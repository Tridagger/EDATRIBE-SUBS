00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,208
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,333
Goku was having
an energy crisis,

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
but fortunately
the good Majin Buu

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,875
was able to
take up the fight

5
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,125
when the mighty Super
Saiyan lost his shine.

6
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,000
But the kind Buu
wouldn't last long!

7
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,291
Something had to
be done, and fast!

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,125
Hey! I know you've got a plan.

9
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,833
[VEGETA]
Yes. And?

10
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,708
Well, I hate to pry, but
um, what is it, exactly?

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:46,000
Kakarot, how many times have you
saved the world up until now?

12
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,583
Hmm. What?
How many? I'm not sure.

13
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
[VEGETA]
Then perhaps it's time

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,166
to let the world
fend for itself, for once.

15
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,791
Now, listen carefully, Dende!
This is very important.

16
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] And so Vegeta's
plan was put into action!

17
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,541
And Moori summoned the
Dragon on the new Planet Namek.

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,250
[PORUNGA]
Name your first wish.

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,750
[NARRATOR]
With the first wish,

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,375
the planet Earth was brought
back to its original state.

21
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,375
[NARRATOR]
And with the second,

22
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,958
all of its inhabitants
were restored to life.

23
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,583
But staying alive
was the problem.

24
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,875
What did Vegeta have in mind?

25
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
[VEGETA] Let's do it.
Now! It's time!

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
It's time? Time for what?

27
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,791
The Spirit Bomb!

28
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,875
That's your big idea?
A spirit bomb?!

29
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,208
[chatter. laughing]

30
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,333
Is it really you, baby doll?

31
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,250
Of course it's me!

32
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,416
Whoa, dude!
This is totally cosmic!

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,291
[BOTH laughing]

34
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,333
Yep. Same old world.

35
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,083
[BABY giggling]

36
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,083
What in the world is going on?

37
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,833
It's all back, as if
nothing ever happened!

38
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,041
Yeah! This is really bizarre!

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,250
Hey! How come Majin Buu
isn't here, guys? Hmm?

40
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,583
Neither is Mr. Satan.

41
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,125
Aah! Don't tell me
he beat him!

42
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,208
Wow! Wouldn't that
be something!

43
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,958
[CHICHI, BULMA lauging]

44
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,208
[BULMA] And just where were you
two in the next world, huh?

45
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,791
Well, Krillin and I got to do

46
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,583
a little bit of
training with King Kai.

47
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh, I guess we
had it all wrong then!

48
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,250
We just assumed that you
went down to you know where!

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,416
Gee! Thanks a lot!

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,000
[BULMA, CHICHI laughing]

51
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,000
[MARON]
Daddy!

52
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,000
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

53
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey! Whatcha doin'
there, squirt?

54
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,791
[MARON]
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,250
I missed you so much!

56
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,125
Yeah! What a journey!

57
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,666
Being dead wasn't
so bad, now was it?

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,125
Huh?

59
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,041
[chuckles lightly]

60
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,166
Dear Videl, Chichi, Bulma.
I'm so glad you made it home.

61
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,416
Oh, how I wish I
could have joined you,

62
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,333
but not this time.

63
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,291
For too long, love has been
a stranger in my cold heart.

64
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,250
Maybe next time, dear ones.
Maybe next time.

65
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,375
A Spirit Bomb?!

66
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
But that didn't
work against Frieza,

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,291
what makes you
think it'll work now?

68
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,791
It will.

69
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,916
So, that's what you meant
about the world saving itself?

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,583
You want the people of Earth to
supply the energy to beat Buu.

71
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,208
Uh.

72
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,708
[KID BUU grunting]

73
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,458
Come on! Get him, Buu!

74
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,458
Give him a wham!
An a pow! An a wap!

--[BUU whimpers]
--[KID BUU grunting]

76
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,291
Punch him back, Buu!
Awe, don't let him do that!

77
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,916
You're bigger than he is!

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,791
Pretty please, Buu!

You be candy!

00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,416
Hmmm?

[BUU yelps]

90
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,041
Buu! Buu!

91
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,333
Keep your guard up!

92
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,000
[VEGETA]
Now. It's time.

93
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,375
You know what to do, Kakarot?

94
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,291
Yeah but... do you really
think the people of Earth

95
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,666
have that much energy?

96
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,833
[VEGETA grunts]

97
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,250
Uh! I'm not doubting your plan,

98
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,708
it's just that
Buu's so darn powerful!

99
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,041
It'll be enough!

100
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,000
I've learned not to
underestimate the power

101
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,166
of the human race.

102
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,416
We won't just take a little bit.

103
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,166
We'll take as much as
they can possibly give.

104
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,166
The maximum, huh?

105
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,125
[PORUNGA] What is your
third and final wish?

106
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,041
[DENDE] Uhh! Please,
just one moment!

107
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,333
Vegeta!

108
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,958
[VEGETA]
What?

109
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,583
Uh, Porunga wants to know
what your third wish is!

110
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,708
How 'bout some new boots.
Size nine, please.

111
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,083
New boots! He's not
serious, is he?

112
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,666
Uhh...

113
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
Uuhhh...!

114
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,333
Of course not!

115
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,291
[VEGETA] Idiot!
Is Kibito Shin there?

116
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,958
Yes! Here!

117
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,708
I need to speak to the
inhabitants of the Earth!

118
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,791
All of them at one time!

119
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,666
Huh? Uh, are you
saying that you want

120
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,041
to speak telepathically
to the entire planet?

121
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,875
[VEGETA]
Exactly!

122
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,166
It can't be done!

123
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,291
Eeehhh!

124
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,666
Uh, Vegeta, we don't know how.

125
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,333
Great, now what?

126
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,250
[KING KAI] Hey, fellas!
I can arrange that!

127
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,291
[chuckles, snorts]

128
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,291
What?

129
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,250
Oh, hey! It's King Kai!

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
Can you really do it?

131
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,166
Of course, I can.
It's a cinch.

132
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,541
Planetary telepathic
communication is my specialty.

133
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,750
[chuckles]

134
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,958
Okay, Vegeta.
You've got the floor.

135
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,375
Whenever you feel
the urge, just go for it.

136
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,208
That's more like it!

137
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:34,333
People of the Earth!
Listen carefully!

138
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,791
[VEGETA]
As you know,

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,208
some very strange events have
been taking place recently.

140
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,375
Your entire planet was destroyed
at the hands of Majin Buu.

141
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,416
But then, in a snap,

142
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,250
everything was
restored back to normal.

143
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,166
Many of you are doubting if
all of this actually happened,

144
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,916
but I can assure you
that this is not a dream.

145
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,958
Not a dream?

146
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,083
Wait!

147
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,375
Hey! What's this
guy talking about?

148
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,583
Shh!

149
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,208
Oh, uh... Uh, right!

150
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,916
He's speaking to
the people of Earth.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,541
Hm?

152
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,000
Uhhh, that's not possible!

153
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,041
Uh, you guys.

154
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,291
Instead of pretending

155
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,791
to talk to the people
of the Earth and all,

156
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,000
why don't you go over
there and please help Buu!

157
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,833
We are trying to help.

158
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,666
Trust me.
This is the best way.

159
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,708
Unfortunately,
Majin Buu is still alive

160
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,166
and the Earth is
still in great danger.

161
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,583
A small group of warriors
have taken up the fight

162
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,583
on your behalf.

163
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,708
Hey! It really is him!
That's Vegeta's voice!

164
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,833
Shh!

165
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,041
[VEGETA] However,
the battle has been

166
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,625
extremely difficult,

167
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,208
and we can't
win it by ourselves.

168
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,958
[sighs]
Vegeta!

169
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,833
[VEGETA] That is why I am
speaking to you right now.

170
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,416
To ask you for your help.

171
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,000
If all of you would raise
your hands up to the sky,

172
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,208
and offer a portion
of your energy,

173
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,916
we could use it to defeat
Majin Buu once and for all!

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,833
No more being slaughtered
like sacrificial lambs!

175
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,041
Consider this your
first small stride

176
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,500
towards becoming
a warrior race!

177
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,916
Now, let's begin!
Raise your hands up! Now!

He ah, certainly has a way
with words! A bit dramatic.

179
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,291
They're ready, Kakarot.
Take your place.

180
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,250
Right!

181
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,500
You're really on top
of things! I'm impressed!

182
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,458
All right! If there was ever
a time, guys! This is it!

183
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,333
It's time! My dad's ready!

184
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,291
This is really fun!

185
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,750
Yeah!

186
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,583
Hmm! Who would have thought!

187
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,791
Vegeta comes
through in the clutch.

188

Whoa, yeah! Here it is!

189
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,000

Ahh! Wow!

191
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,625
At this rate, this thing's
going to be enormous!

192
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,458
This is just
from Gohan's group.

193
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,416
Yeah! What an incredible start!

194
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,458
When everyone
else kicks theirs in,

195
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,166
I think we'll
have energy to spare.

196

[VEGETA thinking]
Yes! Yes! That's it!

197

coming! We need more!

198

Give it everything you've got!

Don't stop now! It's working!

200

All of you!
Raise your hands up!

201
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,375
Okay, yeah! I get it!

202
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,500
Here!

203
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,291

215

They're doing it!

216

[DENDE] Look how big
it is! Wow, it's huge!

217
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,833
That should be
enough to destroy Buu!

218
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,125
Not quite! But at this rate
it won't take much longer!

219
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,250
It looks like they're
actually going to pull it off!

221

[KING KAI] Wait!
Something's wrong!

222
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,333
[KING KAI] If Goku's gathering
energy from everyone on Earth,

223
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,333
the Spirit Bomb should
be much larger by now!

224
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,375
Something's not right!

225
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,875
Give it some time!

226
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,291
I'm sure it's going
to get bigger and bigger!

227
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,208

absolutely positively sure

that all the Earthlings
were brought back to life?

over how to break down

00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:48,041
that is holding back the vast
reservoir of human energy.

357
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,291
Can he get through in time?

358
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:55,375
