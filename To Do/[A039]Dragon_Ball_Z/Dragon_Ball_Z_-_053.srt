1
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:43,166
Last time, on
Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:51,208
Meanwhile, Yamcha,
Chiaotzu, and Tien

3
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:59,500
But Piccolo had no patience
for such foolish games.

4
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,208
Hang on tight, kid!

5
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:11,250
Now, Krillin and Dende race
to find the Eldest Namek,

6
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:16,750
Now, Krillin and Dende race
to find the Eldest Namek,

7
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:22,208
Your fighting skills
have come a long way

8
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:32,291
Will Vegeta's overconfidence
be his undoing?

9
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:42,291
Will Vegeta's overconfidence
be his undoing?

10
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:52,291
Will Vegeta's overconfidence
be his undoing?

11
00:03:52,375 --> 00:04:01,000
Will Vegeta's overconfidence
be his undoing?

12
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:11,375
So I'm not strong enough
to beat you? Funny.

13
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,958
That's right... You figured
it out... I knew you would.

14
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:21,458
You crack me up!

15
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:29,583
Go ahead.
Laugh if you want.

16
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:37,083
It's time I showed
you my true power.

17
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:45,000
You ever hear the saying,
beauty is only skin deep?

18
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:55,000
Is that so? Well, you'll
pardon me if I hadn't noticed.

19
00:04:55,083 --> 00:05:05,041
Now you're being much
too hasty, Vegeta...

20
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:16,666
Now you're being much
too hasty, Vegeta...

21
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,791
Let's see it!

22
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,833
All right, then... So be it.
but consider yourself warned.

23
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:36,583
What the-

24
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:46,625
As I said, you only saw the
'beauty' side of me before.

25
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:56,625
As I said, you only saw the
'beauty' side of me before.

26
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:05,916
As I said, you only saw the
'beauty' side of me before.

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,375
Hey, Dende.

28
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,333
It's not far now...

29
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:19,583
Good. We gotta hurry.

30
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:25,416
Y'know, there's something I've
been meaning to ask you...

31
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,458
But it's still so bright. I
mean, doesn't your sun set?

32
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,666
Not all at once.

33
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:45,375
We have three
different suns.

34
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,041
So, you're saying that on your
planet, you never have night?

35
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,083
No, we don't.

36
00:06:51,166 --> 00:07:01,166
No wonder you're green...

37
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:11,166
No wonder you're green...

38
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:21,166
No wonder you're green...

39
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:31,166
No wonder you're green...

40
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:41,208
No wonder you're green...

41
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:51,208
No wonder you're green...

42
00:07:51,291 --> 00:08:01,208
No wonder you're green...

43
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:11,208
No wonder you're green...

44
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:21,250
No wonder you're green...

45
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:31,250
No wonder you're green...

46
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:37,625
No wonder you're green...

47
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:50,833
Guess this means it's
time to take a break...

48
00:08:50,916 --> 00:09:00,208
All right, I've almost
got the hang of this

49
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:11,625
If I can keep going
at this rate,

50
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:18,583
I wonder how Yamcha,
Tien, and Piccolo

51
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:31,791
I hope it's
going okay...

52
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:44,041
Goku... Listen to me!

53
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:49,750
All you'd do
is provoke him!

54
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,500
But what about
the Dragon Balls?

55
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,250
No! You have
to promise me!

56
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,083
Come on...

57
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:03,291
Absolutely
nooooot!

58
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:13,333
That's it! I have
to train harder!

59
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:23,333
That's it! I have
to train harder!

60
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:34,666
That's it! I have
to train harder!

61
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:44,708
Come here!

62
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:57,000
Come here!

63
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh no you don't!

64
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:17,083
Oh no you don't!

65
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:29,541
Oh no you don't!

66
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,708
Monkey!

67
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:40,833
Get 'im!

68
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:50,916
Huh, well whadda'
you know!

69
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,833
Huh, well whadda'
you know!

70
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:08,875
No! I won't lose!

71
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:18,875
No! I won't lose!

72
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:28,875
No! I won't lose!

73
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:38,916
No! I won't lose!

74
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,916
No! I won't lose!

75
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,791
No! I won't lose!

76
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:08,833
And you wouldn't believe me
when I said you couldn't win!

77
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:18,791
And you wouldn't believe me
when I said you couldn't win!

78
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:28,833
Oh, man... Even from
this far away...

79
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:38,833
Oh, man... Even from
this far away...

80
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:45,166
Oh, man... Even from
this far away...

81
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:55,250
Enough of this, I'm
through toying with you.

82
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:04,708
Enough of this, I'm
through toying with you.

83
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:14,750
No... I won't be defeated
like this... I can't!

84
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:24,750
No... I won't be defeated
like this... I can't!

85
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:31,916
No... I won't be defeated
like this... I can't!

86
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's 'lights out'
for you, Vegeta!

87
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:53,416
It's 'lights out'
for you, Vegeta!

88
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:03,458
There...
Sweet dreams, prince.

89
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:11,000
There...
Sweet dreams, prince.

90
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:21,083
Ah, how perfect...

91
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:33,333
Ah, how perfect...

92
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:43,375
Oh well.. It serves him
right for making me go

93
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:53,375
Oh well.. It serves him
right for making me go

94
00:15:53,458 --> 00:16:03,416
Oh well.. It serves him
right for making me go

95
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,166
Oh well.. It serves him
right for making me go

96
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:17,875
Oh, how did I ever
get into this mess?

97
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,958
How can you be so calm
at a time like this?

98
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:26,291
It's easy, Bulma...

99
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:36,833
Well, I really hope
he gets here soon...

100
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:49,833
I just hope Krillin and
Dende are still doing okay...

101
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:57,833
The power
levels dropped...

102
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,625
So then, who do
you think won?

103
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:11,666
I don't know...

104
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:21,666
I don't know...

105
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:31,708
I don't know...

106
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:46,125
I don't know...

107
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Which way? Should I just keep
flying straight, or what?

108
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:59,166
Actually, I think it's
a little bit to the left.

109
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:05,875
Actually, I think it's
a little bit to the left.

110
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,958
Look, there! It's just up
ahead, on top of that bluff!

111
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:22,875
Yeah, I see it...

112
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:32,875
Looks like
we made it...

113
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,875
Come on, Krillin. We'll find
the Eldest Namek inside.

114
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:46,958
Are you sure?

115
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:56,958
Are you sure?

116
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:06,250
Are you sure?

117
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,333
It's so quiet. Maybe
they got him already...

118
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:19,375
oh no...

119
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:33,666
oh no...

120
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,375
Hey, Nail! Am I ever glad
to see you're all right!

121
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:42,041
This guy looks
just like Piccolo!

122
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:49,500
It's good to see
you again, Dende...

123
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,375
So, then Guru knows
about everything

124
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,416
Well, that's some
good news, at least...

125
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,458
There is much to
discuss. Come with me.

126
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:10,250
Wait, Nail... If Guru already
knows what's happening...

127
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:17,541
Guru is very old. He knows
his time is drawing near.

128
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:23,250
There is little more
I can do for him

129
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:28,291
Oh no... I knew
he was old...

130
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,583
Please.
Come, Dende.

131
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:41,541
This guy's
different

132
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:51,625
Up.

133
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:59,166
Up.

134
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,833
Master, I've brought Dende
and his Earth friend.

135
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,875
Whoa... He's huge!

136
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:17,375
Welcome, friend...
It is my great honor

137
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:27,416
Oh, well, uh, there's no
need to thank me. Really!

138
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:37,458
Oh, well, uh, there's no
need to thank me. Really!

139
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:47,458
Oh, well, uh, there's no
need to thank me. Really!

140
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:57,458
Oh, well, uh, there's no
need to thank me. Really!

141
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:08,333
Oh, well, uh, there's no
need to thank me. Really!

142
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:18,416
Zarbon, you've made
your last mistake...

143
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:30,375
Zarbon, you've made
your last mistake...

144
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:40,416
Vegeta has survived!

145
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:48,375
Vegeta has survived!
