00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,625
things were looking up!

3
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,000
With Piccolo
keeping Frieza busy,

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,708
Goku was able to complete
his ultimate weapon,

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,333
the Spirit Bomb!

6
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,666
Drawing energy from
all living things,

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,208
it was an attack not
even Frieza could ignore!

8
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,583
[FRIEZA] No, that's...

9
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,500
impossible!

10
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,875
[NARRATOR] The awesome power of
the Spirit Bomb seemed too much

11
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,208
for him to handle as he
struggled to hold it back.

12
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,541
[NARRATOR] It was a tense
moment indeed on Planet Namek,

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,875
as the hopes of our heroes
were riding on this one attack.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,625
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
finally conquered

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,666
the vicious tyrant of space?

16
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,958
[NARRATOR] Will the
universe once again be safe

17
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,041
from Frieza's greedy claws?

18
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned
to find out today.

19
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,916
You-You think that's
the end of Frieza?

20
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,833
I hope so...

21
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,916
But where's my daddy...?

22
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,000
He was pretty close to
the blast when it went off!

23
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,291
So maybe he...

24
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,583
Maybe he was too close!

25
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,458
Hey, don't worry!

26
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,541
But I can't feel his...

27
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,000
his presence...

28
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,708
That's because you're
not concentrating

29
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,291
hard enough on it, Gohan.

30
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,708
And besides,
he was with Piccolo.

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,166
They're both alright.

32
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,625
Hm?

33
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,166
Look...

34
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,250
What is that...?

35
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,375
Over there!

36
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,833
Huh...?

37
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
It's Piccolo!

38
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,333
[PICCOLO groans]

39
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,375
Goku!

40
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,416
It's my dad! He's alive!

41
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,833
Yeah-ha-ha!

42
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,375
[BOTH laugh]

43
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,125
Well, Gohan, what're
you waiting for?!

44
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,583
[KRILLIN laughs]

45
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,125
[KRILLIN shouting]

46
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,458
Ah, man...

47
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,041
It's hard to fly
because we used up

48
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,208
most our energy
against Frieza!

49
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,000
Piccolo!

50
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,458
Dad!

51
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,000
[GOHAN] Dad! Piccolo!

52
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
Huh...?

53
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,041
[BOTH laughing]

54
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,541
[GOHAN] Dad!

55
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,333
[GOHAN laughs]

56
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,875
Go... han...

57
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,708
Oh, Goku!

58
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,958
Are you... okay?

59
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,416
[GOKU chuckles]

60
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,083
[GOHAN laughs]

61
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,291
Hey, Piccolo...

62
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,208
Yes?

63
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
Aw, nothin'...

64
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,375

[GOHAN laughs]

67
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,208
Hey...

68
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,875
Sorry to make you worry!

69
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,208
Aww...

70
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,375
Goku, your Spirit Bomb
was just awesome!

71
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,333
It was so huge!

72
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,041
That's because it was
filled with the energy

73
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,375
of every living creature
in the solar system.

74
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,708
I gotta admit, I thought that
I'd never see you again!

75
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,250
Surely you must
have had more faith

76
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,416
in your father than that?

77
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I guess now we can all
get back down to Earth!

78
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,458
For a while there, I
didn't think we'd get back!

79
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,791
Huh?

80
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,583
[KRILLIN gasps]

00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,916
[KRILLIN chuckles]

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,541
What I meant was, it's not
that I didn't have faith

83
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,416
in Goku it's just...

84
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,375
I'm homesick...

85
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,125
Huh...?

86
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,583
Huh?

87
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,541

89
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,708
Goku has done it!

90
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,041
He's finally defeated Frieza!

[KING KAI laughs]

92
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,708
Oh, happy day!

93
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,541
Happy day!

94
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,083
Woo-hoo!

95
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
What are you talking
about, you old kook?!

96
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,333
No one could defeat Frieza!

97
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,208
Impossible...

98
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,666
No way!

99
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,625
You sure?

[GINYU FORCE gasps]

101
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,750
If Goku's won,

102
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,791
then so have we!

103
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,791
And that means if
Piccolo's alive,

104
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,708
then we can get
ourselves back to Earth!

105
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
Let's do it!

Now you've done it...

We won!

you've got another

Your training paid
off handsomely!

You even surprised me with
some of your techniques!

the Ginyu Force showing up here

was as much of a
surprise for me, too!

I brought them here

you or anything!

about them, shall we?

himself here, aren't you?

it'll take us just about
five days to get home.

like that, Krillin!

For a second I thought
you saw Frieza again!

In some ways, Bulma
is worse than Frieza.

the way I feel...
