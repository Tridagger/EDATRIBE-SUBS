[birds chirping]

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,625
Gosh Dad, what's the deal?

3
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,666
Man, don't you think
it's been long enough?

4
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,041
Where in the world are you?

5
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,291
[TORTOISE] Oh boy,
here he goes again!

[KRILLIN grunting]

00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:06,333
Ka.. me.. ha.. me...

8
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,208
Ha!

[explosion]

10
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,833
Oooh, yea!

11
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,416
[TORTOISE]
Look out below!

12
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,708
Ah! Tidal wave!

13
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,375
Yikes!

14
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500
[KRILLIN thinking]
Still not good enough!

[ROSHI snoring]

16
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,791
Hmm?

17
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,916
[ROSHI] He's been so serious
since he broke up with Maron!

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,125
No way! That won't cut it! Yeah!
I gotta turn it up a notch!

19
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,000
[ROSHI humming]

20
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,083
You know I bet
I could teach Krillin

21
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,750
a thing or two about
getting along with the ladies!

22
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,333
Getting them mad,
you mean!

23
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,458
[ROSHI yells]

24
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,083
[KRILLIN thinking] I know
you'll be back someday, Goku!

25
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,041
And whatever it is
that you're called to do,

26
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,500
I'll be here to help!

27
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
I'll be ready!

Hey, you! There you are! Good!

32
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,500
Huh? What's up?

33
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
Ahhh!

[crash]

35
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,333
Gohan! You're being silly!

36
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,916
[GOHAN laughing]

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,166
Gohan! We have
a house guest! Say hi!

38
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,291
This is Mister Shu! He is
going to be your new tutor!

39
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,458
But Mom, why?

40
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,958
Mr. Shu is going to help you

41
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,791
take your studies to
the next level, Gohan!

42
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,958
And I was thinking that you
might want to get started today!

43
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,125
Can't I just study harder and
forget about the tutor? Please?

44
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,500
No! N-O No! And that's
the final word, Gohan!

45
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,250
Goodness! Why me?

46
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:20,833
First my husband leaves, then my
son starts rebelling against me!

47
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:25,083
Why me? Why?

48
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Oh, it just isn't fair!
I feel so vulnerable!

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,125
Where did I go wrong?!

50
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
Ahem...

51
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,625
Gohan! It's time you
two got started!

52
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,250
There you go Mr. Shu,
he's all yours now!

53
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,250
Very well! I'll do what I can!
Madame, I'm very strict!

54
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,875
Oftentimes, slow
children like this

55
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,291
just need a little discipline!

56
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,083
My Gohan is not slow,
Mister Shu!

57
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,833
Of course not! Every parent
thinks their child is a prodigy!

58
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,666
I'm sure he's brilliant,
that's why you hired a tutor...

59
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,625
Now, please excuse us!
We have work to do!

60
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,125
Cat loves food!
Yea, yea, yea, yeah!

61
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,208
You goof! You're such a nut!
Where did you come up with that?

62
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
That was from an old
cat food commercial!

63
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Puar hates it when I do that!

64
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:24,500
I ate catfood once! Oh man!
I thought it was tuna fish!

65
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,291
I had a weird dream last
night that Vegeta came back!

66
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,958
What?! Vegeta?!
You dreamt about him?!

67
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,208
You know, actually he was
pretty nice to me in the dream,

68
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
and a good
kisser to boot!

69
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,250
What? You kissed him?

70
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,083
It was just a dream, Yamcha!

71
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,666
You poor sap! You're jealous,
aren't you?! Admit it!

72
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,458
Right!

73
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,333
Speaking of Vegeta your Dad said
he should be running out of fuel
soon!

74
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:59,666
Hm?! Vegeta's running out of
fuel!

75
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,125
Man! Aw...

76
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Please do not talk slang
when you're in my presence!

77
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,500
And I can see two
mistakes on here already!

78
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:12,916
Mistakes are to learn from!

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,250
And smarting off
to your instructor

80
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
is a mistake I'll teach you
not to make again!

81
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, that might be the toughest
lesson you've ever learned!

82
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:38,125
It hurt me to do it, but I'm
sure your mother will appreciate
the end result!

83
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,125
Gosh, this is so exciting!

84
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,166
Gohan's finally going to
get the attention he deserves!

85
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,958
Ivy-league, here we come!

86
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,958
How dare you, you insolent brat!

87
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:55,375
This is what you get when
you back talk to Mister Shu!

88
00:07:55,458 --> 00:08:00,250
[whipping continues]

89
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,166
[MR. SHU] I've dealt
with your kind before!

90
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,541
Oh, yes! Little rebel punks!
Abandoned by their fathers!

91
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,291
But they all come
around, eventually!

[GOHAN yawns]

96
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,583
Hey! What's up?!

97
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,291
Oh! Shhh!

98
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,750
Let's go, quick! Man,
you're a life saver, Icarus!

99
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
Hey! Wait for me!

100
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,750
[GOHAN giggling]

101
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Icarus, where are you?!

[GOHAN whimpering]

104
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,333
Hm? Hey! Hi, Gohan!

105
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,458
Dad, is it really you?!

106
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,791
[GOKU chuckles]
Of course it is!

107
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,375
Now don't I get
a hug, tough guy?

108
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,250
Dad!

109
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,833
Daddy, it's really you!

110
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,291
Daddy!

111
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,083
Daddy, it's you! I can't
believe it! It's you! It's you!

112
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
It's okay, Gohan!
It's okay!

113
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,125
Huh?! Oh my goodness!

114
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,708
Hey, hon! Sorry, I'm late!

115
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,416
I guess I shouldn't have 
taken that left turn at Mars!

116
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,125
No problem!
What's a year and a half?!

117
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,125
Something smells good!
Wow! I hope that's our dinner!

118
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,208
Huh? It is!

119
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,541
But you're not
going to get any

120
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,416
if you go through the window,
Goku. You know better!

121
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,666
C'mon! Give me a break!
I just got home!

122
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
[CHICHI growls]

123
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,125
He's back!
I can't believe it!

124
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,458
[GOHAN] So what happened
up there on Namek, Dad?

125
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,541
What happened to Frieza?

126
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,125
[GOKU] Well, it's
a long story, Gohan!

127
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,625
And I doubt Mom wants to
hear it right before dinner!

128
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
Ok!

129
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,958
So where have
you been all this time, Dad?

130
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:48,000
Aw, come on, Daddy! You can
tell me that much, can't you?!

131
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,916

[GOKU growls]

133
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:02,125
Your Dad isn't coming back!

134
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,083
He's a loser!
He's nothing but a loser!

135
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,958
No no no!

136
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,750
[MR. SHU] Ahhh!
Let go! Please kid!

137
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,250
Let go!
You're killing me! Ah-ah!

138
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,666
I beg of you!
Please let go of me!

139
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,541
My gosh! What are you?!
You... you mad man!

140
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,541
You almost broke my arm!

141
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,750
How dare you attack
me like that!

142
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,166
I was dreaming!

143
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,583
Well it's about time
you came to your senses!

144
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,750
That's your father's
influence, I'll bet!

145
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,875
Martial Arts...
I've heard the talk, yes.

146
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,833
He's a brainless brute!

147
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,541
[GOHAN growls]

148
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,791
How dare you! You punk!

149
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,958
Are you challenging me?!
Well, take this!

150
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,708
Unhand me you barbarian!

151
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:55,625
For your information, Mister
Shu, my father is not a brute!

152
00:11:55,708 --> 00:12:00,208
He's a great man!
Is that clear?!

153
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,916
You wouldn't!

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,375
Defend my Dad's honor?
You better believe I will!

155
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,625
Let's talk about this! With
your Mother here of course!

156
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,750
Hello! Miss ChiChi!

157
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,333
Alright! Put 'em up!

158
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,375
Gohan? What are you doing?!

159
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,625
Me? Nothin'

160
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,750
[MR. SHU] Yes, although he can
appear to be quite normal...

161
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:39,375
You're son is afflicted with
what I call the demon-seed!

162
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,916
[GOHAN growls]

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,583
Yes, it is a seed of rebellion
and contempt for his superiors!

164
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,041
You can let this seed grow,
or nip it in the bud!

165
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,708
Gohan!

166
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,166
Ah, yes! He's driven
to fight like his Father!

167
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,375
What? That's not true!

168
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,583
Oh! My foot it's not!

169
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,500
My Dad's a saint
compared to you!

170
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,125
What? How dare you!

171
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,500
[GOHAN growls]

172
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,750
Ah, that's better! A little
discipline works miracles!

173
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,750
You just need a father!

174
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,000
Look! Mister!
I have a Father!

175
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:21,500
You do! Where is he! Oh he's
gone off fighting somewhere!

176
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,666
Right! Right!
Am I right!

177
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,333
Of course I'm right!

178
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,208
It's only natural
that the child

179
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,208
should want to follow in
his father's violent footsteps

180
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,500
After being abandoned
by the worthless father,

181
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,625
he fights to measure up!

182
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,666
A vicious cycle!
Like father, like son!

183
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:49,125
[MR. SHU laughs]

184
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:49,833
[CHICHI growls]

185
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,250
Get out of our house!

186
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,333
[MR. SHU yells]

187
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,833
Wow! Nice throw!

188
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,916
Thank you.

189
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,708
You'll pay for this! Nobody
throws Mister Shu! How dare you!

190
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,750
[CHICHI]
Get out of here!

191
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,958
And don't come back!

192
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,750
Oh! I didn't know we had
any guests dropping by!

193
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,958
Goodness! I definitely need
to put on another pot of tea!

194
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:45,291
Vegeta! What do you want?

195
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,875
Oh my! Maybe you'd
prefer some coffee?

196
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,500
I was hoping that Kakarot
might have finally returned?

197
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,875
Hm? What? No way! You
never found him in space?

198
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,208
Don't remind me!

199
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,291
I'm angry enough
to hurt somebody!

200
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,500
And, pounding you might
just be the therapy I need!

201
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,291
Hey, guys!
What's that awful smell!

202
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,875
Oh, it's you!

203
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,875
When's the last time
you bathed there, bud?

204
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,041
You need a bath!

205
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,000
Please! This way!

206
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,333
Well? What? Do you want me
to roll out the red carpet?

207
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,083
[VEGETA growls]

208
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,291
[YAMCHA]
Unreal!

209
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,333
I hope she knows
what she's doing!

210
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,375
Hey! Does anyone take lemon?

211
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,333
[VEGETA muttering]

212
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,875
Hey, you! I left you
some fresh clothes!

213
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,958
[BULMA] Hello?!
You alive in there?!

214
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:07,791
I heard you!
You can leave now!

215
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:12,583
Why yes, master!
Your wish is my command!

216
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,958
The female species!
Such an enigma!

217
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,791
Yeah that Vegeta is
nothing but trouble!

218
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,541
He's so unpredictable, it's hard
to tell what his motives are!

219
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,833
I think he just
wants to find Goku!

220
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,750
Poor guy!
He's obsessed!

221
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,458
He's used to getting
what he wants!

222
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,541
That's all! He's like
a spoiled little kid!

223
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,416
Man, sounds like you!

224
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,750
[VEGETA] Hello! Servant woman!
Bring me a drying cloth at once!

225
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,416
[BULMA growls]

226
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,083
[VEGETA] Woman!
Can you hear me?

227
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,000
I hear you!
But my name is Bulma!

228
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:54,416
And I am not your servant!
So say please!

229
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,083
[VEGETA] Forget about
the stupid drying cloth then!

230
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,833
Suit yourself!
Drip dry, you jerk!

231
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,458
[VEGETA] What in the--?! Is
this some kind of joke?!

232
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,416
Is what a joke?

233
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,083
These garments that you left!

234
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,791
Are they for
a man or a woman?

235
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,000
They're pink!

236
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,791
[BULMA] C'mon!
It's the style here!

237
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,833
Men in pink!
How bizarre!

238
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:25,041
[EVERYONE laughing]

239
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,083
[VEGETA] This is ridiculous!
I'm a warrior!

240
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:35,416
Not a variety of flower!

241
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,291
Well you smell good!

242
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,500
[EVERYONE laughing]

243
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:47,083
Stop that! Stop it
or I'll blast you all!

244
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,666
Loosen up!
Fighting's no fun! Just relax!

245
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,875
[VEGETA growls]

246
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,875
If you want to find Goku,
just stay here! He'll come!

247
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,041
I've known Goku since
he was five years old!

248
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:06,083
Trust me! He'll be back!

249
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,958
I just know he will!

250
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,500
[OX-KING laughing]

251
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,166
ChiChi, darling, you threw
him right out of the window?

252
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,791
Poor guy! Oh, man! Should've
known! Like husband, like wife!

253
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,333
[OX-KING laughing]

254
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:43,250
Sshh! Gohan's studying, Daddy!

255
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,166
Oops! Sorry.

256
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,458
And then you chased him off
the property! Oh, dear!

257
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,625
[OX-KING laughing]

258
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,666
[CHICHI] Daddy, please!
Control yourself!

259
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,583
It can't be!

260
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,458
[phone ringing]
ring, ring, ring

261
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,458
Do you feel that?!
Holy cow!

262
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:30,458
[GOHAN] I know! I feel
it too! This isn't good!

263
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,500
But who is it? It can't
be you know who, could it?!

264
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,708
[KRILLIN] I'm afraid so!
We have to be strong, Gohan!

265
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,375
Right.

266
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:49,500
[KRILLIN] Man! I knew it
was too good to be true!

267
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,666
Suit up, we've got
some planning to do, bro...

268
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,666
Right! Will do!

269
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,708
Dad, where are you?

270
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:06,583
[BUBBLES in distress]
Oooh, eeee, oooo, ahh, ahh...!

271
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:13,625
Yes, yes, I know, Bubbles,
yes! I can feel it too!

272
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,291
There's two of them, Chiaotzu!

273
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,791
My gosh! I've never
felt anything like it!

274
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,125
Tien, I'm scared!

275
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,416
Oh, man, Bulma!
This is great!

276
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,333
I'm piggin' out here!

277
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:36,375
So he failed after all! Frieza's
still alive, and he's coming!

278
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:40,500
Wait! How do you know?! Maybe it
could be somebody else! Come on!

279
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:45,541
I know! I make it my
business to know! Unlike you!

280
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,583
What's that supposed to mean?!

281
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,833
Hey, Vegeta!

282
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,500
Would you like a little
more barbecue sauce

283
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,416
on your spare ribs?!

284
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,250
Sure, why not.

285
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,250
Well, my money's on you guys!

286
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,416
We can leave if you
want to fight 'em here!

287
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,791
[PICCOLO growling]

288
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,500
Frieza, there's no way!

289
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,958
[FRIEZA] There it is,
Planet Earth dead ahead!

290
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,000
It's only fitting
that the Saiyan

291
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,041
should call such
a puny planet home!

292
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,125
[KING COLD] Let's finish
this now, son.

293
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,500
We can destroy
the planet from here!

294
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,916
[FRIEZA] Father, that
would spoil all of my fun!

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,708
I plan to savor my revenge.

296
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,541
Every... little... bit...

297
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:54,583
Well, well, look!
A ship on radar!

298
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,125
It seems your Saiyan
friend is almost home!

299
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:58,833
[FRIEZA laughs]

300
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,416
And when he gets there,

301
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,000
he will find everything he has
ever known or loved in ruins!

302
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,208
Yes...

303
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,083
He will know the
wrath of Frieza!

304
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:19,916
Oh, man! What a week! First it's
the terror tutor, and now this!

305
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,541
C'mon you!

306
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:29,833
Oh, no, Dad!
There he goes again!

307
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,958
I need to learn how to fly!
Just look at him!

308
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:36,458
How can I discipline a kid
who can take-off like that?!

309
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,000
[NARRATOR]
Unfortunately this time Gohan,

310
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:43,041
it's a game of life or death.
Frieza has survived!

311
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,583
And it looks like double trouble

312
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,250
because his father
King Cold is with him!

313
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,041
On the next exciting episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
