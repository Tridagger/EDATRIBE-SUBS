00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,000
ready to do their
part to stop Majin Buu,

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,666
Trunks and Goten charged up
their Super Saiyan powers

4
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,458
for their first lesson
in the fusion technique.

5
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,291
[GOKU] Good, now raise
it to your maximums.

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,791
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, the wizard
Babidi managed to uncover

7
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,458
some valuable information,

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,291
and paused his
spree of destruction

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,875
just long enough to make a
very important announcement.

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,000
[BABIDI using ESP] Attention,
Earthlings! Attention!

11
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,958
So sorry to
bother you once again.

12
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,041
Trunks, I am
very eager to meet you.

13
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,208
And I suppose that if I
can't get you to come to me,

14
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,541
then I'll just have
to come to where you live.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,666
[BABIDI laughs]

16
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,666
[BABIDI] It's a place
called Capsule Corporation

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,291
and it's located in West City.

18
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,625
I hope that you're there
to greet me when I arrive,

19
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,125
because if you're not,

20
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,416
then your family and friends
will have to pay the price.

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,833
Goku, if we let Majin Buu get
to West City and destroy it

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,208
then he'll destroy
the Dragon Radar!

23
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,000
[NARRATOR]
In light of this new crisis,

24
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,875
Goku sent Trunks on a mission
to find the Dragon Radar.

25
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,500
Meanwhile, he would
try to slow down

26
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,916
Babidi and Buu by himself!

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,625
[GOKU] Yeah, but you let me
worry about them.

28
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,083
I'll be all right.

29
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,291
Hi.

30
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,166
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu was more
than pleased by Goku's arrival,

31
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,000
eager to face a new and
interesting challenge.

32
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,000
And that's exactly what Goku
was prepared to give him!

33
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,625
[NARRATOR] Unless Goku can
buy Trunks enough time

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,208
to retrieve the Dragon Radar,

35
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,416
all hope of repairing
Majin Buu's damage

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
to the Earth will be lost!

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,750
But in order to keep this
bizarre monster occupied,

38
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,000
Goku may need to use to some
unconventional tactics!

39
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,291
[GOKU]
I'm guessing an ascended Saiyan

40
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,125
isn't much of a
challenge for you.

41
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,833
So how about I take
it up to the next level?

42
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,000
As interested as I am
to see this trick of yours,

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,166
time is short.

44
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,333
The good people of
West City are expecting us.

45
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,833
Maybe next time.

46
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,333
Majin Buu! Hurry up and
do something nasty to him.

47
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,500
We have an appointment to keep.

48
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,708
[BUU]
Whoa-ho-ho, yeah!

49
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,833
Whoo, whoo-whoo! Whee! Whoo!

50
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,208
[laughs]

51
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
[thinking]
From the way he acts,

52
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,625
you'd never guess he could
really be that strong.

53
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,791
Then again, Vegeta probably
thought the same thing.

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
[thinking]
I'll have to be careful.

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,333
I only have to
distract him long enough

56
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,541
for Trunks to
find the Dragon Radar.

57
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,250
Don't worry.

58
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,916
It won't be long. I'm sure
Trunks has made it home by now.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,291
No, no he hasn't.

60
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,166
[thinking] What?! Why is
Trunks just sitting still?

61
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,833
We don't have time for him to
stop and check out the scenery!

62
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,416
He better hurry.

63
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,833
I don't want to go beyond the
second level if I don't have to.

64
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,250
I don't know, that power
I'm sensing... it's so huge.

65
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,708
What if it's
really that monster?

66
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,291
Goten's dad will need my help!

67
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,875
Oh, what am
I s'posed to do?!

68
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,000
I wish he'd give
me a sign or something!

69
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:12,833
[GOKU growls]

70
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,208
What are you doing?!

71
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,291
[grunts]

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,416
Stop goofing off
and get the radar!

73
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,875
Ahh, yeah!

74
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,250
What? "Radar"?

75
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,375
Did I just miss something here?

76
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,916
Who in the world
are you talking to?

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,166
And what's this
"radar" nonsense?

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,875
Don't worry,
it's not your problem.

79
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,375
I guess that settled that,

80
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,291
Goten's dad has
it under control.

81
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
But still, he didn't
have to yell at me.

82
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,916
I was only tryin' to help.

83
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,500
[BABIDI giggles]

84
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,000
Perhaps you're so terrified that
you've begun to hallucinate,

85
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,125
is that it?

86
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,666
Perhaps.

87
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,958
[thinking] I still need to
buy some more time.

88
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,708
Guess I'm gonna have to give
these guys a demonstration.

89
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,000
Why you go down? You no play?

90
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,375
[GOKU]
We'll get to that.

91
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,041
First, I thought
I'd take a minute

92
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,291
to teach you a thing
or two about Super Saiyans

93
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,625
starting with the basics.

94
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,208
Super Saiya-jin?

95
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,791
Don't bother with it, I never
asked you to explain anything.

96
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,125
You're going
to love this, trust me.

97
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,875
What you're seeing
now is my normal state.

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,958
This is a Super Saiyan.

99
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:41,250
And this... this is what
is known as a Super Saiyan

100
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,250
that has ascended
past a Super Saiyan.

101
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,708
Or, you could just
call this a Super Saiyan 2.

102
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,708
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

103
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,750
Ho-hum. What a
useless transformation.

104
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,541
You've changed
your hair, so what?

105
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,041
[GOKU chuckles]

106
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,500
Just wait.

107
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,750
Has he really found a way to
surpass an ascended Saiyan?

108
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,291
Is that possible?

109
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,958
He must be bluffing,

110
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,416
I mean, what would that
make him, double ascended?

111
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,833
And this...

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
What's he doing?

113
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:24,166
...is to go even further beyond!

114
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:34,791

117
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,458
No, stop it, Goku!

118
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,000
If you do this now,

119
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,583
it's going to drain away all
the time you have left on Earth!

120
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,208
And I'd say you need every
second of it as it is!

121

00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:26,208
It's... unreal. How is he
generating that much power?!

126
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,166
Do it, Dad!

127
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,208
It's... too much!

What's going on?

130
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,958
Goten's dad is putting out
even more energy than before!

131
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,583
I should go. I don't want
to get yelled at again!

It feels like the
whole world is shaking apart.

144
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,291
What is Goku doing?

145
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,875
If he doesn't stop this

146
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,375
everything is
going to be destroyed!

I'm sorry that took so
much longer than the others.

158
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,750
But I haven't had much
occasion to practice this one.

159
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,875
This is what I
call a "Super Saiyan 3."

Ooooh!

162

There's a Super Saiyan 3 now?

163
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,458
Do you feel that energy?

164
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,916
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that was my dad!

165

But that's... crazy.

166
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,500
It IS Goku!

167

I have no idea how,
but it's definitely your father.

I'm certain.

169
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,166
That... That can't be Goku!

170
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,458
Saiyan powers are not strong
enough to be felt this far away.

171

Well, it is. And I don't
think that's a good thing.

Big hair make you big funny.

174
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,041
Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

175
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,500
This "Super Three" whatever you
said, it's ridiculous.

176
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:31,125
Majin Buu, I think our friend's
in need of a haircut.

00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm ready,
show me what you've got.

178
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,291
[laughs]

179
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,083
[BABIDI]
We will! You and everyone else!

180
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,291
The whole world will be watching

181
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,791
when Buu pounds
you into oblivion!

182
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,708
Pow! Pow-Pow!

183
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,541
[thinking] Trunks,
you better move it fast.

184
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,166
[TRUNKS]
Yeah, I made it!

185
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,208
Bulma, Trunks has just landed!

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,458
All right!

187
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,875
It'll just take him a second
to get the radar from my dad.

188
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,791
Then we're home free!

189
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,250
[TRUNKS]
Grandpa!

190
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,166
[DR. BRIEF]
Well...

191
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,208
How's my grandson today?

192
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,708
[MRS. BRIEF]
Oh, hi, Trunks.

193
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,875
What great timing,
I just made some tea.

194
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,291
No, we've gotta hurry!

195
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,708
Okay then.

196
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,250
I have some fresh vanilla
ice cream in the freezer.

197
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,958
Do you want a sundae?

198
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,000
There's not time for ice cream!

199
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,541
Well, let's see...

200
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,250
Would you rather have a nice
big sandwich, some roast beef?

201
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,541
I just sliced it myself.

202
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,083
You're not listening to me,

203
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,541
Grandpa, where do we
keep the Dragon Radar?

204
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,500
Dragon Radar?

205
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
[TRUNKS]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

206
00:15:55,375 --> 00:16:04,166
Ah... Well, the last time
I saw it, it was umm...

207
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,916
Hurry up! We don't have time!

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,833
[BABIDI growls]

209
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,041
Do it! Take him down!

210
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,208
Buu!

211
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,666
[gasps]

212
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,041
[screams]

213
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,333
[BUU grunts]

214
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,583
Oh no!

215
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,125
[BUU yells]

216
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:30,916
[grunts]

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,291
[BUU whimpers]

218
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,958
[GOKU yells]

219
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,916
[BUU grunts]

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,958
[gasps]

221
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:46,208
[BUU grunting]

222
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,958
Fight back! Do something!

223
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:54,041
[grunting continues]

224
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,166
[KRILLIN]
Oh yeah!

225
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,166
I don't see why Goku didn't
do this in the first place!

226
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,375
I knew it! No one in the
world can beat my dad!

227
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,833
Perhaps.

228
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,416
It's true that
Goku has proven

229
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,208
to be stronger
than any of us imagined.

230
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,208
But the chances he'll be
able to stop Majin Buu

231
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,708
by himself are still slim.

232
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:21,333
Well, if Goku can't do it,
is there anyone who can?

233
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,791
I hope.

234
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,291
Hey, somebody's
fighting with Majin Buu!

235
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,916
Who is it?

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,291
I don't know,
but he's my new best friend!

237
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,958
You take that
fat tub of lard down!

238
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,291
[BUU grunting]

239
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,583
What are you doing?! Buu!

240
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,750
[GOKU yells]

241
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,208
[BUU yelps]

242
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,666
[yelling]

243
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,250
[BUU grunting]

244
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,083
[gasps]

245
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,791
[BUU]
Buuuuu!

246
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:13,000
[screaming]

247
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,375
[BABIDI]
No! What have you done?!

248
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,708
[MAN D] Did he actually win?
Is that thing dead?

249
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,250
[gasping]

250
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,458
[giggles]

251
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:38,166
[BABIDI] Ha, ha! Welcome back,
Buu! I thought we'd lost you!

252
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,000
[thinking]
He's completely unharmed.

253
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,791
Not so much as a scratch.

254
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,208
[BUU yells]

255
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,208
[thinking] That's one
of Vegeta's attacks!

256
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,833
[growls]

257
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,666
[thinking] Amazing. He can't
have seen it more than once.

258
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,125
But he's already mastered
one of Vegeta's best moves...

259
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,958
[BABIDI] I've had enough of
watching you show off, Buu!

260
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
Finish the job!

261
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,958
[GOKU grunts]

262
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,625
[laughs]

263
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,458
Goku, that's enough!
You're using too much power.

264
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,500
Please, please stop it!

265
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:01,250
While you still have some
time left. The Earth needs you.

266
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,041
You still have to teach
the boys the fusion technique!

267
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,416
[BUU grunts]

268
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,000

[BOTH grunting]

[yelling]

272
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,166
Buu have fun playing
with you. You strong.

273
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,083
Thanks, so are you.

274
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,958
Hey, punch him! Don't just
float there like a balloon!

275
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,375
[BUU growls]

276
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,541
[BABIDI] Hurry! Or do you want
me to seal you up again?

277
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,208
Quiet!

278
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,833
What?! You insolent,
portly buffoon!

279
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,916
How dare you
talk to me that way!

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,250
I am your master

281
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,750
and I'm ordering you to
grind that man into dust!

282
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,416
[thinking] Trunks hasn't
left Capsule Corp yet.

283
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,166
What's taking so long?

284
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,125
Hey, Trunks, you really
need to get a move on.

285
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,291
What was that?

286
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,166
[TRUNKS] C'mon,
c'mon, stupid radar!

287
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,083
Grandpa, where was the last
place you remember putting it?!

288
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,583
[DR. BRIEF] I'm thinking it
was somewhere in this room.

289
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,083
Ah! I see, so you've
been in contact

290
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,875
with young Trunks all along!

291
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,583
How delightful.

292
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh-ho, Buu!

293
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,750
How would you like to
torture our friend here

294
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,041
until he tells us where
that little brat is hiding?!

295
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,750
[giggles]

296
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,500
[thinking] Looks like I still
have to stall for more time.

297
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,458
[BUU]
Ohh... Oh?

298
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,916

That's it, show that
fat blob who's boss!

301
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,333
[GOTEN]
Get him, Dad.

302
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,208
[grunts]

303
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,625
[NARRATOR] Once again,
Goku has defied the impossible

304
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,416
by transforming himself
into a Super Saiyan 3!

305
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,916
[BUU screams]

306
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,083
[NARRATOR] But how long can
these awesome new powers

307
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,750
keep Majin Buu at bay?

308
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:25,375
[TRUNKS] Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

309
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,833
Where is it?!

310
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,458
[NARRATOR] Can Goku win
Trunks the time he needs

311
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,583
to find the Dragon Radar
and escape from West City?

312
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
[BUU laughs]

313
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,791
[NARRATOR] Or will he
somehow find a way to do

314
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:45,583
what can't be done and
finish off Majin Buu by himself?

315
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,583
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next action-packed episode

316
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,833
of Dragon Ball Z!
