Goku and the others easily
qualified for the tournament.

00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,250
But, as usual,
the stubborn Vegeta

7
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,291
wasn't pulling any punches.

hit him so hard but...

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,083
at least he's quiet.

26
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:23,583

Those two are
really tearing it up!
