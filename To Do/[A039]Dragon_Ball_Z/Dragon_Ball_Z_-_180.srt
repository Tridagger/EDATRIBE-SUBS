00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,875
Cell had a surprise for Goku!

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,000
[CELL] You almost
fell out of the ring!

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,708
If you had, I would
have been declared

5
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,250
the winner of this
little match of ours.

6
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,791
Huh?

7
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,916
Is the game too hard for you?
Should I make it easier?

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,583
Perhaps this will make
things more interesting!

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,083
[NARRATOR] In a reckless move,

10
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,083
the genetically-engineered
villain destroyed his own ring

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,416
so that he could fight
Goku without any boundaries.

12
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,625
[NARRATOR] And so,
across the desert landscape

13
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
the battle waged on.

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,375
Cell's attack was relentless,
but the valiant Super Saiyan

15
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,083
matched the attack
blow for blow.

16
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,708
It seemed the fighters had
been thrown into a stalemate,

17
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,750
and the bout
would last forever.

18
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,125
[NARRATOR] But after dodging
a string of lethal blasts,

19
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,000
Goku unveiled
a daring new strategy.

20
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,416
Soaring high into the air, he
gathered up tremendous energy

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,250
for his most famous move--
The Kamehameha Wave--

22
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,041
and aimed it
directly at the Earth!

23
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,625
[NARRATOR] Cell was quick
to call Goku's bluff,

24
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,708
knowing that he wouldn't
risk firing the blast

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,958
and exploding the entire planet.

26
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,000
But, Goku had
something else in mind...

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
[GOKU] Haaa... 

28
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,000
No, he wouldn't?!

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,208
[NARRATOR] At the
last moment, Goku used

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,416
his Instant Transmission
technique to appear below Cell

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,791
and deliver the bang
before the vile android

32
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,166
could put up his guard.

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,541
[CELL] NOOO!!

34
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,791
Haaa!!

35
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,041
[NARRATOR] Goku has
scored a direct hit!

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,458
Is this the final blow
that will win the tournament

37
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,250
and rid the Earth of Cell?

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,541
Find out... today!

39
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
[YAMCHA] Did you see that?!

40
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,750
Goku blasted Cell into pieces!

41
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,083
Nobody could survive
the Kamehameha Wave

42
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,541
at that close range!

43
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,125
[TIEN] You're right, Yamcha!

44
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,875
That little maneuver may have
just won Goku the tournament!

45
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,708
Yeah, he's won!

46
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,166
[VEGETA growls]

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,958
Uh, say, Champ, what
just happened down there?

48
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,416
Yeah! Goku did it, alright!

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,166
That Instant Transmission
Technique really did the trick!

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,833
Hey, everybody,
Goku won the tournament!

51
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,458
[YAMCHA laughs]

52
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
[YAMCHA gasps]

53
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,625
[YAMCHA] Come on, you guys!
This is good news!

54
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,250
We don't have to worry
about Cell anymore!

55
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,458
Huh...?

56
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,708
Man! I wish those guys
would lighten up a bit.

57
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,791
So, Mr. Satan, could this really
be the end of the Cell Games?

58
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,708
Hello, Earth to Hercule!

59
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Oh! Uh? Of course!

60
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
Uh, this new guy
has some good moves,

61
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,916
and he might have
done a number on Cell,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,750
but that's nothing compared to
what I would have done to him!

63
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,708
[MR. SATAN laughs]

64
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,750
[PIIZA giggles]

65
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,375
Oh, Mr. Satan,

66
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,958
it's such a pity you
never had a chance to fight.

67
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,666
Now the world will never get to
see what a great hero you are!

68
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,541
[PIIZA giggles]

69
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,833
[ANNOUNCER] Huh.

70
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,708
Well, there you have
it, ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,166
To our great regret, Mr. Satan
won't be able to demonstrate

72
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,666
his bone-crushing
moves in the Cell Games,

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,875
because this unknown contestant
has somehow turned Cell

74
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,375
into a pile of cinders.

75
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,500
Who is this insanely-hair-styled
hero and how did he do,

76
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,916
well, whatever he did?

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,166
Stay tuned, I'll try
for an exclusive interview!

78
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,458
What? You mean it's over now?

79
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,500
You know what I think,
the whole thing was fixed!

80
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,458
Come on, Mama! Let's go!

81
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,250
--Let's go! Come on!
--Wait!

82
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,458
I want to find out
who this young man is!

83

[thinking] Something's not
right... It's not over yet!

84
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,750
I can still sense a lot
of energy left in Cell's body.

86

Get away from him, Goku!

to regenerate himself!

Oh my! Cell has just
sprouted another head!

97
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,416
Is this another one of
the monster's dirty tricks?!

98
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,458
Of course it's a trick!
It has to be!

that you'd be able

101
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,958
to regenerate yourself.

102
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,041
[CELL] Of course.
Thanks to Piccolo's cells.

103

[GOKU] Hah!

105
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
I may not have beaten
you with that blast, Cell,

106
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,208
but I can sense that
your power level

107
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,458
has gone down sharply
because of it.

108
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,500
[CELL] Perhaps, but you're
the one who seems

109
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,791
to have trouble
catching his breath.

110
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,416
I know what you did.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,625
You pushed most of your energy
into that last attack, Goku.

112
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,958
But I'm still standing and
all your power's drained,

113
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,583
which means your fight is over!

114
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,708
That's not true!

[ANNOUNCER] The golden-topped

with everything he's got!

181
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,208
This could really be it, folks!

182
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,666
It looks like Cell is in
really big trouble now!

183
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,791
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

184
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,291
I'm almost too
scared to open my eyes!

185
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
Come on, now! This is important!

186
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,458
Fix it, you bums!

187
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,541
There's nothing wrong
with our equipment!

188
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:53,666
I set this station up myself
and I know everything works!

[OPERATOR] That's it,
no more phone calls!

192
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,333
Alright, Cell is going down!

193
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,333
It's about time!

194
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,791
We won, guys!

[VEGETA growls]

196
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
Do it!

197
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,625
[thinking] Finish him off, Dad!

00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,500
[ANNOUNCER] I don't like
the look of that!

[MR. SATAN screams]

[MR. SATAN grunts]

207
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,083
Maestro, are you okay?
Shall I give you a hand?

208
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,375
[MR. SATAN] No! No problem here!

209
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,166
Just getting
warmed up, that's all.

210
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,375
[MR. SATAN grunts]

211
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,958
Whatta man!

212
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,625
Hercule, you
are something else

213
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,541
getting warmed up
for battle like that!

214
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
So that's how you do it!

215
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,833
That's how you keep
in such great shape!

216
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,041
[MR. SATAN] You know me,
always ready for action!

217
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,375
As hard as this is, I will
hold on and continue my report!

218
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,166
But what is this ball
of energy Cell has created?!

219
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,208
It sort of looks
likes static electricity,

220
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,875
but where would he find
a conductor this large

221
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,416
and where was he hiding it?

222
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,375
Maybe now you can see
how completely hopeless

223
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,791
you really are, Goku!

224
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,500
[CELL] This is my game
and I make the rules!

225
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,750
[GOKU] Hmph.]

226
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,250
[MAN] Oh no! That monster
can't be stopped!

227
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,500
Hey, look at that!

228
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,416
It won't be long now,
that guy's history!

229
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,625
Mama what's going on?
I can't see! Is it over yet?

230
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,333
I'm not sure, but that
golden-haired young man

231
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,083
looks a lot like
ChiChi's husband to me.

232
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,750
What on earth
is he doing

233
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
on television fighting
that monster?

234
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,791
Don't ask me!

235
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,208
Don't know why ChiChi lets
her husband run wild like that!

236
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,750
It's shameful!

237
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,416
Ha-choo!

238
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,291
[CHICHI] I think I'm
worrying myself sick!

239
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,833
Come on, Goku!
You gotta do something!

240
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,041
[BULMA] Oh, Goku was so close to
winning the tournament!

241
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,416
What a rip-off!

242
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,166
No, I don't think so.

243
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,333
I don't think Goku has
any chance of beating Cell.

244
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,541
He's running low
on strength. It's obvious!

245
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,375
[BULMA gasps]

246
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,833
You think he'll lose...?

247
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,375
I know it's hard
to believe, Bulma,

248
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,458
Goku is looking tired

249
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,125
and I think he knows he can't
win the tournament either!

250
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know what
he's planning,

251
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,875
but whatever it is,
he'd better do it soon!

252
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,458
[PICCOLO]
Both of their power levels

253
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,666
have dropped tremendously,

254
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,208
but Goku's is...
dropping much faster!

255
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,541
[PICCOLo] If he doesn't act
soon, Goku is going to lose!

256
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,250
[CELL] Are you
feeling tired, Goku?

257
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,625
You've lost a lot of strength.

258
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,500
[CELL laughs]

259
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,541
Why don't you take a breather?

260
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,208
Perhaps one of those
Senzu beans would help you.

261
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,083
Hey, this is our chance!

262
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,500
If Goku eats a Senzu Bean,
he can get his strength back

263
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,958
and take Cell down!

264
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,625
That's right!
Cell said he could!

265
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,000
Come on, Krillin!

266
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,833
[PICCOLO] We will wait...

267
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:08,375
We'll wait for what?
He needs a Senzu Bean!

268
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,416
[VEGETA] Quiet, boy!
Where is your honor?!

269
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,791
Like all pure-blooded Saiyans,

270
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,458
Kakarot would rather
die fighting than win

271
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,083
with one of those disgraceful
Senzu Beans as his crutch!

272
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,583
Kakarot trained in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber

273
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,583
just as we did.

274
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,583
Now let's see what he can do!

275
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:36,625
Oh no! We can't!
Goku doesn't have the strength!

276
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't you see what'll happen
if he keeps going like this?!

277
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,208
If this goes on,
then he will die.

[KRILLIN growls]

281
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,583
But, that will be his decision!

282
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,041
It is painfully
clear at this point

283
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:59,541
that no one among this group
is stronger than Kakarot is.

284
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,458
Not even... myself.

285
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,500
So he deserves to have
the fight of a true warrior!

286
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,166
And that means to the death!

287
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,083
While we all just stand here and
watch?! I won't be a part of it!

Aren't you the one who
has never stopped talking

289
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,291
about how great a
hero Kakarot is?!

290
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,291
[VEGETA] If you have
so much faith in him,

291
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,750
then wait and see
what he will do!

00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,458
[CELL] I can feel your
power slipping away, Goku.

294
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think you
can last much longer.

[CELL chuckles]

296
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,833
You know, it's hardly worth
my effort to finish you off now.

297
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,833
But I wouldn't
want to disappoint

298
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,166
the television audience

299
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,250
because I know they
want to see a real champion.

300
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,958
The next battle we engage
in will be your last, Goku!

302
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,833
[GOKU] You're right
about one thing, Cell,

303
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,500
the world does want
to see a real champion!

No, don't do it!

his back on us?!

You can't end it this way!
You can't let Cell win!

322
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,250
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
lost his mind?

323
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,625
If he gives up now,
what will prevent Cell

324
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,083
from terrorizing
the Earth once again?

325
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,708
Has Dr. Gero's cruel
creation proved

326
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,791
that he is even more powerful
than our greatest hero?

327
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,166
The answers are coming,

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,291
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
