1
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,666
After a lengthy rest,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,416
Goten and Trunks awoke to
some strange new surroundings,

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,458
unaware that Piccolo
had carried them

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,708
to the Lookout
for safe keeping.

6
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,083
[TRUNKS]
This place is huge!

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the loss of Gohan and Vegeta

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,583
weighed heavily on the
remaining Z Fighters' minds.

9
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,166
Little could they know,

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,458
far away on the
Supreme Kai's planet,

11
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,833
a glimmer of hope
still remained.

12
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,250
[SUPREME KAI] Kibito,
revive Gohan with your power.

13
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,083
Whoa! What's the...?

14
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,375
[NARRATOR]
Gohan has been revived!

15
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,166
The injuries he sustained from
Majin Buu have been healed.

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,458
But for what purpose has
he been transported

17
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,250
to the World of the Kais?

18
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,333
[SUPREME KAI] I brought Gohan
here to get the Z Sword!

19
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:21,041
It's the only way that
Majin Buu can be defeated now.

20
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,250
[NARRATOR] Sheathed in stone
atop a pillar of rock,

21
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,916
the Z Sword has lain dormant
for untold centuries,

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,916
waiting for the
arrival of a warrior

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,875
strong enough to
harness its hidden power.

24
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,291
Many have tried,

25
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,625
but so far, none have
succeeded in pulling it free.

26
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,083
[SUPREME KAI]
Now try to pull it out!

27
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
[NARRATOR]
Is Gohan strong enough

28
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,500
to remove the Z Sword
from its resting place?

29
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,750
And if he is,

30
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
will this legendary weapon

31
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,875
really give him the edge he
needs to beat Majin Buu?

32
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,833
There's only
one way to find out!

33
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,708
Stay tuned for Dragon Ball Z!

34
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,416
[thump]

35
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,708
[BULMA growls]

36
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,791
[BULMA] It's just too hard...
for me to believe...

37
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,208
How could Gohan
beat something like Cell,

38
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,208
but he couldn't stand up
to that fat, disgusting...

39
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:41,166
[BULMA sobs]

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,750
Yes, it is hard to
believe, but it's true.

41
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,541
Gohan is dead,
and my poor ChiChi...

42
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,708
Now she's lost her
husband and her son!

43
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,875
Dead, dead, dead! I'm so tired
of hearing you people say that!

44
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,583
We haven't even found
a body yet, and you just...

45
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,750
...stand around here
acting defeated

46
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,583
like we've...
already buried him!

47
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,541
[VIDEL growls]

48
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,583
Videl, I'm sorry.
I lost a friend, too.

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,333
But if we can't sense
his life force anymore,

50
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:38,916
then that... means that,
well... That he's passed on.

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,708
[VIDEL]
Stop saying that!

52
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,166
I don't believe it...

53
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,916
[VIDEL] I absolutely
refuse to believe it.

54
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,166
[VIDEL] He can't be gone before
we ever had a chance together.

55
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,375
[VIDEL thinking]
Gohan...

56
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,041
Here goes.

57
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,000
Huh?

58
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,208
Uh, I was wondering exactly...

59
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,166
I mean... Ha, ha. What's
supposed to happen when a person

60
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,250
actually manages to
pull this thing out?

61
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,166
[KIBITO] The sword draws on its
master's deepest hidden powers.

62
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,666
The two become one weapon,

63
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,625
capable of cutting down
even the mightiest of foes.

64
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:05,250
Oh wow, it sounds like this
sucker must be really sharp!

65
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,583
Guess I'll have to be careful.

66
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,250
Don't worry,
you can't free it.

67
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,333
[SUPREME KAI] Kibito,
we've all had our chance,

68
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,166
now give Gohan his.

69
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,375
If you're ready,
give it a try.

70
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,875
[GOHAN]
Here goes nothing.

71
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:33,458
[grunts]

72
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:46,625
[grunts]

73
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,750
[yells]

74
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,708
[grunting]

75
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,166
[screams]

76
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:13,083
[GOHAN groans]

77
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,083
Ahh, stupid hands.

78
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,166
Gohan, I think you
should try it again.

79
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,791
You guys weren't
kidding about this thing!

80
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:29,333
C'mon, hands, be strong,
be strong, be strong!

81
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,583
[yells]

82
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,166
Not even your
Super Saiyan strength

83
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,333
will be enough, I'm afraid.

84
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:58,875
[grunts]

85
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,250
Your effort is in vain.

86
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,125
If the Supreme Kai was
unable to extract the sword,

87
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,958
how can a simple mortal like
yourself ever succeed?

88
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,750
[grunts]

89
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,875
[GOHAN yells]

90
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:33,875
[yells]

91
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,916
[GOHAN grunts]

92
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,791
Gohan, you did it!

93
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,458
The Z Sword is free!

94
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,625
[SUPREME KAI]
Well, Kibito,

95
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,958
it would seem that you have
underestimated our young friend.

96
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,291
[KIBITO growls]

97
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,041
How does it feel, Gohan,
to hold the legendary Z Sword?

98
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,041
Let's see.

99
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:17,125
[grunts]

100
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:22,708
[GOHAN yells, grunts]

101
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,166
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

102
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,416
Don't worry, I've got it.

103
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,875
[grunts]

104
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,833
Hey, you know what?

105
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,083
I think I figured out
how I can use this thing

106
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,208
to beat Majin Buu.

107
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,083
Is that so?

108
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,250
[GOHAN] It's so heavy, if I
could just get him to hold it,

109
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,291
he won't be able
to move his arms!

110
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,250
[gasps]
How dare you make jokes?!

111
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,083
Have you no respect for the
power that is in your grasp?!

112
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,625
This sword is the ultimate
weapon, and you removed it.

113
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,833
Now you must master it.

114
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,750
You must work harder
than you ever have,

115
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,291
because if you continue
trembling the way are now,

116
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,458
your battle with Majin Buu will
be over before it's begun!

117
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,750
Well, Kibito, maybe you'd
like to give it a try?

118
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,708
For you, this
should be no problem.

119
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,041
[GOHAN]
Ready?

120
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,541
[yells]

121
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,833
[SUPREME KAI]
How embarrassing.

122
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,250
See? Like I said, it's heavy.

123
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,041
[KIBITO grunts]

124
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:50,541
[growls]

125
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,000
[BOTH gasp]

126
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,750
[KIBITO]
Uh, it's not that heavy.

127
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,166
You couldn't even
lift it off the ground...

128
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,208
[KIBITO] Well, I'm not the
one who has to use it!

129
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,000
You are! So you
had better get started!

130
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,083
[GOKU] Now remember, even if
the fusion is successful,

131
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,416
it will only last
for 30 minutes.

132
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,583
Once that time's up,
your bodies will separate

133
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,083
and you guys
will return to normal.

134
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,000
And then you won't be able to
do another fusion for a while.

135
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,666
You follow me?

136
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,125
Ah, 30 minutes isn't long
enough for this kind of fight.

137
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,291
Actually it is,

138
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
as long as they do
the fusion correctly,

139
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,791
a half an hour is all they'll
need to take down Majin Buu.

140
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,291
This technique
really is that powerful!

141
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,958
Okay, now, the two of you,

142
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,583
I need you to become
Super Saiyans for this.

143
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,583
What's wrong?

144
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,458
[growling]

145
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,916
Huh...?

146
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
Listen, we wanna know.
You're supposed to be

147
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
the strongest guy in the
universe or something, right?

148
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,375
So why why weren't you there?

149
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,750
Why weren't you there
to save Gohan? Or my dad?!

150
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm sorry, Trunks.

151
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,833
What? You're sorry?!
You could've helped!

152
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,166
"I'm sorry" isn't
gonna bring back my dad!

153
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,750
Gohan always told me
that you could do anything!

154
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,916
So why didn't you save
him from that Buu monster?!

155
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,875
Why didn't you save him?!

156
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,625
Don't just stand
there, say something!

157
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,250
What can I say?

158
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,916
Look, I wish I was the
strongest guy in the universe.

159
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,375
Then I could have helped. But
I'm not. I can't beat Majin Buu.

160
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:21,250
But, with the fusion technique,
I know the two of you can!

161
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,625
If you'll trust me,

162
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,666
and you're willing to learn
what I have to show you,

163
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,083
we can still get that monster

164
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,625
for all of the
terrible things he's done.

165
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:30,833
I'm game.

166
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,291
Okay.

167
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,250
[BABIDI laughs]

168
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,083
[BABIDI using ESP] Your
attention please, Earthlings!

169
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,208
It's me again!

170
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,083
The great wizard Babidi,

171
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,208
along with my faithful
counterpart, Majin Buu.

172
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,833
The two of us have been out

173
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,166
doing a little
bit of sight seeing.

174
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,083
And what a glorious
site we've found.

175
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,791
A perfect place for Majin Buu
to grab a little snack.

176
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,125
[BUU]
Mm-hmm!

177
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,083
[BABIDI] I hear the local
cuisine is to die for!

178
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,375
Of course, what he
was really hungry for

179
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,750
was some Majunior Trunks,
and Goten a la mode.

180
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,291
[BABIDI laughs]

181
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,125
[BABIDI using ESP] Alas, I guess
we'll just have to make do.

182
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,375
I can't tell where he is.
What city is that?

183
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,875
Trust me guy--
you don't wanna know!

184
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:31,750
[PEOPLE screaming]

185
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,666
Why is that wizard
guy talking about us?!

186
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,208
I don't know, but if you close
your eyes you can see him, too!

187
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,250
Don't do it!
Don't close your eyes!

188
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,875
[yells]

189
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,208
[BABIDI] You all know what
I want. I'm lis-ten-ing!

190
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,375
Which means you still have time

191
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,458
to tell me where
my quarry is hiding.

192
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,208
I'll give you until I finish
speaking this sentence.

193
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,875
To late! Ha! It looks like
Buu gets to have that snack.

194
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,291
Yes! But what should he eat?

195
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,583
I'm sure he's had more than
enough candy for one day.

196
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,250
Hold on, I think
I know just the thing

197
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,166
to hit the spot, chocolate!

198
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,041
Oh-ho!

199
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:19,291
[screaming]

200
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,750
Ooh.

201
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,666
[laughs]

202
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
Whoa-ho!

203
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:35,583
[screaming]

204
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,583
Buu want chocolate!

205
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,083
[screams]

206
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,083
[screaming]

207
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,250
[laughs]

208
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,250
What's happening?!

209
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,166
[GOTEN] He's really gonna
eat all those people!

210
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,625
[GOTEN, TRUNKS scream]

211
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,208
Hey, uh, was that Cindy
and Janet I just saw?

212
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,750
Yeah, I think it was.

213
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,541
What's going on out there?!

214
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,833
[MR. SATAN] What are you
guys whining about?

215
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,375
[growls]

216
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,583
[MR. SATAN]
A true martial artist

217
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,000
is never distracted
from the task at hand.

218
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,041
Only a fool
dwells on foolish things.

219
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,875
Now get your minds focused
and back to my training!

220
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,625
Yes!

221
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,125
Human beings can fly,

222
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:02,291
it's just that our bodies
have forgotten how to do it.

223
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,500
We have to re-teach ourselves,

224
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,291
just like Videl did.
Okay, let go!

225
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,708
And release me now!

226
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:35,041
Come on, body of mine, wake up
and remember your lost powers!

227
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,750
[screams, grunts]

228
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,041
[screams]

229
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,500
[grunts]

230
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,333
[screams]

231
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,291
Mr. Satan, hurry,
we need your help!

232
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,583
[gasps]

233
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,541
I've told you over a dozen times

234
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,625
never to open that door
when we are training!

235
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,208
I'm so sorry, sir,
but you have to see this!

236
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,958
[gasps]

237
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,208
What's all this?

238
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,125
--[chanting] Mr. Satan!
--[WOMAN] It's our hero!

239
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,916
--Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!
--Our savior! Please protect us!

240
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,291
--[chanting continues]
--Yo, Mr. Satan!

241
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,833
--Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!
--I gotta challenge for you!

242
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,041
--[chanting]
--Won't you defeat Majin Buu?!

243
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,500
[chanting]
Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!

244
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,458
It's certainly
easier said than done.

245
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,458
Mr. Satan, you rock!

246
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,750
Please, save us!

247
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,458
You are truly an
example to us all!

248
00:19:52,291 --> 00:20:02,250
[CROWD cheers]

249
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:17,708
--Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!
--[MR. SATAN growls]

250
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,541
[yells]

251
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,041
[MR. SATAN]
My people, my people!

252
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,250
You have nothing to fear.
It can be revealed now.

253
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,458
I have been secretly training,

254
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,541
and am now in the
middle of developing

255
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,333
a devastating
new fighting technique.

256
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,708
Once I have mastered
this new method,

257
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,916
I will possess strength
far beyond that of anyone.

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,375
And then, like the mighty lion
hiding in the shadows,

259
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,416
I shall pounce on
and completely destroy

260
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,541
this evil beast
called Majin Buu!

261
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:58,083
[MR. SATAN laughs]

262
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,000
[thinking]
Oh no, what am I doing?!

263
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,541
[burps]

264
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,083
No, they'll destroy it all!

265
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
[BABIDI]
Well, the fun is over here.

266
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,166
It seems that Majin Buu
is actually full for once.

267
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,583
I guess that means the next city

268
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,833
will have to settle for being
pummeled into oblivion.

269
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,166
Okay, time for us to move on.

270
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,375
[TRUNKS using ESP]
Babidi, Majin Buu!

271
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,458
Huh?!

272
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,625
Can you hear me? This is Trunks!

273
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,208
And I'm Goten!

274
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,000
So, the two of you have
decided to find some courage.

275
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,375
No, we've decided to find you,

276
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,833
and you don't wanna know what
we've got in store for that day.

277
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,208
It won't be pretty!

278
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,000
You two stop talking
to him or he'll find us!

279
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,541
[BABIDI] Hello? Where are
you boys? Where'd you go?

280
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,291
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

281
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,208
[BABIDI laughs]

282
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,916
I think it's time we got
started. What do you say?

283
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
[BOTH]
Mm-hmm.

284
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,125
[NARRATOR] Having witnessed
Babidi's horrific spectacle

285
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,458
of mass destruction,

286
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,708
Goten and Trunks are ready
to do whatever it takes

287
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,083
to stop the wizard
once and for all.

288
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,625
And if Goku is right,

289
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:46,083
these young Super Saiyans may be
the only ones who can do it!

290
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,875
Can they master
the fusion technique

291
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,583
before Majin Buu claims
any more innocent lives?

292
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:54,500
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next Dragon Ball Z!
