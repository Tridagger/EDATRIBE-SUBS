00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,333
Gotenks took aim at Majin Buu

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,333
with his peculiar
new technique.

4
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,333
[GOTENKS] Now for the big
finish! I'll be legendary!

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,708
[NARRATOR] Strangely,
the fused warrior spat out

6
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,541
eleven ghost-like
copies of himself,

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,208
all of which created a
lethal explosion on impact!

8
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,000
[SUPERGHOSTS]
Ah! Aaah!

9
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,250
[NARRATOR]
Initially Majin Buu

10
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,291
evaded the kamikaze attacks,

11
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,750
but in a clever move
playing on his appetite,

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,458
the monster was had.

13
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,083
[NARRATOR] However,
Majin Buu survived.

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,416
And that's when Gotenks
made a grave mistake.

15
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,583
Wanting to prolong
the fight in the belief

16
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,000
it would be more impressive,

17
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,125
Gotenks fooled
Piccolo into thinking

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,166
he had run out of energy.

19
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,166
Deliberately,
Gotenks did not reveal

20
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,083
his most powerful
new technique,

21
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,708
hoping to increase
the suspense.

22
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,041
And just before Gotenks could
unveil this surprise attack,

23
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,166
Piccolo made a rash decision.

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,541
He has destroyed the door to
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

25
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,208
trapping them inside forever.

26
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,250
That's it. We're all
stuck in here together.

27
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,250
So I guess we better
make ourselves comfortable.

28
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,708
[GOTENKS]
Hu--!

29
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,875
Aaah!
[grunting lightly]

30
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,791
[GOTENKS]
Piccolo, is it true?

31
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,916
Is there really no way
out of this place?

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,041
Yes. I'm sorry. That was
the exit and now it's gone.

33
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,125
It's gone, Buu.

34
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,583
Uh! But how do we eat candy?!

35
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,708
We don't. There's none here.

36
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,541
None?! No ice cream?!
No--no chocolate?!

37
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,000
Nothing. All gone.

38
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:39,833
[SUPER BUU screams]

39
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,875
[KRILLIN]
Did you hear that?

40
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,750
What was that blast about?
Seems like they just started.

41
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,291
There's trouble!

42
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,541
The door has been destroyed

43
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,958
and there's no way
for them to get out!

44
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,833
It's Piccolo, he must have been
forced to seal off the room!

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,750
That was part of the plan,
right? As the backup.

46
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,125
[ROSHI]
Yes. I suppose Majin Buu

47
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,166
was too much for Goten
and Trunks to handle.

48
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,250
So, in order
to save the planet,

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,291
Piccolo had no choice but to
destroy the exit to the Chamber.

50
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,916
Now Majin Buu is trapped
in that dimension.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,958
And there he will stay
for the rest of eternity!

52
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,208
Good for him!

53
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
But what about Trunks,
Goten, and Piccolo!

54
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,500
Have they been killed
by Majin Buu or not?

55
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,708
[ROSHI]
Mmm.

56
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,041
I'm afraid there's
no way of knowing.

57
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,125
But what about
the Dragon Balls?

58
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,333
If they're alive then
we can't wish them back!

59
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,166
Relax Bulma,
if Majin Buu's still alive

60
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,166
I'm sure he'll
kill them eventually!

61
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,291
[BULMA] Are you even
listening to yourself?!

62
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,166
Relax because a monster
they're trapped with

63
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,708
will kill them?!

64
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,208
They're children! They never
should've been made to fight!

65
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,166
You grown men left the fate
of the Earth in their hands!

66
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,833
I hope you're ashamed!

67
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,291
[SUPER BUU]
No candy for me?

68
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,208
I want candy! I need it!

69
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,958
Great! This is great!

70
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,333
Who told you to
lock us in here, huh?!

71
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,833
For your information I still
have my best technique!

72
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,166
I thought you said
you had no strength left

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,000
and your powers had
reached their limits!

74
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,458
I had to do it!

75
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,208
I was just trying to make
the fight more fantastic!

76
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,500
If you would have let me

77
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,250
I could have taken
care of Majin Buu

78
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,000
and we'd be on the
outside now! You blew it!

79
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,041
You what?! You put
the world at risk

80
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,833
just to be more fantastic?!

81
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,500
What kind of kid
are you?! You idiot!

82
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,333
Well, you're the idiot
that blew up the door,

83
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,166
so you're the idiot
who has to get us out!

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,750
If you don't, I'll use
my technique on you!

85
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,416
There's no way out of here!

86
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,458
The only door has been
blown up! It's gone! Gone!

candy! Want candy now!

Oh no! He'll escape!

Somehow he's made
a rip in space and time!

he'll get back to Earth.
