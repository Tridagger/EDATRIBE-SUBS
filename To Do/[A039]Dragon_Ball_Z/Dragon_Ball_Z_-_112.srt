[NARRATOR] It's looks
like Garlic Jr.'s plan

00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,833
to take over the world
is almost complete!

5
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,333
So far, he's shrunk Kami
down to the size of a toy

6
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,083
and turned almost
everyone else into zombies

7
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,958
by forcing them to breathe
in his evil Black Water Mist!

8

escaped his madness!

he even stand a chance

Can Gohan escape the clutches

Yes, once he was
young Gohan's mentor...

47
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,416
but the table's have turned!

48

to leave the kid to us.

67
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,041
I did, but remember, Piccolo
and Gohan hate each other.

68
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,125
That hatred has been pent up in
Piccolo for years and probably

69
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,208
was released when he breathed
in the Black Water Mist.

I thought you could
read people's minds?

126
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,208
So how come she keeps winning?

127
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,791
Would you keep it down?! Please!

seem to work on her!

you have left to bet?

This!

it's also a letter opener!

lose to this ditz again!

getting mad at me, Korin?

183
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,833
[GOHAN panting]

184
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,666
[GARLIC JR. cackles]

185
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,791
[GOHAN growls]

186
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,333
[GARLIC JR.]
Well, on the bright side,

187
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,458
at least you'll
get to see the bottle

188
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,375
of Sacred Water
before I terminate you!

189
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,166
How dare you...

190
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,708
Don't take another step forward

191
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,750
if you know what's good for you!

192
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,500
[growling]

193
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,708
That's it!

194
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,666
[VINEGAR grunts]
[GOHAN groans]

195
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:25,583
[GOHAN coughing]

196
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,041
[GOHAN]
Krillin!

197
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,125
[KRILLIN grunts]
[GOHAN groans]

198
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,083
What... happened to you?

199
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,500
Oh... Oh no!
Krillin's one of them now!

200
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,416
Don't you get it, Gohan?

201
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,833
Huh?

202
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,375
[GARLIC JR.] Whether you breathe
in the Black Water Mist,

203
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,541
or get bitten by someone
who has, it's all the same!

204
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,916
You become one of us
and your only mission

205
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,208
is to serve me,
the almighty Garlic Jr.!

206
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,291
Huh?

207
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,041
Why don't you join us?

208
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,541
You're the only one
who's left, kido!

209
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,041
[VINEGAR] S'cuse me, sire!
It'd be my pleasure

210
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,791
to rid you of this roach!

211
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,750
[SPICE] Unless, of course,
you would like the honor

212
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,500
of finishing off the little
ratbag yourself, my lord!

213
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,458
Nah! Have fun, boys!

214
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,375
[grunting]
[GOHAN gasps]

215
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,833
[grunting]

216
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,250
[GOHAN groans]

217
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,291
That's enough!

218
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,708
[GOHAN groans]

219
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:13,375
Wait! I think I will
finish him off after all!

220
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,541
Oh, the pleasure is all yours!

221
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,291
Huh?

222
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,541
[grunting]

223
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,750
Krillin! Catch!

224
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,958
I got 'em!

225
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:42,375
[GARLIC JR. growling]

226
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,625
You'll pay for that!

227
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,708
Yeah, well I don't think that's
gonna happen, Garlic breath!

228
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,500
[PICCOLO grunts]

229
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:59,041
[PICCOLO groans]

230
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:13,916
[GARLIC JR. growling]

231
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,416
[KRILLIN] Hey! That was one heck
of a plan, Piccolo, but uh...

232
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,666
Gohan here's pretty messed up!

233
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,541
[PICCOLO]
Ha! He's fine!

234
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,708
Don't worry, I know I've
trained Gohan to withstand

235
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,458
a lot worse than this!

236
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,375
[KRILLIN]
Hey!

237
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,583
Huh?

238
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,833
[GARLIC JR. growling]

239
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:37,041
This isn't over yet,
mark my word!

240
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,500
Hmph!

241
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,750
[NARRATOR]
It looks like Piccolo has bought

242
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,541
our heroes a little time!

243
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,083
But one thing's for sure,

244
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,041
Garlic Jr. and his henchmen
won't take this sitting down!

245
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,666
The real battle is still ahead,

246
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,583
don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
