00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,916
Majin Buu realized that he
no longer needed any guidance

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,958
from his master, Babidi

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,000
and decided, much to
Babidi's dismay,

5
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,833
that the evil wizard
was expendable.

6
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,875
[NARRATOR]
Suddenly free, with no one

7
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,375
to put a damper on his fun,

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,083
Majin Buu celebrated his
newfound independence

9
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,083
the only way he knew how:

10
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,041
with massive destruction!

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,333
[NARRATOR]
Back at The Lookout,

12
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,833
Goku learned that
because he had used the

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,666
energy-draining Super
Saiyan 3 to stall Majin Buu,

14
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,958
he had even less time remaining
on Earth than he thought.

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,333
[GOKU]
Thirty minutes?! Ah!

16
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,166
Is that all the time I've got?

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Determined to make
the most of every last second,

18
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,916
Goku started training
Goten and Trunks

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,458
in the art of fusion.

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,500
Only by mastering this technique

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,416
can the boys hope
to defeat Majin Buu

22
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,166
once Goku has returned
to the Other World.

23
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,958
[NARRATOR] These complex moves
will take time to perfect.

24
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,041
Unfortunately, time
is the one thing

25
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,875
the Z Fighters
absolutely don't have.

26
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,500
[TRUNKS]
This might be a bit tough.

27
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,583
[GOKU]
Listen, boys!

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,125
You two are gonna
have to face off

29
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,208
against Majin Buu
in just two days.

30
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,333
Now, that's pretty soon.

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:56,208
[panting]

32
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,958
So it's crucial you know
how to fuse before then.

33
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
Do you understand?

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,458
[BOTH]
Yes!

35
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:10,083
[panting]

36
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,041
[PICCOLO thinking] Listen
to that. He sounds pathetic!

37
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,375
I still can't believe
how much energy Goku lost

38
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,750
becoming a Super Saiyan 3.

39
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
[GOKU] Okay guys, I hope you
were paying close attention.

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
You're gonna have to
do the same exact moves,

41
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,541
in perfect symmetry.

42
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,583
All right? Let's give it a try!

43
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,541
[BOTH]
Uh...

44
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,166
Hm? What's wrong?

45
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,583
[TRUNKS] Uh, I don't think Goten
knows what symmetry is, sir.

46
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,333
Huh? Oh, right.

47
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,583
Well, it's--
How should I put it?

48
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,458
[GOKU] It's like--
Well, no. Mirrors and--

49
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,625
Oh! I've got it, Piccolo and
I can show you how it's done!

50
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,000
Huh?!

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,583
A-Are you sure?

52
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,125
[TRUNKS thinking]
This, should be good.

53
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,708
[GOKU]
Now, watch us very carefully.

54
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,416
We only have time to
demonstrate this once.

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Just follow me,
Piccolo, and do what I do.

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,583
But in reverse,
like a mirror opposite.

57
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
Fu...

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,833

59
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,708
Ha!

60
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,125
[GOKU]
That is symmetry!

61
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,250
[KRILLIN]
What the heck was that?!

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,500
Is this fusion or
a junior high prom?

63
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,250
I don't know how
I feel about that

64
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,625
being our last hope
to save the world.

65
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,625
Now, are you two ready
to give it a try?

66
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,208
[BOTH]
Yeah!

67
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,333
Goku, would you have
really asked Vegeta

68
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,541
to do this fusion move with
you if he were still alive?

69
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,875
It's just that--

70
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,750
Well, I can't imagine
Vegeta subjecting himself

71
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,833
to something like this.

72
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,916
Hm? Why not?

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
What's wrong?

74
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,208
It's sort of...

75
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,333
[GOTEN]
Hey, Dad, look at this!

76
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,000
[TRUNKS]
Right?

77
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,333
That's it!

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,333
Oh. But, Goten, your left
arm is a little bit low!

79
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,666
It should be even with Trunks's.

80
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,083
Good! Now take three steps.

81
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,500

Oh, brother!

85
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,208
[GOKU] All right! Let's take
it again, from the top.

86
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,625
Remember, symmetry!

in the Other World.

Huh? Oh, it's you.

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,833
Can you tell me how much time
Goku has left with us, Baba?

94
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, judging from
his energy level,

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,041
I'd say about 15 minutes.

96
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,833

If Goten weren't
holding my Trunks back

they'd be ready to
fight Majin Buu right now

people from getting killed.

have to hold me back

00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,041
Just like bath water!

179
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,166
There you go little toes!

180
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,125
Buu feel so fresh and so clean
in brand new pajamas! Pop!

181
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,166
Makes Buu feel all
warm cuddly on inside.

182
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,250
So soft and comfy
against Buu's clean skin

183
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,541
just like wearing a thin
red layer of fluffy clouds.

184
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,791
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ja-mas!

185
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,166
Look! It Buu!

186
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,791
Privacy please!

187
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:17,791
[BUU grunting]

188
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,125
[BUU sighs]

189
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,083
What relief to finally
clean Buu's teeth

190
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,000
after so much yum-yums!

191
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,916
Smell Buu's breath! Minty fresh!

192
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,833
Buu go sleep!

193
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:43,291
[snoring]

194
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,208
Buu sleep good!
Feel well rested.

195
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,541
If Buu sleep for night.
Then today must be tomorrow

196
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,500
and that's one day
after yesterday was!

197
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,500
Where is the strong guys at?

198
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,500
Right! That little man said
they here in two days!

199
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,750
And that yesterday so
tomorrow they here!

200
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,083
[GOKU] Start over again
from the top, guys.

201
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,375
And remember this time to stay
in time with the rhythm. Ready?

202
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,041
[clapping in time] One-two.
One-two. One-two.

203
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:25,541
One-two. One-two. One-two.
One-two. One-two. One-two...

204
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,916
What's the matter, Trunks?

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,208
I'm sorry, but this
Fusion technique's lame.

206
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,958
What? You think it's lame?

207
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,666
Ha! Kids today! Ah!
Fusion is anything but lame.

208
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
The Metamorese people
who taught this to me

209
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,875
are some of the strongest
warriors in the universe,

210
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,333
thanks to Fusion!

211
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,166
Okay. But, first
can you show me

212
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,333
h-how you change
into Super Saiyan 3?!

213
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,541
Those people may be powerful,

214
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,791
but they're no
Super Saiyan 3!

215
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,583
Hey, can you show me
how to do it too, Dad?

216
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,166
Instead of wasting our time with
this boring old Fusion thing,

217
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
wouldn't me and Goten
be a lot better off

218
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,000
if we became
Super Saiyan 3?

219
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,375
Yeah! I'm sure we
can beat Majin Buu then!

220
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,166
[laughing]

221
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,250
You can't!

222
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,458
[BOTH]
Huh?

223
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,583
The only way you two
boys can beat Majin Buu

224
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,333
is by fusing together!

225
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,416
Just trust me on this one.

226
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,625
Maybe, your dad is right.

227
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,458
Great! Take it from the top!

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,375
They look so sad, fine!

229
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,291
I'll show you the
Super Saiyan 3 just one time.

230
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,166
Wow!

231
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,250
Go Dad!

232
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,375
[GOKU]
Not so fast.

233
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,625
You have to promise me

234
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
that you'll really
learn to fuse afterwards.

235
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,041
Promise!

236
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,416
Be smart, Goku!

237
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,208
You'll lose what little
time you have left on Earth.

238
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,208
I'm already out
of time, Piccolo.

239
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,458
Trunks, Goten! Watch closely!

240
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,875
First, turn Super Saiyan!

241
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,166
[GOKU yells]

242
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,250
Then you go one step beyond
that to a Super Saiyan 2:

243
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,958
an Ascended Saiyan.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,791
[BOTH]
Uh-huh.

245
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,166
Then...

246
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:33,083
[yells]

247
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm... afraid!

248
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,916
[GOKU] This next energy
has to come deep inside.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,708
Push hard to find it!

250
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:48,750
[yells]

251
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,666

[PICCOLO grunting]

254
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,875
[gasps]

255
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,208
[GOTEN, TRUNKS grunt, gasp]

256
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,958
Tap into that and you
become a Super Saiyan 3.

257
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,791
--[TRUNKS] That's awesome!
--[GOTEN] Cool, Dad!

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,625
[GOKU grunts]

259
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,416
What's wrong?!

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,541
Daddy!

261
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,041
Goku!

262
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:37,416
[panting]

263
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Don't worry about me,
I'm all right.

264
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,916
Let's get back to work.
You two promised me, remember?

265
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,666
[BABA]
Goku!

266
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,083
Your time's up, Goku!

267
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,125
Now?!

268
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,916
That little stunt
you just pulled

269
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
drained the last grains of
sand through your hourglass.

270
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,041
Alright, Piccolo just pick up
where I left off, okay?

271
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
I know these boys
aren't too graceful

272
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,666
but they learn fast
and I believe in them!

273
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,208
But, Goku...

274
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,583
I'm putting all of my trust
in you with this one, Piccolo.

275
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,125
You've earned it!

276
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,166
Thank you.

277
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,666
Trunks and Goten.

278
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,458
I know you'll show Piccolo
the same respect and dedication

279
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,083
that you've shown me.
He's the one in charge now.

280
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,291

Yes!

283
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,000
Wh-Where am I, Dad?

284
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,083
I'll explain everything later
when we have more time.

285
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,666
But for now, let's--

286
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,458
Goku's gotta go back
to the Other World now!

287
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,500
What?! Goku's leaving?!

288
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,125
[OX KING groans]

289
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,000
[ROSHI] Things aren't the same
around here, without you, Goku.

290
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,833
These guys won't
let me have any fun.

291
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,875
[BULMA]
We'll miss you!

292
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,833
Goku, you still think about us
when you're in Other World,

293
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,083
uh, don't you, buddy?

294
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,208
Yeah!

295
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,125
Goku! Nooooo!

296
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,125
[CHICHI sobs]

297
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,125
But, Goku... Goku, how
can you say goodbye?

298
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,041
Now that Gohan has left me too?!

299
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,625
ChiChi, you'll be all right

300
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,875
you still have Goten
to look after you.

301
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:26,500
And what if Majin Buu takes
him away from me like Gohan?

302
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,083
That won't happen!

303
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,125
Once he masters Fusion, Goten
can't possibly lose the fight!

304
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,125
I'll tell Gohan how
much you really miss him

305
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,916
when I see him there.

306
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:42,958
You won't. I know. Gohan is
still alive, I'm sure of it!

307
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,500
Oh? But how?

308
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,625
[VIDEL] I don't know, I just
feel him beating in my heart.

309
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,791
To be young and in love!

310
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:55,166
To be completely irrational.
Boy, I miss those days, a lot.

311
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,708
Your devotion to
him is really great.

312
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,791
Thank you, sir.

313
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,416
Hey, no more goodbyes!
Your time's up.

314
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,750
But--

315
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,750
Huh? What is it, Goten?

316
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,916
Oh, I know!

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,708
You want one last hug from
your father, don't you, Goten?

318
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,041
Oh, of course!

319
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:24,291
Hey, there's nothin' to be
ashamed of, son. It's okay.

320
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,708
Goten, gonna take
care of Mom for me?

321
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Goku, you can't put
it off any longer!

322
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,750
Gotcha.

323
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,000
[GOKU]
I'm proud of you, son.

324
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,541
So long, everybody!

325
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:51,208
[ALL] Goodbye! Bye, Goku!
Nice seeing you, bye!

326
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,875
[GOKU]
Good luck fighting Majin Buu!

327
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,291
I'll see you all
sooner or later!

328
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,083
Ha, where you're going, I hope
it's a bit later than sooner!

329
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:11,916
[ALL]
Goodbye! I miss you!

330
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,166
Buu gonna run out
of things to boom

331
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,041
if strong guys
don't come soon!

332
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,625
[laughs]

333
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,791
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu continues
to ravage the Earth!

334
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,458
But elsewhere, on the
World of the Kais,

335
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,208
deep in the heart
of the universe

336
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,083
plans are being
made to stop him.

Gohan continues his training

338
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,125
with the mighty Z Sword.

339
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,500
Will it be enough to crush
Majin Buu once and for all?

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
