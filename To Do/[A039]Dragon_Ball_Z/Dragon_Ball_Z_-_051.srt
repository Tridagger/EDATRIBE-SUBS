1
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,916
Now what do I do?

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,916
Goku!

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,250
Get outta there!

4
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

5
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,208
Goku took a very wrong turn on
his journey to Planet Namek!

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,875
But as he plummeted into the
fiery heart of a giant star,

7
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,208
it was our hero who
turned up the heat!

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,541
Kaa... Mee...
Haa... Mee... Haaa!

9
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,750
[NARRATOR] With the help of
a powerful Kamehameha Wave,

10
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,166
the ship blasted free
of the star's gravity

11
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
and resumed its
course to Namek!

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,333
It would seem
Goku's intense training

13
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,625
has begun
to pay off...

14
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,666
And he'll need every
ounce of strength

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,875
he can get if he
hopes to face Vegeta!

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,375
The evil Saiyan has
become even more powerful

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,541
since their
last meeting...

18
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,083
And he's only too
happy to show it!

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,541
Bang.

20
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Can nothing
stand in Vegeta's way?

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:06,208

31
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,875
Oh, I see.
Sounds like you guys

32
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,625
had a rough
time out there.

33
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,875
Yeah, I'd say we're
lucky to be alive!

34
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,166
Huh...?

35
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,625
[sighs sadly]

36
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,875
I know it's
not very good,

37
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,500
but you should probably
try to eat something

38
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,166
to get your
strength back.

39
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,375
[BULMA]
Not very good?!

40
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,833
[BULMA growls]

41
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,875
Well, that sure
hasn't stopped you

42
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,375
from stuffing
your fat face.

43
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,458
Would it kill
you to show me

44
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,875
a little appreciation
for once?! Huh?!

45
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,125
I... I wasn't
talking about the food!

46
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,291
I swear! It's the
best I ever had!

47
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,208
[GOHAN laughs]

48
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,416
[KRILLIN] Shut up, Gohan!

49
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
[laughing continues]

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
I'm sure he's just
too upset to eat.

51
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,125
I mean, after
everything that's happened.

52
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:24,208
Please try. It might
make you feel better.

53
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,791
I'm sorry,
but we don't eat.

54
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
We Nameks only
drink water.

55
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,416
Uhh... Really?
But wait a second.

56
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,166
You guys had fields full of
vegetables out by your village.

57
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,500
I saw 'em myself.

58
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,291
The fields you saw
were Ajissa plants.

59
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,666
W-W-Whoa... 
Ajima wha--?

60
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,083
Well, the elders say
that the Planet Namek

61
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,500
used to be a very different
place than it is today.

62
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,166
They say our world was
once lush and beautiful,

63
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
alive with
forests of Ajissa.

64
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,625
But one day, a massive
storm darkened our skies.

65
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,125
Violent winds tore
across the planet,

66
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,166
stripping the Ajissa plants
of their delicate leaves.

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,416
The forests
were destroyed.

68
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,291
In fact,
all life on our planet

69
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,125
was brought to the
brink of extinction.

70
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,125
The Eldest Namek remembers
how the Ajissa plants

71
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,833
brought beauty to our planet,
and helped make the soil rich.

72
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,083
That's why we're trying
to grow more of them.

73
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,416
We hope this will bring our
world back to life.

[GOHAN] Y'know,
I just realized

95
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,416
you haven't told
us your name yet.

96
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,708
I'm sorry.
It's Dende.

97
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,041
And who are you? What
brings you to Planet Namek?

98
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,500
[BOTH] Hmm?!

99
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,083
Whatever that is, 
it's... it's bad!

100
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,541
[BULMA] Hey!
What is it, you guys?

101
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,916
Did they find us?
Is someone coming?

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,916
No. It's a whole
bunch of power levels.

103
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,750
And they're all... fading!

104
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,250
Huh?!

105
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:09,333
It means somewhere out there,
the... Nameks are dying!

106
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,291
[DENDE gasps]

107
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,750
It's... it's Vegeta! He's
attacking one of the villages!

108
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:20,166
That bastard! Those Nameks
never even had a chance!

109
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,791
Why, he's just an
animal, isn't he!

110
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
Yeah, and from
the looks of it,

111
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,166
now he knows how to sense
power levels without a scouter.

112
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,166
So we're stuck. 'Cause if
we try to fly anywhere

113
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,791
he'll find us!

114
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,125
I don't know if he's
working with Frieza or not.

115
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
But if either one of
them gets their hands

116
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,208
on all seven
Dragon Balls,

117
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,041
we're gonna be in
some serious trouble.

118
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:45,500
I don't think anyone'll be
able to stand up to them!

119
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,375
We may not be able to
fight them directly,

120
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,833
but if we can manage to find
just one of the Dragon Balls

121
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,250
and hide it, we can stop
them from making a wish.

122
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,083
[GOHAN] No.
That's not enough.

123
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,250
It won't stop them
from looking for it.

124
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,208
They'll kill every Namek on
this planet until they find it!

Oh no!

00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,333
[KRILLIN] What are
we supposed to do?

128
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,083
I mean, Vegeta on
his own is bad enough.

129
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,125
But... Vegeta and
Frieza together?!

130
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,625
Man, I don't even know
if Goku's strong enough

131
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,291
to fight 'em both.

132
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,750
Dammit!

133
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,333
[KRILLIN] I should've killed
Vegeta when I had the chance!

134

[DENDE] I... I still don't
understand... Who are you?

135
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,666
[BOTH] Huh?

136
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
[DENDE] You seem to
know everything about

137
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,875
the Dragon Balls
and these evil men

138
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,250
who attack my people.

you've come here to help us!

[VEGETA] Hmph.

143
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,833
You killed them...

144
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,666
You savage!
You killed them all!

It's just down to
you and me, old man.

147
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,041
Are you ready to tell me
where the Dragon Ball is yet?

148
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,291
No, I won't do it.
You'll never find it!

[VEGETA laughs]

150
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh, you think
not, do you?

151
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,916
Well, then.
We'll see, won't we?

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,375
Hm?

Don't ever
try to stop me.

[VEGETA chuckles]

157
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,000
I should
have known.

Sitting right out in the
open for all to admire.

159
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,125
This should
do nicely...

[VEGETA laughs]

161
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,500
Frieza can tear this planet
apart looking for that Ball.

162
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,458
But he'll never suspect
it's hidden so close to home.

163
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,750
[VEGETA] So... six of the Dragon
Balls are now accounted for.

164
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,500
Only one
left to find.

165
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,250
It's been
too long.

166
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,083
Dodoria should have
been back by now.

167
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,125
Something must
have happened.

168
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe I'd better
go look for him.

169
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,000
[FRIEZA] Forget him.

170
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,916
If he isn't
capable of dealing

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,875
with two puny pests
and a baby Namek,

172
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,666
then I don't
want him back.

173
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,916
Continue your search for
the last two Dragon Balls.

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,208
[HENCHMAN] But, how will we find

175
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,000
the Namek villages
without our scouters?

176
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,791
We'll have to search
this entire planet!

00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,458
And that's exactly
what we'll do.

178
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,166
Don't worry, Lord Frieza.
We'll find them.

179
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,625
[FRIEZA] I expect nothing
less from you Zarbon.

180
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,625
Now, leave all the
Dragon Balls with me.

181
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,625
I'll wait for you
back at the ship.

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,375
Come to me when you
have the final two.

183
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,625
And do hurry...

184
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,541
I'd like to make my wish
before I die of old age.

185
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,000
[BOTH] Lord.

186
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,333
[ZARBON] I want you to
search in that direction.

187
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,875
If you find
any villages,

188
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,250
note the position and
come get me at once.

189
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,291
Don't try and take on
the Nameks by yourself.

190
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,541
They're way too
strong. Understand?

191
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
Sir.

192
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,250
Otherwise, meet me back at
the spaceship in three hours.

193
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,708
Now, head out!

194
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,208
If Vegeta tries to
interfere with my plans

195
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,750
for getting all
the Dragon Balls,

196
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,583
he will soon
regret it.

197
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,958
I refuse to stop until I've
collected all seven of them.

198
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,333
But I imagine he'll be
on his way sometime soon

199
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,833
to try to steal
these five.

200
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,708
Well, that's fine with me.
I hope he does try it.

201
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,833
He'll just save me the trouble
of having to hunt him down.

202
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

203
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,416
Poor Vegeta has no idea
what he's getting into.

204
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,666
So, I can just
relax at the ship.

205
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,750
Ha!

206
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,375
[KRILLIN] So you see,
we thought if we came

207
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,791
to Kami's
home planet,

208
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
there might be another
set of Dragon Balls here.

209
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,083
We hoped we'd be able
to wish all our friends

210
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,125
that Vegeta and his
partner killed back to life.

211
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,166
That's all we're
trying to do.

212
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,750
Not only that, if
our wish is granted,

213
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,583
it means the Earth's Dragon
Balls will come back, too.

214
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,875
Oh. Thank you for
telling me your story.

215
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,708
So your world has been
terrorized by these men, too.

216
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,166
[DENDE growls]

217
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,416
Then we must fight
them! Together!

218
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,125
And I know
someone who can help.

219
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,791
I must take you to
see the Eldest Namek!

220
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,500
Huh?

221
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,291
And, who's that?

222
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,000
But how can
he help us?

223
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,291
Oh, he is
very wise.

224
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,625
He is the father
of all Nameks!

225
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,375
He alone survived
the terrible storm

226
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
that nearly
destroyed our world.

227
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,125
And he is the one
who is responsible

228
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,208
for repopulating
it so far!

229
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,500
We are all
his children.

230
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,125
I myself am
his 108th child.

231
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
But, um, well...

232
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,791
How exactly did your father
have a child all by himself?

233
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
What do you
mean "how"?

234
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,875
He spit the eggs out
of his mouth, of course.

235
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
Oh, right.
H-How silly of me...

236
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,500
Wait, so what
you're saying is

237
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,916
he is actually a she,
right? A female!

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Female?
What's a female?

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,583
[BULMA] Well, there's
two types of people, right?

240
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,958
Males and females. And
they're... they're different.

241
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,208
So, like for
instance, say...

242
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,833
You have brothers,
and you have sisters!

243
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,541
What?
Different types?

244
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,416
Uh... No...

245
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,916
[BULMA gasps]

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,833
Can you believe this? There's
no different genders here!

247
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,500
They're all one type!
I'm sure glad I'm not a Namek.

248
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,166
Talk about boring!

249
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
'Kay. Anyway...
So you really think

250
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,291
going to see this Eldest
guy'll do us some good?

251
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,458
Yes... But, it's
important that we go quickly.

252
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,125
The ones who
attacked my village

253
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,666
already have five
of the Dragon Balls.

254
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,083
And, if another
village is being attacked

255
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,500
right now,
like you say,

256
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,833
unless the Nameks
can hold them off,

257
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,208
they'll be looking for
the Eldest Namek soon.

258
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:07,166
Sorry, kid.
I think it's all over.

259
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,333
[GOHAN] I'm not sensing
any more power levels.

260
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,875
It doesn't feel like
Vegeta left any survivors.

261
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Oh, no...
If that's true,

262
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,250
then there are only a
few of us left alive now...

263
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,083
Wait a sec... So, if Vegeta
got the sixth Dragon Ball

264
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,458
in that village, and if
there aren't many Nameks

265
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,041
left out there...

266
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,708
Then, does that mean the Eldest
Namek has the last Dragon Ball?

267
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right.

268
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,208
This is bad!

269
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,458
[ALL gasp]

270
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,833
[KRILLIN] It might take
Frieza's goons a while

271
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,041
to find him without
their scouters,

272
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,333
but that won't
stop Vegeta!

273
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,375
If he has any
kind of power,

274
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,625
Vegeta will sense
him from miles away!

275
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,666
For all we know, he could be
on his way there already!

276
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,625
Exactly! And we must warn the
Eldest Namek that he's coming!

277
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,625
Please! Please, you have to
help me! Come with me, please!

278
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,333
It's risky, but I'd say
we'll be in even more danger

279
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,166
if we let Frieza or Vegeta
get that Dragon Ball.

280
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,708
'Kay, let's go. You lead
the way. I'll follow.

281
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,166
Right.

282
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,833
With any luck, this
won't take too long.

283
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,833
But I want you to
wait here with Bulma

284
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,958
until we get
back, okay?

285
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,958
We can't let
Vegeta sense us both!

286
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,708
You're right. It'll be
better if we split up.

287
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,291
See ya! You guys
be extra careful.

288
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,666
You, too! Bye!

289
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,291
[thinking] Vegeta seems
stronger than he's ever been.

290
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,125
And the power I
sensed from Frieza

291
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,916
was even higher than his!

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,666
I don't know what kind of
training Goku's doing, but...

293
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,166
But whether he's strong
enough to beat them or not,

294
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,541
the only thing we can do now
is get the last Dragon Ball

295
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,708
from this Eldest Namek and
hide out for a few days

296
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,000
until he gets here.

297
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,625
Then I guess we just
cross our fingers

298
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,583
and hope we don't
all get creamed.

299
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,625
[KRILLIN thinking]
Ahh, who am I kidding?

300
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,125
I doubt any of us're gonna
make it off this planet!

301
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,708
I'm gonna die here...

302
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,208
And I've never even
had a girlfriend!

303
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:21,666
[GOKU grunting]

304
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,208
[GOKU growls]

305
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:34,291
[GOKU grunting]

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,083
[GOKU] Well, I guess that does
it for twenty-times gravity.

307
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,750
Good, then it's time to
start working on thirty.

308
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,250
[KING KAI]
Goku, can you hear me?

309
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,666
Helloooo...
Come in, Goku...

310
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,208
Hey, I sure hope
that's you, King Kai.

311
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,125
[KING KAI] No, it's the
chair talking to you.

312
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,625
Of course it's me!

313
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,666
How are you, Goku? I had some
trouble tracking you down.

314
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,416
You're moving at a
pretty good clip there

315
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,166
in that spaceship of yours.

316
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
But I guess it means
you're off to Planet Namek

317
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,416
for a little Dragon Ball
hunting, huh? Sounds exciting.

318
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,416
Wait a second...

319
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,041
You mean you
don't know anything

320
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,458
about what's
been going on?

321
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,500
It's a long story, but
there's a whole lot of trouble

322
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,250
waiting for
me on Namek.

323
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,625
You can fill me
in in a minute...

324
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,541
First, I have something
important to tell you.

325
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,333
You see, I've received
some unexpected guests.

326
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,833
[GOKU] Guests? What's the big
deal about having some guests?

327
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,666
[KING KAI] Well for starters,
they got down Snake Way

328
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,541
even faster
than you did!

329
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,583
Let's just say, they're
some pretty strong guys.

330
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:58,333
Stumped? Okay, I'll give you
a hint. There's four of them!

331
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,916
Huh? Four?

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,916
[KING KAI] Yup. Let's also say
you know these guys pretty well.

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,958
[GOKU] No way!
You don't mean...

334
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,833
[KING KAI chuckles]

335
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,083
You guessed it!

336
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,375
They're here, and they
want me to train them

337
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,666
harder than
I trained you!

338
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,125
You gotta be kidding me!
Everyone made it?

339
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,541
They all reached you
together? That's great news!

340
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,416
Hey, can I say
hello to him?

341
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,791
[KING KAI] Of course.
Just rest your hand

342
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,125
on my shoulder and speak.
He'll hear you.

343
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,208
[YAMCHA] What's up, Goku?

344
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,708
[GOKU] Yamcha!

345
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,500
Guess we just missed each
other at the check-in station.

346
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,791
But we saw Kami, and he
told us about this place.

347
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,375
Uh-huh.

348
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,875
[YAMCHA] Anyway, King Kai told
us you guys might try to find

349
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,416
the Dragon Balls
on Planet Namek

350
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,750
so you could
wish us all back.

351
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,625
That's really great, Goku.
You're a good friend.

352
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,750
Thanks, Yamcha.
So, who all's there with you?

353
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,750
What about Piccolo?
Did he make it?

354
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,875
[YAMCHA] Yeah,
he's here alright.

355
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,833
Heh. Like I'd let those
clowns train without me.

356
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:06,916
I don't want them
to start thinking

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,416
they can show me
up or anything.

358
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,666
[GOKU] And you said you ran
into Kami. Is he there, too?

359
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,875
No, not Kami.

360
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,458
He stayed back at the
Check-In Station.

361
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,166
It's Tien
and Chiaotzu!

362
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,708
[GOKU] Chiaotzu? That's
fantastic! How is he?

363
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,541
Is he doing okay?

364
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,166
[YAMCHA] He's doing
just fine, Goku.

365
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
In fact, I almost had
trouble keeping up with him

366
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,000
coming down Snake Way! Heh, heh!

367
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,500
[GOKU] Ha, ha, ha!
All right! Way to go, Chiaotzu!

368
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,458
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

369
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,166
[GOKU] Wow, you guys.
This is great!

370
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,750
You don't know how glad
I am to hear from you!

371
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,583
[NARRATOR] Goku is
certainly relieved to learn

372
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,250
of his friends' safe
arrival on King Kai's planet.

373
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,750
However, still more of
his friends are in danger

374
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,208
on Planet Namek!

375
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,041
Can they escape the watchful
eyes of Vegeta and Frieza?

376
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,416
Don't miss the
next Dragon Ball Z!
