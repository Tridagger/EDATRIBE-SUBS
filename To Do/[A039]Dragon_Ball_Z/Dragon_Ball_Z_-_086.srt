00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,333
the battle between Frieza
and Vegeta raged on

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,083
though it was clear who had
the upper hand in this fight.

4
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,291
[NARRATOR] Grasping
him with his tail,

5
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,750
Frieza took full adventage

6
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,875
of his couterpart's
vulnerable state

7
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,791
and pummeled the Saiyan
prince mercilessly.

8
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:40,416
[blows landing,
VEGETA yelling]

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,708
[NARRATOR] While Gohan,
Piccolo, and Krillin

10
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,666
watched the horror unfold,

11
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,041
Goku sensed the severity
of the situation as well.

12
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,791
Fortunately, Goku's healing
process was complete

13
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,000
and he erupted
from the spacecraft

14
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,416
determined to use his
regenerated power

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,166
to help his friends.

16
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,666
[NARRATOR] But after the
display Frieza has put on,

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,458
will it be enough?

18
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,333
Find out... today!

19
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:22,875

00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:27,541

[GOHAN growls]

25
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,208
Uh...

26
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,916
Ah, but Piccolo...!

27
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,250
[GOKU] Mmmm...

28
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,625
[GOKU] Hm... That's good.
They're close by.

29
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,083
Alrighty, then, this is it.
Just hold on guys!

30
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:44,041

[ALL gasp]

40
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,958
[FRIEZA] My, my...
What do we have here?

41
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,125
A fallen prince. Oh, dear!

42
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:02,000
[VEGETA groans]

43
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,333
[VEGETA yells weakly]

44
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,500
[FRIEZA] It pains me to
see you like this, Vegeta.

45
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,666
I don't know why, but
I still care for you enough

46
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,333
to put you out of your misery.

47
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,791
[VEGETA groans weakly]

48
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,791
Hmm...?

49
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,208
Don't worry.
Everyone gets a turn.

50
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,416
[FRIEZA] Goodnight,
sweet Prince.

51
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,916
[FRIEZA yells]

52
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,875
[FRIEZA] Hmm?

53
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,333
--[PICCOLO] Hn?!
--[KRILLIN] Huh?!

54
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,291
[GOKU] It's okay, guys.
It's really me.

55
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,750
[ALL gasp]

56
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,833
[GOKU] I'm glad to see that
you're all in good health.

57
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,958
This is the first time I've
arrived at the battlefield

58
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,208
that you haven't
been all beat up.

59
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,833
[PICCOLO] Yeah, well, we had a
little help in that department.

60
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,333
It's great to see you again!

61
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,875
I can tell you're
a lot stronger now,

62
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,250
and not just physically.

63
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,875
Hey, Dad! Welcome back!
We missed you!

64
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,041
[KRILLIN] Heh! What do
you think of our new duds?

65
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
Not bad... but I don't
think Master Roshi

66
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,625
or ChiChi would approve.

67
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,833
[GOHAN laughs]

68
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,208
[GOKU] I'm proud of you guys!

69
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,708
Especially of you, Gohan. Leave
the rest to me! It's my turn!

70
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,166
Say what?!

71
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,625
Hm?

72
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,166
Goku, did you get hit in
the head or something?

73
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,750
It's going to take everything
we've got to beat him!

74
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm fine!

75
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,625
[PICCOLO growls]

76
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,125
[GOHAN] I believe in you.

77
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,375
[KRILLIN] Hey, you're
the man, Goku! Do it!

78
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,500
Take care of that big bully!

79
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,625
And be careful. And
watch out for that tail!

80
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,750
[GOKU] Thanks!

81
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
[thinking] He's either
making a huge mistake...

82
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,958
or he's infinitely improved
since I fought him on Earth!

83
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,291
[GOKU] You must be Frieza.
The one responsible

84
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,708
for the horrible
chain of events

85
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,708
that have taken
place on this planet.

86
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,833
The proof is in the pudding,
don't you think? Huh?

87
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,333
Whatever problems
you have with Vegeta,

88
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,666
you can take them
up with me now!

89
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,208
Huh...?

90
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,625
[FRIEZA thinking] I'm sure I've
seen him somewhere before...

91
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,500
Hey, Kakarot...
Looks like you made it...

92
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,583
Kakarot? But that's a
Saiyan name, isn't it?

93
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:36,416
Huh?! Yes... yes...
that's it! Now I remember!

94
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,875
[BARDOCK] Frieza! Show yourself!
We're not scared of you anymore!

95
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,875
[BARDOCK laughs]

96
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,833
That's it. Face the music...

97
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,750
Don't be afraid of him, men!

98
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,375
I'd rather be a free
man in my grave,

99
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,250
than living as his
puppet or his slave!

100
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,666
[SAIYAN troops muttering]

101
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,250
Come on! Let's get to it!

102
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,958
That's it...

103
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,208
Now we're talkin'!

104
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,666
[BARDOCK chuckles]

105
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,208
Here! Have it!

106
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,791
[FRIEZA cackles]

107
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,958
No way!

108
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:49,500
[FRIEZA cackles]

109
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,875
[BARDOCK screams]

110
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:59,416
[screaming continues]

111
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,583
My... son... lives... on...

112
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,583
[BARDOCK screams]

113
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,625
[FRIEZA] Yes, you are a Saiyan.

114
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,333
I was in a skirmish with a
Saiyan who looks just like you.

115
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,708
You're his offspring.

116
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,375
The resemblance between
you is unmistakeable.

117
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,666
I don't care.

118
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,958
Huh?

119
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,791
[thinking] Kakarot's
different than before!

120
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,625
Maybe his last battle
pushed him over the edge!

121
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,166
Maybe he's done it at last...

122
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,458
[VEGETA gasps]

123
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,000
[thinking] A Super Saiyan!

124
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,958
Well, shall we proceed?

125
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,666
Your call...

126
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,583
[FRIEZA grunts]

127
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,083
[FRIEZA gasps]

128
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,500
[GOKU] Haah!

129
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,458
Amazing! I couldn't follow
any of it! How 'bout you?

130
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,916
No...

131
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,166
[thinking] Either my eyes
were playing tricks on me,

132
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,791
or Goku got the best of
him in that little scuffle! 

133
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,208
[FRIEZA] Nice move,
but your shoe came untied.

134
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
[GOKU] I'm not going
to fall for that.

135
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,625
I don't even
have shoe laces!

136
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,708
[FRIEZA] Darn. I guess
you're a little smarter

137
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,625
than the average Saiyan.

138
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,250
[GOKU] Very funny.

139
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

140
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,458
[FRIEZA] Goodness!
No sense of humor.

141
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,583
No! Don't try to block it, Goku!

142
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,791
[KRILLIN] Everybody
hit the dirt!

143
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,958
[GOKU &amp; KRILLIN yell]

144
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,666
You fool! Die!

145
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,333
Hmph!

146
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,750
[FRIEZA growls]

147
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,208
[FRIEZA yells]

148
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,666
[PICCOLO gasps]

00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,583
[FRIEZA continues to yell]

150
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,875
[FRIEZA snarls]

151
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,333
[GOKU] Hyyah!

152
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,500
Huh?!

153
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,166
One hand? Not only
did he block them,

154
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,291
but he was able to aim them
away from his friends.

155
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,916
[VEGETA laughs]

156
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,250
Who would have thought?

157
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,916
A lowly soldier like you,
Kakarot. I commend you.

158
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,541
[GOKU] Hmm.

159
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,250
[VEGETA] Frieza, you fool! You
don't get it, do you?!

160
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,708
Kakarot's not an
ordinary Saiyan!

161
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,166
Kakarot is a Super Saiyan!

162
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,250
[FRIEZA gasps]

163
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,625
[VEGETA] That's right!
You heard me!

164
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,958
If there's a God,
He must be good

165
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,958
for letting me live long
enough to see this day.

166
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,166
[VEGETA laughs]

167
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,791
How great! This is a dream come
true!

168
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,166
To see you...
beaten by a Saiyan!

169
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,750
[VEGETA laughs]

170
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,541
[VEGETA gasps]

171
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,000
Huh?!

172
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,208
Oh, no...

173
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,166
[PICCOLO growls]

174
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:49,041
Enough! Loud mouth. On and
on like a broken record.

175
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,958
[VEGETA whimpers]

176
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,625
Oh, no!

177
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,500
What's your problem?! He was
no threat to you any more!

178
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,916
He couldn't even defend himself!
There's no honor in that!

179
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,666
Huh?!

180
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,166
[FRIEZA] It was the only
way I could shut him up.

181
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,791
He insists on babbling about
that ridiculous legend.

182
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,875
There's no such thing
as a Super Saiyan!

183
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:17,833
[VEGETA grunts]

184
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,208
[VEGETA] Kakarot!
Listen to me...

185
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,291
Don't be so soft! There's no
stinking honor in any of this!

186
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,958
It's just a game! Play to win!
There are... no rules!

187
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,416
[GOKU yells]

188
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
[GOKU] Krillin, no!

189
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,458
You're going to have to get over
your soft-heartedness! Do it!

190
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:47,291
Forget about your feelings! You
have to! They'll get you killed!

191
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,833
They'll get you killed, Kakarot!

192
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:54,125
I can't! I can't change who I
am! Not on the battlefield!

193
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,083
My feelings
are my guide!

194
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,375
Besides, everybody deserves a
chance to change their ways,

195
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,750
just like you had!

196
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:05,458
Fool! You don't... know what
you're dealing... with!

197
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,333
[ALIEN speaking]

198
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,791
[ALIEN screams]

199
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,583
[SAIYAN SOLDIERS laugh]

200
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,041
[ALIEN 2 shouting]

201
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,041
[KING VEGETA chuckles]

202
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,625
[KING VEGETA &amp; VEGETA laugh]

203
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:36,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

204
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:44,041
[KING VEGETA grunts]

205
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,291
[FRIEZA] Long live the King...

206
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,708
[FRIEZA cackles]

207
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:58,416
Oh, my! This is... stupendous!
Wow! What a great show!

208
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,708
Unbelievable! Look at that!

209
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,791
[FRIEZA cackles]

210
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,000
[GOKU] Save your
strength, Vegeta!

211
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:12,916
No! There's more! He killed our
home planet! It... was him!

212
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,708
He's just a corpse and
he's still blabbing.

213
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,166
I'll have to gag him
to shut him up...

214
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,750
Your father! And mine!
The whole planet!

215
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,458
He blew it up! It's true!

216
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,833
No one... survived... but us...

217
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:35,041
Ask him if you want! He'll
tell you! He's proud of it!

218
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,875
Please stop talking, Vegeta!

219
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,083
It's sapping all
of your strength!

220
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:44,000
[VEGETA] No! Listen!
You have to hear this!

221
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,416
We worked so hard for him!

222
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,041
We did everything he
asked of us and more...

223
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:58,000
He took me... from my father...
when I was just a little boy!

224
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,250
He made me do whatever he wanted

225
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,666
and said he would kill
my Father if I didn't!

226
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,208
I did everything he asked,
but he killed him anyway,

227
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,041
along with
everyone else...

228
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,791
[VEGETA sobs]

229
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,500
[VEGETA] He was scared of us!

230
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:17,041
Scared that a Super Saiyan
would be born to rise up

231
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,500
and overthrow him...

232
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,833
A touching story.

233
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:27,625
[VEGETA sobs]

234
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,833
Please... no more.
Save your strength...

235
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:35,291
[VEGETA] Kakarot! Please!
Destroy... Frieza!

236
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,958
He made me what I am...

237
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:44,500
Don't let him do it
to anyone else...

238
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:49,125
Whatever it takes...
stop him... please...

239
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,250
[GOKU] Vegeta...

240
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,625
Wel it's about time.

241
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,833
Saiyans tend to linger
like a bad odor.

242
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,583
[GOKU] Goodbye, Vegeta...

243
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,250
You're not as cold-hearted as
you believed yourself to be.

244
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,000
A heart of stone can't
shed tears like you did.

245
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,708
You must have been holding
them back your whole life...

246
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,250
[GOKU] I'm the only one left...

247
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,791
[GOKU growls]

248
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,791
[GOKU] I think I
understand you now.

249
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,875
You weren't grieving
over your own death

250
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,291
or because our home
planet was destroyed.

251
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,625
You were grieving
because he turned you

252
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,416
into what he wanted you to be.

253
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,041
You never had a chance
to be anything else.

254
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,791
Well, I still respect you.

255
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,333
I know you made a
lot of mistakes...

256
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,000
[GOKU] But now I see that it
wasn't all your fault.

257
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,500
[GOKU] You had the
fiery will of a Saiyan!

258
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:03,458
Please share that with me
now... 'cause I need it.

259
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,041
[GOKU] Thank you for
saving my son's life

260
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,583
and for buying enough time
for me to recuperate.

261
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,291
I'll do my best to
carry out your wish.

262
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:28,000
It's true! Vegeta's right!
You have no honor!

263
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:32,291
For him! And for everyone
else you've destroyed!

264
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,416
[GOKU] I am going to...
finish you!

265
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,625
We'll see about that, won't we?

266
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,916
[NARRATOR} Many have suffered...

267
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,625
And many have perished
at the hands of Frieza!

268
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,625
Can Goku rid the
universe of this evil?

269
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:55,250
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
