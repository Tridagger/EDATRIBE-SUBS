00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,875
The Great Saiyaman,
or rather, Gohan,

3
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,458
entered the ring
with his opponent Kibito.

4
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,083
Gohan's true identity
had been revealed

5
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,208
so there was no sense
hiding it anymore.

6
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,083
But he didn't expect
that all his secrets

7
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,666
would be revealed.

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,750
[KIBITO] Gohan, I am curious to
see your Super Saiyan powers.

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,375
Show them to me!
We may be able to use them!

10
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR]
To everyone's surprise,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,541
Shin stepped forward to
reveal that Gohan

12
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,666
had become a pawn
in a much larger plan.

13
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,583
[SUPREME KAI] You do not
need to worry about Gohan.

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
He will be fine.

15
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,791
But no matter what happens,
I want all of you to promise me

16
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,500
that you'll stay out
of the ring.

17
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,500
Do you understand?

18
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,916
What? No way!

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,500
What do you want with Gohan?

20
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,333
[NARRATOR] This mysterious
message seemed to spell trouble

21
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,875
for Gohan, but when the
Z-Fighters learned that Shin

22
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,708
was none other than
the Supreme Kai himself,

23
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,750
they had no choice
but to obey his request.

24
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,916
Meanwhile, two pairs
of hungry eyes

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,583
closely monitor
Gohan's power, but why?

26
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,458
A conspiracy is brewing,
today on Dragon Ball Z!

27
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
Wanna see me turn
into a Super Saiyan?

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,083
Fine! I'll do it!

29
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,250
Just remember, you asked for it!

30
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,708
Goku, I got a bad
feeling about this...

31
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,916
I think Gohan's in trouble.

32
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Listen, the instant
Gohan transforms,

33
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,208
I'm certain Spopovitch and
Yamu will try to attack him.

34
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,416
[GOKU] Hm?

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
[SUPREME KAI] But as
I've already told you,

36
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,500
you must not try to help him!

37
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,083
I don't know what you're after,

38
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,250
but Gohan can
take care of himself.

39
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,458
He doesn't need
any help from us.

40
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,166
Yes, of course...

41
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,791
What makes you so sure

42
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,375
that those two are
going to attack Gohan?

43
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,375
[SUPREME KAI] Spopovitch
and Yamu are not yet aware

44
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,833
of it, but Gohan is the one
they are searching for...

45
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,666
Don't worry. They don't want
his life--only his energy.

46
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,125
Energy?

47
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,291
[VEGETA grunts]

48
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,750
[VEGETA Hey!

49
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,583
Last chance for requests!

50
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,333
Do you just want to see
a Super Saiyan,

51
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,291
or should I take it up
to the next level?!

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,750
What's that?

53
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,416
There's a level beyond
a Super Saiyan?

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,875
[GOHAN grunts]

55
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:12,291
[GOHAN yells]

Hey, look! Yamu!

64
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,375
[YAMU growls]

65
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,250
All that energy! It's him!

66
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,083
You're kidding!
Is this for real?

67
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,416
Gohan is the Gold Fighter?

68
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,791
Impossible!

69
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:39,166
Ah! He's the Great Saiyaman
AND the Gold Fighter?!

70
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,041
Boy, he sure is
talented, huh?

71
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,791
[Oh wow, uh... he's strong...

72
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:50,375
[CHICHI] That's my boy! See?!
Didn't I tell you?! Huh?!

73
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,625
Now come on, you guys!
Let's hear it for Gohan!

74
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,583
Go, Gohan!

75
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,333
There, now you know
what I can do!

76
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Is this good enough for ya?

77
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,416
What happens now?
Should I start fighting?

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,083
[KIBITO thinking]
What enormous energy...

79
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,041
He is far stronger
than I expected...

80
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,125
[VEGETA] Bah! Gohan had a lot
more power when he fought Cell.

81
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
I think your son has gone soft

82
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,083
in these peaceful times,
Kakarot.

83
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,875
You may be right, but he is
still the strongest fighter

84
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,375
at this tournament.

85
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,125
The only question is,
will it be enough?

86
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,791
[GOKU] Hm?! For what?

87
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
What does he mean?

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,250
[PICCOLO whimpers]

89
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,958
What's the matter?
C'mon, fight me!

90
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
[GOHAN]
What are you waiting for?

91
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,250
A written invitation?

92
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:53,166
Hey, hold on! Golden Boy, there!
I remember seeing that kid

93
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,125
when Mr. Satan
was fighting Cell!

94
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,541
Yeah, man, I think
you're right. It's gotta be him!

95
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,916
Come on! Let's get him!

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
Make sure you hold on
to him and don't let go!

97

Do you understand?

98
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,500
Right!

99
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,041
[SUPREME KAI] There!

100
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,708

They're killing him!

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,541
Trust me... He'll be fine.

109

all of it, Yamu!

over, Gohan... Hold on...

[CHICHI] Hey,
stop that you creeps!

122
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,750
What are you doing to my son?!
Leave him alone!

Let me go! Gohan's
in trouble! He needs help!

127
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,208
Stay here! Gohan
will be fine, Videl.

Gohan is in no danger.

helping him?

All of you stay where you are!

152
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,208
Kibito will take care
of Gohan now.

153
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,875
He has no need
of your assistance.

154
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,125
At least tell us what
you're gonna do with him?

155
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,000
It's time!

156
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,333
I must follow them and find out

157
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,333
where they are taking
Gohan's power!

158
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,666
You're leaving?!

159
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,125
I could use your help...

160
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,250
I understand if feel you
have to stay here...

161
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,750
But I must go.

heck is going on?

00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,666

I was going to ask you...

You're going, too?
Are you crazy?!

167
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,666
I don't think
I have much choice!

168
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,875
The Supreme Kai gave us his word
that Gohan would be okay,

169
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,875
and I believe him!

170
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,958
So, unless I go with him,
I'm never going to know

171
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,583
what's going on around here!

What's she doing?

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,291
She's all fixed!

180
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,500
Sharpner, pinch me so
I know this isn't a dream.

181
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,958
Ow!

182
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,916
I can't say I like it...

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,958
But... if you're going,
then I'm going, too.

184
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Oh, I know I'm
gonna regret this...

185
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,250
All right. Let's do it!

[KRILLIN gasps

187
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,458
Oh, I better tell my wife
where I'm going,

188
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,458
or she'll kill me!

189
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,625
[GOKU] Huh?

190
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,666
[KRILLIN]
I'll catch up with you, Goku!

191

[VEGETA growls]

192
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,916
I know what you're
doing, Kakarot!

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,583
You're trying to skip out on
our next match, aren't you?!

194
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,208
Vegeta... Can't you see

195
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,458
that there's something
more important going on here?

196
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,916
You listen!

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,750
After the next two matches,
we are scheduled to fight!

198
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,708
And you will fight me!

199
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,083
So if you leave, you had better
make sure you come back!

200
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,666
I only entered this stupid
tournament so I could beat you!

201
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,333
Okay, okay!
Take it easy, Vegeta.

202
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,625
I have to go with the
Supreme Kai, but I promise

203
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,833
I'll put you at the top
of my "things to do" list

204
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,166
when I get back.
Just try and relax, will you?

[VEGETA growls]

206
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,708
You forget!

207
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,791
You can only stay for
one day in this world!

208
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,958
I guess that slipped
my mind, but listen,

209
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,166
why don't you come with me?

211
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,083
We're wasting time here!

212
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,541
Okay!

213
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,541
Kibito, will you promise to
take care of Gohan for me?

214
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,041
You have my word.

215
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,583
And as soon as he is healed,
I will follow after you.

216
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,500

will want to do the same...

[VEGETA growls]

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500

220
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,875
[KRILLIN] So you see,
without my help, they're toast!

221
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,916
If your friends
need you, then go.

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,875
But I've got a
tournament to win.

223
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,458
Oh yeah! Right!

224
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,750
Good luck with your match and
I'll see you when I get back!

225
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000

226
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,958
[KRILLIN] So long!

227
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,833
Krillin, you be
careful out there!

[KRILLIN laughs]

229
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,291
[KRILLIN] You got it!

230
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,125
Where did everybody go?

231
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,083
[KIBITO] Quiet.
You must stay still.

233

[FRIAR A]
We'll take it from here.

234
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,375
[KIBITO] No, you will not.

235
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,083
Ah! What?
But he's been stabbed, sir!

242
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,083
[KIBITO thinking] I don't know
how long it will take

243
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,375
for him to regain
his full strength...

244
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,291
He has lost an
enormous amount of energy!

245
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,125
It's hard to believe a single
Earthling can possess

246
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,250
so much pure energy.

247
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,416
It's no wonder they were
so eager to obtain it!

[TRUNKS] What's the deal, Goten?

249
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,375
Did your brother
lose the match or what?

I don't know? He got hurt!

251
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,958
I know... But why did
your dad take off?

00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,583
[GOTEN] Don't know!
I want to go see!

Do you feel better now?

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,041
I feel even stronger
than I was before.

If you come with me,
I'll tell you everything.

where my daughter is?

Yep! I do. She's
right over there, sir!

with you, Gohan?

bad's gonna happen.

you to get hurt.

learn how to do that?!

So she can fly.

should be more strict with her!

I'm glad you decided to come.

And thank you.

Without all of your help,

00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,625
I would not be able
to defeat them!

316
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,375
You need us? To beat those two?

317
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:45,041
No, it's not Spopovitch
and Yamu that concern me...

318
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,000
It's the wizard
controlling them.

319
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,625
[PICCOLO] Huh? A wizard?

320
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,041
[SUPREME KAI] Yes.

321
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Long ago, at a time
when the human race

322
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,083
was still in its infancy
here on Earth...

323
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,750
a powerful wizard from the
distant edge of the universe

324
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,416
named Bibidi,
first appeared...

325
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
With him, he brought a
terrible monster

326
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,000
of his own creation, whose
sole purpose was to detsroy...

327
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,083
The name of that
monster was Majin Buu.

328
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,041
[GOKU] Buu, huh?
So what did this guy do?

329
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,625
[SUPREME KAI] Majin Buu had
no feelings or conscience.

330
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,708
He was designed as an
instrument of fear and terror.

331
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,041
His single desire was to
eliminate all living things.

332
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,500
And he was very good at it!

333
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

334
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,791
[SUPREME KAI] With Majin Buu
under his control,

335
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,333
Bibidi set about the
systematic destruction

336
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,000
of all life in the universe.

337
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,833
Hundreds of planets
were reduced to rubble.

338
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,708
Entire galaxies were
erased from existence.

339
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,666
No force could withstand
his evil power...

340
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,958
[VEGETA thinking]
This Majin Buu sounds like

341
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,958
he would have made
a decent Saiyan...

342
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,708
No, you're wrong Vegeta!

[VEGETA gasps]

344
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,041
There were five Grand
Kais at that time,

345
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,375
each one a thousand times
more powerful

346
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,041
than the one you called Frieza.

347
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,541
When they fought Buu...
only one survived.

[VEGETA growls]

349
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,583
He would have wiped out
your entire Saiyan race

00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,625
with a breath.
Just like so many others...

351
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,291
Whoa! Not good.

352
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,500
[VEGETA thinking]
Why didn't someone tell me

353
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,833
he could read minds?!

354
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,541
In time, Majin Buu
became so powerful

355
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,583
that even Bibidi had
difficulty controlling him.

356
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,583
[GOKU gasps]

357
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
Whenever he needed to rest,

358
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,791
Bibidi used a spell to seal
Majin Buu inside a ball,

359
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,458
where he would lay dormant until
the counter-spell was invoked.

360
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,708
[KIBITO] Bibidi used
this spell to transport

361
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,750
Majin Buu from planet to planet.

362
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
The ball was brought here.

363
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,791
The Earth was intended to be
Majin Buu's next target.

364
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,833
No... That's terrible!

365
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,166
Obviously this action
was prevented,

366
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,333
but the ball that
contains Majin Buu

367
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,625
remains here on Earth
to this day...

368
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,166
Yes... The Supreme Kai
could have destroyed him...

369
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,833
He chose to leave him hidden.

370
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,166
[GOHAN] I don't get it.

371
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,458
Why didn't he destroy him
when he had the chance?

372
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,375
Because Majin Buu is no threat

373
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,083
as long as he is
confined to that ball.

374
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,791
And until now, we thought
Bibidi was the only one

375
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,125
who could release him.

376
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,958
Until now?

377
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,291
It would seem that we
have discovered another...

378
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,000
Bibidi had a son...

379
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,250
He's here on Earth.

380
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,791
Huh?!

381
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,375
Bibidi named his son Babidi.
At any cost we must stop him!

382
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,458
But what is he gonna do?

383
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,875
He intends to continue
his father's work.

384
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,291
He's going to
release Majin Buu!!

385
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,458
[NARRATOR] At last, the
source of Spopovitch and Yamu's

386
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:40,083
inhuman power has been revealed:
the Wizard Babidi!

387
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,166
Who, unless the
Z-Fighters can stop him,

388
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,708
intends to unleash a monster
that will eradicate the Earth!

389
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,500
The Supreme Kai has witnessed
the destructive force

390
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,250
of Majin Buu before...

391
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,083
Can he prevent it from
being released once again?
