1
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,375
Aaah!

2
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,541
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,666
Frieza got a bitter
taste of his own attack!

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,791
Despite Goku's
attempts to warn him,

5
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,125
the enraged Frieza was cut down

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,458
by his own deadly energy disk.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,458
[NARRATOR]
Sliced into pieces,

8
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,875
it seemed like the end
for the fallen tyrant!

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,750
Please... have... mercy!

10
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,250
How many people have begged
for their lives at your feet,

11
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,916
and you killed them anyway?

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,750
Did you show me mercy
when I asked you

13
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,333
to spare my
best friend Krillin?

14
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,416
[NARRATOR] But as
Frieza pleaded for help,

15
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,875
the pure-hearted
Goku couldn't resist,

16
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,625
giving up some of his last
energy to save Frieza's life.

17
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,250
[yells]

18
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,750
[NARRATOR] As the epic match
draws to a close,

19
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,875
will the battle-worn Goku
have time to escape Namek

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
before it explodes?

21
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,750
It's a race against the planet,
on thodays episode...

22
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,333
of Dragon Ball Z!

23
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,458
[wheezing]

24
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,916
[grunts]

25
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,500
[FRIEZA chuckles]

26
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
[FRIEZA] Well, little Saiyan,

27
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,500
since you seem to have
all the answers, tell me this;

28
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:09,041
what do you suppose I'll do,
with this energy?

29
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,125
You told me you could survive
without any air, didn't you?

30
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,083
Then why don't you
go out into space

31
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,208
and just drift for a while!

32
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,125
That way you'll have
plenty of time

33
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,125
to think about your defeat!

34
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,666
[grunts]

35
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,125
[birds chirping]

36
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:43,583
[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN laughing]

37
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,791
Yes, all is well...

38
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,875
[heavy inhale, exhale]

39
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:59,916
[laughing]

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,583
[exhales]

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,958
[GURU moans softly]

42
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:18,333
This day, rich with life.
What a wonderful time to die.

43
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,958
No Guru, you can't die!

44
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,458
[VILLAGERS gasp]

45
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,041
Guru, please don't leave us!

46
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,750
[BOTH] Huh?

47
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,041
[VILLAGERS gasp and murmur]

48
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,416
It is time.

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Please gather
all the villagers here.

50
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,541
[NAMEKIAN A] Yes, of course!

51
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,291
--[CHILD A] Don't go away, Guru!
--[CHILD B] We love you, Guru!

52
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,083
--[CHILD A] Don't go away!
--[CHILD B] Don't leave!

53
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,083
Oh.. You mustn't
be sad, my children.

54
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,375
I have lived a full
and blessed life!

55
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,250
Don't be afraid...

56
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,583
Death is simply
another stage of our life!

57
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:06,000
[murmurs]

58
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,125
They're not here!

59
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,333
What? Who's not here?

60
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,666
We've looked everywhere,
and we can't seem to find

61
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,166
anyone from Guru's village!

62
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,666
But, that can't be!

63
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,208
[VEGETA] Are you talking
about those whiny villagers

64
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,791
I defeated?

65
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,625
I believe the Dragon Balls
brought back everyone

66
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,458
who'd been killed
by Frieza or his henchmen.

67
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,000
Isn't that right?

68
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,250
Well that doesn't
include me. How very sad.

69
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:47,541
[grunts and growls]

70
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,458
Huh?

71
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:16,708
Ah.. The Dragon Balls have
followed me to this place!

72
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,625
They, too, feel the time
is right for me to go!

73
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,333
[coughing]

74
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,416
Guru, we need you now!

75
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,625
Ah... No. You are all so much
stronger than you realize!

76
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,916
[GURU] It is a tough road ahead,
but we are a race of survivors.

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,416
You will make it.

78
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,958
M-Moori.

79
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,958
Uh... yes?

80
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,000
Please.. give me your hand.

81
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,458
[MOORI] Yes..

82
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,291
[VILLAGERS gasp]

83
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,541
You.. are the eldest now.

84
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,916
Please take good care
of all our people!

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,708
[GURU] Soon the Dragon
Balls will sparkle again.

86
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,958
Use them, but use them wisely.

87
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,166
Watch over them.

88
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,583
Guard them like children!

89
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,791
Yes. I--I will try!

90
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,583
You.. will do fine...

91
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
[VILLAGERS gasp and scream]

92
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,166
Oh, Guru! We'll miss you!

93
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,125
[GURU]
Good-bye, my children!

94
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,875
You made me, so very proud!

95
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,250
[murmurs and sobbing]

96
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,041
He really is gone!

97
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,041
[DENDE] Why?

98
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,291
[sniffs]

99
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,333
You helped me become who I am!

100
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,125
[GOHAN] So could
you please, Mr. Guru?

101
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,041
[GURU] So you're Gohan!

102
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,500
Ahh! Let's take a look!

103
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,541
[coughs]

104
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,208
[GURU] I can feel that you have
truly amazing hidden powers.

105
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,458
The strongest I've ever felt!

106
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,708
Quick, you've gotta help!

107
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,375
It's Vegeta!
He's right outside! Uh--

108
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,375
[quavered breathing]

109
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,041
[DENDE exhales nervously]

110
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,416
[groans]

111
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,041
[yells]

112
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:53,791
Farewell, Guru. I swear
I won't let you down!

113
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,458
Huh?

114
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
[NAIL'S VOICE]
Be strong, Dende!

115
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,083
Nail! I just knew
it was true all along!

116
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,375
Piccolo needed your help,
so you fused with him, right?!

117
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,833
[chuckles]

118
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,125
[laughs]

119
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,791
[MOORI] Listen, all of you!

120
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,000
We must be strong
and work together...

121
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,791
...so we can finally realize
Guru's dream of peace

122
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,875
for all Namekians.

123
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,333
It looks like
they're all gonna be okay.

124
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,166
If only Krillin could
have seen this happen.

125
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,250
Yeah. After all that fighting,
he would've really loved

126
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,791
to see everyone
here at peace again.

127
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, why don't you use our
Dragon Balls to wish him back?

128
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,750
Namek's dragon can
revive someone many times.

129
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,333
Hm?

130
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
[DENDE] Sure, if it's
not a natural death!

131
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,375
Then... Then...!

132
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,791
We can wish Krillin
back as soon as

133
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,833
the Namek's Dragon Balls
become active again!

134
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,000
And Chiaotzu!
Chiaotzu's the same way!

135
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,250
We can bring him back too!

136
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,625
Oh my gosh, it's just too good!

137
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,916
[laughing]

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,958
Okay! Did you catch
all that, Dad?

139
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,541
Now you have to come home,
because it's only right that

140
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,250
you be here when
we bring back Krillin!

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,500
[chuckles]

142
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,041
[growls]

143
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,125
[FRIEZA chuckles]

144
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,375
I'm afraid the planet
is about to go boom!

145
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,291
So where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

146
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,375
You know you
can't survive in space!

147
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,000
[chuckles]

148
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,041
Oh, you can run all you want!

149
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,166
But sometimes you have to
meet your problems head on!

150
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,500
Face it, monkey,
you're going to die!

151
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,916
[laughs]

152
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,875
[chuckles]

153
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,250
[FRIEZA] Well aren't you
gonna keep running, monkey?

154
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,916
Aren't ya? [chuckles]

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,875
Like a little circus chimp!

156
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,916
Come one, come all!

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,416
See the spectacular
chimp and amaze!

158
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,125
Where will he run today?

159
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,125
You don't have enough time
to get back to your space ship,

160
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,583
and Vegeta destroyed mine.

161
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

162
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,791
But please, just for my sake,
don't stop running!

163
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,500
It's far too entertaining!

164
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,458
[chuckles]

165
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,791
It's ironic. After all
your heroic efforts...

166
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,083
you're still going to die!

167
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,333
[FRIEZA] And I will live on.

168
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,791
So much for the awesome power
of the legendary Super Saiyan.

169
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,291
Can't even beat a dead planet.

170
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,666
[GOKU] Maybe not. But it was
enough to beat you, Frieza.

171
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,708
[growls, yells]

172
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,250
[GOKU] It's done!

173
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,333
[FRIEZA] What do you mean?

174
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,166
Don't just stand there,
say something!

175
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,833
[GOKU] Your energy is
decreasing with every blow.

176
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,083
You're not even a
challenge to me anymore.

177
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,083
[GOKU] It would be
meaningless to fight you now.

178
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,875
You're too scared and ashamed.

179
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,125
Nothing but a monkey.

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,291
[GOKU] You must be Frieza!

181
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,791
The one responsible for
the horrible chain of events

182
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,833
that have taken place
on this planet.

183
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,208
Hm. The proof is in the
pudding, don't you think, huh?

184
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,375
I don't care if you're a million
times stronger than me, Frieza!

185
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,541
Mark my words! I'm not going
to let my friends down!

186
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,958
So get ready, Frieza,

187
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
because this time
you're going down!

188
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,250

00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,000
[GOKU] Kamehame... ha!

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,125
[FRIEZA groans]

[yells]

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,958
[FRIEZA] Something is
strange about this warrior!

196
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,000
How does a Saiyan have
such incredible power?

197
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,958
They are, after all,
inferior creatures!

198
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,625
[FRIEZA] I've never
met a fighter with

199
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,875
that kind of strength!

200
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,500
[FRIEZA]
I must take him out now!

201
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,916
Prepare for battle!

202
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,750
It is time...

203
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,958
for your demise!

204
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,250
[heavy breathing]

205
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,625
[grunts]

206
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,666
[FRIEZA] It's all over, Saiyan!

207
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,375

[GOKU yells]

209
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,625
Huh?

210
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,583
That's not possible!

211
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:39,833
[FRIEZA groaning]

212

214
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,125
Th-That's impossible!

215
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,208
You made a direct hit
with your Spirit Bomb

216
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
and no one could survive that!

217
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,958
Ah... Mommy...

218
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000

220
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,166
Help me! Aah--

[GOKU grunting]

222
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:48,333
I... won't let you...
get away... with this...!

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,500
I won't let you...

230
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,500
What?!

[FRIEZA breathes heavily]

237
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,958
You!

238
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,125
It's done!

239
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,250
Uh? What are you saying?

240
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,875
You just said it was done!
What does that mean?

241
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,541
Your energy is decreasing
with every blow!

242
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,625
You're not even
a challenge to me anymore!

243
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,333
[GOKU] It wouldn't be fair
for me to keep fighting you.

244
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm satisfied now.

245
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,125
Your pride has been
torn to shreds.

246
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,833
You've challenged and lost to a
fighter who is superior to you,

247
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,375
and to make it worse...

248
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,250
...he was just a monkey, right?

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,791
[GOKU] It would be
meaningless to fight you now.

250
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,458
You're too scared and ashamed!

251
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,833
Live with the shock.

252
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,250
Keep it bottled up
inside you... silently.

253
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:14,708
[FRIEZA grunting]

254
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:27,791
Poor, stupid Saiyan.
You honestly think you've won.

255
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,666
[FRIEZA] Your puny mind
never could understand.

256
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,583
I am Frieza, the most powerful
being in the Universe!

257
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,333
And you are nothing but
a beast; a fragile animal!

258
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:46,333
[FRIEZA] You can't win,
because I am mighty!

259
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,166
And you are not!

260
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,250
[grunts]

261
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
Now learn...

262
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,625
Learn what happens
when you mess...

263
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,208
[FRIEZA] with the most powerful
being in the Universe!

264
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,500
Huh?

265
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,666
You fool!

266

[FRIEZA screams]

270
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,250
[NARRATOR] With one last blow,
it seems that Frieza

271
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,750
has finally been laid to rest!

272
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,375
Indeed, Goku has
saved the Universe

273
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,708
from Frieza's wicked reign!

274
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,000
[NARRATOR] But with Namek's
explosion only moments away,

275
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,541
can Goku save himself?

276
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:49,750

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
