1
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,833
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,750
Frieza was in a cold
stalemate with Goku,

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,125
now a legendary Super Saiyan.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,666
Meanwhile, Dende called
forth the Namekian Dragon

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,500
to wish everyone but Frieza
off of planet Namek,

6
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,000
and on to the Earth.

7
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,666
[NARRATOR] But Goku
wasn't ready to go,

8
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,541
and asked that he be
left on Namek as well.

9
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,625
[NARRATOR] With the planet
about to explode under his feet,

10
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,083
has Goku just sealed his fate?

11
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,833
[GOKU] I've been waiting
for this moment, Frieza!

12
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,916
The moment when you pay
for all the evil deeds

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,583
you've done to us!

14
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,750
A heroic move by Goku,

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,291
or the biggest mistake
of his life?

16
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,541
Stay tuned to find out!

17
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,041
[FRIEZA laughs]

18
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,875
In exactly two minutes you will
be nothing but a pile of ashes.

19
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
Just look how you're trembling.

20
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,416
It's you who should be afraid,

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,458
because your spree
of hatred will end

22
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,416
at the hands of a Saiyan,
like you've always feared!

23
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,916
[FRIEZA growls]

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,666
Your speeches are so poetic,

25
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,291
but I can assure you that
the only things ending

26
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,833
are you and this
ugly planet!

27
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,875
[FRIEZA yells]

28
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,958
[FRIEZA yells]

29
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,083
[GOKU growls]

30
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,708
[KING KAI wails]

31
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,625
[KING KAI] Goku, you're
running out of time!

32
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,041
King Kai, if Goku
beats Frieza soon,

33
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,833
he'll still have time to
escape from Namek

34
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,333
before it blows, right?

35
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,458
Even if Goku is a Super Saiyan,
he still needs air to breathe!

36
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,708
No one can survive in space.

37
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,291
[YAMCHA] But sir, isn't
there something we can do

38
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,750
to save Goku?

39
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,208
Goku has chosen
this way himself...

40
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,000
So... that's it?

41
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
[YAMCHA growls]

42
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,291
Yamcha!

43
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,875
[YAMCHA] Goku!

44
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,166
Goku...

45
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:46,583
[BOTH grunting]

46
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,416
[GOKU yells]

47
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,708
[FRIEZA growls]

48
00:04:51,791 --> 00:05:00,541
[BOTH grunting]

49
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,250
[GOKU yells]

50
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,750
[FRIEZA yells]

51
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:11,208
[GOKU growls]

52
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,125
[FRIEZA growls]

53
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,625
[birds chirping]

54
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,833
[GOHAN] Y-You mean,
Krillin can't be...

55
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,250
According to the powers
of the Earth's Dragon,

56
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,500
any person who has been revived
once cannot be revived again.

57
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,666
No... Krillin...

58
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,083
But guys! What about Goku?
How come he's not here with us?

59
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,583
[GURU] Goku wished for
all on planet Namek

60
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:52,291
to be moved to Earth, except
for Frieza and himself.

61
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,750
Wha--?!

62
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,083
[GOHAN] So my dad is
still fighting Frieza?

63
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,333
Back on-on Namek?

64
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,500
Mm-hmm...

65
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,625
That's awful!

66
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,625
It's gonna explode
any minute from now!

67
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:10,041
Planet Namek's going to explode?
Great Guru, is that true?

68
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,250
[DENDE] No! No! Guru!

69
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,666
There's nothing I can do.

70
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,708
But... our home...

71
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,083
[PICCOLO] It's absurd!

72
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,875
Just what was Goku thinking?!

73
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,625
Even if he does defeat Frieza,

74
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,375
the explosion alone will
be enough to destroy him!

75
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,041
Goku...

76
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,708
You had the chance to escape
from Frieza and join us,

77
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,625
but you chose to die and
make sure Frieza was defeated...

78
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,083
What... honor!

79
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,125
Mr. Piccolo...?

80
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,833
[thinking] Goku...

81
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,250
Our paths have crossed
many times along the way.

82
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,500
[PICCOLO] It was because of you,
that I was even born!

83
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,000
[PICCOLO] From the
very beginning,

84
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,166
when I was
nothing but an egg,

85
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,458
even then I wanted
you destroyed!

86
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,875
I was born hating you!

87
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,666
As a young fighter,

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,416
those tournaments against
you were all that I had,

89
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,583
I lived for the
chance to see you die!

90
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,500
I will never forget our fight

91
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,291
at the World's Martial
Arts Tournament,

92
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,083
Ka... me... ha... me... ha!

93
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,666
[PICCOLO] With my newly learned
ability to increase my size,

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,291
I knew that this would be it!

95
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,916
This would be my
chance to finish you!

96
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,625
[PICCOLO] But still, you
found a way to beat me!

97
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,333
Your power, I'd never
seen anything like it!

98
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,291
[PICCOLO] From that day forward,

99
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,083
I knew there was something
different about you!

100
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,500
Something, not of this world!

101
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,750
[PICCOLO] Goku!

102
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,916
[PICCOLO] And then the
fight with Raditz...

103
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,625
[PICCOLO} I can't say I
objected to destroying you!

104
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,416
After all, It's what I'd been
waiting for my whole life!

105
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,416
[PICCOLO] But as you
lay there, lifeless,

106
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
it just wasn't what
I had imagined...

107
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,791
How could I hate someone

108
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,750
who'd made such an
honorable sacrifice?

109
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,375
Goku... Why did you have
to send me back to Earth?

110
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,291
I wanted to fight
alongside of you!

111
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
It's great to see you again!

112
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,000
I can tell you're alot stronger
now, and not just physically!

113
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,000
[PICCOLO] It's vexing,

114
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,250
but your powers have become
far greater than my own.

115
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,250
And so has your character.

116
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,333
You chose to beat Frieza
at the cost of your own life.

117
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,583
You're always like that.

118
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,708
That's our Goku...

119
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,166
Daddy...!

120
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,500
[VEGETA] I understand
Kakarot's blood!

121
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,958
[GOHAN] Vegeta!

122
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,250
[VEGETA laughs]

123
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,750
Kakarot just can't turn
down a good fight,

124
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,250
it's against his Saiyan nature!

125
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,041
Oh! Why did YOU
have to come back?

126
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,125
Why didn't the dragon leave
out those filthy jerks?!

127
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,666
Now, that wasn't very nice.

128
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,125
[BULMA screams]

129
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,583
That hurt!

130
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,250
[GINYU] Ribbit.

131
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,708
Huh?

132
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,041
And you're here too?

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,875
[GINYU croaks]

134
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,833
Go away!

135
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,291
[GINYU grunts]

136
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,666
[BULMA] I hate that nasty frog!
This is a nightmare!

137
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,958
[VEGETA] Oh, is it?

138
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,666
[BULMA squeals]

139
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,541
[VEGETA] You're all
so foolish to assume

140
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,791
Kakarot would
abandon a good fight!

141
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,375
Because the blood of a Saiyan
flows too strongly in his veins!

142
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,625
And now, as that idiot martyr
is becoming a Super Saiyan,

143
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,166
his hunger for battle
is even greater!

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,250
Nothing will stop Frieza
and Kakarot from fighting,

145
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,416
that is, until Namek explodes

146
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,291
and they both go
out with a bang!

147
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:15,000
[VEGETA laughs]

148
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,666
Don't laugh!

149
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,208
Meanwhile, since I
was revived from death,

150
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,083
I should become even stronger.

151
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,833
And once Kakarot
and Frieza are both

152
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,791
completely out of the picture,
I'll be the most powerful

153
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,208
fighter in the universe!

154
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,666
[GOHAN growls]

155
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,666
You little...!

156
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,750
I must admit this
was unexpected

157
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,541
but that doesn't mean
I won't enjoy it!

158
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:45,375
[VEGETA laughs]

159
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:54,416
[BOTH grunting]

160
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,083
Huh?!

161
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,875
[GOKU grunts]

162
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:06,416
[BOTH grunting]

163
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,666
So now that you and I are
the only Saiyans left,

164
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,666
why don't we have a
little fight to celebrate?

165
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,833
It'll be a perfect
opportunity for me

166
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,500
to test out my new strength.

167
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,625
Just stop talking to me, jerk!

168
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:23,166
I don't wanna have to listen
to your stupid voice anymore!

169
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,708
How in the world can you
think about fighting now,

170
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,833
with Goku risking his
life against Frieza?!

171
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,875
Hey, it was Kakarot's
choice to stay, not mine!

172
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,791
And from now on you're
all going to do exactly

173
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,333
as I tell you to do!

174
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,791
What?!

175
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,583
[FRIEZA growls]

176
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,333
[FRIEZA yells]

177
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,750
[GOKU grunts]

178
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,791
[FRIEZA yells]

179
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,291
[FRIEZA yells]

180
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,625
I'm going to have some more fun
before this place explodes!

181
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,375
I've always been told to
make every second count!

182
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,000
[FRIEZA yells]

183
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,666
Goku is still on Planet Namek.

184
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,875
But that means...

185
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,750
He must get away from there!

186
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,250
[FRIEZA yells]

187
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,708
[GOKU shouts]

188
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,208
[GOKU grunts]

189
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,791
[FRIEZA growls]

190
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,250
[GOKU growls]

191
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,708
Huh...?

192
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,791
[FROG] Ribbit... Ribbit...
Ribbit... Ribbit...

193
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,875
Wait, as I recall there are
Dragon Balls here on Earth,

194
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:55,916
aren't there?

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
So I'll just call
for the Dragon

196
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,916
and make him grant
me immortality!

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Then I can rule the
universe for eternity!

198
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
[PICCOLO] You're too late!

199
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,750
Huh?

200
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,666
[PICCOLO] The Dragon Balls
were used to revive you,

201
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,583
so now they've become
ordinary stones.

202
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,666
It's not your lucky day,
after all. Hah! Too bad!

203
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,291
[VEGETA growls]

204
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,333
In the end the forces
of good will overcome you!

205
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,750
It's too late; your day is done!

206
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,500
Hmph! We'll see!

207
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,833
[BOTH grunting]

208
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,291
[blows landing]

209
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,250
[FRIEZA yells]

210
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,833
[FRIEZA yells]

211
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:43,416
[GOKU grunts]

212
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,416
[grunting continues]

213
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,333
[GOKU yells]

214
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,500
[KING KAI] Goku, you're
in way over your head!

215
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,375
I always told you to
stay away from Frieza!

216
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,791
Why didn't you listen?

217
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,958
[KING KAI grunts]

218
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,833

220
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,666
[FRIEZA growls]

221
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,791
[FRIEZA] Yaah!

222
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,250
[GOKU grunts]

223
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,208
Goku!

224
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,541
[GOKU yells]

225
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:09,000
Go, Goku!
His power is incredible!

226
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,583
Mr. Guru! Please tell us what's
happening on Planet Namek!

227
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,375
[BULMA] Goku's okay, isn't he?

228
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,541
I mean, Frieza can't
beat him, right?!

229
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,875
I'm sorry, but I can
no longer sense

230
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,416
what is happening
on Planet Namek.

231
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,458
No, oh no...

232
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,916
[PICCOLO] Don't worry.

233
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,791
[GOHAN] What do you mean?

234
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,583
[PICCOLO] Goku will be okay.

235
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,125
But how do you know?

236
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,500
[PICCOLO] I know.

237
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,291
[FRIEZA yells]

238
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,458
You're really a Super Saiyan.

239
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,708
I'm glad now that
I've finally met one.

240
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,875
I can see it was quite
an over-rated legend!

241
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,458
My dad...

242
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,250
Goku... please don't die...

243
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,000
Goku!

244
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,708
Daddy!

245
00:21:53,791 --> 00:22:01,958
[blows landing,
grunting]

246
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,541
Only one of us
is leaving alive!

247
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,791
[blows landing,
grunting]

248
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,458
[FRIEZA] Yaah!

249
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,916
[GOKU yells]

250
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,833
[GOKU growls]

251
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,416
[NARRATOR} With only one minute
left before Namek explodes,

252
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,916
can the Super Saiyan Goku defeat

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,583
the mighty Frieza
once and for all?

254
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,291
[NARRATOR] And even if he can,

255
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:47,166
how will Goku escape the
firing Namek in one piece?

256
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,333
On the next Dragon Ball Z!
