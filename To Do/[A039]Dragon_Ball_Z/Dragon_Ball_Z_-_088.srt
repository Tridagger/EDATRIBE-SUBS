1
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,791
it was a narrow escape for
Goku on the planet Namek

3
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,625
after a dreadful
attack from Frieza.

4
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,000
[NARRATOR] Behind the
veil of a smokescreen

5
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,833
Goku made an
important discovery:

6
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,041
He learned that Frieza was
unable to "feel" his whereabouts

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,708
by sensing his power signal.

8
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,500
[NARRATOR] It wasn't
much of a weakness,

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,750
but against an
opponent like Frieza,

10
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,791
opportunities of
advantage are rare.

11
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,916
[NARRATOR] Once again Frieza
fired with amazing power,

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,041
and this time it looked like
he was going to hit his target!

13
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,458
[GOKU grunts]

14
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,000
[NARRATOR] But with sheer
determination and true grit,

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,333
Goku held on to the
immense force of the attack!

16
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,125
[NARRATOR] As he struggled
to contain the energy

17
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,958
pushing against him, the entire
planet began to come apart!

18
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:25,583
[GOKU grunting]

19
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,208
[NARRATOR] After seeing his
attack thwarted by Goku,

20
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,708
Frieza continued his
relentless assault.

21
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,333
Hey! Goku! Look out!

22
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,291
[GOKU] Hey, just what's
your deal anyway, Frieza?

23
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
[NARRATOR]
The battle continues... today!

24
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,625
[CHICHI] Panties, shades,
camera, sushi, coffee...

25
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,750
Alright, I'm ready.

26
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,916
I'll get Gohan and
bring him back myself!

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,041
ChiChi, really. I think
it'd be wise to reconsider.

28
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,541
The planet Namek is certainly
no place for a lady.

29
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,916
He's right!

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,958
Goku can handle things
up there! Have faith in him!

31
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,750
I remember one time
when my poodle was lost.

32
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,750
I know how you feel.

33
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,875
But it all works out in the end.

34
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
It does? Yeah, right...

35
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,458
Not in my lifetime!

36
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,291
But I'm going to
make it work out.

37
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,333
I'm going to Namek
and that's final!

38
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,208
[YAJIROBE] Hey!

39
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,250
[ALL] Huh? Yajirobe!

40
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,416
That's right! In the flesh.

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,875
Korin said to tell you that
Piccolo made it to Namek.

42
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,208
[ALL gasp]

43
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,750
--[CHICHI] What?!
--[ALL] Hmm?

44
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,541
That green guy
with sharp fangs?!

45
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
What's so great about that?!

46
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,458
I think you're all
out of your minds!

47
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,875
That does it! I'm taking off!

48
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,333
[ALL gasp]

49
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,208
--[CHICHI] Let go of me!
--[OX-KING] ChiChi, please!

50
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,625
It's too dangerous!

51
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:14,375
[ALL grunting]

52
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,041
For heaven's sake,
do something!

53
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,708
You're her father,
Ox, think quick!

54
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,166
ChiChi, the
ship's broken!

55
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,958
Remember last time?

56
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,916
[CHICHI] Huh?

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,375
[screaming]

58
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:27,916
[CHICHI sighs]

[CHICHI groans]

61
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,166
[ALL sigh]

62
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,916
Please, you don't have
to bow down before me.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,041
But I will say that I amazed
even myself this time. Yep!

64
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,208
It's not what I did,
but how long it took.

65
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,875
Ladies and gentlemen,
the ship is fixed!

66
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,625
[CHICHI gasps]

67
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,708

[OOLONG &amp; PUAR growl]

70
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,125
What...? What's wrong?

71
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll tell you what's
wrong, you idiot!

72
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,708
You have the sense of a monkey,
that's what's wrong!

73
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,458
Geniuses! You're all alike!

74
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,583
Hm?! Oh, no you don't!

75
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,750
[ROSHI yells]

76
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,833
[ROSHI] Get back here!

77
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,875
So, trying to sneak
out again, huh?!

78
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,166
Well, this time you're
going to face the music!

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,666
This is one battle you're
not going to miss!

80
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,000
[OOLONG] Hey!
She's getting away!

81

--[CHICHI] Hai-yaa!
--[OX-KING] ChiChi, no!

83

[ROSHI] Oww!

84
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Hmm...

85
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,958
I was thinking and something
just occurred to me.

86
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, it makes sense.

87
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,375
You are the one who defeated
the Ginyu Force, not Vegeta.

88
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,083
Yes, YOU killed
Captain Ginyu.

89
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,875
That's right! Well,
not killed! Changed!

90
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,291
He was blue! Now he's green!

91
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,041
[FRIEZA] Heh. Very funny.

92
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,250
[FRIEZA roars]

93
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,708

[FRIEZA] Ah, flushed
down the sewer

106
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,958
like the little
rat that he is.

[FRIEZA] Heh. You can't
fool me. I know better.

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,666
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

111
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,583
[thinking] Man, I've got
to think of something.

112
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm getting nowhere fast!

113
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,625
Hold on, wait a second...

114
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,541
[GOKU] Huh?

115
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,000
[thinking] Yes! He
can't sense where I am!

116
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,708
He has to see me
with his eyes!

117
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,583
That gives me an idea!

118
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,625
[thinking] It's pretty tricky,
but it can be done.

119
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,833
Oh, man! This is just terrible!

120
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,041
I'm afraid Goku may have
overestimated himself!

121
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,375
Not a chance!

122
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,875
My Dad's gonna tear that
guy to shreds, just watch!

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,666
[thinking] Alright! Here goes!

124
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,666
Man, I haven't used this
one in a good while!

125
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:16,041
[thinking] Kaa... Mee...
Haa.. Mee... Haaaa..!

126
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,083
[thinking] Okay... Don't
move... Stay right there...

127
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,916
Oh, come on. Where are you?

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,958
The suspense is
really killing me.

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,250
[thinking] Alright...

130
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,916
So far so good!

Torpedo number one, away!

Huh?! Whoa! How rude.

Man, this guy's
really something else.

153

Well, I've got
to hand it to you.

since I've felt pain.

It's such a strange sensation.

158
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,958
What a rare case he is.

159

Man, is he ticked!

160
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,125
I wouldn't want to be me right
now, but I don't have a choice.

161
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,041
First, I'll have
some fun with him.

00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:20,083
[FRIEZA cackles]

179
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,291
Oh, man! It's as
big as an island!

180
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,875
No way! How can
he do that?

181
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,125
That thing's gigantic!

182
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,583
Whoa!

183
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,458
[FRIEZA chuckles]

184
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,666
Let's see if he
can dodge this one.

185
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,791
[FRIEZA grunts]

186
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,291
[GOHAN] Dad, look out!

187
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,750
[PICCOLO] Goku, no!

188
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:22,291
[GOKU grunts]

189
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,125
[grunting continues]

190
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,791
[FRIEZA giggles]

191
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,708
Here I am!

192
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,750
Ah, no way!

193
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,791
[GOKU grunts]

194
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,083
[FRIEZA chuckles]

195
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,375
[thinking] Rrrrgh! I...
can't... budge!

196
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,000
[GOKU grunts]

197
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,791
Here, let ME help.

198
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
[FRIEZA grunts]

199
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,166
[GOKU yells]

200
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,000
[FRIEZA] Gotcha.

201
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,833
You're lucky
I'm so fast.

202
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,583
This ball will go "Boom!" if
it touches anything but me.

203
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:45,875
[FRIEZA grunts,
GOKU grunts]

204
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,458
[GOKU yells]

205
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,125
[FRIEZA] Going somewhere?

206
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,750
[FRIEZA giggles]

207
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,666
Now for the final swat.

208
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,000
This game's over when
you hear the "Bang".

209
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,166
You fiend!

210
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,375
Don't try
to flatter me.

211
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,083
[GOKU yells]

212
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,125
[KRILLIN grunting]

213
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,625
[GOHAN grunts]

214
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,791
[GOHAN screams]

215
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
Nooo!

216
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,833
[GOHAN screaming]

217
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,875
Thank you, Piccolo!

218
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,125
[KRILLIN gasps]

219
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,208
[PICCOLO grunts]

220
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,416
[GOHAN coughs]

221
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,125
Huh...?

222
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,583
Oh no!

223
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,125
Wow! What power! And he's
still just warming up!

224
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,250
Huh?!

225
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,958
Frieza could destroy
this whole planet

226
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,458
in an instant if he
wanted to, no problem.

227
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,000
He wasn't serious when
he was fighting Goku,

228
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,250
he was just playing.

229
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,583
Piccolo, if what
you're saying is true,

230
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,958
we're in serious trouble...

231
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,625
My Dad's gone...
Isn't he, Piccolo...?

232
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,000
Nah, not by a
long shot, kid.

233
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,375
Your dad was just
playing as well!

234
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,708
[BOTH] Huh?!

235
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,958
Take a look
over there.

236
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,125
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laugh]

237
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,583
[GOHAN] Alright, Dad!

238
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,083
Man! Shoot!

239
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,125
That was too close for comfort!

240
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,125
I can't make any more mistakes
around this guy, he's too good!

241
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,291
[KRILLIN] Right on!

242
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,875
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laugh]

243
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,541
Hmm...?

244
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,416
Amusing little game.

245
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,083
But you're going to have
to find another ball.

246
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,958
How did he do it...?

247
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,708
It's crazy!

248
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,875
He outran the explosion
somehow! That's fast!

249
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,625
It's hard to imagine!

250
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,833
How can they
do all that stuff?

251
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,250
It's... just not normal!

252
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,708
They're monsters...

253
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,958
One good... One evil...

254
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,708
[FRIEZA] I have a
little proposition.

255
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,625
I'd like to ask you
in my native language.

256
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,416
I'm listening.

257
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,041
[FRIEZA speaks in Alien tongue]

258
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,041
It means: "Let's get
down to business."

259
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,458
No more sandbagging.

260
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,583
What d'ya say?

261
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,416
Hmph.

262
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,041
Sounds good! Sure!

263
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,916
[NARRATOR] It seems that
the two super-powers

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,916
were merely toying
with each other

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,166
But now, Goku and
Frieza have agreed

266
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,125
to lay all their cards
on the table and an

267
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,458
all-out battle between
the two warriors is immanent

268
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:53,500
on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
