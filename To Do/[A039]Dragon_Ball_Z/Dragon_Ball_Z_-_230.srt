1
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,666
Vegeta was attacked from
within by Babidi's dark magic,

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
and by the hatred from his past.

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,958
[GOKU]
Vegeta... You didn't...

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,958
[cackles]

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,583
How sad...

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,583
I didn't figure you were weak
enough to be controlled.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,958
[NARRATOR] All the
bitterness, hurt and anger

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,625
that had ruled Vegeta long ago
were brought to the surface.

10
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,750
It conusmed him!

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,666
[NARRATOR] And put him
under Babidi's control.

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,791
In a single, devistating
instant, it was clear.

13
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,958
The Dark Prince had returned.

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,250
The evil that had been
surpressed in Vegeta's heart

15
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,041
for years was once again brought
to life by Babidi's magic.

16
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,208
There could be no negotiation.

17
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,166
Vegeta was beyond
reason, beyond logic.

18
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,833
Only action would prevent him
from causing any further harm.

19
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,708
Realizing this, Goku did the
only thing he could.

20
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,000
[GOKU]
Babidi!

21
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,250
Transport us to a place
away from people!

22
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,958
If you give me that,
then I will fight Vegeta!

23
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,750
[NARRATOR] Goku was playing
right into Babidi's hands.

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,250
But not even the protests
of the Supreme Kai

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,833
could dissuade him from
his course of action.

26
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,166
[NARRATOR] Left with no other
option, the Supreme Kai

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,916
and Gohan descended into
Babidi's ship in the hopes

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,708
of destroying Majin Buu
before he could be returned

29
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,250
to full power.

30
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,125
All of the energy lost by
Goku in the coming struggle

31
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,291
will be absorbed by
the sleeping monster,

32
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,833
and there's sure
to be plenty of it.

33
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,333
Vegeta isn't taking
this fight lightly.

34
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
[VEGETA] You see!
This is our fate. Our battle!

35
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,750
[NARRATOR] The Super Saiyan
showdown is about to begin.

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,916
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

37
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,000
[MR. SATAN]
Uh... Ah... Uh...

38
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,375
Hey, uh... Mister Satan?

39
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,250
I hope you'll understand
if we postpone

40
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,750
your awards ceremony...

41
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,083
Of course.

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,416
After all that's happened,
I think that would be

43
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,750
the right thing to do.

44
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,916
Besides, all the
TV crews have run off.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,416
Okay, we'll reschedule
for later, then.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,875
[MR. SATAN]
Hm.

47
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,833
I guess we should probably
tell the runner-up.

48
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,291
What do you mean?

49
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,583
About the delay, of course.

50
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,500
I think Number 18
will wanna be here

51
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,333
to collect her prize for
second place, don't you?

52
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,208
Uh-- Number 18?!

53
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,416
Wh-uh...

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,500
Uuuh...

55
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,041
What? Are you kidding?

56
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,375
Ha! Of course she'll
wanna be here!

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,000
She worked hard for this
honor. She deserves it!

58
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,125
Not many people
can stand next to me

59
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,416
when I put on my
Championship Belt!

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,791
[laughs]

61
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
[laughs]

62
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,333
[CHICHI]
How could he do this?

63
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,500
I really thought
Vegeta knew better.

64
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't think he'd ever wanna
hurt people like this again.

65
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,791
What kind of an
example is he setting--

66
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,666
[gasps]

67
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,208
You don't think Trunks was...

68
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,291
Goten was with him!

69
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,791
They wouldn't have
been down there...

70
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
Would they?

71
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,250
Vegeta, what happened to you?

72
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,666

What's this?

82
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,500
I thought you said we were
skipping the warm-up!

83
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,541
I guess I was wrong.

Ooh! Look, Dabura!

104

At this rate, Majin Buu
will be at full power

we have to do now

is decide how we're going to
exterminate the Supreme Kai.

We should get 'em, right?

117
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,833
It seems we have a

daring us to come.

It would be a terrible shame
to disappoint him, wouldn't it?

132

Come, Gohan. Let's put
an end to this ordeal.

Phew. That was close.

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,333
Told you not to stop.
Now we'd better hurry!

182

[GOTEN]
Mm!

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,166
[TRUNKS]
Stupid.

184
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,416
Don't know why I'm surprised.

185
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,125

What's the matter?

193
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,416
Not winning as easily
as you thought?

194
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,708
I never said it would be easy.

195
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,708
You won't be winning at all!

196
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,375
What, clown?
Are you feeling angry?

197
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
Humiliated? Is that it?

[VEGETA] Fool! You don't
know what humiliation is!

200
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,875
Don't worry. I will teach you
its bitter taste, just as you...

201
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,375
...have taught me!
Me! A warrior elite!

202
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,500
In my fingertips I hold the
power to destroy entire worlds!

203
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,791
I am a Saiyan
of royal blood,

204
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,791
the last of my kind,
and on my shoulders rests

205

the glory of an
extinct warrior race.

at the sound of my name.

208
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,208
But you didn't,
did you Kakarot?

209
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,291
And at your hands,
your common hands,

210
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,541
my honor and my pride,
the foundations upon which

211
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,125
I have always stood,
began to crumble at my feet.

212
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,666
It was at your hands
that I suffered my first

213
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,833
great humiliation, toppled
by a piece of low-level trash.

214
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,166
[VEGETA] Imagine my added
shame when it was you,

215
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,625
and not me, who avenged our
people by defeating Frieza.

216
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,750
You, who were
the first to achieve

217
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
the pinnacle of our race,

218
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,416
the first in 1,000 years to take
a place among the Super Saiyans

219
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,958
of legend, a place that
I had been raised

220
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,791
to believe was
my royal birthright!

221
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,583
[VEGETA] And imagine
the disgrace I suffered

222
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,833
when the strength I had
worked my whole life

223
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,541
to acquire was surpassed
by a mere child!

224
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,541
Your half-breed son
succeeded where I,

225
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,416
the prince of all
Saiyans had failed!

226
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,708
It is time to take
back what is mine!

227
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,500
I will not live my
life as your second!

228
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,250
That time is over...

229
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,375
Every breath you take
is an assault to my honor.

230
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,250
But no more, Kakarot.

231
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,583
By my hands,

232
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,291

cut down my pride!

This is what we're here to find.

And Majin Buu's inside?

Yes. We must act quickly.

I doubt Babidi and Dabura will
leave it unguarded for long.

If we combine our powers,

269

I will not let you
resurrect Majin Buu.

That's too bad.

I'm sure Dabura
won't like that one bit.

He was so looking forward
to meeting Buu today,

hate to see him upset.

to pass brings Majin Buu

his full power.

may be impossible to win,

they land, they send more

sleeping Majin Buu...
