1
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,666
Faced with the terror of
Frieza and his evil henchmen,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,958
three brave Namekian
warriors stepped up

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,958
to meet
the challenge!

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,541
[NARRATOR] Though
heavily outnumbered,

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,500
the Nameks launched into
battle with all their might...

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,916
Stunning
Frieza's men

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,458
with their unexpected
show of power.

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,208
[NARRATOR] The Nameks moved
with lightning speed

10
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,500
and with their superior
strength and agility,

11
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,375
their enemies found
themselves chasing shadows,

12
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,208
unable to land
a single blow.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,750
And for a time, it seemed
the forces of good

14
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,208
would win the day...

15
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,625
Raaugh!

16
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,166
[yelling]

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,083
Go! Go! Go!

18
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,625
Atta way!

19
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,125
[NARRATOR] But the scene took
a sudden turn for the worse,

20
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
as Frieza ordered his
lieutenant Dodoria

21
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,541
to put an end to the
Namek resistance...

22
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,375
[DODORIA] So do you just want me
to kill one as an example?

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,750
[FRIEZA] Kill them all.

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,041
[NARRATOR]
That's when the Namek Elder

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,041
made a bold,
and desperate move!

26
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,625
The scouters!
I should have known.

27
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,750
That's what
he's aiming for!

28
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,250
[thinking]
That crafty old dog.

29
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, wait a second.

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,458
Why is he just
destroying the scouters?

31
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,041
Think about it!

32
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,833
Without the scouters,
Frieza and his men

33
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,791
won't be able to find the
Nameks or the Dragon Balls!

34
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,666
Even if Frieza gets the Dragon
Ball he's looking for here,

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,041
he's gonna have
a heck of a time

36
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,041
tracking down the next one.
You gotta admire him.

37
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,666
He's risking everything
to protect his people!

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,041
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
the Elder's bravery

39
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,166
in the face of danger

40
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,833
only served to incur
Dodoria's wrath...

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,875
[DODORIA] You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?!

42
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,000
But you're not!

43
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,333
I'll kill
all you Nameks!

44
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,291
[DODORIA] And I'm
gonna start with you!

45
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,333
[DODORIA yells]

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,333
[NARRATOR] Dodoria attacks!
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

47
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:22,916
Raaugh!

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,625
[NAMEKS gasping]

49
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,583
[GOHAN and KRILLIN gasping]

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,500
[ELDER NAMEK grunting]

51
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,833
Elder!

52
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,041
Dodoria!
Not yet!

53
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,666
[FRIEZA] I want
you to eliminate

54
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,875
these three young
warriors first!

55
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,208
[DODORIA yells]

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,416
[DODORIA chuckles menacingly]

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,666
[DODORIA]
All right.

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,125
A little appetizer
before the main course.

59
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,416
[DODORIA chuckling]

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,458
[DODORIA] Now, which one of
you pathetic weaklings

61
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,291
wants to be
first to die?

62
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,250
[NAMEK 1] Don't be ridiculous.
There's three of us!

63
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,750
We have you
outnumbered.

64
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,458
Oh? Don't think you'll
find safety in numbers.

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,083
I can take on
twelve of you.

66
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,541
Huh?!

67
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
Waaugh!

68
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,375
[NAMEK 2 growling]

69
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208
Raaah!

70
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,500
Taah!

71
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,083
[NAMEK 2 screaming]

72
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,791
[DODORIA chuckles]

Raaah!

[DODORIA coughs, chuckles]

82
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,625
Nooo!

83
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:32,291
You're kidding! That didn't
even faze him?! Come on!

84
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,166
[DODORIA yelling]

85
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,125
[NAMEK 3 screams]

[DODORIA chuckling]

91
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,291
[FRIEZA] Heh, heh...

92
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,125
So, do you
finally understand?

93
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,625
As I've tried to explain
to you from the start,

94
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,375
it is impossible for
you to defeat us.

95
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,625
Now, give me
the Dragon Ball!

96
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,666
[MOORI growls]

97
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,291
[FRIEZA] Good. You
can trust me when I say

98
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,458
you've made the
right decision.

99
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
And since you owe us
something in return

100
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,833
for destroying
our scouters,

101
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,208
I think this is more
than an equitable trade,

102
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
don't you agree?

103
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:35,250
[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN whimpering]

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,875
You wretch...
You leave me no choice.

105
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,625
Just promise me you'll
leave us in peace!

106
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,083
[ZARBON] Hmph.

107
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,833
[FRIEZA] Oh,
and don't worry

108
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll keep an eye on the
children until you get back.

109
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,416
[KRILLIN] Rrgh... You got what
you wanted. Enough already!

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,750
[GOHAN growling]

111
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,708
I hate him!

112
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Calm down, Gohan. I told you,
we're just gonna have to wait.

113
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,333
I don't like
it either,

114
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,041
but we aren't gonna do any good
by getting ourselves killed!

115
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,083
[GOHAN growling]

116
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:28,541
[GOKU grunting]

117
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,958
Huh?

118
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,833
[GOKU squealing]

119
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,375
Wah!

120
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,833
[GOKU grunts]

121
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,000
Oww!

122
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,500
Wow, whoever said
"no pain, no gain"

123
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,583
definitely wasn't
kidding! Ow!

124
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,791
Here, now you have what you
came for. Take it and leave!

125
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,250
[FRIEZA] I'll do that.

126
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,708
[FRIEZA] And while I'm deciding
whether or not to kill you,

127
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,916
tell me where to find
the last two Dragon Balls!

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,708
How dare you!
We had an agreement!

129
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,833
Take your Dragon Ball
and leave us as promised!

130
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,458
You'll get nothing
more from me!

131
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,916
[FRIEZA] Hmph.

132
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,416
Go. For the last time,
go now, and leave us in peace!

133
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,166
Oh, shut up.
I promised nothing.

134
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,708
And considering
the circumstances,

135
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,625
I'd hardly say
you're in a position

136
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,625
to be issuing
threats.

137
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,500
Now, tell me what
I want to know,

138
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,958
or I'll beat
it out of you!

139
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,708
How dare you!
Do your worst!

140
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,375
[growling]

141
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,833
Uugh!

142
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN]
Oh, no! Elder!

143
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,250
You monster!
What have you done?!

144
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,250
You can torture
me all you'd like.

145
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,875
It won't do you any good!
I don't know where they are!

146
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,125
One: You're lying.

147
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,041
And two: You've already
hindered my search

148
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,916
by destroying
the scouters.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
Normally, I'd say that's
more than enough reason

150
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,750
to kill you.
But I'm feeling generous.

151
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,958
I'll give you one last
chance to save yourself.

152
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,791
[MOORI] And why
should I trust you?

153
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,541
Why should I believe
the word of a murderer?

154
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,166
[FRIEZA giggles]

155
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,416
Oh well, I guess
you caught me.

156
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,208
I was planning to kill
you even if you talked.

157
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,875
You!

158
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,208
We don't need him.

159
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,708
Even without the scouters,

160
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,375
it shouldn't be too difficult
to find the next village.

161
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
Yes, Zarbon. You must
have read my mind.

163
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,833
Those... scumbags!

Run and get help!

00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,833
Uh-huh!

[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN whimpering]

167
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,500
Alright, then. If it's a
fight you want, so be it!

Don't do it, Gohan!

176
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,125
I'm sorry, but if
we go down there

177
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,791
we'll end up
just like him!

178
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,375
Say something! Cargo!

[MOORI grunts]

181
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,083
Uwaugh!

182
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,250
Aaaah!

183
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,833
Aah!

[FRIEZA giggles]

186
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,833
Ha, ha, ha...

187
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:53,500
That's two Nameks down,
and one more to go.

[screams]

189
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,666

[DODORIA laughs heartily]

192
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,791
What's wrong?
Don't you wanna play, kid?

193
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,500
[GOHAN growling]

194
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,791
[DODORIA] I do!
And I know just the thing:

195
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,291
Play dead!

196
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,083
[GOHAN screaming]

197
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,916
Stop it!!

198
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,125
[KRILLIN]
Gohan! No!

199
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,666
[FRIEZA] Hm?

200
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,125
[ZARBON] Ah!

201
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,125
What the...?
Who's that? Huh?

202
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,250
[GOHAN growling]

203
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,708
Huh?!

204
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,333
Ha! Take that, jerk!

205
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,041
What? Where did
you come from?

206
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,166
[KRILLIN] Well, here we go!

207
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,500
If you want him, you're
gonna have to get through me!

208
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,541
If you insist--

209
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,000
[KRILLIN] Yaah!

210
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,500
[GOHAN] Good one, Krillin!

211
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:38,541
C'mon, Gohan! We gotta
get outta here! Right now!

212
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,000
Move, Gohan!

213
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,000
Zarbon, make
a note, please.

214
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,125
I must find out who
those little rodents are.

215
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,583
Noted.

216
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,916
[DODORIA growling]

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,208
Dodoria, what
are you doing?!

218
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,333
Get off your fat butt
and follow them, now!

219
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,666
[DODORIA yelling]

[DODORIA laughing]

222
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,458
Step on it,
Gohan!

223
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,250
If he catches us, we're
just as good as dead!

224
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,708
Got it!

225
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,833
Okay, so you want to turn
it up a notch, do you?

226
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:56,250
Oh, great! Lumpy's gaining
on us! We're in trouble!

227
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,916
Those two were
fairly strong.

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,875
Whoever they are, I
suspect they're the ones

229
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,541
who took out our
scouts earlier.

230
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,791
And if we're
not careful,

231
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,000
they could cause us even
more trouble. Perhaps--

232
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,833
[FRIEZA] Zarbon...

233
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,375
You disappoint me...

234
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,666
Could it be your faith in my
power is beginning to waver?

235
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,125
[FRIEZA chuckling]

236
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,875
They are just a minor
annoyance, Zarbon.

237
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
Nothing more.

238
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:06,333
[GOKU grunting]

239
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,791

[GOKU squealing]

241
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,375
[DODORIA]
Give it up! It's no use!

242
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,375
You can run but there's
nowhere you can hide!

243
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,666
[DODORIA]
I'm gonna get you!

244
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,833
And when I do,
I'm going to make you pay!

245
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,875
And pay dearly!

246
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,666
[DODORIA laughing]

247
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,000
Ah!

[DODORIA growling]

249
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,500
[DODORIA] Haa!

250
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,958
Heads up!

251
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,375
[DODORIA laughing]

252
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,833

[DODORIA]
Haa, haa, haa, haa!

254
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,125
[KRILLIN] Aargh!

255
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,291
Uh?! Oh, no!

256
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,041
Ah-Aaah!

00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,041

[KRILLIN gasps]

259
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,208
[KRILLIN] Let go!

[DODORIA laughing]

261
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,958

[DODORIA groaning]

263
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,458
I'm not
gonna make it!

[KRILLIN sighs]

265
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:11,750
Gohan! Get going!
He's closing in and fast!

266
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,416
Haah!

267
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,625
[BOTH] Huh?!

268
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,833
They're quick! Just makes
killing 'em all the more fun.

[GOHAN screams]

270
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,291
Hey, Krillin! Don't look now,
but he's right behind us!

271
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,250
Never mind!
Just keep going

272
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,500
as fast as you can!

273
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,416
Our only hope is if we
can outrun him somehow!

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,083

275
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,791
[DODORIA laughing]

276
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,291
Man! He's still gaining
and I'm out of ideas...

277
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,250
Wait! No,
I'm not! Gohan!

278
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,791
Listen! Whatever
happens, just keep going!

279
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,125
Don't look back!

280
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,666
I think I might have a
way to slow this guy down!

281
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,125
Okay!

282
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,250
Hmm...?

[KRILLIN grunting]

284
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,208
[KRILLIN] Alright,
big guy! Watch the birdie!

285
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,750
Solar Flaaaare!

[DODORIA grunting]

287
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:39,666
[DODORIA] My eyes! My eyes!
What have you done to my eyes?!

288
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,541
Whadda you know?
It actually worked!

289
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,166
[DODORIA] I'll get you
for this! I swear it!

290
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,291
[DODORIA groaning]

291
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,541
C'mon, Gohan! Hurry!
Now's our chance!

292
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:04,750
[groaning]

293
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,541
Where...
Where are they?!

294
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,041
If those little twerps
think they can outrun me,

295
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,958
they've got another
thing coming.

296
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,541
And when I get my 
hands on them,

297
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,958
they're gonna lose a
lot more than their eyes!

298
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,208
Do you hear me?!
I'm gonna tear you apart!

299
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,375
I'm gonna rip
you to pieces!

300
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,291
And I'm gonna love
every minute of it!

301
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,291
[DODORIA growls frustratedly]

302
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,833
[KRILLIN chuckling]

303
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,833
That was great, Krillin!
Where'd you learn that?

304
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,458
Oh, uh, it's just a little
trick I picked up from Tien.

305
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,125
[DODORIA growling]

306
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:05,041
[growling continues]

307
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,541
[GOHAN] Shhh!

308
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,166
I thought so...

309
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,333
Without his scouter, he
doesn't know how to find us!

310
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:24,083
[DODORIA growling]

311
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,208
[NARRATOR] Have Krillin's
surprise escape tactics

312
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,166
actually succeeded in throwing
Dodoria off their trail?

313
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,166
For now,
he can only hope,

314
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,541
for as he has seen too
many times already,

315
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:38,041
the brunt of Dodoria's
anger can be deadly...

316
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,291
The tension mounts
for our heroes,

317
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,541
as Dodoria circles
high above.

318
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,625
And the slightest sound,
the smallest false step,

319
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,458
could bring the full
weight of his wrath

320
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
crashing down upon them!

321
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
Don't look up!
There's danger in the skies!

322
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,375
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
