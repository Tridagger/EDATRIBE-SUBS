[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,583
Babidi and Dabura
took a major step

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,000
toward reviving the
terrible Majin Buu.

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,833
But when the wizard realized
he still had only half

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,250
the pure energy he needed to
awaken his sleeping monster,

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,666
he sent his henchmen to
gather the rest.

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
this would prove to be

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,500
a difficult task indeed.

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,375
Something PuiPui found
out the hard way!

10
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,583
[NARRATOR] And when the
light-eating monster Yakon

11
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,833
tried to rob Goku of his
Super-Saiyan power,

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,625
Goku gave the beast a little
more than he bargained for...

Babidi's back is to the wall.

21
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,375
Fortunately for him, he's still
got Dabura on his side.

22
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,125
The demon king has retired to
his mediation chamber

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,250

fierce fighting spirit.

25

No, make that three!

33
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,833

Dabura is going to rid me
of those annoying intruders,

but first I must have
their energy

215
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,208
so I can feed it to Majin Buu.

He's the perfect choice to
handle all the dirty work.

[DABURA laughs]

219
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,750

he concentrates his evil spirit

220
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,333
in that meditation room,
the easier it will be for me

221

Mighty Mask has gotten up again!

This is a perseverance
he's not shown

at any of his previous
Tournament appearances!

252
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,208
It's hard to think of this
as a Battle Royale anymore...

253

we're gonna win.
