1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,166
Frieza fired an attack that
seemed to pass by everyone...

3
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,833
[NARRATOR] Everyone
except the one person

4
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,333
who couldn't be
healed by Dende...

5
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,166
[NARRATOR] Dende himself...

6
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,000
Enraged by the loss
of their friend, Gohan...

7
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,041
...Krillin...

8
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,125
...and Piccolo...

9
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,375
...go three-on-one
with the evil Frieza.

10
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,416
A move that almost
lands Gohan in trouble.

11
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
[NARRATOR] Surprisingly,
Vegeta stepped in

12
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,291
and saved the young boy.

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,166
[NARRATOR} Then launced
an attack of his own.

14
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,666
You're making me mad!

15
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,291
[NARRATOR] Fueled by the idea
of becoming a Super Sayian,

16
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,000
Vegeta tried his hand at
defeating the maniacal Frieza.

17
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,000
Things were looking good, but
Frieza's immense power and speed

18
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,625
were too much to handle,
and left Vegeta puzzled

19
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,833
over his inability to
strike his nemesis.

20
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,083
That's impossible!

21
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,541
I guess you're... not a
"Super Saiyan", are you?

22
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,916
[NARRATOR] Does Vegeta have
the power to destroy Frieza?

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,125
Find out today!

24
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,708
[VEGETA thinking]
How can I beat Frieza?!

25
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,291
I've used all of my best moves!

26
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

27
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,541
[VEGETA roars]

28
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,166
Here I come!

29
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,083
[VEGETA growls]

30
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,458
[VEGETA] Hyaah!

31
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,916
Huh?!

32
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
Where'd he go?!

33
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,416
[thinking] He's so darn fast!

34
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,333
I don't believe it!

35
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,833
It looks like Frieza's
too much for Vegeta!

36
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
I think you're right.

37
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,041
[FRIEZA] Vegeta,
face it, to fight with me

38
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,458
is futile and useless.

39
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,250
Just wake up. You're
blind and delusional.

40
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,000
[VEGETA gasps]

41
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,750
You keep going on about
being a Super Sayian.

42
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,458
But it's just a myth, Vegeta.

43
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,916
I've never seen one.
Have you? You're such a chump.

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,666
[FRIEZA giggles]

45
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,458
[VEGETA gasps]

46
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Such an ego...

47
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,750
You really believe all that?
A "Super Saiyan".

48
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,791
I must say, somebody
has some high hopes.

49
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,583
[VEGETA whimpers]

50
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,666
[thinking] Oh no!
What if he's right?!

51
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,333
What if I'm not
a Super Saiyan?!

52
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,666
That would mean I don't stand
a chance against Frieza!

53
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,208
And that means I'm
pretty much... dead!

54
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,208
Blast it! It can't be true!

55
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,916
What's he doing?

56
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,583
No, this just isn't possible!

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,166
Huh?

58
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,000
[VEGETA] You're wrong!

59
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,000
I am a Super Saiyan!

60
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,708
[VEGETA growls]

61
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,583
[VEGETA] Ryaaagh!

62
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,041
[gasping]

63
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,125
[VEGETA giggles]

64
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,083
[FRIEZA] Idiot.

65
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,625
[VEGETA gasps]

66
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,083
Wha--?!

00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,375
Haah! Haah! Haah! Haah!

00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,833
Haah! Haah! Haah! Haah!

70
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,833
Haah! Haah! Haah! Haah!

[GOHAN yells]

73
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,208
Go for it, Vegeta!

74
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,833
[GOHAN whimpers]

75
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,291

[PICCOLO gasps]

77
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,291
[KRILLIN] Hey--! Whoa!

78
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,500
[VEGETA screams]

79
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,125
[VEGETA] Raaagh!

80
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,291
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN grunt]

81
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,541
[PICCOLO thinking]
Vegeta's aim is bang on,

82
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,666
but everytime he shoots, Frieza
anticipates his every move!

83
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,250
[thinking] It's only
a matter of time

84
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,333
before Frieza goes on the
offensive and finishes Vegeta.

85
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,125
[KRILLIN] Piccolo
looks worried...

86
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,083
Hey, Piccolo!

87
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,791
What's going on?

88
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,500
[PICCOLO] Quiet!

89
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,583
[BOTH] Huh...?

90
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,333
Huh! Haah! Haah! Haah!
Huh! Raah! Haah!

[VEGETA] I'm not
done with you!

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,375
That's it!

[VEGETA yells]

99
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,208
I'll show you, Frieza!

100
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,958
Feel my Super Saiyan wrath!

[VEGETA yells]

102
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,333

to do, destroy us all?!

Huh...? Huh?!

00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,583
Aah--!

[VEGETA whimpers]

109
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,291
I should go...

110
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,166
I've wasted enough of my time
playing around with you.

111
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,666
Uh... guys...?

112
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,708
I-I don't...

113
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,250
Frieza defended himself with
just one... one simple kick!

114
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,166
[KRILLIN] And that's
not the worst of it.

115
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,791
Looks like Vegeta's power
is pretty much done for!

116
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:43,083
[GOHAN] This is terrible!
This is all just terrible!

117
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:48,166
But before I depart... One
final piece du'resistance!

118
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,708
Don't worry... The pain
will subside after a while.

119
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,250
Ready?

120
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,625
[thinking] Oh my! I fear Vegeta
has exhausted all of his power.

121
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,166
He fought a brave battle,
but this is awful...

122
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,125
[KING KAI thinking]
Despite all the attacks,

123
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,291
Frieza isn't even winded!
Poor Vegeta. How sad.

124
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,375
I sense he too realizes
that his fate lies

125
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,666
in the hands of the icy tyrant.

126
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,583
[KING KAI thinking] Now it is
only a matter of time before

127
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,916
the ruthless Saiyan prince
meets his demise.

128
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,416
All things come around,

129
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,541
and Vegeta's treachery is
about to be paid back tenfold.

130
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,333
Well, then... Shall we begin?

We can't help Vegeta now.

00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:54,000
Vegeta... I must say I'm
very disappointed in you.

00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,291
After all that "Super Saiyan"
garbage you were spouting.

141
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,166
But I thought I should
give you a sporting chance.

143
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,375
There you go... I
was just checking

144

your reflexes and
they seem to be fine.

145
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,666

to be sure, shall we?

While you did put
up a good fight,

148
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,875
the bottom line, Vegeta,
is you are just as stupid

149
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,333
as those other half-wits!

Now it looks as though all
hope to defeat Frieza is lost...

losing his battle against...
