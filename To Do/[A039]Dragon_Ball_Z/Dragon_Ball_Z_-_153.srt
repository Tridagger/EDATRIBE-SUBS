00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,666
our heroes' worst
fears were realized

3
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,833
when Cell absorbed Android 17
into his being.

4
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,125
Fueled by this union,

5
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,541
Cell underwent a mighty
transformation,

6
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:38,708
moving him one step closer to
his final terrifying form.

7
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,333
[CELL] Ahh, yes!
This is much nicer!

8
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,875
How exhilarating!

9
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,166
[NARRATOR] The reformed Cell
was certainly a sight to behold.

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,250
But what sort of
horrifying new power

11
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,375
accompanied this shocking
new appearance?

12
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,791
[CELL] Ah, a new look! 
Much more comely than the last!

13
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,166
Merging with 18 should
have a similar effect.

14
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,333
[CELL] I can't wait!

15
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,333
[CELL chuckles]

16
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,583
[NARRATOR]
Bulging in his new body,

17
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,375
Cell was able to quickly
overcome the ox-like 16.

18
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,791
[ANDROID 18]
Look what you've done.

19
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,208
You're a monster!

20
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,416
[NARRATOR]
It seemed no one could stop Cell

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,375
from absorbing Android 18
and reaching his completion.

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,041
[CELL]
My dear android,

23
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,916
when will you understand
that you belong to me?

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,041
[NARRATOR]
Then, in a daredevil move,

25
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,083
Tien ambushed Cell
with a bold new attack!

26
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,041
But how long can he keep it up?!

He's strong...
But Cell is stronger.

62
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,625
Tien will not be able
to last much longer.

His life force is slipping away.

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,875
He must stop.

65
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:40,166
Or, the next energy blast
he fires could be his last!

Yeah, I'm worried about Tien.

[CHIAOTZU] I'm worried
about him too, Yamcha.

Tien is on his own right now.

Shame on you!
You can't give up.

You know Goku would
never do a thing like that.

When he and Gohan
finish their training,

But if you get involved now,

181
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,083
Well, that will be the last time
that they will get away from me!

182
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,291
I'll deal with them soon,
but finding Android 18

183
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,791
is much more important
to me right now.

184
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,708
[GOHAN]
Piccolo!

185
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,166
[GOHAN] Are they okay, Dad?

186
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,416
Yes, Son, but they both
need a Senzu bean right away!

187
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,875
[GOHAN]
Okay!

188
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,458
Huh?

189
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,250
I wonder what that is...

190
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,041
Hey, it's Bulma!

191
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,666
[BABY TRUNKS babbles]

192
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,083
What? What is it, Trunks?
Are you hungry?

193
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,916
Krill-oo! Krill-oo!

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,375
What? Krillin?

195
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,333
Where? I-I don't see him yet.

196
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,833
[KRILLIN laughing]

197
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,291
[BULMA gasps]

198
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,833
That's him alright!

199
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,291
Yay, Trunks! Good call!
What a smart boy you are!

200
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,291
You're a real genius,
just like your mom!

201
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,125
Okay. Should we see
what he wants, huh?

202
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,291
[KRILLIN]
Hey, Bulma!

203
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,041
Listen, I really need
that remote control

204
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,291
to stop those androids, okay?

205
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,666
[BULMA] Sure, Krillin.
But be careful.

206
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,583
I put a lot of work into it.

207
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,666
Wow. So this little
thing will stop them, huh?

208
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,666
Now you'll have to get within
10 meters of the androids

209
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
to be in range.

210
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,375
Any farther away
and it won't work.

211
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,875
Huh? Uh... 10 meters?

212
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,083
[KRILLIN gulps]

213
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,375
Gee, don't you think
that's kind of close?

214
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,916
Don't complain! You're lucky
you have that thing at all!

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,750
Uh... yeah, of course.

216
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,625
I'll try to keep that in mind.

217
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,208
[BULMA]
Well, you better!

218
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,708
[KRILLIN]
Hey, what have you got there?

219
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,791
I got everyone a combat
suit just like Vegeta's.

220
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,291
This one is for you.

221
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,958
It's very comfortable.
And of course, durable!

222
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,500
[KRILLIN] Thanks, Bulma,
We're gonna need those.

223
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
Hey, Goku, Gohan,
Trunks, and Vegeta

224
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,750
are training at Kami's
place right now.

225
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,291
Could you take
their suits to them?

226
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,458
[BULMA]
Kami's place?

227
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,000
Wow! That's above
Korin's Tower isn't it?

228
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,333
[KRILLIN] Yeah, that's right.
Think you can do it?

229
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,375
Okay! I'll go to Kami's.

230
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,208
But you take that remote

231
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,708
and shut down those
androids for good!

232
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,541
Sure thing.

233
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,666
[BULMA] Okay... Say "bye-bye"
to Krillin, little Trunks!

234
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,541
[BABY TRUNKS babbles]

235
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,791
Adios, little guy.

236
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:26,625
[KRILLIN laughs]

237
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,333
[KRILLIN chuckles]

238
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,125
[KRILLIN thinking]
Guess it's in my hands now...

239
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,000
I hope this thing works.

240
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,125
[CELL growls]

241
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:17,416
So, they think they have
escaped me? They are mistaken.

242
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,208
[ANDROID 18] 17...
I can't believe you're gone...

243
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,708
I guess those Senzu beans
did the trick.

244
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,541
You look like you're
feeling a lot better.

245
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,333
You bet! And I thought
I was gone for good this time.

246
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,375
Next time, Tien, don't try
to do everything by yourself!

247
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,125
You had us all really
worried about you, Tien.

248
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,458
But that was really cool
how you stopped Cell

249
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,458
from absorbing
that other android!

250
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,166
I don't know if I
could have done that.

251
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,083
[PICCOLO] It was
an honorable move, Tien.

252
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,041
But let's remember:
it still wasn't enough!

253
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,791
It's going to take a force
much stronger than all of us

254
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,208
to defeat Cell now!

255
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,916
Think about it.

256
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,416
Not one of us...
can take that guy down.

257
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,083
Not even you, Goku...

258
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,500
We're going to need
something... more...

259
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
[MR. POPO]
Goku!

260
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,458
Huh?

261
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,041
Come quick!

262
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,166
Vegeta and Trunks are coming out
of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber!

263
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,666
'Bout time!

264
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,750
[MR. POPO]
I heard strange sounds

265
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,291
coming from inside the chamber.

266
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,166
I believe their time is up!

267
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,750
[NARRATOR] At long last,
the moment of truth has arrived!

268
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,291
After a year of unseen training,

269
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,333
Trunks and Vegeta have emerged

270
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,416
from the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber!

271
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,916
But do these hardened
Saiyans possess the strength

272
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,625
necessary to defeat
the most terrible villain

273
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,833
ever to threaten the Earth?

274
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,708
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next explosive episode

275
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,416
of Dragon Ball Z!
