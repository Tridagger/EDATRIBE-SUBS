00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,416
Cell was about to absorb
Android 17 into his being

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,916
when Android 16
lodged a silent complaint.

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Like a raging bull,

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,375
the strong, silent Android
charged into battle

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,291
and attacked Cell
with all he had.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,625
It was soon evident
that Android 16

8
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,958
was every bit as strong as Cell.

9
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,375
Leaving nothing to chance,

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,958
the giant Android proceeded
to rip off Cell's tail,

11
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,291
ensuring that the
greedy monster could never

12
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,250
absorb another life
into his being again!

[CELL screams]

15
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,875
[NARRATOR] But
Cell had other plans,

16
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,458
and he would not be deterred

17
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,208
from completing his
deadly evolution so easily.

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,750
A little tail regeneration,
and he was back in business.

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,791
[ANDROID 16] Hmm?

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,958
[CELL chuckles]

21
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,458
[CELL] Since some
of Piccolo's cells

22
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,291
comprise my cellular structure,

23
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,375
I, too, have the ability
to regenerate my body!

24
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,541
[NARRATOR]
The epic battle continues...

25
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,458
...today on Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,041

Full regeneration?

27
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,208
How can you beat a
creature like that?!

28
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,333
[thinking] He's hideous.
I could never be a part of that!

29
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,958
[thinking]
He's just too much...

30
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,875
[CELL]
A valiant effort, my friend,

31
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,875
but just a minor
inconvenience to me.

[CELL chuckles]

33
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,708
I thought I had the
solution, but I did not.

34
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,708
You are bound to have a
weak point somewhere, though!

35
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,916
Really now? We'll see.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,416
This time I'll
rip off your head!

So much for that strategy...

00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
Now, do you have
any other tricks,

44
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,208
or can I get
on with my work?

What's he doing over there?

66
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,458
So much for the plan!
Aw, man! Now what?

67
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,416
I can't go over there now.
Not without the remote.

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,166
Sorry, Tien.
I've got to find Bulma first!

Wow! That's strange!

70
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,083
Cell's energy signal
just took a nose-dive!

00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Yeah, I felt it,
too, Dad. Is he losing?

72
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,083
[GOKU] It doesn't seem
possible, but somebody seems

00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,500
to have the upper
hand on him right now.

hold on a little longer!

I told you to leave this place!

00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,333
Hey, you squashed the bug. What
is there to be afraid of now?

82
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,083
That attack was not
enough to finish Cell!

83
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,500
It is imperative you run
from this place immediately!

You, too, 17!

00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,875
Don't give Cell the
chance to absorb you!

Don't worry.

00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,958
[ANDROID 17 (CELL)]
Hey, 18, what's up? Don't worry.

178
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,083
It's me, 17.

179
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,875
Huh?

180
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,333
What's the deal?
You're scared, huh?

181
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,458
Don't worry, look. I'm fine.

182
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,708
I know that it's hard
to understand, but we were

183
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,125
meant to be together
as part of Cell.

184
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Once you join us,
it will all become clear.

185
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,416
Join you? Are you sure?

186
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
[ANDROID 17 (CELL)] 18! Would I
ever do anything to hurt you?

187
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,125
Don't listen to him!
That's not 17!

188
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
Cell is using
his voice to trick you!

189
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,250
[CELL]
Be quiet, you fool!

190
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,125
You only have half a brain left!

191
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,833
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

192
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,708
Please continue, 17.

193
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,666
You do whatever you want, 18...

194
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,250
But doesn't it make
sense to do as Dr. Gero

195
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,083
intended and become one
ultimate being above all others?

196
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,875
It's what we were made for!

197
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,208
There is no higher
purpose for us!

198
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,250
I'm not buying it!
That's not 17!

199
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,750
17 loved
the person he was.

200
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
This life was a
fascinating game to him.

201
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,833
And he wouldn't trade
it for anything!

202
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,416
Especially not to
be a part of you!

203
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,291
You fool, you're mine
whether you like it or not.

204
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
So just accept it.

205
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,291
[CELL] Go ahead and try! But how
many seconds will you need?

206
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,125
At least a few to
gather energy for the blast!

207
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,041
But I will stop
you before then!

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,583
All I need is a
second to get to you,

209
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,833
but you'll need at least a
handful to get the job done!

210
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,041
[CELL chuckles]

211
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,500
Add it up.

212
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,625
[CELL] Come to me.

213
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,208
[ANDROID 16 groans]

214
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,958
No!

215
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,958
[ANDROID 18 growls]

216
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,125
Huh?

217
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,541
What does that no count
think he's doing?

218
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,666
[TIEN] I'm doing the only right
thing... I'm stopping you.

219
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,833
You fool! You've seen, you
know you're no match for me!

220
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,125
[TIEN] I might be just a pothole
in the road to you, big guy!

221
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,125
But it's going to be
one heck of a deep pothole!

222
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
Take this, you!

223
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,291
[TIEN yells]

224
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,500
[TIEN] Tri-Beam! Haaa!

225
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,833
[ANDROID 18 grunts,
CELL yells]

226
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,083
Oh, no!

227
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,125
Tien just jumped in, didn't he?!

228
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,541
We had a plan!

229
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,250
He's not even supposed to
be there! What's the deal?

230
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,250
[ANDROID 16]
18... Are you okay?

231
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,250
[ANDROID 18]
I'm fine, I think.

232
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,625
[TIEN]
There you go, Cell!

233
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,416
A little greeting
from the "No Count"!

234
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,500
[TIEN] Alright, big guy! I know
you're down there somewhere!

235
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,500
And I'll bet you're
raging mad, aren't you?

236
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,208
Oh boy, Tien! You've
really done it this time!

237
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,041
Why are you still here?!
Get out of here right now!

238
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,958

[CELL grunts]

241
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,708
Can you fly?

242
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,250
I will try to.

243
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,500

244
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,625

[CELL grunting]

249
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,125
He's putting out
too much energy!

250
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,625
Darn it!
What's he doing?!

251
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,125
He knows that he can't
sustain an effort like that!

252
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,625
We're gonna lose him!

253
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,166

254
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,916

255
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,791
[ANDROID 16]
You go, 18..

256
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,291
I do not think...
I can fly.. anymore..

257
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,625
[ANDROID 18]
Yes, you can! Let's go!

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,583
No, Tien!
Get out of there!

262

[NARRATOR]
Tien's going all out,

263
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,166
but how much longer
can he hold on?

264
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,625
With Cell on the rampage,

265
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,958
is there any hope left
for the valiant warrior?

266
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,083
Can Vegeta and Trunks
complete their training

267
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,708
in the pendulum room
in time to lend a hand?

268

from the next episode
