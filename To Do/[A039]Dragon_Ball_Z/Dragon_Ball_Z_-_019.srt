00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,333
With the arrival of the
Saiyans only weeks away,

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,250
all of Earth's heroes
were beginning

4
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,208
to feel the pressure...
Especially Goku...

5
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,250
His epic journey
to find King Kai

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,041
was beginning to look like
an epic waste of time.

7
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,291
That is, until he summoned
a final burst of energy

8
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,166
and tackled the last
mile of Snake Way...

9
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,375
[GOKU laughs]

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,541
[NARRATOR]
An unexpected turn

11
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
caused him to slide
right off the road,

12
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,750
but at least it put him in the
place where he wanted to be!

13
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,125
Talk about your
lucky breaks!

14
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,708
Goku didn't know
it at first

15
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,291
but he had just stumbled
upon King Kai's planet...

16
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,166
[straining sound]

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,666

[MONKEY chatters]

19
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,541
[NARRATOR] The intense gravity
of the planet sucked him in

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,291
and he found himself face
to face with King Kai...

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,250
Or at least that's
what he thought...

22
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,833
Not wanting to offend the
mythical martial arts master

23
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,666
he began to train with
the banana-loving legend...

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,958
But in the back
of his mind

25
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,208
Goku knew something
wasn't right!

26
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,583
Could this hairy creature
really be King Kai?

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:34,083
[MONKEY chatters]

28
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,916
[STRANGER] Hm?

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,041
[GOKU and MONKEY chatter]

30
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,250
Alright, that's enough...

31
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,166
Who are you?

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,416
[GOKU] Huh?

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,541
Hey... Are you--
No, you couldn't be!

34
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,708
[STRANGER chuckles]

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,375
I am who I am!

36
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,500
Guess who? Go on guess!
It rhymes with pie!

37
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,958
Hmm... Huh... H-Hmm...

38
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,208
Hmm... Hmm...

39
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,208
Got it?

40
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,125
I'm King Kai!

41
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,833
[yells]

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,166
Then who is he?

43
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,625
Him? He's my favorite
monkey, Bubbles!

00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,458

[GOKU laughs]

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I see, I thought he
was a little strange!

47
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,916
[KING KAI] Did you just call
my friend Bubbles strange?

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,833
Like you're not!

49
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,333
[GOKU] Huh?!

50
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,625
Now don't take it personally,
I'm only teasing you, son.

51
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,708
Even Kais like
to kid around!

52
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,166
Yeah... Me too!

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,750
[KING KAI] Nnn...

54
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:41,083
Okay, let's see...
I'll try a few jokes on you.

55
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,916
All right. Here's a good one,
it's about my uncle...

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,250
He's so large, when he
sits around the house,

57
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,083
he sits
around the house.

58
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,666
[GOKU] Uh!

59
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:57,083
Ring! Ring! Ah! Yes, hello.
You don't say... Wha?

60
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,041
You don't say!
My gosh!

61
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:06,750
[KING KAI giggles]

62
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,375
Heh. Good one...

63
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,500
[KING KAI] You're supposed
to say, Who was that?

64
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,791
Then I say...
They didn't say! Get it?

65
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,666
Oh, right...
You're very funny,

66
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,541
but actually I've come here
to train with you, sir!

67
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,333
Train you?!

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,666
No way! Why should I?!

69
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,375
Why you wouldn't
know a good joke

70
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,250
if it snuck up and
kicked you in the head!

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,833
Forget it! I won't train anyone
without a sense of humor!

72
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,708
[GOKU laughs loudly]

73
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,416
Jokes can't kick you in
the head! That's crazy!

74
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,750
[GOKU's laughing continues]

75
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,083
You're too much,
King Kai!

76
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,708
Well... On second thought,
I guess I could train you.

77
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,750
Oh, wow!
You really mean it?

78
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:56,333
Well, of course. But first,
you must pass a test!

79
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,708
Sure! Anything!

80
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,083
[KING KAI]
Alright then...

81
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,333
Make me laugh
and you're in!

82
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,583
Uh?

83
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,541
What? Surely you have to
know a good joke or two.

84
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,500
But remember it has to be
a funny one for it to count.

85
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,166
What?! Come on!
I'm not a comedian!

86
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,333
[KING KAI chuckles]

87
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,500
[KING KAI] Hey, don't
get all tensed-up!

88
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,916
Staying loose
is the key!

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,666
Trust me, you'll
ruin your delivery

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,291
if you're all
stressed out!

91
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,791
Well, I'm waiting!

92
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,000
[GOKU thinking] Knock Knock.
Who's there? Krillin.

93
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,833
No! Think! Think!

94
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,291
Oh, having trouble are you?

95
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,375
Then give up and go home!

96
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,666
Why did the chicken...

97
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,875
...cross the road?

98
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,083
[KING KAI]
Eh?! Eh?!

99
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,833
Uh... to get to...
the other side.

100
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,500
[stifled laugh]

101
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,166
Hey! No, wait...

102
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,916
It was too
far to fly!

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,666
Ahh! Eh?!

104
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
[GOKU] What's the difference
between a jeweler and jailer?

105
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,958
One sell watches!
One watches cells!

106
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,041
Ahh!

107
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,333
[stifled laugh]

108
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,041
I did it! You laughed!
You laughed King Kai!

109
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,750
[KING KAI guffaws]

110
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,916
Somebody stop me!

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,166
Hey King Kai, don't blow
a gasket on me, okay!

112
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,625
Oh, my, my, my.
Okay kid, you're in!

113
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,666
When I get
through with you,

114
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,208
you'll be a real
prince of comedy!

115
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,541
You'll have no equal in the art
of delivering a punch line.

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,583
They'll call you
the Prince of Puns!

117
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,166
How does that
grab you?

118
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,958
But... King Kai, I came here for
training in the martial arts!

119
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,000
You did? Shame on you!

120
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,833
You should have told me earlier!

121
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,958
Right! Show me
what you've got!

122
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't hold back,
I'm stronger than I look!

123
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,625
Uhh?

124
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,750
What's wrong?

125
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,041
It's this place...
The gravity here...

126
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,333
For some reason I just can't
seem to get used to it at all.

127
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,958
[KING KAI]
That is most unusual.

128
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,125
Ah! I know!

129
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,750
I'll bet you came from
Earth, didn't you?

130
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,833
Uh-hum.

131
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,625
Yes, that explains it!

132
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,083
I'm surprised that you
can even walk around!

133
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,208
You see, this planet
may look small,

134
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,458
but the gravity
is severe!

135
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,541
I'd say that your body weighs
at least ten times more here

136
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,375
than it did on Earth!

137
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,375
Go ahead and try and
jump... As high as you can!

138
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,333
Uh? Oh!

139
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,583
[GOKU yells frantically]

140
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,000
Ah! Bummer! This is
really embarrassing!

141
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
[KING KAI thinking] Hmm...
This one may prove

142
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,625
to have talent
after all...

143
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,666
If he can jump that high in
ten times his normal gravity,

144
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,125
then there's hope
for him yet! Maybe...

145
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,708
[KING KAI] All right, then!
Let's begin the training!

146
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,625
Now, how long do you
plan on staying here?

147
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,583
Well, for as
long as possible,

148
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,375
but I'm just not sure how
much time there is left.

149
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,875
See, it's like this!
There's these guys...

150
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,666
Really evil guys called
Saiyan Warriors!

151
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,208
And they're on their way
to Earth to take it over!

152
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm here, because I have to get
strong enough to stop them!

153
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,833
I've got family
down there!

154
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,041
The Saiyans, huh?
That's awful.

155
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,375
They certainly can
be a ruthless bunch!

156
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,375
Mm-hmm. Okay. Heh, heh.

157
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
We need to find
out the exact day

158
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,958
they're going to be
arriving on planet Earth.

159
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,041
Let's see now...
Where are they?

160
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,875
Ah, yes. There they are.
Two of them. Hmm...

161
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,833
I'm afraid they don't
come any stronger

162
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,625
than those
particular two!

163
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,208
All right then...

164
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,500
According to my calculations,
at their current rate of speed,

165
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,458
they should arrive on Earth
in approximately 88 days.

166
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,958
Really? Are you sure about
that? That's amazing!

167
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,416
No, I'm amazing, my boy!

168
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,333
Isn't it obvious?

169
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,500
[KING KAI laughs]

170
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,500
[thinking] This poor boy has
no idea what he's up against!

171
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,333
Hm... You should forget
the training... It's no use.

172
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,208
[GOKU guffaws]

173
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,708
That's good!

174
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,583
Yeah?

175
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,666
Hey! I've only
got 88 days

176
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,041
to prepare for the Saiyans and
that's not good... Let's go!

177
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,500
Aw! I'm sure we can get
you trained in 88 days!

178
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,500
[GOKU]
You can?

179
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,500
Training under me
on this planet,

180
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,541
non-stop for 88 days,
is equivalent to training

181
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,541
for several thousand
years on Earth.

182
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,500
Are you ready?

183
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,625
Sure! That's great!

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,250
[KING KAI]
There is one thing though...

185
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,416
Even if you train, it doesn't
necessarily mean you can win.

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,458
The two Saiyans that are
on their way to Earth

187
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,083
rank among the
greatest fighters

188
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,791
in the entire universe!
There are no guarantees...

189
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,916
Those particular two, well,
they're even stronger than me.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,541
What?! Stronger?!
They can't be!

191
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,125
[KING KAI]
I'm afraid so...

192
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,291
That means in order
for you to win...

193
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,875
You are going to have to
become stronger than me.

194
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,833
Now I hope that
doesn't scare you at all.

195
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,750

Ha, ha! Good!

197
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,083
Well, I say we
get started! Hm?

198
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,916

try to catch him!

[GOKU] That's my training?
Catch the monkey?

203
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,416
[KING KAI] That's right! Until
you can move around easily,

204
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,583
you're not ready to start
anything more intense than that!

205

Excellent!

the unnecessary gear

him heavier!

to catch himself!

get moving

be more effective

yours lived on a planet

It's one of the great
secrets to their power.

Unfortunately, that's not
even the root of their power.

to fight anywhere.

[BUBBLES chatters]

349
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,875
He's really
starting to bug me!

350
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,416
You crazy ape!

351
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,791
Heh! Bubbles is
all fired up!

352
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,166
Ow! Hey! Come on,
this car is a classic!

353
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,333
Show some respect,
would ya?!

354
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,625
[GOKU yells]

355
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,750
[BUBBLES chatters]

356
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, man!
He's mocking me! Great!

357
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,458
You're mine, Bubbles!
You hear me?

358
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,000
[panting]

359
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,666
Huh?

360
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,916
Hey, I have an idea!

361
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,250
I'll cut him
off over there!

362
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,333
[BUBBLES yells]

363
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,958
[GOKU]
I'm gonna get you!

364
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,041
[GOKU yells]

365
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:18,625
[BUBBLES chatters lightly]

366
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,750
[sighs]

367
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,791
[breathes heavily]

368
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,458
[GOKU]
Oh, Bubbles?

369
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,708
[BUBBLES yells fearfully]

370
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,125
La-la-la-la!

371
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,208
[BUBBLES yells]

372
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,541
[GOKU yells]

373
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,291
Ooohh...

374
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,416
Ha! Gotcha!

375
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,125
Yeah! I did it!
Woo-hoo!

376
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:09,000
[GOKU laughs]

377
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,875
[thinking] Ohhh!
How extraordinary!

378
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,500
He's conquered the
intense gravity here!

379
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,375
Perhaps he does
have the strength

380
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,875
to handle my training
program after all...

381
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:24,333
Yes... Maybe he is the one
to finally stop the Saiyans!

382
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,750
[NARRATOR]
By catching Bubbles,

383
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,166
Goku has gained the
respect of King Kai.

384
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,708
Now he can begin the next
phase of his training.

385
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,208
Training that will
hopefully give him

386
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,583
the strength and skill to
defeat the two sinister Saiyans

387
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,083
who are headed
towards Earth.

388
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,791
Goku has every
right to celebrate

389
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,041
after conquering the extreme
gravity of King Kai's planet,

390
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,708
but there are far more
serious challenges ahead.

391
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,708
The days are rolling by
and it won't be long

392
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,083
before Goku will have
to come face to face

393
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,500
with the two deadliest
warriors in the universe.

394
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,166
Will he be
ready in time?

395
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,625

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
