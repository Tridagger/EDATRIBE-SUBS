00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,125
The tables were turned
on the demon king Dabura.

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,500
With the monster Majin
Buu at his bidding,

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,666
Babidi no longer had need
for his former right-hand man.

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,541
And the evil wizard was most
eager to see his new pet

6
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,041
cause some
delicious destruction!

7
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,250
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

8
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
[NARRATOR] Quick to recognize
Buu's awesome potential,

9
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,291
Dabura was determined
to put a stop

10
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,291
to the seemingly
simple-minded creature

11
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,625
before he became too powerful
for Babidi to control.

12
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,333
[laughs]

13
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,166
Aaaaarrgh!!

14
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,041
[NARRATOR] But even
his mightiest efforts proved

15
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,916
to be in vain.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

17
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,541
Ah ha ha!

18
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,166
You turn into a cookie!

19
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] A flick of
Majin Buu's pink antenna

20
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,583
revealed one of the monster's
most uncanny abilities.

21
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,750
In an electrifying
display of power,

22
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,708
Dabura was reduced to
a harmless foodstuff.

23
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,875
[NARRATOR] And Buu
made good on his promise

24
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,250
to devour the King
of the Demon World.

25
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,250
[NARRATOR] Once again, Majin Buu
enjoyed the taste of victory.

26
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,500
But his delight
would not last long.

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,833
In a fiery blast that
sent Babidi reeling,

28
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,291
another fighter arrived
on the battlefield,

29
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,583
ready to challenge
the bloated beast.

30
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,916
[NARRATOR]
When the smoke cleared,

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,625
the wizard was shocked to
find his spaceship in ruins,

32
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,708
and the man responsible--Vegeta!

33
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,208
Hmph! Yes!

34
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,250
[NARRATOR] For what this
terrifying creature has done

35
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,541
to Gohan and the others,
Vegeta has sworn revenge!

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,583
And with Babidi's
magic augmenting

37
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,958
his already incredible
Super Saiyan strength,

38
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,250
it seems nothing will
stop him from having it!

39
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,625
[GOKU grunts]

40
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,250
Ve... Vege... ta...

41
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:36,500
No! Majin Buu? What's going
on? He's beating you?!

42
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,291
Why can't you do to him
what you did to the others?!

43
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,291
[VEGETA] Is this the best
your monster can do, Babidi?

44
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,333
The "terror of the universe"?
Hah! Pathetic.

45
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,375
Uh, wow. And here I thought
he couldn't get any cockier.

46
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,916
Haha haha haha.

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,083
[TRUNKS]
Yeah!

48
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,166
All right! Go for it, Dad!
You can do it!

49
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,625
You got him right where you
want him, now finish him off!

50
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,333
Haha! Yeah go get him!

51
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
[PICCOLO thinking]
Something's happened to Vegeta.

52
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,791
Even for a Super Saiyan,
he seems unnaturally strong!

53
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,375
[gasps]

54
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,416
[VEGETA chuckles]

55
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,875
[PICCOLO thinking] Amazing!
His energy, it's enormous!

56
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,166
I haven't sensed
anything like this since..

57
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,250
since Gohan fought Cell!

58
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
But Majin Buu was
able to take Gohan down.

59
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,458
He killed him! I only hope
Vegeta can avoid the same fate.

60
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,458
He's the last chance we've got.

61
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:54,666
And if he fails. No!
Vegeta, you can't fail!

62
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,458
Unless Goku reappears,

63
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,500
all of our lives--this whole
world--depends on you!

64
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,041
[BUU]
Hmm?

65
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,125
Majin Buu!
Don't let him do this to you.

66
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,375
Just eat him or
squash him or something.

67
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,750
Oh... Uh...

68
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,291
Whoa...

69
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:10,583
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
I knew my dad could beat him!

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,250
All right! Goten!
Victory is ours! Heh!

71
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,000
Trunks! Your dad's the best!

72
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,166
Well, of course! I guess you
could say it runs in the family!

73
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
[GOTEN laughs]

74
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,041
[BUU]
Oof!

75
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,833
Huh?!

76
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:56,125
Aahhh! Ooo!

77
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,583

00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,125

[cackles loudly]

81
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,916
Buu! You are positively
wonderful! I love you!

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,375
Now go and destroy him!

83
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:35,083
[BUU hums]

84
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
[BABIDI]
Buu, what are you waiting for?

85
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,458
Finish him!

86
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,541
Tear him to ribbons!

87
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,666
Do you hear me? Ribbons!

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,041
I don't want there to
be anything left of him

89
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,541
when you're through!

90
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,208
Show him what happens to people
who blow up my spaceship!

91
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,000
[BABIDI]
Are you even listening to me?

92
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
I'm giving you an order!

93
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,041
Do something!

94
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,458
Do you want me to put
you back in your ball?

95
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,000
Because I wil!!

96
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,541
If he's not die by the
time I count to three...

97
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
One, two...

98
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,083
Get him, Dad!

99
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,083

Aaah!

00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,625
Oh...

103
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah!

104
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,416
Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray!

105
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,791
He did it! All right!

[snickers]

107
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,208
[BABIDI]
No.. No.. How could this happen?

108
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:24,916
My pet is gone...
My beautiful pet is gone! Ah!

109
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,625
Huh?!

00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,750
Yay, Dad! Hahaha!

00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,833
[snickers] No, no!
Buu no drop dead.

114
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,333
What is he? Immortal?

[BABIDI]
Oh ho, yes, victory! Hahahaha!

116
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,750
Go Majin Buu! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

117
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,916
Isn't that right, Buu!

118
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,375
"Drop him dead!"
or whatever it is you say.

119
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,166
Big power.

120
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,583
[KRILLIN] Uh, guys, this
looks like our cue to leave.

121
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
[TRUNKS] But, we can't!
We can't just leave my dad!

122
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,666
[KRILLIN] I think your dad
knows how to handle himself!

123

Whadda ya say we get outta here!

124

Curse that thing!

145
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,833
How can I beat him if he's
able to regenerate himself

146
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,625
after every attack? Darn him!

147
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,833
That fool thought he was so
tough but just look at him now.

148
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:11,291
He's nothing compared to you
Majin Buu! He's nothing at all!

149
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,666
Too bad he had to go
and disobey me.

150
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,333
He would have made
such a fine subordinate!

152
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
[PICCOLO] I don't think
even Vegeta will be able

153
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,458
to do this on his own.

154
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:38,916
And Gohan, Goku, the Supreme
Kai, all of them are gone!

155
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,125
If Majin Buu wins now.. there
will be no one left to stop him.

harder. He must have a weakness!

he can also have it taken away!

00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:07,625
[BUU hums]

179
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,750
Oh no!

180
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,708
Hahaha!

181
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,875
Augh!!

182
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,583
[laughs]

183
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,333
[KRILLIN]
Vegeta's a goner!

184
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,083
Man I wish Goku
and Gohan were here!

185
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,000
Where the heck are
those guys anyway?

186
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,666
Hey! They'll be here,
Krillin! Just wait!

187
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
[PICCOLO]
Stay where you are Trunks!

188
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,250
We don't want to lose you too!
There's nothing you can do now!

189
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,333
You'll just cause Vegeta
more pain if you get involved!

190
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:10,958
[laughs]
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

191
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,208
Hyaaaa!!

192
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,750
Trunks wait up!

193
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:25,500
[BUU]
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

194
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,625
Ha!!

195
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,166
[NARRATOR]
To Babidi's great amusement,

196
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,875
Vegeta is getting the beating
of his life from Majin Buu.

197
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,625
The Saiyan Prince is strong,

198
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,291
but unable to defend himself

199
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,458
how much of this
pounding can he withstand?

200
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,875
[BUU laughs]

201
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,583
[NARRATOR] Can the two young
Super Saiyans, Trunks and Goten,

202
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,708
save Vegeta
before it's too late?

203
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,375
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
