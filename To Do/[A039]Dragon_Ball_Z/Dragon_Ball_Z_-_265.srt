00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,000
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,750
Majin Buu became furious

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,666
when his every attempt to
defeat the powered-up Gohan

4
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,833
proved useless.

5
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,208
Gohan was clearly
the superior fighter,

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,375
and it seemed Buu's
destructive spree

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,833
would at last come to an end.

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,666
[NARRATOR] But the crazed Buu
put an abrupt stop to the fight

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,333
by turning himself
into a living bomb,

10
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,583
apparently trying
to take Gohan with him.

11
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,583
[NARRATOR]
Gohan survived,

12
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,666
and in the following calm,
lost friends were reunited.

13
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,625
[PICCOLO] You're alive.
I don't know how you did it.

14
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,750
[NARRATOR]
But a dark cloud on the horizon

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,541
put a damper on the reunion,

16
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:02,583
as Majin Buu returned from
hiding, only one hour later...

17
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,791
[NARRATOR] ...and delivered
a puzzling request.

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,458
[SUPER BUU laughs]

19
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,500
Come on then, little worms.
I want to fight you now!

20
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,500
[ALL gasp]

21
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,541
[GOHAN]
That is not gonna happen!

22
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,166
You're fighting me, Buu.
You got it?

23
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,291
What happened boys? Don't tell
me you're scared to fight Buu.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,125
[TRUNKS, GOTEN growl]

25
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,458
[SUPER BUU]
You were raring to go before.

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,291
[NARRATOR] What sinister
trick does Majin Buu

27
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,250
have hiding behind his back?

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,541
Find out now, on Dragon Ball Z!

29
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:02,666
[TRUNKS, GOTEN grunting]

30
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:16,458
[SUPER BUU chuckling]

31
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh I'm sorry,
I must of misjudged you.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,375
What's he saying?

33
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,666
I think he's trying
to say we're weak!

34
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,916
Then I guess he doesn't
remember us kicking his butt.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,791
I wouldn't say we're
down for the count just yet.

36
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
We just thought
Gohan deserved a shot.

37
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,625
[SUPER BUU]
Ah, I see,

38
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,208
for a moment I thought
you were hiding behind him.

39
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,250
Now why don't you do your little
magic so we can get started?

40
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,541
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Fine!

41
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
Ha, I'm ready.

42
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,000
With Gohan on our side,
there's no way we'll get beat.

43
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,916
Yeah, and I'm sick and tired
of hearing this pink guy

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
run his big, goofy mouth!

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,958
[PICCOLO] Goten, Trunks,
hold your ground for a moment.

46
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm sensing some kind of...

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,958
...deception.

48
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,250
C'mon, Piccolo,
you gotta be kidding.

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,416
he's not smart enough
for something like that.

50
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,291
He can't even spell deception.

51
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
Let's go!

52
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,625
No! Come back!

53
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,625
[GOTEN] Hey, you can't
spell that word, either.

54
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,208
[TRUNKS]
Shut up!

55
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,625
There, you got what
you asked for, Majin Buu.

56
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,291
Gotenks is back in the ring!

57
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,458
[GOHAN]
No, Trunks, you two stay back.

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,916
I'm dealing with this myself.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,166
[GOTEN] But, ah, come on!
We're really good.

60
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,083
[squelching]

61
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,833
[TRUNKS]
This stinks!

62
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,541
We can't just stand here
and watch. I wanna fight!

63
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,583
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

64
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:50,416
[growling]

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
[BEE barks]

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,791
Don't worry about
a thing, Gohan,

67
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
you haven't seen me
and Trunks in action yet.

68
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,875
When we do fusion,
we're unbeatable!

69
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,958
Watch this, okay?

70
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,000
[SUPER BUU thinking]
That's it boys.

71
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,458
Do your little fusion for me.

72
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,875
Now, are you ready, Goten?

73
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,250
Yeah!

74
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
[GOTEN] This time, we
should definitely start off

75
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,375
as Super Saiyan Three!

76
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,333
Fu...

77
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,291
Fu...

78
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,666
...sion!

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,708
Ha!

80
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:39,125
Whoa, so that's
what fusion looks like.

81
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,166
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

82
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
[GOTENKS]
Yeah!

83
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
Sorry you were
missing me, ugly,

84
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,250
but now I'm back,
and stronger than ever.

85
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,958
Now, that's weird.

86
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,416
First there were two kids,
and now there's one,

87
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,541
and he's got blonde hair
instead of... What's goin' on?!

88
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
[SUPER BUU thinking]
The power of Gotenks

89
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,916
and the mind of Piccolo.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,708
Unstoppable.

91
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,750
[squelching]

92
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:28,333
[squelching continues]

93
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,458
[barks]

94
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,208
[MR. SATAN] It just doesn't
make sense to me.

95
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,416
If two kids became one,
uh, they'd be twice as big.

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,916
--Right?
--[BEE growling]

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,500
Look, I'm pretty hungry too, but
right now, there's this fight.

98
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,458
And I'm tryin' to figure out
this other thing

99
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,458
all at the same time.

100
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,541
[barks]

101
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,458
Well, Gohan,

102
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,458
I hope you don't mind
if I take it from here.

103
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,166
You're looking like you
could use a little break.

104
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,166
[chuckles]

105
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,291
I'll beat on Buu
for a little while.

106
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,291
[grunts]

107
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,125
Then, I might be nice enough to
give you another shot at him.

108
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,875
Nice attitude, you've definitely
got some Vegeta in you.

109
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,500
[GOTENKS]
Thank you.

110
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,541

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,958
Wait, Bee! You're
running the wrong way!

[BEE barking]

115
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,625
[MR. SATAN]
Bee! No!

116
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,208
I-If you keep
running that way,

117
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,083
you'll end up
killing both of us!

118
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,166

119
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,833

120
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,375
[MR. SATAN]
Hey, that's weird! Huh?!

121
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,125
[gasping]

122
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,500
[GOTENKS] How 'bout I give
you the first move?

123
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,083
Ah!

124
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,750
[GOTENKS groaning]

125
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,291
Ah! What is that?!

126
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,666
[GOTENKS] Uh! Hey!
Get this nasty goo off of me!

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,833
[groaning] Stop it!

00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:57,041
[PICCOLO grunting]

129
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,500
No, not Piccolo!

[MR. SATAN groaning]

131
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,541
Guys, stay close,
you'll be safer!

132
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,541
[PICCOLO groans]

133
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,083
[GOTENKS groans]

134
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,958
Yes! Come to me!

135
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,708
[GOHAN]
No! What's he doing to them?!

136
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,791
Man, this looks bad!
You know what's happening?

137
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,083
Quick, Gohan, Raise your power!
He's changing again!

138
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,750
[gasping]

139
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:59,041
[SUPER BUU groaning]

140
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,541
[groaning continues]

141
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,166
[gasping]

142
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,541
No, he absorbed them.

143
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,500
[MR. SATAN gasping]

144
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,666
[MR. SATAN]
Does that mean he's gonna

145
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,666
run around and absorb us all?

146
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,500
He might. He went after
Gotenks and Piccolo,

147
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,333
so we know he's absorbing
the bravest fighters.

148
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,541
Uh, I hope he doesn't
find us back here.

149
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,708
So, Gohan, what
do you think of it?

150
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:02,250
New clothes to match my figure,
and a few new abilities as well!

151
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,708
[grunts]

152
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,625
I suppose the sudden loss
of your friends and family

153
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,541
has left you speechless, Gohan.

154
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,541
Hurry and drain your
tears so we can fight.

155
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,583
[chuckles]

156
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,083
How could you do that to them?

157
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,708
They've been fair in
this fight since the start.

158
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
I'm not interested in fairness,

159
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,583
I'm interested in the extinction

160
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,416
of every living creature
on this planet.

161
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,375
A good fighter knows his mental
and physical limitations,

162
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,250
but a great fighter will
figure a way around them.

163
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,666
From the moment I felt your
power, I knew I was beaten.

164
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,416
And then I thought
about something,

165
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,541
if I could hatch a plan to
absorb Piccolo and Gotenks

166
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,791
and their powers,

167
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
then no force on this
boring, pathetic planet

168
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,916
would ever stand a chance
against me again.

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,791
And then another important
factor was revealed. Time...

170
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,500
[GOTENKS]
I've only got five more minutes,

171
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,166
then we'll have to wait an hour
until I can do fusion again!

172
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,583
You'd be smart
to show your face.

173
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,666
Here I am about to lose
all of my powers,

174
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,250
and be helpless to
defend myself. Really!

175
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,500
It's just poor,
little Gotenks here,

176
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,125
all by his lonesome,
unable to fight back at all.

177
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,791
[SUPER BUU] Individually, the
boys were worthless to me,

178
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,833
but together, they have the
strength to make me invincible.

179
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,375
So, I decided to
wait out the hour

180
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,458
until they could do their
little fusion trick again.

181
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,291
Then all I had to do
was get them angry.

182
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:08,750
Tch. Well, you got
me angry, too.

183
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,708
You know,
if you wanted the best,

184
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,125
you should've come after me.

185
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,166
You just absorbed the
wrong Super Saiyans, Buu.

186
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,166
And if you're using
Piccolo's brains,

187
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
you know you've
got thirty minutes

188
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,791
until this newfound
strength of yours defuses.

189
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
[SUPER BUU laughs]

190
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,958
I assure you, it will
be over before then.

191
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,916
And I didn't absorb you
because I needed a punching bag.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,625
What's the point
of having strength

193
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
if there's nothing to hit?

194
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,333
I kept you around because
I'm stronger than ever,

195
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,250
and I have to try it on someone.

196
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,125
Sounds fine, I'm all yours.

197
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,875
Let's do this.

198
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,208
All right,

199
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,833
but be warned,
in my new super form

200
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,541
I have the body of Buu,
the intensity of Gotenks,

201
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,166
and all the cunning of a Namek

202
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,375
ready to drive the nails
into your coffin.

203
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,541
I'm tougher than Gotenks
and smarter than Piccolo.

204
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,875
So, I guess, the only thing
you have to worry about

205
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,375
is if I'm stronger than you.

206
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:10,000
[gasping]

207
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,416
You know I'm going
to kill you, Gohan.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,375
Well let's hold off on
the gravestone, Majin Buu.

209
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:01,000
[GOHAN, SUPER BUU grunting]

210
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,125
[BOTH groan]

211
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,708
Uh?!

212
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,125
Uh!

213
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,833
Uh!

214
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:25,166

[GOHAN pants]

228
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:21,708
[SUPER BUU] That was fun, Gohan.
Why don't we try it again?

229
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,583
[MR. SATAN gasps]

230
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,625
[MR. SATAN] Where-- where
are all the army guys?

231
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,208
I thought they
were droppin' bombs.

232
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,541
There's no army. Gohan and
Majin Buu are fighting.

233
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,166
All those explosions
from two guys?

234
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,083
They don't even look like
they've taken a single punch.

235
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,375
Do you think Buu's
gonna come after me?

236
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,833
Uh-huh, if you're a strong guy,
I think he might.

237
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,041
Do you not know who I am?

238
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,291
I am Mr. Satan,

239
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,750
Champion of the World
Martial Arts Tournament,

240
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,916
and the savior of planet
Earth, gotta fan club.

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,291
Well, he'll surely
be looking for you.

242
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
[SUPER BUU] It seems you're
weaker than you thought.

243
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,958
Is your confidence
dwindling yet?

244
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,958
There's no shame
in quitting here.

245
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,833
You can just walk away
whenever you want.

246
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,125
Your mind games aren't
gonna work on me, Buu.

247
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,208
I've been trained
much better than that.

248
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,541
Now let's go again!

249
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,041
All right, it's time to show you

250
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,250
why my little brother
looks up to me.

251
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,166
He doesn't.

252
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,625
If fact, he wonders
why you let me take him.

253
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,500
[grunts]

254
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,875
[SUPER BUU] Oh, I bet
that hurts, doesn't it?

255
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,416
Ah!

256
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,416
[SUPER BUU] Your old teacher
Piccolo isn't impressed, Gohan.

257
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,416
He thought you were
smarter than that.

258
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,833
[GOHAN groans]

259
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,541
[SUPER BUU] And Trunks thinks
you're a cowardly deserter,

260
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,000
just like your father.

261
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,125

267

Gohan, look up!

268
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,250
[screams]

269
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,708
[MR. SATAN, DENDE groaning]

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,666
Gohan, where are you?

271
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,500
Elder Kai, Gohan just
vanished while he was fighting.

272
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,708
Does he still have the
ability to defeat Majin Buu?

273
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,000
Mm.... Beats me.

274
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
--[SUPREME KAI] Ee!
--[GOKU gasps]

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,041
Everything is falling apart.

276
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,666
I can't seem to find
him anywhere. Is he...?

277
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,791
Don't even think like
that okay? He's alive!

278
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,291
[gasping]

279
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,958
I tell you,
I think this fight's over.

280
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,375
Remember, not so long ago,
I was the one hiding.

281
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,583
I needed time to stall.

282
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,791
Is that what you're
doing now, Gohan?

283
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,500
Are you hiding, trying to think
your way out of this mess?

284
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,000
You seem to have forgotten

285
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,416
that your beloved Piccolo
is a part of me,

286
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,958
and I can sense that
you're alive down there, kid.

287
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,416
[NARRATOR] After absorbing
both Piccolo and Gotenks,

288
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,416
Buu's physical
and mental abilities

289
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,208
have reached a new pinnacle.

290
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,958
Will Gohan's training hold up

291
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:44,000
in the face of this
newly formed Super Buu?

292
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,375
[GOHAN]
Buu!

293
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,958

294
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,666

from the next, Dragon Ball Z!
