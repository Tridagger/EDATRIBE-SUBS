1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,166
Huh? Kaio-Ken?

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,208
After the defeat of Piccolo,
Chiaotzu, Tien and Yamcha,

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,750
it seemed no one could
stop the Saiyan onslaught

5
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,208
from destroying
the Earth.

6
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,125
But that was before
Goku returned

7
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,625
from his training
with King Kai

8
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,250
and began to demonstrate
his new found skills!

9
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,750
I'm gonna
rip you apart!

10
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,083
Aahh!

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,750
[NARRATOR] Now it appears
as if the brutal Nappa

12
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,750
has finally
met his match.

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,875
[NARRATOR] But overpowering the
awesome strength of Vegeta

14
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,750
will not be
an easy task.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,458
And with Nappa
far from finished,

16
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,958
will Goku's strength
hold out to the very end?

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,500
[NAPPA] Huh?

18
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,625
[NAPPA growling]

19
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,083
Aahh!

20
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,125
[NARRATOR] Will Goku have
enough tricks up his sleeve

21
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,625
to avenge his
fallen friends

22
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,875
and help repel these Saiyan
attackers once and for all?

23
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,750
Find out... today!

24
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,875
That's for my friends,
all four of them!

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,250
[NAPPA] I was
Commander in Chief

26
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,208
of the whole
Saiyan Army!

27
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,166
You're nothing
compared to me!

28
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,458
[NAPPA growling]

29
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,750
Raah!

30
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,041
[NAPPA yelling]

31
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,500
Hyaah!

32
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:04,166
[NAPPA growling]

33
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,708
[KRILLIN] This guy's
no problem for Goku.

34
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,916
[NAPPA growling]

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,458
[NAPPA] I'm through
with you!

36
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,875
Ka... ka... rot!

37
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:29,875
[NAPPA growling]

38
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,333
Raahh!

39
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,791
[GOKU] All right!
Here goes!

40
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,708
Haahh!

41
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,875
Huh?!

42
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,250
No way!

43
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:11,333
Ah! How was that pathetic
fool able to stop that?!

44
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Well, take this!

45
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,750
[GOKU] This one's
for Piccolo!

46
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:24,541
What was that?! I didn't
even see him get behind me!

47
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
What the...?!

48
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,333
And this one
is for Yamcha!

49
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,666
Wow! No way!
He's got him! Way to go!

50
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,125
Yes!

51
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,583
Hnn.

52
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:25,875
[NAPPA snarling]

53
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,708
I hate you!

54
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,958
You hate losing! You're
not used to fighting

55
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,791
someone stronger
than you!

56
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,958
You're not stronger than
me, you little runt!

57
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
Your strength was tested
when you were a baby!

58
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,750
You're a
third-class Saiyan!

59
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,250
I'm a Saiyan Elite,
you low-class dog!

60
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,541
[VEGETA] Nappa! Don't
be a fool! Calm down!

61
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,291
How do you expect to
win when you're so mad

62
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,833
you can't even see straight?!
Now, settle down!

63
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,458
Use your head!

64
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:08,833
[NAPPA growling]

65
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,541
Heh, heh. All right,
Kakarot, round two!

66
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,333
[thinking] His skills are way
beyond what they should be.

67
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,125
I don't
understand it!

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,166
[NAPPA] You may
have gotten lucky

69
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,833
with a couple
of fancy moves,

70
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,541
but now I'm gonna
tear you apart!

71
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm ready when you
are. It's your move.

72
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,000
Heh! Your time
is up, Kakarot.

73
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,958
[thinking] That idiot has no
idea what he's up against.

74
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,375
I'm sure I'll have to
clean up his mess.

75
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,458
[NAPPA chuckling]

76
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,625
Why did
they stop?

77
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,291
I don't know.

78
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,875
[OOLONG] Uh-oh, the ugly
guy's smiling about something!

79
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,666
I can't take it! Goku, wipe
that smile right off his face!

80
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,291
No! Don't!

81
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,916
[ROSHI and TURTLE screaming]

82
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,000
You fool! Why'd
you go and do that?!

83
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,458
Nevermind! I did it because
I felt like it, so there!

84
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,291
You should learn to
respect your elders!

85
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,208
Well, you should learn
not to shower people

86
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,708
when you're trying
to make a point!

87
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,291
That breath of
yours isn't exactly

88
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,208
kissing fresh,
you know!

89
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,583
Serves you right!

90
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,833
[ROSHI]
Ladies, please!

91
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,000
[BOTH] Huh?

92
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,125
I think we're all
a little high-strung!

93
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,916
Let's try
to calm down!

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,875
Yeah, besides, we're
missing all the action.

95
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,750
Goku could be in trouble
for all we know!

96
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,416
He's not going to
be in any trouble.

97
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,708
You'll see,
Goku's fine.

98
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,583
Now, let's see if we can
get this thing to work...

99
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,250
Where's the picture?!
Come on!

100
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,791
Hey, it's not a
television set!

101
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,208
All right!
That's enough!

102
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,875
[ROSHI] This has gone
on too far, girls!

103
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,750
Remember that your
guests in this...

104
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,833
[ROSHI] Hey!
What did I do?

105
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:23,208
[commotion and yelling]

106
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,708
[BULMA] I think we
might've broken it...

107
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,375
[BABA] No, there's a disturbance
in the Earth's energy!

108
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:38,750
[NAPPA yelling]

109
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:43,416
[whimpering]

110
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:57,416
[NAPPA yelling]

111
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,375
[thinking] Now he's
getting serious.

112
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,083
[NAPPA chuckling]

113
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,125
You can't escape!

114
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,958
[blows hitting]

115
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,666
Phew! This might be a little
tougher than I thought!

116
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,666
[NAPPA] Ha, ha, ha! That was
just a taste of my skills!

117
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,000
I haven't even begun to
show you my full power!

118
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,916
See how you
like this...

119
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,041
Raaugh!

120
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,791
Uh?!

121
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:05,666
[bellowing]

122
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,083
That was fast! How could
he possibly stop that!

123
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,708
Nappa was right
in his face!

124
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:23,583
[NAPPA laughing]

125
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,541
Hnn?! Aah!

126
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,250
That was a little too close.
Any closer and I'd be history!

127
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,916
This can't
be happening,

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,958
nobody has ever
survived that attack!

129
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,833
He's got to have
some weakness.

130
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,791
This cannot
go on forever!

131
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,125
I should really try using
the Kaio-Ken Attack,

132
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,041
but I've gotta save my
strength for the other guy.

133
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,958
[VEGETA] All right!
That's it! Enough!

134
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,791
You heard me, Nappa! Come
down here! You're finished!

135
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,291
[NAPPA growling]

136
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,625
Don't look at
me like that!

137
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,583
So far you haven't managed
to land a single punch!

138
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,958
I think you've
embarrassed us long enough!

139
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,166
That's just great.
He was just a warm up...

140
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,916
This other guy really seems
to know what he's doing.

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,208
Please!
Hang on, Dad!

142
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,958
[whimpering]

143
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,375
I said it's my turn.
Now get down here!

144
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,208
Well, fun's over!

145
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,375
Vegeta's going to enjoy
killing you slowly, Kakarot!

146
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,958
[NAPPA] He's the only one
in the universe

147
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,958
that could stop me from
ending this with you right now.

148
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
He's stronger and
faster than me!

149
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,458
I can't wait to
watch you fail!

150
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,375
It's too bad he won't let
me help finish you off.

151
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,875
[NAPPA] Now, what
can I do for fun?

152
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,583
Hmm?

153
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,583
[NAPPA] I know!

154
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,208
[NAPPA chuckling]

155
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,208
[whimpering]

156
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,916
Gohan, no!
Krillin, run!

157
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,875
[GOKU] I'm not
going to make it!

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,625
Raahh!

159
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,125
[screaming]

160
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,958
Kaio-Ken Attack!

161
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
Now what?!

162
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,666
[NAPPA screaming]

163
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,125
How in the world
did he do that?

164
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,000
Good question.
I really don't know!

165
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,208
I-I can't
move my legs!

166
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,375
[KRILLIN] Wow, Goku, I think
you really hurt that guy.

167
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,125
He's not
getting up.

168
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,416
He won't be
fighting anymore!

169
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,416
I suggest you take him back
to wherever you came from

170
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,916
and get him
some help!

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,458
[thinking]
He's so confident!

172
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:56,166
How did he achieve that drastic
increase in power and speed?

173
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku.
How did you do that?

174
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,375
That was one of the most
amazing attacks I've ever seen!

175
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,708
What was it?

176
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,958
Oh, it's the
Kaio-Ken Attack!

177
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,875
It's like a massive
upsurge of energy!

178
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,416
Everything is
heightened!

179
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,250
Power, speed, even hearing and
vision improve dramatically!

180
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,833
[GOKU] You sort of become
a super-self!

181
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,458
But it can only be
sustained for a short time

182
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
so you have to get
the job done quickly!

183
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,000
That's so great!

184
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,416
Do you think you'll
be able to teach me

185
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,000
how to do a move like that
someday Goku, huh? Maybe?

186
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,041
Maybe...

187
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,833
As usual, I have to do
everything myself...

188
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,708
Why didn't you
use that Kaio-Ken

189
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,625
to attack him in the
first place, Goku?

190
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,000
With a move
like that,

191
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,541
you could have taken him
out any time you wanted to!

192
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,833
[GOKU] That's true,
I could have...

193
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,583
But the problem is,
there's always a chance

194
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,833
that the increase in energy
could have destroyed my body!

195
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,875
But I'm still here,
aren't I? Yeah!

196
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,333
[KRILLIN]
Yeah...

197
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,791
[KING KAI] You have mastered
the Kaio-Ken Attack.

198
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:18,250
Well done, Goku...
But you must remember...

199
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,708
Energy and matter are
always interchangeable...

200
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,750
One eventually
replaces the other.

201
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,875
The awesome speed and
strength you gain

202
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,791
in the Kaio-Ken attack
come at a price...

203
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,708
The attack can only
be used for short bursts...

204
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,791
If you use it for too long or
if you are in a weakened state,

205
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,708
the energy will take
over your material body

206
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,958
to the point of its
complete obliteration.

207
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,708
Do you understand what
I am telling you Goku?

208
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,000
I understand.

209
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,916
It... could kill you?

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,375
[GOKU] Yes.

211
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:56,875
[NAPPA] Vegeta, give me a
hand... I can't get up!

212
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,458
Thank you!

213
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,500
Hmph. Sure. It's the
least I can do, Nappa.

214
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,625
Waaugh!

215
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,708
[ALL] Wha--?!

216
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:23,875
[NAPPA screaming]

217
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,208
Maybe you won't be such
a disappointment...

218
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,666
when you're dead!

219
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:35,250
[VEGETA grunting]

220
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,791
[VEGETA laughing]

221
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,166
Wow, this
is intense!

222
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,416
Dad? What's
happening?

223
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,791
Whoa, that guy's
powering up! Hang on!

224
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,250
[VEGETA] Goodbye!

225
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,333
[NAPPA screaming]

226
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,000
No! No, Vegeta!

227
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,500
[VEGETA chortling]

228
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,666
[NAPPA screaming]

229
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,583
Hmm. Hn?

230
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,208
Hnn?

231
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,083
Hah?! Hnn!

232
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,541
I can't...
believe it...

233
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,541
He completely obliterated
his own teammate!

234
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,958
[GOHAN whimpering]

235
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,000
[VEGETA chuckling]

236
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,125
[GOKU] Gohan, Krillin...

237
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,916
It's time for you guys to
head back to Master Roshi's!

238
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,083
[GOHAN] But, Dad...

239
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,333
I see...
Gohan...

240
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,375
Gohan, listen to your Dad...
Let's get going!

241
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,458
No! I can't go!

242
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,208
Don't you get it? I don't
wanna leave either!

243
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,666
But these guys are in a
different league altogether!

244
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,875
That Saiyan could even
use us against your Dad

245
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,916
if he got ahold of you or me
and threatened to hurt us!

246
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,375
Daddy?
Is that true?

247
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,750
Yes, Gohan,
Krillin's right.

248
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,125
I'll be much better off
if I face him alone.

249
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,750
All right...
Whatever you say.

250
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,208
Oh, yeah! Goku!

251
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,083
Don't rely on grabbing his
tail! We already tried that!

252
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,791
Yeah, see, Piccolo tried
grabbing that big guy's tail,

253
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,416
and he got hammered
for it, really bad.

254
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,125
[KRILLIN] They all
fought so hard.

255
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,708
I can't believe they're
gone! They did their best.

256
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,333
We all did.
But in the end...

257
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,375
I guess we just didn't
have what it took.

258
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,875
[GOKU] Then I guess...

259
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,416
It's up to me
to finish this.

260
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,791
[GOHAN] Hey, Dad?

261
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,125
Please, come home.
You have to win.

262
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,750
Don't worry.

263
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,458
Well, of course
you'll come home, Goku...

264
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,833
After what
I've seen,

265
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,916
there isn't anything
that could stop you.

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,291
Thanks, Krillin...
Well, it's time!

267
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,500
Try not to worry about
me! I'll be just fine!

268
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,750
[GOHAN whimpering]

269
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,791
You can waste all
the time you want

270
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,833
with your pathetic
'goodbyes'...

271
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,041
But you're simply
postponing the inevitable.

272
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,041
Its too bad.

273
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,708
It seems he's
totally determined

274
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,583
to end things
this way.

275
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,291
He sure would make a
good sparring partner!

276
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,333
Hey, Goku... You're my
friend. We grew up together!

277
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:36,666
Just make sure that we
both grow old together, too!

278
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,541
Right! I couldn't
have asked

279
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,250
for a better best friend
than you, Krillin!

280
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,750
Goodbye, Daddy!

281
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,833
Goodbye, Gohan!
I'm very proud of you!

282
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,958
Hey, I'll bet your Mom
is over at Master Roshi's!

283
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,583
Go give her a big
hug for me, 'kay?

284
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,958
[GOKU] Can you do that
for me, Gohan?

285
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,625
Yes!

286
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,125
[KRILLIN]
Go get him, Goku!

287
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,333
[VEGETA] So, Kakarot! You ready
to get this over with?

288
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,583
I know a better
place than this!

289
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,291
Wherever!
Just lead the way!

290
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,000
Bye, Daddy...

291
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,541
[NARRATOR] And so
it is down to two,

292
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,875
as Goku and Vegeta
prepare to engage

293
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,333
in the ultimate showdown
between good and evil.

294
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,416
Can our hero stand up
to the evil Saiyan

295
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,708
and thwart his plans to
take over the Earth?

296
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,291
Don't miss the
explosive action,

297
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,750
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
