00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,625
You make Buu house!

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,833
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,666
the town folk were
going nowhere fast

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,541
as they tried
in vain to escape

5
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,791
the evil clutches
of Majin Buu!

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,458
[BUU]
Buu put you people to use!

7
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,916
[NARRATOR] It was a bad day
for the helpless citizens,

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,833
who were transformed
into giant lumps of clay!

9
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,750
And what did the diabolical
Buu intend to do

10
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,666
with this great
ball of humanity?

11
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,708
Why construct a
dwelling, of course!

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,250
The proud new neighbor
was moving in!

13
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,958
Meanwhile, in the
safety of the Lookout,

14
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,916
Goku was teaching Trunks and
Goten the Fusion Technique!

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,333
[GOKU] That's it! Oh.
But Goten, your left arm

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,375
is a little bit low!

17
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,750
[NARRATOR] A mastery of the
Fusion Technique would allow

18
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,500
Goten and Trunks to unite
and become one super being!

19
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,750
But before Goku could
complete their training,

20
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,333
it was time for
him to depart

21
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,916
and return to
the Other World!

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,291
[GOKU] Hey, there's nothin'
to be ashamed of, son.

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Goten, gonna take
care of Mom for me?

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,500
Goku, you can't put
it off any longer!

25
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,958
Gotcha.

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,208
[NARRATOR] And so,
Goku's magical day on Earth

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,875
came to an end!

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,458
It was a time of both
joy and sorrow

29
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,000
for his family and friends!

30
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,083
[GOKU] I'll see you
all sooner or later!

31
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,583
Huh? Wow!
Look at that line!

32
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,666
There must be millions of them!

33
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,916
[ATTENDANT 1]
Please remain calm!

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,125
[gasps] That's a whole lot
of dead folks, Baba!

35
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,750
[BABA] Yep, they're dying
like flies down there.

36
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,666
[GOKU grunts]

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,875
[GOKU]
What's that thing made out of?

38
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,750
I almost bit my tongue off!

39
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,291
Why'd you put the brakes
on like that? What's up?

40
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,708
[BABA] I'm having second
thoughts, that's all.

41
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,541
[GOKU]
Huh?

42
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, look! I don't
want to be a worrywart!

43
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,666
But I don't feel
comfortable leaving

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,583
Trunks and Goten
to fight Buu alone!

45
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,750
Oh, so that's what's
buggin' you, is it?

46
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,375
Well, if the two boys
learn the Fusion Technique,

47
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,916
there won't be
anything to worry about!

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,125
Are you kidding?

49
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,958
Do you really think
that those little tykes

50
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,041
can defeat a powerful
monster like Majin Buu?

51
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,250
[GOKU]
Mm-hm!

52
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
[BABA]
I see.

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,708
[BABA]
Hmm! All right, then! Let's go!

54

[SOULS chattering]

55
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,541
Goku, I'm surprised at you!

56
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,916
You're not going to
cut in line, are you?

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
I sure am!
But don't tell!

58
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,208
[BABA laughs] You crack me up!
I'll see you later!

59
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,833
Hey! Thanks for
the great day, Baba!

60
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,916
It was definitely one
to remember! So long!

[ATTENDANT 2] Please approach
in an orderly fashion!

62

I know it's a long wait, but
you're dead. So, just relax!

63

All right, knock it off out
there, you bodiless tramp!

to be sent down below, you know!

people lose their manners

66
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,250
when they lose
their bodies? Huh?

Yeah! Nice to see
ya again! Bye!

the line's the other... way!

And what brings you here today?

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,875
Well, I have a favor to ask!

78
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,291
Could you see if my son,
Gohan, came through here?

79
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,375
What? Do you know
what you're asking of me?

Look! These are
just from today!

Look at that line!
There are millions of them!

Yeah, Earth is under siege!
It's pretty bad.

Well, King Yemma!

91
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,291
My son Gohan can
help to avoid that,

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,416
but I don't even know
if he's still on Earth!

93
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,791
That's why I need your help!

94
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,750

he's checked in yet, please?

well when I'm under pressure!

I don't see a Gohan.
Unless he's on the next page.

No! He's not here!

It's true that I've been
working around the clock,

101
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,500
but I think I would
have remembered

102
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,375
if your son checked in!

103
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:31,416
Really? He's not dead?

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,375
Woo-hoo! Yeah, yeah!
He's not dead! Awesome!

105
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,166
Oh, and Goku!

106
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
A hard case came
through a while ago!

you know this guy?

Ah, yeah!

[YEMMA]
I knew it!

110
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,333
He was a handful,
I can tell you that!

111
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:53,791
Listen! You better behave
yourself in here! Understand me?

112
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,041
[YEMMA]
He was supposed to go below.

113
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,125
But he would have enjoyed that

114
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,708
so I gave him my
stamp of approval

115
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,041

First Gohan, now him!

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
How can he wield the
Z Sword in such a manner

179
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
without any previous training?

stay here with Gohan?
