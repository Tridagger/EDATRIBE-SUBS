1
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,416
Tien kept the
monster Cell at bay

3
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,000
with a barrage of high-powered
energy attacks.

4
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,208
[NARRATOR] No matter
how hard Cell tried,

5
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,500
he could not escape the power
of Tien's ferocious blasts.

6
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,041
[NARRATOR] But Tien's technique

7
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,291
required an incredible
amount of energy,

8
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,625
and soon the courageous
hero could fight no more...

9
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,125
[NARRATOR] Furious at losing
sight of the androids,

10
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,208
Cell demanded that Tien
pay for the interruption...

11
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,958
...with his life.

12
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,708
[NARRATOR] But Goku was not
about to lose another friend

13
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,958
on the battlefield.

14
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,291
Employing his Instant
Transmission Technique,

15
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,041
he arrived in
the nick of time,

16
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,000
rescuing his friend and
challenging the android villian.

17
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,833
[GOKU] I'd really like to
teach you a lesson...

18
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,750
But I need one more day
before I'm strong enough

19
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,125
to go up against you!

20
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm gonna take you down, Cell!

21
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,833
Your days of terrorizing the
Earth will be over for good.

22
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,000
[NARRATOR] And after placing the
near dead Piccolo on his back,

23
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,166
Goku was gone with a flash,

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,375
leaving Cell with
a mouthful of dust.

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,208
[CELL] Well, they won't
get away from me again.

26
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,208
Now I must continue my search.

27
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,875
[NARRATOR] The hunt is on
for the two remaining androids

28
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,916
and Cell won't rest
until 18 is absorbed.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Can Goku complete his
training and stop Cell

30
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,666
from carrying out his evil plan?

31
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,791
Find out today!

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,333
Thanks for waiting, guys.
Did we miss anything?

33
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,875
It's good to have you back.

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,166
[GOKU] Things have gotten
worse since you've been gone.

35
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,083
[GOHAN] Hey, Trunks,
you've changed!

36
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,458
I'll say... Hey, you look
like you're in great shape.

37
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,208
[TRUNKS chuckles]

38
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,791
You were in the chamber
for a whole day.

39
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,083
I've never known anyone who
could last that long in there.

40
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,083
We probably could have
come out a lot sooner,

41
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,500
but father wasn't willing
to leave until he was sure

42
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,958
he'd done all he could do.

43
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,125
He insisted on training
for the full year

44
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,541
even though it
really only took him

45
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,750
a couple of months to trans--

46
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,791
Quiet!

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,333
You've said quite enough.

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,250
Our training is not to
be discussed... Ever!

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,708
[TRUNKS] Well, I guess
you're just going to have to

50
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,166
wait and see for yourself.

51
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,000
So it worked out, I guess...

52
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,833
Heh, heh. Maybe.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,375
I will take care
of everything now.

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,041
There's no need to attempt
the training, Kakarot,

55
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,333
because I'm sure you
would not survive it.

56
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,916
Besides, I can guarantee that
I won't be needing any of you

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,458
to help me take care
of the androids.

58
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,958
You fool!

59
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:18,000
Listen, I don't know how
powerful you think you are,

60
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,791
but you're underestimating
our enemies.

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

62
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,875
While you were in that room,

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,000
Cell swallowed up Android 17
and transformed.

64
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,750
So don't try to tell us
you can handle it.

65
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,666
You don't even know
what you're up against!

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,166
[VEGETA laughs]

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,041
[VEGETA] Clearly,
trying to defeat Cell

68
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,166
has taken its toll
on all of you.

69
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,500
That's why I am offering
to take care of him myself.

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
[TIEN growls]

71
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,041
Vegeta.

72
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,375
I really suggest that you
listen to Piccolo and Tien.

73
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
I mean, you'd have
to triple your strength

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
to stand a chance--

75
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,291
[VEGETA chuckles]

76
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,083
--[BULMA] Whooa!
--[BABY TRUNKS laughs]

77
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:19,083
[BOTH laugh]

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,166
Okay, Trunks, let's get going.

79
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,041
There'll be plenty of
time for fun on the way home.

80
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,208
But right now we better
hightail it to Kami's Place!

81
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
Hey! All right!

82
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:55,666
[KORIN] Whatta day.
Look how blue the sky is today.

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,250
[KORIN squeals]

84
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,208
[KORIN] Hey, young lady,
this is a no fly zone!

85
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,750
[BULMA laughs]

86
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,666
Okay, maybe that was a little
too close. Sorry about that.

87
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,750
Curse them! Those androids!
They escaped!

88
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,916
They couldn't be too
far away from here.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,833
And I will find them soon.

90
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,291
[ANDROID 18] Must you play with
that disgusting creature? Shoo!

91
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,500
Now wake up! We have to
get off this island, 16!

92
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,125
Oh, great. I think you're
starting to malfunction.

93
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,333
All you've been doing is staring
at these birds all day long.

94
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,708
What do you see in
those things, anyway?

95
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,958
Don't you care that Cell's going
to suck me up like he did 17?!

96
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,125
Don't you care that
he's going to kill you?!

97
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:35,166
Oh, wow! So this is
Kami's place, huh?

98
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,375
Yoo-hoo! Hell-O!

99
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,125
[BULMA] Hey, where are you guys?

100
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,833
Look, it's Bulma!

101
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,291
Oh! Hi there!

102
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,666
[GOKU] Bulma, what
are you doin' here?

103
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,041
I brought some things for all
of you. You might need them.

104
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,416
[GOHAN laughs]

105
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,666
Hello there!

106
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,791
[BABY TRUNKS &amp; GOHAN laugh]

107
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,250
[BULMA laughs]

108
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,291
Oh my gosh! Trunks,
what happened?!

109
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,125
I mean, you are Trunks, right?

110
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,916
Uh, yeah.

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,166
Oh! Wow! You've grown!
This a wig?

112
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,291
No, it's real!

113
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
I was in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

114
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,166
I spent a year in there, but
outside only a day had passed.

115
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,333
That's why I've grown a little.

116
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
Oh!

117
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,416
[TRUNKS]
Father and I trained together.

118
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
Huh?

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Vegeta, you don't
look that different.

120
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,875
Why didn't your
hair grow at all?

121
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,916
For your information,
a pure Saiyan's hair

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,625
does not change from
the day that he is born.

123
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,000
[GOKU &amp; BULMA]
Oohh!

124
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,625
Is that true? How 'bout that?

125
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,250
I guess that's why you've
never needed a haircut.

126
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,833
[GOKU]
Hey, yeah!

127
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,000
But I wish I could do something
about these split ends. Ha, ha!

128
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,500
Try shampoo.

129
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't have time to listen
to Kakarot's hair problems!

130
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,208
But I sure wouldn't mind
knowing why you're here!

131
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,041
Hold on, I'll show you!

132
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,208
You see, this fight with
Cell's gonna be tough,

133
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,041
so I thought you guys
might be able to use

134
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,541
some new combat suits.

135
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,958
And if you stop
being a jerk, Vegeta,

136
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,208
maybe you can have one, too.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,333
[GOHAN] It's like the one I used
to wear on Namek! Remember, Dad?

138
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,125
A perfect fit!

139
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,041
Hey! These are
really light! Cool!

140
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,708
So all of these are
Saiyan combat suits?

141
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,625
More or less. I tried to copy
Vegeta's as much as possible.

142
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,541
[GOHAN]
You did a great job, Bulma!

143
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,541
[BULMA] Why, thank you, Gohan.

144
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,208
Hey! Aren't you
going to wear yours?

145
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,583
I am a Namek, not a Saiyan, and
I'm not going to dress like one.

146
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,666
That's right.

147
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,041
I refuse to wear
the same suit as Vegeta,

148
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,333
not after all of the
horrible things he's done!

149
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,333
[VEGETA chuckles]

150
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,583
Aw, come on guys...

151
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,166
They look good and
they fit great too.

152
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,291
There's no need for
you to wear that.

153
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,666
You won't even get
a chance to use it.

154
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,916
So why even bother
putting it on?

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,041
Is that because you plan on
finishing Cell all by yourself?

156
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,458
Well, I hope that you
can pull it off.

157
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,166
Right...

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,958
[GOKU] You want me to
take you over there

159
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,333
with my Instant Transmission?

160
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,958
Oh, please. I don't need
any help from you, Kakarot.

161
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,333
So long...

162
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,333
Oh boy! What an ego!

163
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,375
I'll follow him.

164
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,458
Wait!

165
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,208
You might need these!

166
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,583
[GOKU] Senzu Beans.

167
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,000
I saved these two for you and
Vegeta to use. Here, take them.

168
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,250
[TRUNKS]
Thanks, Goku.

169
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,958
Good luck! And if you
get into any trouble,

170
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,750
get yourself outta there, okay?

171
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,333
Right. Thank you for
everything, Goku.

172
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,333
And I hope that your
training goes well.

173
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,125
I want you to take care
of yourself, Trunks.

174
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,000
And look after Vegeta too.

175
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,833
[TRUNKS chuckles]

176
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,750
[GOHAN laughs]

177
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,208
[TRUNKS]
I'll see you later.

178
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:47,208
Yeah! Great! It's time for us
to start our training, Gohan!

179
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,416
Right!

180
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,958
Wait a minute, Gohan! Hold on!

181
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,208
[stomach growls]

182
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,416
Can we eat? I'm kinda hungry!

183
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,166
Aw... right now, Dad?

184
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,208
Come out!

185
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,875
I should have caught up
with those androids by now!

186
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,458
There's no way they could
have gotten so far away from me.

187
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,458
Not with 16 as injured as he is.

188
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:41,458
They must be hiding on one of
these islands. But which one?

189
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
[CELL] Come on, now!

190
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,041
[CELL] I am not in
the mood for games!

191
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,791
[CELL chuckles]

192
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,416
Of course!

193
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,458
Perhaps I'll be able
to flush them out.

194
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,375
18! Come out now!

195
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,625
I will find you!
Give up now, 18, or else!

196
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,000
If you do not show yourself,

197
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:32,458
I will destroy these islands one
after another until I find you!

198
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,666
Hey! What's up?

199
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,750
[DRIVER] Hey! Watch out!

200
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,458
Hey! Why don't you watch
where you're going buddy?!

201
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,291
What was that?
Something's not right!

202
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,000
It sounds like some
kind of evil monster!

203
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,833
[CELL]
Come out, you android!

204
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:56,250
Reveal yourself! I must
absorb you to become complete.

205
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,000
I know that you can hear me!
Make it easy on yourself!

206
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,833
Come out now and your
suffering will be minimal!

207
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,250
If you do not, you shall suffer
the full extent of my wrath!

208
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,125
This doesn't sound good.

209
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,291
Come out now!

210
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,833
Be warned!

211
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,666
No one is stronger than me and
I will find you eventually!

212
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,541
My powers have grown beyond

213
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,708
anything you can
possibly comprehend!

214
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,083
Join with me and end
this pointless game

215
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,541
of hide and seek now!

216
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:34,458
Your time has come, 18!
I will find you!

217
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:38,291
I command you to show yourself!

218
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,125
So that's Cell!
Heh, heh, heh.

219
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
Nice of him to let me
know where he is.

220
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,291
I can't wait!

221
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:49,625
Soon all will know I am
the strongest in the universe!

222
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,291
Not coming out?!

223
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,791
Then I will begin destroying
the islands one-by-one!

224
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,333
Do you understand?!

225
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
He's crazy!

226
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,625
Do not be afraid, 18.
Please stay calm.

227
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,333
I do not think Cell
would destroy these islands.

228
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,166
You are far too valuable.

229
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,125
He will not run the risk
of destroying you.

230
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,708
[CELL] They still refuse
to show their faces.

231
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,250
Perhaps they don't
believe my threats are real.

232
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,833
I'll show them.

233
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,000
They will learn.

234
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,416
Where to begin? Who cares!

235
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,208
All these islands are
full of worthless lives

236
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,500
that belong to me anyway.

237
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,208
Hey, look up there!
What is that thing?

238
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,791
Wow! He's floating up there!

239
00:16:55,875 --> 00:17:00,416
Oh no! The devil!
He's come for me!

240
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,791
It's all over! This is it!

241
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,791
[CROWD murmuring]

242
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,875
[WOMAN screams]

243
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,500
[screaming]

244
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,083
[CELL] I don't think the
androids were on that island.

245
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,708
I guess I'll move on.

246
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:58,666
You hear me?!
You must come out now!

247
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,291
If you do not, you and
the island you are hiding on

248
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,916
will be destroyed!

249
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
What should we do, 16?

250
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,041
He's destroying the islands
like he said he would!

251
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,500
Do not worry.
Cell will only use a blast

252
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,458
strong enough to destroy
everything but you.

253
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,791
All other life may end,
but you will remain.

254
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:25,333
But what about you, 16? You have
to survive this blast, too.

255
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,250
[ANDROID 16 thinking]
Why is Cell so determined

256
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,125
to become more powerful?

257
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,625
He is already stronger than any
other creature on this planet.

258
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,791
What is he trying to achieve?

259
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,083
What is the point to
this destruction?

260
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,500
[CELL chuckles]

261
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,625
Oh, good! The fireworks
have already started.

262
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,583
[VEGETA chuckles]

263
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,166
[thinking]
I'm coming, Father.

264
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,500
I won't let you do this alone.

265
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,666
[GOKU]
This is wonderful!

266
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,333
[GOKU burps]

267
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,666
Alright! More food!

268
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,125
Aaahhh...

269
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,291
Man, that was great!

270
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,958
Uh, Goku? Are you done?

271
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,416
Oh yeah! Thanks a lot
for the chow!

272
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,166
Now, let's train, Son.

273
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,625
Right!

274
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,875
[MR. POPO] Right this way.

275
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,416
[BULMA]
Go on! You can do it!

276
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,416
That's it! You got it down now.

277
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Whoa! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

278
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,291
You want to get big and strong--

279
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
[GOKU]
Hey, what's going on?

280
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,500
Well, hi there!

281
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,916
Hey! So you're really
going through with this, huh?

282
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,916
Well, Goku, Gohan, it's
your turn. I hope you're ready.

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,416
[MR. POPO]
Go on in.

284
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,708
[GOHAN] Ugh, it's hot in here.
I feel kinda funny.

285
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,916
[GOKU] That's just the gravity,
Gohan. You'll get used to it.

286
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,583
[GOHAN]
Look at this, Dad!

287
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,500
What?!

288
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,291
[GOKU] Talk about your
rooms with a view, huh?

289
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,666
[GOHAN] I don't believe it.
Is this for real, Dad?

290
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,375
[GOKU]
You bet it is!

291
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,916
[GOHAN] We're in the middle
of nowhere! It's amazing!

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,083
Heh, heh, heh! Wow!

293
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,291
Hey, come here!
You've got to see this!

294
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,416
[NARRATOR] Goku and Gohan
are about to face

295
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,375
their greatest
challenge together

296
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,041
inside the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber!

297
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,458
If they can endure
the intense training,

298
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,291
they will become
Ascended Saiyans.

299
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,458
But it's not going to be easy.

300
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:49,500
Planet Earth is depending
on them. They must succeed.

301
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:54,958
Don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
