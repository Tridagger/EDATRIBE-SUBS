00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,416
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,375
Gohan and Krillin successfully
summoned the Dragon

3
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,291
with the help of their
Namekian friend, Dende.

4
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,875
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the enraged Frieza

5
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,500
was rushing to the scene
in his bid for immortality!

6
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,250
With danger approaching, will
they make their wishes in time?

7
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,583
Find out today!

8
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,083
Man, check him out!
I'm glad he's friendly!

9
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,125
At least, I hope he is!

10
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,791
Yeah, me too. He's... huge!

11
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,791
You who have awakened
me from my slumber.

12
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,500
I will grant you
any three wishes

13
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,125
that are within
my power to fulfill

14
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,666
as a boon for
summoning me.

15
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,500
[KRILLIN] Hey, alright! Oh, wow!

16
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,416
That's a heck of a deal, huh?
Three wishes instead of one!

17
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,625
Didn't I tell ya? Namek's
great! You can't beat it!

18
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,083
Yeah, no kidding!
Namek's awesome!

19
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,208
No, please guys! Don't
disrespect the Dragon!

20
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,958
Uh... okay. I know one!

21
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,875
Well, Vegeta's men killed
some friends of ours.

22
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,708
Could you please ask
Porunga to bring them back

23
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,208
to our dimension?

24
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,583
Yes, I can try it.

25
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:08,625
[DENDE speaking Namek]

26
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,625
Your wish is unacceptable.

27
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,166
Huh?!

28
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,500
Only one life can be restored
for each wish that you use.

29
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,375
What?! Oh no!

30
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,541
[KING KAI] Hmm...!

31
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
Darn! What a pity!

32
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,916
Seems that Gohan and
Krillin can only wish

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,958
three people back
to their dimension.

34
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,416
What? That's not gonna cut it!

35
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,750
I think he's right.
Let's see here...

36
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,791
Chiaotzu, Yamcha,
Piccolo, and me!

37
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,458
[YAMCHA] Just count
your eyes and add one!

38
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,958
What do you know?!

39
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, I know this: I'm one
of the three going back! Huh?

40
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,125
Wait! No! You need to fix
your hair! You should stay!

41
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,375
[TIEN growls]

42
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,041
Fix my hair?! So I like
to comb my hair alot!

43
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,083
At least I have hair, Cue Ball!

44
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,541
Cue Ball, huh? You jerk!

45
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,708
[CHIAOTZU] Hey, guys!
Why don't we draw straws?

46
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,750
Yeah, right! There's
one small problem:

47
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,250
You and Tien are telepathic!

48
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,916
[CHIAOTZU] We're not
cheaters! How dare you!

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,833
[ALL growl]

50
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,875
I'm the one that needs to go!

51
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,750
That's right! I need to
talk to Gohan right now!

52
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,541
What?!

53
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,083
Please, sir!

54
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,500
Look! I'm enjoying the fresh
air, but I don't have all day.

55
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,041
If you can't make up your mind,

56
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,458
just wish for "nothing"
three times so I can go.

57
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,958
Wow. A Dragon with
a sense of humor.

58
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
[DENDE] Krillin,
we need to hurry!

59
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,791
Frieza could be on his way!

60
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,500
He's right! There's no time
to stew over this, Gohan!

61
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,041
We have to make
up our minds!

62
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:43,666
Uhh... So one stays,
but which one?

63
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,416
Man! It's gonna be a tough
call any way you slice it.

64
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,458
I understand that you'd
like to talk to Gohan now.

65
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,041
But, that wouldn't be
fair to the others!

66
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,791
You're darn right!
Let me talk to Gohan!

67
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,041
I've known his father
since he was just a kid

68
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,666
so let me tell him what to do!

69
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,458
You can forget that!

70
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,333
Yeah, that's not fair!

71
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,708
I get it! I know what
the deal is now.

72
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,291
You saved Gohan's life and now
it's payback time! Of course!

73
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,708
That's not it! Trust me, please.

74
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:28,791
Alright, I will. You're the only
one not acting like a rabid dog.

75
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,916
Thanks.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,125
Gohan, can you hear me?
It's me, Piccolo!

77
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,708
[KING KAI] You don't have
to yell, you know!

78
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
[PICCOLO] Oh, sorry. Gohan?

79
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:38,875
Huh?

80
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,250
[PICCOLO] It's me, Piccolo!

81
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,000
[GOHAN laughs]

82
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,500
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

83
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,791
[PICCOLO] Listen
carefully, Gohan!

84
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,375
Uh... Where is he?

85
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,875
I can hear you,
but I can't see you!

86
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,500
[PICCOLO] I know! King Kai
opened up a direct

87
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,458
telepathic link
between the two of us!

88
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,666
And just ten cents
a minute! That's my rate!

89
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,708
Hey, I still got it!
Hee, hee, hee!

90
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,208
Huh? What?

91
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,625
[GOHAN whimpers]

92
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,500
[GOHAN] Piccolo?
Are you still there?

93
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,750
[PICCOLO] Yes, Gohan, I know
you don't have much time

94
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,291
so I'll get straight
to the point.

95
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,750
Gohan, use your first wish to
wish me back to your dimension!

96
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,833
Uh-uh!

97
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,666
Hey, no way, Piccolo!
That's not fair!

98
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,916
Be quiet!

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,750
Huh?

100
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,333
[CHIAOTZU] Whoa...

101
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,875
Better! Now Gohan listen up!
Wish me back there first!

102
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
Huh?

103
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,875
If I come back, then Kami
will return to Earth as well!

104
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,916
And so will the Dragon Balls!
You know what that means.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,750
Hey! He's right! Then we'll
have plenty of wishes!

106
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,458
To bring the others
back... That's brilliant.

107
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,833
Yeah, you got it.
What a great idea!

108
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,833
Man, you're the bomb!

109
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,791
You rock, Piccolo!

110
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,625
Alright! And now,
for the second wish.

111
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,541
[ALL] Hm?

112
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,541
[PICCOLO] Gohan, after you wish
me back to your dimension,

113
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,041
I'd like you to wish me
over to the planet Namek.

114
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,541
That's where I belong!

115
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,458
It's my people that Frieza
destroyed! It's my fight!

116
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,500
He needs to pay for what he's
done and I intend to make him.

117
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,041
Hey, you promised
never to fight Frieza!

118
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,500
[KING KAI yells]

119
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,916
I know how much you
care about me, old man!

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,250
But I've got to do
what I've got to do!

121
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,500
Gohan! Are you clear
on the first two wishes?

122
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,125
Yes! Crystal clear, Piccolo!

123
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,583
That a boy! I guess I'll be
seeing you real soon then!

124
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,708
Yeah! We'll be fighting side by
side again! Just like on Earth!

125
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,666
[KING KAI whimpers]

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,875
Hey! What's the deal?! Piccolo!
I see! Now, I get it!

127
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,208
Bad boy!

128
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,791
You get what you want
from my training and then

129
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,000
tell me to take a hike!

130
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,583
Heh, well, to be blunt,
yeah. That's right.

131
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,500
What?! You brat! Ah!

132
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,750
[PICCOLO] So this is it. This is
what it's like to have a mom.

133
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,625
[KING KAI growls]

134
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,583
That does it!

135
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,250
[TIEN] Whoa! Easy does it!

136
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,375
Down, big guy!

137
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,666
[TIEN] King Kai!
Settle down! Please!

138
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,125
We can't let you go
until you calm down!

139
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,583
[KING KAI yells]

140
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,041
[PICCOLO] It's time!

141
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,958
Time? Time to get annhilated!
Time to get blown away!

142
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,541
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into!

143
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,500
[KRILLIN] Alright. Well,
what do you think, Gohan?

144
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,416
Should we follow
Piccolo's plan or not?

145
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,166
Yeah!

146
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,916
[KRILLIN] Dende!

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,333
Yes, what?

148
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,000
For the first wish, could
you please ask the Dragon

149
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,416
to bring our friend Piccolo
back to this dimension!

150
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,875
Right! B-Bring Piccolo back.
I think I can do that.

151
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,000
[GOHAN] Well, this is it.

152
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,833
This is the whole
reason we came here!

153
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,833
Huh! Something's
on the way here now!

154
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:54,083
It's Frieza!
I know it! It has to be!

155
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,958
No! Agh...!

156
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,166
[VEGETA] Come on, Kakarot!

157
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,833
Darn it! Hurry!

158
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:13,208
You're no good to me until your
strength is fully restored!

159
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,875
Rats! This isn't good!

160
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,791
Ah! What?!

161
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,916
Darn it! How could I
have slept that long?!

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,416
It's-It's dark out!

163
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,625
Wait a second! It's not night
time! The horizon isn't dark!

164
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,875
What in the world is going on?!

165
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,625
Oh, no... Oh, no, no!

166
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,458
Darn it! I should have never
trusted those Earthlings!

167
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,250
Hurry up, Kakarot!

168
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:54,666
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

169
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:05,500
Alright. It shall
be done. As you wish.

170
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,250
[VEGETA] How could
I be so foolish!

171
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,375
Those little punks
are gonna pay for this!

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
[VEGETA] Darn it! Where are
they? Where are they?!

173
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:22,541
Oh, come on! They have to
be around here somewhere!

174
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,416
Huh?!

175
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,875
Look at
that thing!

176
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,625
Th-They summoned him! The
Earthlings have tried to summon

177
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,666
the Dragon of Legend without me!

178
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,875
Alright! I am not going to
let this shake my composure!

179
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,250
Damn it!

180
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,500
[VEGETA] And to top it off,

181
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,208
Frieza should be arriving
any minute now!

182
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:00,125
They're at my ship! How dare
they try to outsmart me?!

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,916
Hey! Cool! You're alive!

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,375
Yes...

185
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,583
You did it, Gohan!
Now! Wish me there!

186
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,166
Come on! Do it!

187
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,750
Go! I don't care! Your
generation just can't be taught!

188
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,250
[KING KAI screams]

189
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,458
[MR. POPO hums]

190
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,291
[MR. POPO laughs]

191
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,375
A butterfly!
And at this altitude!

192
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,958
[MR. POPO laughs]

193
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,416
[MR. POPO gasps]

194
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,125
[MR. POPO] It's... It's the
ghost of Kami! Oh, no!

195
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,416
Are... Are you... Are you real?!

196
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,041
Indeed. Thanks for
watering the plants

197
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,208
while I was gone, Mr. Popo.

198
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:14,250
Popo? What's wrong?
You look pale, my friend.

199
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:19,041
Oh, Kami! You're too much.
I... I missed you!

200
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,541
I am running out of patience!

201
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:28,416
Speak, now! Tell me
your next wish, now!

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,625
Quick! Dende, tell him that
we'd like our friend Piccolo

203
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,125
brought here to the planet Namek
from wherever he is right now!

204
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,083
That's our next wish!

205
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,500
Okay, yes! Got it!

206
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,958
Huh?!

207
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,208
Hey, guys! He's awake!

208
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,416
And I bet he got up on the
wrong side of the bed!

209
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:56,541
[DENDE speaks in Namek]

210
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,791
I will grant this wish.

211
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,416
The one you call Piccolo will
be brought to Namek now.

212
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,875
[GOHAN chuckles]

213
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,250
[CHIAOTZU] Hey.
There he goes. Wow!

214
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,083
Fool! He could get hurt.

215
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,625
[PORUNGA] Your second
wish has been granted.

216
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,625
Now, speak. Tell
me your last wish.

217
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,000
Say what? But I don't
see him! Do you?

218
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,583
No! I don't!

219
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,958
Hey, sir! We...

220
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,416
[DENDE] Guys, please! If Porunga
says he's here, he's here!

221
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,166
We're the ones who messed up!

222
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,750
He could be anywhere
on the planet!

223
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,375
What? Oh, no!

224
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,958
But we could use
our last wish

225
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,000
to wish him to
this exact spot.

226
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,583
[DENDE screams]

227
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,375
[VEGETA growls]

228
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,333
Vegeta!

229
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,833
What's the matter? You two
look a little surprised

230
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,166
to see me.

231
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,500
[GOHAN] Well, nothing really.
Everything's fine!

232
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,166
[VEGETA] No, I don't
think everything is fine.

233
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,958
[VEGETA] And I will tell you
why everything is NOT fine.

234
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:23,125
Because you two... You
summoned the Dragon, didn't you?

235
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,833
Shame on you! How dare you?

236
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,375
I spoiled you with new suits,
took you in, saved your lives,

237
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,750
all of that! And this
is how you repay me?

238
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,333
Well, you can kiss
each other goodbye!

239
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
Hold on a second!

240
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,916
You only wanted to use
one wish for yourself, right?

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Well, we've only used
two of our wishes,

242
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,541
and there's
still one left!

243
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,458
[KRILLIN] Gohan! Why did
you have to tell him that?!

244
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,041
[VEGETA] Thank you!

245
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:49,666
Huh?

246
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,041
[VEGETA chuckles]

247
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,416
I'm glad you're not as
smart as I thought you were!

248
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,458
[VEGETA laughs]

249
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,250
[FRIEZA growls]

250
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:04,500
Huh? What in the world
is that bizarre apparition?!

251
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,000
Four of them are
gathered beneath it.

252
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:11,541
No, it can't be! Why those
scurvy, low-life opportunists!

253
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
How could they?!

254
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,666
Speak! Make your last wish now.

255
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,583
[VEGETA] Alright, kid!
We're out of time!

256
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,875
Ask him to grant
me eternal life!

257
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,958
Now!

258
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,166
Come on!

259
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,583
Come here, you
little green bean!

260
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,625
You need a little
encouragement, huh?!

261
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,666
Hey!

262
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,125
[VEGETA] Hurry up, kid!

263
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,375
[DENDE] Let go! Please stop!

264
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,250
Look: Do or die, we need
to stop this, now!

265
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,083
Well, it seems to
make sense, but, well...

266
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,333
Frieza's on the way

267
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,333
and my dad still needs
more time to recover!

268
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:09,291
So this is it, huh?
Namek, my home...

269
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,583
[PICCOLO] This is what I've
yearned for my whole life,

270
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,416
without ever
knowing it was here...

271
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,833
No! No time! I have
to stay focused.

272
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,791
Let's see here...
Gohan, where are you?

273
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,041
[PICCOLO] No...

274
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
Not there either...

275
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:42,666
They're not even close! I guess
the Dragon had bad aim! Huh?!

276
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,375
[PICCOLO] I've never felt a
power like this one!

277
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,833
But it's dark!

278
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,041
Man! He's stronger than
I imagined he would be!

279
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,125
[PICCOLO growls]

280
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,875
Ah, well, what the heck.
Shoot, you only live once.

281
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,416
[PICCOLO chuckles]

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,833
Well, looks like
I'm back in action!

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,625
[DENDE] I'm sorry, sir! I can't!

284
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,541
Make your last wish now!

285
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,083
[PORUNGA growls]

286
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,875
You heard him, make the darn
wish! What's the matter?!

287
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,666
Don't tell me you'd rather
be destroyed by Frieza?

288
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,625
Don't you get it? I'm the
only one who can stop him!

289
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,583
[KRILLIN] I can't take
much more of this...

290
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,541
[GOHAN] Uh, oh! Hey!
We're out of time!

291
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
Frieza's close! I can feel it!

292
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,625
Desperate times call
for desperate measures!

293
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,791
Hm?

294
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,541
Dende! Do whatever
Vegeta tells you! Now!

295
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,583
[BOTH] Huh?!

296
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,750
[KRILLIN] We're definitely
all going to be wiped out

297
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,541
if we don't do
something fast!

298
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,166
Man! I hate this!

299
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,583
Damn! But I guess trusting
Vegeta is better

300
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,208
than dying, right?!

301
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,458
Yeah, I guess so...

302
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,750
[VEGETA laughs]

303
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,291
Kid, I like your style.

304
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,208
--[VEGETA] Hurry up!
--[DENDE screams]

305
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,166
[VEGETA] Do it, boy!
Make the wish!

306
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:24,041
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

307
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,708
[VEGETA] This is it!
It's really happening!

308
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,708
[GOHAN whimpers]

309
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,375
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

310
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,500
[VEGETA] Yes! A
new Vegeta is born!

311
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,083
An indestructable power
that only can get stronger

312
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,791
from every battle!

313
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,500
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

314
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,083
Vegeta!

315
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,083
[DENDE] Huh...?

316
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,416
What's going on?!

317
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,833
[DENDE screams]

318
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,625
[KRILLIN] Oh, man...
I don't belive it!

319
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,625
[GOHAN gasps]

320
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,666
[ALL gasping]

321
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,750
Hey! What's the deal!
I don't feel any different.

322
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,375
Is this supposed to happen?
Does this normally happen?!

323
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,291
Well, someone speak up!
Am I immortal or not?!

324
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,833
[DENDE] No, you're
not immortal...

325
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:07,500
Dende? Hey, are you alright?
What's the matter?

326
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,416
It's Guru... He's gone.

327
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,333
[gasping]

328
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,791
I'm sorry, Dende...

329
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,750
He was like a
grandfather to me...

330
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,000
Guru, I-I asked you not
to die while I was gone...

331
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,833
Wait a minute-- That's it?!

332
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,833
Hey! You mean that
when this guy kicks it,

333
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,416
the Dragon Balls are
completely useless?!

334
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,083
Yes. They're part of him.

336
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,875
[VEGETA] Idiots!

337
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,541
So, I guess we're back to
where we started from!

338
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,750
I was about to kill you guys
for betraying me, wasn't I?

339
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,166
Yes, I remember now!
That was it!

00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,208

[KRILLIN whimpers]

345
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,041
So, you are the ones? Naughty!

346
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,958
I don't see how three
shrimps and a burnt-out Saiyan

347
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,750
managed to defeat
the Ginyu Force.

348
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,333
But now it's your turn!

[DENDE &amp; VEGETA whimper]

351
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,833
Don't worry, it
won't hurt too bad.

352
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,833
Really, death is my specialty.

[NARRATOR] The dark hour
has finally arrived!

354
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,291
Is it lights out for
this unlikely foursome?

355
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,625
Or can Piccolo lend a hand?

356
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,291
Is his training with
King Kai enough?

357
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,500
Will Goku wake up in
time to help his friends

358
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,875
on the next Dragon Ball Z?
