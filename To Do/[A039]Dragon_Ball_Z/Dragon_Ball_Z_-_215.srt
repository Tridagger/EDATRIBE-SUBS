[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,041
as Trunks and Mr. Satan fought
a "friendly" exhibition match,

3
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,083
the rest of the Z-Fighters
were confronted

4
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,375
by a mysterious stranger.

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,750
Although this curious young man
greeted Goku as a friend,

6
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:32,333
his smile seemed to be masking a
far more ominous intent.

7
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:36,291
Later, Trunks and Goten did a
little masking of their own!

8
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,583
[NARRATOR] And when
the time finally came

9
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,833
for the sixteen finalists of the
World Martial Arts Tournament

10
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,166
to secure their
places on the fighting board,

11
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,166
one of the competitors,
it seemed,

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,750
had developed a particularly,
er, youthful personality.

13
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,791
[NARRATOR] Bulma and ChiChi
watched in suspense

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,041
as the final pairings
were posted,

15
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,375
but neither could have expected
this round one shocker:

16
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,500
Vegeta versus Goku!

17
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,916
[GOKU] That figures.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,833
[NARRATOR] The last of the
numbers has been drawn...

19
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,291
[ANNOUNCER]
The champion is number 10!

20
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,416
[NARRATOR] Now with
a full board of fighters,

21
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,875
and eight exciting matches in
the first round,

22
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,541
everyone's ready
for the action...

23
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,833
The fighting starts today!

24
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,291
[KRILLIN] This is so exciting!

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm gonna totally cut loose!

26
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:27,375
Now... Let the World Martial
Arts Championship begin!

27
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:44,500
[CROWD cheers]

28
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,416
[REPORTER #1] Mr. Satan,

29
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,041
now that the pairings
have been decided,

30
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,250
how do you feel
about the tournament?

31
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,416
Well, I think that we've got a
decent lot of competitors

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,041
all willing to lay their
strengths on the line...

33
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,083
And for the good
of all the fighters,

34
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,125
I hope they keep
their heads on straight

35
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,583
and save all of their
power for the ring.

36
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,333
'Cause they'll certainly need it
if they come up against me!

37
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,750
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

38
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,208
I have to say, Hercule,
you really are rather confident

39
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,500
for a man who just got
beaten up by a youngster.

40
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,250
Hey! That was just
an exhibition bout...

41
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,166
You got that?

42
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,166
What do you want personally
out of this match?

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,500
Well, there's only one thing
that any fighter worth his salt

44
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,208
could ever want.

45
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,666
So, what you're saying
is that your goal today

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,166
is to win the grand prize.

47
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,541
No, no, no...

48
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,250
I just want to do my best.

49
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
And if it just so happens
that, you know...

50
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,125
I win... Hey!

51
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,958
So what do you think
of today's line up?

52
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,541
Ah, Well I don't know.

53
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,291
Who's my first
unlucky competitor?

54
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,958
I believe it's a
woman named Number 18.

55
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,541
Oh... Really?!

56
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,416
Wow! That'll... be... close!

57
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,750
[MR. SATAN laughs]

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,125
[FRIAR #1 thinking] I could have
sworn I told him that already...

59
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,083
[GOHAN] Hmm...
Something's wrong...

60
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,208
Hey, that Piccolo guy looks like

61
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,333
he's really stressed
out over there.

62
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,708
Does he get like this
before every fight?

63
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,541
He's a pretty serious guy.

64
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,708
This is all just part
of his usual routine.

65
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,166
[VIDEL] Hmm...

66
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,208
[GOHAN] Piccolo... What is it
that's eating at you like this?

67
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,625
Are you really
that worried about Shin?

68
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,208
Should I be worried
about Kibito?

69
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,333
Soon Kibito, that which we came
for will be within our grasp...

70
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,833
[GOKU grunting]

71
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,791
You can't seem
to sit still, Goku.

72
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,708
[GOKU] Haha... I'm just excited.

73
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,291
Well, with you fighting
Vegeta right off the bat,

74
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,916
it's kind of like having the
last round first, you know?

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,750
[GOKU laughs]

76
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,041
[VEGETA] Hm?

77
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,875
That's why I'm stretching.

78
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,333
Huh?

79
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,416
You alright?

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,208
Yeah... Looks like
he's got his game face on!

81
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,791
[SHIN] I think we'll
find them in here...

82
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, Piccolo!
Looks like you and I

83
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,916
are gonna be fighting
each other in the second round!

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,875
Just try to take it
easy on me, okay?

85
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,041
Gotta try and look good for
the Mrs. Know what I mean, Goku?

86
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,958
Hey, Hon, I've got a great idea.

87
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,583
Let's trade! You take my slot,
and I'll fight Mr. Satan!

88
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,208
Forget it! He's mine...

[CROWD cheering]

90
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,166
I've been waiting
for this forever...

91
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,083
Videl's in the third match.
I'm so nervous!

92
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,708
Stop worrying about
things so much, babe.

93
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Her only competition today
is her father!

94
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,333
Yeah, you're right...

00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,791
Hey, there's the Great Saiyaman!

96
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,875
Ooh, what if he and
Videl have to fight?

97
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,458
Just think!

98
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,833
The city's two greatest crime
fighters in the ring together!

99
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,791
Isn't it exciting?

100
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,666
Nah... Nobody with an
outfit that stupid looking

101
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,208
could be strong enough
to get past the first round.

102
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,583
[COMMANDER]
Now don't forget the cheer.

103
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,125
"Videl! Videl! You're
the one! Videl!" Got it?!

104
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,375
[POLICMEN cheer]

105
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,083
For you.

106
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,083
Thank you.

107
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,458
Well, you're sure
in a good mood!

108
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,000
Ready for things to start, huh?

109
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,333
I guess I'm still a
little giddy over Trunks' win

110
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,000
in the Junior Division
this morning.

111
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
And now, of course,

112
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,208
Vegeta has the best chance of
winning the World Championship!

113
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,791
Father and son winning
on the same day?

114
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,541
You bet I'm in a good mood!

115
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,958
[BULMA laughs]

116
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,166
[CHICHI] I don't think so!

117
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,625
Huh?!

118
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,625
Vegeta's a long way
from winning

119
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,666
especially if he has to fight
my Goku in the first round.

120
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh?! Need I remind you, ChiChi?

121
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,583
My Trunks beat your Goten. "Like
father, like son", they say...

122
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,958
They were just little kids
fighting, and besides!

123
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,666
Your boy cheated!

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,625
I hate to be the one to
break it to you Bulma,

125
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,333
but my Goku has
never lost a fight.

126
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, so that's why he
wears that halo?!

127
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,583
Now you listen to me!

128
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,166
My husband has done nothing but
train for the last five years!

129
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,958
He's wearing that
championship belt home, sister!

130
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,916
[CHICHI] Goku's fighting so he
can feed his family

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,750
and put his children
through school!

132
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,250
He's got heart, you know.

133
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,333
He's not out there for cheap
thrills like your husband...

134
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,708
Vegeta will win!

135
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,375
[CHICHI] No, Goku will win!

136
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,125

[CHICHI] Goku!

138
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,958
[BULMA] Vegeta!

[BOTH snarl]

140
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,833
Please, ladies, don't
you think this is a

141
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,125
little childish--

Yes! Ladies and gentlemen,
I am proud to present to you,

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the first match in the
World Martial Arts Tournament!

148
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:19,083
So... Let's get Krillin and
Pintar out here to the ring!

149
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,083
[GOKU] Break a leg, Krillin.

150
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,500
Just so long as
it's not one of mine!

151
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,208
[KRILLIN grunts]

152
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,125
Hey!

153
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,208
[PINTAR chuckles]

154
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,916
Why don't you
save it for the ring?!

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,375
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you down there.

156
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,750
I'm surprised that you've
stayed this long, little man.

157
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,708
I was worried that I'd end up
beating myself into a pulp.

158
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,541
But now that you're here,
I guess you'll do just fine.

159
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,333
[PINTAR grunts]

160
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,625
You know, I asked my assistant
to call and reserve you

161
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,875
a private room at the hospital.

162
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,916
[PINTAR laughs]

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,833
You'll thank me.

164
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,333
[KRILLIN growls,
PINTAR giggles]

165
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,791
[ANNOUNCER] We now have both
fighters for the first match

166
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,666
entering the ring!

167
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,500
[ANNOUNCER] Krillin is quite
the accomplished fighter,

168
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,208
but this is his first tournament
appearance in many years.

169
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,250
It's a pleasure to
see him back in the ring.

170
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,083
Pintar's fierce fighting
at the last championship

171
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,875
proved he had stamina.

172
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
He may have lost
in the semi-finals,

173
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,291
but he's back today
ready to change his luck!

174
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:21,333
[PINTAR chuckles]

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,583
[PINTAR yells]

176
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,416
[CROWD cheers]

177
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,125
The man that Daddy's
fighting looks really scary.

178
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,208
I hope he doesn't hurt him.

179
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,541
Oh, Maron, I wouldn't worry
about anything like that.

180
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,083
Your dad's one of the
strongest fighters around.

181
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,375
Is that true?

182
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,500
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

183
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,708
[YAMCHA laughs]

184
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,000
I certainly wouldn't
want to fight with him!

185
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,416
[MAN A] Look how much
bigger Pintar is!

186
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,250
[MAN B] There's no way
this'll be a fair fight.

187
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,208
[MAN A] I feel bad
for Krillin...

188
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,916
[ANNOUNCER] There's a lot of
talk down here on the floor

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,208
about fairness in regards
to the size difference

190
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,416
of our competitors.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,208
Let me just say that
this is a competition

192
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,666
where size truly
does not matter, folks!

193
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,291
You can believe...
what he's saying...

194
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,625
if you want to...
But I tell ya this...

195
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,083
You're gonna definitely think

196
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,791
size matters when
I'm done with you!

197
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,250
[KRILLIN] Hmph.

198
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,875
[KRILLIN] I'm gonna have to
take it easy on this guy.

199
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,125
I don't want to cause him
any more brain damage!

200
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:13,708
[KILLA talks incoherently]

201
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,208
[KILLA mumbles incoherently]

202
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,333
[PINTAR growls]

203
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,291
[FIGHTER screams]

204
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,375
[PINTAR laughs]

205
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,166
[ANNOUNCER] Now,
let the battle begin!

206
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,791
[PINTAR yells]

207
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,666
[KRILLIN] Huh?

208
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,708
[PINTAR grunting]

209
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:49,958
[PINTAR laughs]

210
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,041
I told you
size matters, boy.

211
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,125
I guess you see
what I'm talking about.

212
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,500
You must be ready
to forfeit the match, right?

213
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,666
Run home like a little girl?!

214
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,791
[KRILLIN sighs]

215
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,375
You are so lame...

216
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,208
[PINTAR laughs]

217
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,375
Sticks and stones may
break my bones,

218
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,250
but you can never hurt me!

219
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,250
And just to prove to you
that I'm right,

220
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,583
I'm gonna give you
a little something.

221
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,041
[KRILLIN sighs]

222
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll give you the
first punch, shorty!

223
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,041
Right here in the gut.
C'mon! Now!

224
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,250
[KRILLIN growls

225
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:23,875
'Kay!

226
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,125
[KRILLIN yells]

227
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:31,250
[PINTAR screams]

228
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,458
[CROWD gasps]

229
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,791
[KRILLIN yells]

230
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,625
[PINTAR screams]

231
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,416
[KILLA screams]

232
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,208
[ANNOUNCER yells]

233
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,291
[PINTAR grunts]

234
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:47,125
[PINTAR whimpers]

235
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,375
[ANNOUNCER] Out of the ring!

236
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,750
Pintar has landed
out of the ring,

237
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,208
which makes Krillin the winner!

238
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:59,875
[CROWD cheers]

239
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,958
[BOTH] Yes! Yes! Yes!

240
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,125
Daddy, you're the best!

241
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,541
That's right!

242
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,958
[ANNOUNCER] Now, that's the
kinda fighting

243
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,166
I'm talking about!
That is entertainment!

244
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, nice going, Krillin.

245
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,625
[KRILLIN laughs]

246
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,208
That was nothing.

247
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,166
Sorry, Piccolo, but it
looks like they want

248
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,833
the next victim out in the ring,

249
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,916
so you better put
your fighting gloves on.

250
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,041
Hey, why are you getting
all bent out of shape,

251
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,791
I'm just fooling around.

252
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,000
This match should be
a piece of cake for you!

253
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,041
[KRILLIN] What's the matter
with you guys?

254
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,500
Man... All of you, loosen up!

255
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,166
[GOTEN] Trunks, give me a sip.
It's really hot down here.

256
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,875
If I give you some, then they'll
find out what we're doing--

257
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,083
[GOTEN] You don't get it!

258
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,708
I'm burning up,
and I want a sip of juice!

259
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,083
You better give me some

260
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,916
or I promise I'll knock you
right off my shoulders!

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,375
Here!

262
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,041
[GOTEN] Wow! That was great!
Could you get me another?

263
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,166
Now, for match number 2...

264
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,958
And I guarantee you that this
will be another colossal brawl!

265
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,250
Majunior versus Shin!

266
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:20,333
[CROWD cheers]

267
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,875
Well then...

268
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,833
This should be interesting.
Don't you think, Piccolo?

269
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,833
[ANNOUNCER] This is the first
year Shin has participated

270
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,375
in the tournament.

271
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,833
He's a man of few words, so
we know very little about him.

272
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,166
And that could spell trouble for
our other competitor Majunior!

273
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,500
Someone who,
if I remember correctly,

274
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,791
came close to turning
this arena into rubble

275
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,500
the last time he was here!

276
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,750
[ANNOUNCER] Uh... this time,
try to leave the stadium intact.

277
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,958
Okay?

278
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,625
Am I right to say that
the big green fellow

279
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,541
was one of the guys who jumped
up between Cell and Mr. Satan

280
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,625
when they were fighting?

281
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,250
I think so.
I saw him on the tele.

282
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,750
[PICCOLO thinking] What is this
strange energy I sense?

283
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,750
[KRILLIN] I don't understand...

284
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,750
Is this guy really getting
under your skin that much?

285
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,666
Yeah...

286
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,291
If you say so...

287
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,166
He just doesn't seem to be
all that powerful to me.

288
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,250
[VEGETA thinking]
Come on, Shin...

289
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,458
Why don't you show us

290
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,083
why you have the little
Namek all worried?

291
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,041
[ANNOUNCER] Fighters...
let the second match begin!

292
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,708
[PICCOLO thinking]
Why can't I focus my power?

293
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,875
[PICCOLO growls]

294
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,791
[PICCOLO thinking] Why am I
holding back like this?!

295
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,833
I've never even met him
before today!

296
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,666
And yet, there's
something about him...

297
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,958
C'mon, guys, would one of you
throw a punch already?!

298
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,708
This is bogus, man!

299
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,208
The match has already started so
you guys can fight anytime now!

300
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,416
[MAN A] Can't you hear him?!

301
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
He said the fight's
already started!

302
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,875
[MAN B] Stop staring at each
other already and do something!

303
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,500
This is boring!

304
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,083
Well, folks, it looks
like we've got ourselves

305
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,791
an old-fashioned stand off!

306
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,000
[PICCOLO thinking] I've sensed
this kind of energy before.

307
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,583
But where?

308
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,166
[SHIN laughs]

309
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,083
[PICCOLO thinking] No...
It couldn't be...

310
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,833
[GOKU gasps]

311
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,666
What's wrong with Piccolo?
Why won't he fight?

312
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,208
[VEGETA thinking] He's afraid!

313
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,166
[PICCOLO thinking] It can't be
him... Why would he be here?!

314
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,125
I promise you'll know soon.

315
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,000
[PICCOLO gasps]

316
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,250
[SHIN] You'll know soon...

317
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,416
But for now, let's enjoy
our little match.

318
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,625
[PICCOLO gasps]

319
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,708
[GOKU thinking] Piccolo!

320
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,875
[ANNOUNCER] So, is this
gonna happen or what?

321
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,708
[PICCOLO] I'm sorry.

322
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,208
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

323
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,750
I can't.

324
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,541
[SHIN gasps]

325
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,708
[ALL gasp]

326
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,333
Quitting?!

327
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,458
Does this mean... you're
withdrawing from the match?!

328
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,291
[PICCOLO] Yes, it does.

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,250
[SHIN thinking] Interesting...

330
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,291
Yes, that Namek was the
guardian of this planet

331
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,541
at one time.

332
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,208
Perhaps he knows more
about me than I thought.

333
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,750
Well, you heard it! Majunior
has withdrawn from the match.

334
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,416
That makes Shin
the winner by default!

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,458
[CROWD yells]

336
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,958
What's going on?

337
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,208
I paid good money to see
some serious action!

338
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh yeah? You made me
pay for the tickets.

339
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
[GOHAN] Hey, Piccolo.

340
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,583
[KRILLIN]
What went down out there?

341
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,666
Is he that strong, Piccolo?

342
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,583
Yes...

343
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,500
Stronger than you can imagine.

344
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,000
[gasping]

345
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,458
[KRILLIN] Uh...

346
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,833
Please tell me you just got
a headache or something...

347
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,708
