00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,916
Gohan began his training
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,250
a room that defies the normal
constraints of time and space.

5
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,416
His mission: To achieve
the level of Super Saiyan

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,416
under the watchful
guidance of his father.

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,375
[GOKU] Use the pain of loss.

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,375
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Vegeta began his assault

9
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,541
on the evil super-power, Cell,

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,666
who was still one android short
of completing his evolution!

11
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,875
Even without
absorbing Android 18,

12
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,666
Cell had already gained a
enormous amount of strength

13
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,000
when he successfully integrated
Android 17 into his body.

14
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,333
And itt seemed that
he was now unstoppable

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,791
[CELL gasps]

16
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,208
That one was free...

17
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,541
Now I'm going to show you
what true power really is!

18
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,958
[NARRATOR]
But has Vegeta actually

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,708
surpassed him in strength?

20
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,333
[CELL] Vegeta!? You've changed!

21
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,708
You've... You've
become something else!

22
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,291
Yes... I am Super Vegeta.

23
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,958
[ANDROID 18] Cell's... scared!

24
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,375
[TRUNKS] Father has
him against the ropes.

25
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,875
He's won the game.

27
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,583
How did you acquire this
new strength?! Enlighten me!

28
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,166
I do a lot of
push-ups and sit-ups!

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,583
And I drink plenty of juice!

[CELL] Listen here!

32
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:09,500
I came from the future where you
were destroyed by Android 17!

33
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,625
And now I've
absorbed Android 17!

34
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,375
I have all of his power at my
disposal in addition to my own!

35
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,958
So tell me, how could
you be stronger than me?!

36
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,041
It's not possible!
You're bluffing!

37
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,375
Look! If you think
I'm bluffing, call my bluff.

38
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:30,458
Here, I know you're confused
so let me make it easier on you.

39
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,666

43
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,708
[KRILLIN] Wow! Vegeta's
turned his back on Cell!

44
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,833
I don't see either of the
androids down there...

45
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,666
Man, that's not a
good sign at all!

46
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,416
That means that 18's
probably been absorbed already!

47
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,416
[KRILLIN growls]

48
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,458
Well, maybe it's all
for the best anyway...

49
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know if I
could have used this thing.

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,916
[VEGETA] Hmm?!

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,916
Hey, that's my

Our feelings sometimes

So this is it, huh?
Now that's a joke!

winning, right?

you truly are strong...

But it's dangerous to
let it go to your head.

183

Hey, it's Trunks.

184
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,041
Man! What a change.
He looks totally different!

185

The Hyperbolic Time
Chamber must be a killer!

186
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,166
Maybe I should think about
spending a day in there!

187

I need to bulk up myself...

188

Come on, girls!
You can do it! One, two...

189

And that's the news, folks!

190

you guys watch T.V.?!

I can't stop thinking
about Tien and the others...

196
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,500
Well, when Goku's your
husband and Gohan's your son,

197
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:01,125
you can either let it all go
or worry yourself to death.

198
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,916
So, I'm trying to let it all go!

199

were just being heartless...

Master Roshi's really
stressed out over there.

really write that down.

Why, thank you, sir.
