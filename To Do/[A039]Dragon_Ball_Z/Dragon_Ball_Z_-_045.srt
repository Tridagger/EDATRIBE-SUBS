1
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,375
more visitors arrived
on Planet Namek.

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,416
[KRILLIN] It looks
like a Saiyan ship!

4
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,583
[BULMA whimpering]

5
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,291
It's Vegeta!
It's gotta be.

6
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
Rrrgh... Raagh!

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,416
[NARRATOR]
Vegeta landed on Namek

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
with only one thing
on his mind:

9
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,166
Revenge.

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,958
[VEGETA] My time
has finally come.

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm about to remove the only
obstacle standing in my way.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
[BULMA squealing]

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,625
W-Was that Vegeta's
ship again?

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,125
[FRIEZA laughing]

15
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,875
Heh, heh...

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,041
[NARRATOR] The young
adventurers have no idea

17
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,666
that the mighty Frieza
is also on the planet

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,208
and in possession of four
of the Dragon Balls.

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,541
Now, their simple mission
is moving quickly

20
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,166
into messy territory.

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,875
Stay tuned for
Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,083
[BULMA sighing heavily]

23
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,708
This may be the most
depressing day of my life...

24
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,875
Yeah, today isn't
starting off too well.

25
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
So, what do
you think, huh?

26
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,958
[KRILLIN] Who could have been
in that second ship?

27
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,708
[GOHAN] Hmm...

28
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
[HENCHMAN]
For you, Lord Frieza.

29
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,125
Very good.
Only three more to go.

30
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,791
[chuckling]

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,458
Guard them
carefully, Dodoria.

32
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,833
Vegeta wants them,
and I'd rather not

33
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,416
waste any time hunting
them down again.

34
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,333
Lord Frieza,
Cui has just arrived.

35
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,958
He's been
tracking Vegeta,

36
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,458
so we should know his exact
whereabouts soon enough.

37
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,333
Also, those small power
levels we noticed earlier

38
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,750
appear to
have vanished.

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,000
However, it's unlikely
they've traveled far

40
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,000
from their last
known position.

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,750
I've already sent out two
scouts to search the area.

42
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,666
Whoever it is, they won't be
able to hide from us for long.

43
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,875
Fine. But I don't want my
scouts chasing apparitions

44
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,625
when they could be helping
to search for Vegeta.

45
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,458
Yes, I understand your
concern, Lord Frieza.

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,291
And I would agree,
if I didn't believe Cui

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,458
was more than capable of
handling the job on his own.

48
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,708
His power level is much
higher than Vegeta's.

49
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,583
I don't think you'll
have to worry about seeing

50
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,416
that monkey-tailed
abomination again.

51
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,166
Ahh... There you are.

52
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,375
[CUI laughing]

53
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,083
Hello, Vegeta.

54
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,458
Do you read me?
Fair warning...

55
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm coming for you.

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,750
And I'm brining a little
message from Lord Frieza!

57
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,750
So, you've been following
me, have you Cui?

58
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,041
Well, I have a message
you can take to Frieza.

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
His days are numbered,
as are yours!

60
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,833
[CUI laughing]

61
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,750
[CUI] Take a good look
at your scouter.

62
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,583
My power level is way
higher than yours!

63
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,583
[CUI chuckling]

64
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,375
[CUI] You arrogant Saiyan.

65
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,875
It's about time someone
put you in your place.

66
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,708
[GOHAN] What are we
supposed to do now?!

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,125
Well, it's not doing us any
good just sitting here.

68
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,625
So it's settled! We'll
stick to the original plan!

69
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,791
I'll hurry back to
Earth and get Goku!

70
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,291
You guys
have the radar,

71
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,000
so you shouldn't
have any trouble!

72
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,791
See you in
two months!

73
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,750
Hold on, Bulma. 
Give us a second.

74
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,208
Ahh...

75
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,708
Ah?!

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,875
[KRILLIN] Uhh...

77
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,875
So, um, Gohan.

78
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,875
Hmm?

79
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,875
Whaddaya say you and me,
well, maybe we should go, too?

80
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,583
Wha--?

81
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,041
Hmm?

82
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,208
Hey, c'mon! Two enemy
ships have already landed.

83
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,708
Even with the Dragon Radar,
the odds are stacked against us.

84
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,583
It might be best
to cut our losses.

85
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,916
I'm not saying I'm
scared or anything,

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,541
I'm just lookin'
out for Gohan!

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,041
ChiChi would kill me
if I let him get hurt!

88
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,375
But, we can't
just leave now.

89
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,875
If we do, then Vegeta will
get all of the Dragon Balls.

90
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,125
Uhh. Yeah, well, uh... Maybe
we should let him have 'em.

91
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,875
I mean, we can always
try again next year!

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,250
That's not funny,
Krillin.

93
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,458
You know what kind of
damage he can do with them.

94
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
We're talking
about Vegeta.

95
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,041
Krillin, look!
Someone's coming!

96
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,916
Hmm?

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,625
Ahh!

98
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,416
[BULMA squeals]

99
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,666
Is it...
Vegeta?

100
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,916
Don't think so...

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,833
This energy level feels
way too low to be his.

102
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,791
Keep your
eyes peeled.

103
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,875
They should be right
around here somewhere.

104
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,416
I bet it
was a native.

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,250
[BULMA]
Who are they?

106
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,833
Let's hope
they're Namekians.

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,166
[BOTH scream]

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,625
Those are definitely
not Namekians!

109
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,916
Hey, who's that?

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,791
Whoever they are,
they're not from around here.

111
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,666
Looks like we get to
have ourselves some fun.

112
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,583
Zarbon said if
they're not Nameks,

113
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,208
we don't even have to question
'em before we kill 'em.

114
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,916
[laughing]

115
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,416
Check out what
they're wearing!

116
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,833
That's weird, it
looks like they're

117
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,833
wearing Saiyan
battle uniforms.

118
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,583
But they
aren't Saiyans.

119
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
What are they?

120
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,458
I guess they're hired
muscle or something, but...

121
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,791
Either way,
it's not good.

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,375
They sure don't
look friendly.

123
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,333
Aren't you two
gonna do something?

124
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,166
You've gotta
protect me!

125
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,458
Gohan. Keep your
energy suppressed

126
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,125
until we know what
we're dealing with here.

127
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,666
All right.

128
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,250
[SCOUT B laughing]

129
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,708
This will be easy.

130
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,000
Their power levels
are almost non-existent.

131
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,875
They're
probably tourists.

132
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,416
Heh, heh, heh. Let's attack
their ship first.

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,125
It would be a shame
for them to get away

134
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,875
before we
have our fun.

135
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,375
Sounds good!

136
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,791
[BULMA screams]

137
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,000
No! Not
the ship!

138
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,833
[SCOUT A laughing]

139
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,000
[SCOUT B] Did I destroy
your precious ship?

140
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
Please forgive me!

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,666
Well, I think
I've seen enough.

142
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,333
Time for us to do some
serious powering up!

143
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,125
Hmm!

144
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
[GOHAN growls]

145
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,458
Hey, take a
look at that.

146
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,583
Looks like
the little one

147
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,708
is having stomach
cramps or something!

148
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,458
[SCOUT B] Huh?

149
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:39,625
[BOTH laughing]

150
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,333
[SCOUT B] Huh?

151
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,875
Wait! Hold on!

152
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,166
Their power reading
just skyrocketed!

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,375
[BOTH whimpering]

154
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,666
Let's do it!

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,125
Yeah!

156
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,958
[SCOUTS yelling]

157
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,416
[GOHAN] Haah!

158
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,208
[KRILLIN] Raah!

159
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,750
[GOHAN] Ha-ha!

160
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,333
[KRILLIN laughing]

161
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,333
That was easy
enough, huh?

162
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,875
Don't look
so happy!

163
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,000
[BULMA quietly sobbing]

164
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,416
--[BULMA] Our poor ship.
--[KRILLIN] What's wrong?

165
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,125
[BULMA] How are we
supposed to get home now?

166
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:34,166
Zarbon, what is it?
Something's troubling you.

167
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
It's the search
party we sent out.

168
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,750
Both of our scouts stopped
transmitting at the same time.

169
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,041
I realize those scouts
weren't the best that we had,

170
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,791
but it still worries me that
they were defeated so quickly.

171
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,375
Whoever is responsible
for this attack

172
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,541
knows what they're doing, and
they seem to have the ability

173
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,916
to suppress their power.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,875
Well. That's
very interesting.

175
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,750
But why are you wasting my
time with these things?

176
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,208
The two unknown power levels
came in at fifteen hundred.

177
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,583
It's possible Vegeta has brought
with him some extra help.

178
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,458
Only fifteen hundred?

179
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,583
That means nothing to me,
nor should it to you.

180
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,666
Just concentrate on
retrieving the Dragon Balls

181
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,541
and we'll be on our way.

182
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,583
They'll be dealt with when
I destroy this puny planet.

183
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:52,708
[GOKU quietly grunting]

184
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,041
[thinking] Yes...
Just a little more.

185
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,666
[grunting continues]

186
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,791
[water bubbling]

187
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,666
[GOKU] Ngh!

188
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,458
[CHICHI] Goku?

189
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,416
Uh... ChiChi?

190
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,375
Honey, what
are you doing?

191
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,208
[GOKU chuckling sheepishly]

192
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,166
Well, I was bored,
so I started to, uh--

193
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,791
Goku, really.

194
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,083
Why can't you understand
that you're badly wounded?

195
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,041
You need to
stay in bed.

196
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,791
Look at you.
Your hair is all wet.

197
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,291
You don't want to catch
a cold now, do you?

198
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:46,666
[GOKU wailing]

199
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,708
I hope Gohan is taking
good care of his hair

200
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,791
like I
asked him to.

201
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,041
That boy's
hair is so fine

202
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,875
that he has to keep up
with washing it daily.

203
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,541
I wonder if he's
using the conditioner

204
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,000
I gave him
before he left?

205
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,250
I don't want him
coming back to Earth

206
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,333
with a frizzy mop
on top of his head.

207
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,083
And he better not be
using his hair dryer,

208
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,541
because that will
only make it worse.

209
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,500
His scalp is already
dry enough as it is.

210
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,666
[thinking] Gohan, I sure
hope you're doing okay.

211
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,458
[BULMA whimpering]

212
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,416
It's no use! We'll never
get back to Earth!

213
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,583
We'll be stuck on this
planet for eternity!

214
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,583
[KRILLIN] Come on, Bulma.
We need to get out of here.

215
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,500
Whoever is sending those
scouts knows our location now,

216
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,291
and there's bound to
be more on the way.

217
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,333
Don't worry, Bulma.

218
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,833
I'll bet if we find
some Namekians

219
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,666
they can help us
repair the ship.

220
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,958
We're not going to be
stuck here. I promise.

221
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,666
We'll make it back
to Earth somehow.

222
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,791
Okay.

223
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
He's right.
We'll find a way.

224
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,375
We just have to
keep our cool.

225
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,166
That was the first
thing Piccolo taught me:

226
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,750
Never panic!

227
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,125
Oh, sure...
Easy for you to say!

228
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,000
[BULMA crying]

229
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,458
Bulma?

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,458
Hah!
It's about time.

231
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,125
Took him
long enough.

232
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,000
[CUI laughing]

233
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,666
So nice to
see you, Vegeta.

234
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,291
You have no
idea how much

235
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,875
I've looked
forward to this.

236
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,750
The day when I
would get to wipe

237
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,500
that smug little smirk
off your face forever.

238
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,833
You should have never
defied Lord Frieza.

239
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,833
Oh, we'll
see about that.

240
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,916
[VEGETA chuckling]

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,166
Cui, you just
don't get it, do you?

242
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,791
I'm through
taking orders.

243
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,791
It's time Lord Frieza
started bowing to me.

244
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,458
[CUI] You're old news, Vegeta.

245
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,666
You turned on Frieza and you'll
pay for it with your life.

246
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,500
Maybe, yes,
but not today.

247
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:07,250
[VEGETA growling]

248
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,166
Wha--? M-My scouter's
going haywire!

249
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,625
[growling continues]

250
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,958
That's right! I've been
suppressing my power.

251
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,541
It's a little trick
I learned on Earth.

252
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,541
Impossible! Your power level
was never anywhere near mine!

253
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,916
Idiot! Do you really believe
that you can keep up

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,875
with my experience
in battle?

255
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,458
I am constantly fighting
on the front lines.

256
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,708
I have been to the brink
of death and back again!

257
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,958
Meanwhile,
you've been hiding

258
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,750
behind the shield of
Frieza, growing soft!

259
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,750
[VEGETA yelling]

260
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,625
Twenty-two thousand?! I've
never seen a reading that high!

261
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:48,250
[shouting continues]

262
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,458
Zarbon. What happened?

263
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,500
I don't know. It must be
some kind of malfunction.

264
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,916
For a second there,
it registered

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,708
Vegeta's power level at 22,000,
and then it shorted out.

266
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,250
22,000? You've got
to be kidding me.

267
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,666
It must be that older
scouter model you're using.

268
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,208
Let me check
it on mine.

269
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,041
The number?

270
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,041
It... doesn't make
any sense.

271
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
This stupid thing
can't be right!

272
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,750
Now it's reading
twenty-four thousand!

273
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,041
Twenty-four?

274
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
Are you sure you're
reading that thing right?

275
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,208
It would mean Vegeta's power
level is even higher than ours!

276
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,583
I'm sure! It must be
some kind of a trick.

277
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,541
He's never been
above 18,000...

278
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,791
[FRIEZA] Is it really
so surprising?

279
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,125
Don't forget
that Vegeta

280
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,708
has been in heavy
combat for a while now.

281
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,416
With all the
fighting he's done,

282
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,666
especially on Earth,

283
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,833
he must have picked up
some new techniques.

284
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, but...

285
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,083
But nothing. There's
no need for concern.

286
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,916
It's only 24,000.

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,125
And while that may seem
impressive to some,

288
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,541
compared to me,
it's still insignificant.

289
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:58,083
[FRIEZA laughing]

290
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,916
[FRIEZA] Why do you think
Vegeta is so desperate

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,458
for the
Dragon Balls?

292
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,625
Hmm? I'll tell you.
He knows that without them,

293
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,791
he doesn't stand a
chance against me.

294
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,750
That's why he went to
Earth against my orders.

295
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,583
And that's why he's come
to this wretched planet.

296
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,958
He's been secretly
plotting to overthrow me,

297
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,583
biding his time, waiting for
his opportunity to strike.

298
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,041
And now, with the hope of
the Dragon Balls in sight,

299
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,583
he dares to
oppose me openly.

300
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,791
That stupid,
arrogant fool...

301
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,625
I am going to enjoy making
an example out of him.

302
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,291
Wait! Hold on, Vegeta!
I thought of a great idea!

303
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:43,041
I could join forces with you!
I never liked Frieza anyway...

304
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,750
And with both of us
working together,

305
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,666
we can take Zarbon and
Dodoria, no problem!

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,833
Think about it, Vegeta!

307
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,416
We've fought so much that we
know each other's moves

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
like the back
of our hands.

309
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,875
We'd make a
fantastic team!

310
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,458
[VEGETA] Stop blabbering
like a pathetic fool, Cui.

311
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,000
Your cowardice
makes me sick.

312
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm not lying!

313
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,750
[VEGETA growling]

314
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,958
Please, you've got to
believe me, Vegeta!

315
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:17,375
[growling continues]

316
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,833
Hey! Look,
it's Frieza!

317
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
Huh? What?

318
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,625
Idiot!

319
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
[CUI] Ah-ha!

320
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,958
Rraaagh!

321
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,708
Huh...?

322
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:52,333
[CUI laughing]

323
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,375
He should've taken my
advice back on Planet Frieza.

324
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
I tried talking
some sense into him,

325
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,541
but, oh well...

326
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,583
[VEGETA] Is that so?

327
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,166
Huh?! Aaah!

328
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,833
Apparently your idea of advice
is to submit to my adversary,

329
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,500
and you know
I won't do that.

330
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,166
How'd you
escape that?!

331
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,416
Once again you've
underestimated your enemy,

332
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Cui, and you won't be walking
away from this mistake.

333
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,500
But--! I--Aah!

334
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,041
What happened to
all that confidence

335
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,541
you had built up
for yourself?

336
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,541
It doesn't seem to
be working anymore.

337
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,791
[CUI whimpering]

338
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,250
[CUI] Aah!

339
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,708
[VEGETA growling]

340
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,083
[CUI screams]

341
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,541
[VEGETA] Rrrgh...

342
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,000
Raah!

343
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,500
[VEGETA] Heh, heh...

344
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,250
Goodbye.

345
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,958
See you in hell, Cui.

346
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,875
It looks like Zarbon
was right after all.

347
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,500
We really underestimated
Vegeta's power level.

348
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,625
He destroyed Cui in
a matter of seconds!

349
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,000
[FRIEZA] There's still nothing
to be concerned about.

350
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,833
Continue your search
for the Dragon Balls.

351
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,541
That's all
that matters.

352
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,250
[thinking] I'm sure
they've sensed my energy

353
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,625
through their scouters,

354
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,833
so they know I'm here. I can
take Zarbon and Dodoria,

355
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,791
I'm confident of that.
But Frieza...

356
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,416
Frieza is still
much too powerful.

357
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,833
I can't risk a
direct confrontation

358
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,875
until I've collected
all seven Dragon Balls.

359
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,083
Wait, of course! Without
all seven, they're useless.

360
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
Which means, if I
can find just one,

361
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,625
Frieza won't be able
to make his wish.

362
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,125
[VEGETA chuckling]

363
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
And then, after
he and his goons

364
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,375
have gone to all the trouble
of collecting all six,

365
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll sneak in
and take them

366
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,000
right from under
their noses...

367
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,041
[laughing]

368
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,250
[thinking] Ah, yes...

369
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,125
I can almost feel my
immortality already.

370
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,875
Lord Frieza, we've
detected a group of Nameks,

371
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,500
not far in
that direction.

372
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,416
Well, that's good news.

373
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,791
And with any luck, they'll
have the fifth Dragon Ball

374
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,041
in their possession.

375
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,625
I'm sure we can convince
them to part with it.

376
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,083
But stay on
your guard.

377
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,000
We have a few troublesome
little pests lurking about.

378
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,708
Yes. Right.

379
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,833
[FRIEZA]
Very well. Let's go.

380
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,375
That's it, Frieza. Find
those Dragon Balls for me.

381
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,083
Each one you gather brings you
one step closer to your doom!

382
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,500
[VEGETA laughing]

383
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
Come on, Bulma.
Let's pick up the pace.

384
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,625
They'll catch us if we
don't find a place to hide.

385
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,208
[BULMA panting]

386
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,625
You guys can fly, can't you?
Why don't you just carry me?

387
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,250
Well, you know
we would, Bulma,

388
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,833
but, when we fly, it puts
out way too much energy.

389
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
Sorry, but they'd pick
up our power levels

390
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,416
on their scouters
for sure,

391
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,083
and then they'd know
exactly where to find us!

392
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,416
[BULMA screams]

393
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,791
[KRILLIN] Hey, look!

394
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,125
I found a cave.

395
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,291
It should be a great spot
to lie low for a while.

396
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,041
You're kidding,
right, Krillin?

397
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,208
You can't expect me
to live in that hole.

398
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,916
[BULMA sobbing]

399
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:24,875
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin...?

400
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:25,958
Huh?

401
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,375
Are you sensing that?
That energy...

402
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,666
Think so.
It feels pretty strong,

403
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,416
and it's
still rising.

404
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,875
I don't know.
Whoever that is, it's--

405
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,375
Hmm! Ah!

406
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,166
Trouble! Everyone get into
the cave and hide, right now!

407
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,875
[NARRATOR] Once again,
our heroes find themselves

408
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,166
standing directly
in danger's path.

409
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,083
But for now, they are
still in the dark

410
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,541
as to the identity of
the approaching foe...

411
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,333
Could it be Vegeta? Or is it
someone far more sinister?

412
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,916
Find out...
Next Dragon Ball Z!
