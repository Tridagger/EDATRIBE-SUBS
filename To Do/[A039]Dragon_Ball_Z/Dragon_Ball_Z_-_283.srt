1
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] It looked to be
lights out for Vegeta

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,500
on the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,208
until the World Martial
Arts Champion himself

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,000
stepped in to
challenge Majin Buu!

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,083
[NARRATOR] The champ was
cruisin' for a bruisin',

6
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,083
but when Buu tried to attack,

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,166
he became crippled with agony!

8
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,041
Until, he hocked up the
source of his pain, that is,

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,250
and spit it out for good!

10
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,041
[NARRATOR]
It was the gentle Buu.

11
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,166
And now that his kind influence
had been expectorated,

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,791
the evil Buu was going to
make Hercule dead! But wait!

13
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,833
[BUU] You leave alone!
Him Buu's buddy!

14
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,791
[NARRATOR]
And so, the battle between

15
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,000
the good and evil Buu's began.

16
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,541
Meanwhile, Goku attempted
to gather enough energy

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,041
to join the action!

18
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,916
[GOKU] I need to relax.
Let go. I'm way too tense!

19
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,375
[NARRATOR]
It was a horrifying sight to see

20
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:20,500
the great Super Saiyan Three
completely sapped of his power.

21
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,916
Can there be any
hope of victory now?

22
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,083
[growls]

23
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,750
[MR. SATAN] Get him, Buu!
Yeah, come on, pow!

24
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,875
[barking]

25
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,958
[GOKU gasping]

26
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,916
Hey! What's the deal?

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,583
Were you playing some kind
of stupid joke on me, or what?

28
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,250
That didn't tickle, you know!

29
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,708
[panting]

30
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,083
Sorry, I misjudged.

31
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,166
Man, how strange!

32
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,875
When I was training
in Other World,

33
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,416
Super Saiyan Three
was, well, easy!

34
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,375
But this body, it chugs.

35
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,583
Yeah, I'll bet it uses
twice as much energy.

36
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,375
Wait a minute, guess
you're pretty mad.

37
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,291
[KID BUU grunts]

38
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,125
[BUU groans]

39
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,625
[MR. SATAN]
Buu!

--[MR. SATAN] Buu!

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,791
[MR. SATAN]
Unhand him, you scoundrel!

46
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,541
Lousy runt! How dare
you hurt my friend!

47
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,916
I'm gonna turn you inside out!

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,541
[MR. SATAN grutning]

49
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,291

[BEE barks]

51
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,750
Ah! Turn you into chocolate!

52
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,416
[BUU]
Huh?!

53
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,125
[KID BUU chuckles]

54
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,208
[screams]

55
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,291
[BUU]
Bad little Buu!

56
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,125
[BUU, KID BUU grunting]

57
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,250
He can't even land
a punch. Come on, Buu.

58
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,291
Hang in there. Don't die!

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,250
[VEGETA thinking]
Darn it!

60
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,208
We can't overpower him,

61
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
we're just going to
have to outsmart him!

62
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,583
[VEGETA thinking] There's
got to be a way! But how?

63
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,333
[VEGETA gasps]

64
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,166
Supreme Kai! Dende! Old Kai!

65
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,791
If you're listening to me, I
need to talk to you right now!

66
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,375
Uh?!

67
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,833
[VEGETA] I need your assistance!
Come on, can you hear me or not?

68
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,750
[ALL gasp]

69
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,583
[OLD KAI]
Yes, yes! We're here.

70
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,583
Good! Now, look. Go to the
new planet Namek right away!

71
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,791
Quick, there's no time to waste!

72
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,750
Gather the Dragon Balls.

73
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,416
[DENDE]
I'll have to tell them what for.

74
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,250
To save our hides!
That's what for!

75
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,083
But if you don't hurry,
it'll be too late!

76
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,750
[OLD KIAI]
The Dragon Balls?

77
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,958
We can't use them to
settle our affairs.

78
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,708
[DENDE] But Sir, Vegeta needs
them! He must have a plan.

79
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,250
Plan schmann! No can do.

80
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,625
But this isn't our affair!
Don't you see? It's everyone's.

81
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,666
And if we don't do everything
in our power to help,

82
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,583
we're as guilty as Buu.

83
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,166
All right! Take it easy!

84
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,916
You made your point.
Now, let's get going.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
[DENDE]
Thank you, Sir.

86
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,291
Well, it's about time.

87
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
Hey, I know you've got a plan.

88
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,958
[VEGETA]
Yes! And?!

89
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Well, I hate to pry, but,
um, what is it, exactly?

90
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,500
Kakarot, how many times have you
saved the world up till now?

91
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,750
Hm. What? How many?
I'm not sure.

92
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,916
[VEGETA]
Just a ballpark.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,916
Well, gosh! Half a
dozen, at least!

94
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,291
[VEGETA]
Then perhaps it's time

95
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,125
to let the world fend
for itself, for once.

96
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,333
[gasps]

97
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,166
[DENDE]
Wow! It's just as I remember.

98
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,958
Hmm? Not bad! Nice, short grass.

99
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:13,166
Uh. Yes, but where is everybody?

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,083
This is too good to be true!
It even smells the same!

101
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,083
Ahh! My beautiful home!

102
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,750
[MOORI]
Well, it's good to see

103
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,958
you haven't forgotten
about us all together.

104
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,375
Feeling a bit homesick
perhaps, Dende?

105
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,000
--[OLD KIAI] Hm? Oh!
--[DENDE laughs]

106
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,583
[DENDE]
Moori! It's really you!

107
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,083
[NAMEKS murumur]

108
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,291
[DENDE] Hi, everybody!
It's good to see you all again!

109
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,375
Elder, you truly are
the picture of wisdom

110
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,875
and good health.

111
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,916
Oh, Dende! You've grown into
a strong and noble guardian.

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625
Haven't you, my boy?

113
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,208
Well, sort of!

114
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,000
The planet I was guarding,

115
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,750
it, kind of, met with a
little accident and blew up.

116
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,583
[OLD KAI]
Excuse me!

117
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,666
I hate to interrupt
your lovely reunion,

118
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,833
but we do have something
of a crisis on our hands.

119
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,583
Yes, very true.

120
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,583
Elder! We're in danger!
Please, help us out!

121
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
Sir, with your permission,

122
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,666
we need to summon Porunga
as soon as possible!

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,583
Hmm... I See, well, uh...

124
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,083
You know our rules concerning
the use of the Dragon Balls.

125
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm surprised that you would
make such a request, Dende.

126
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,958
[DENDE]
But, Sir!

127
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
[MOORI]
Yes?

128
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,125
[DENDE]
I, uh. Uh.

129
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,041
[MOORI]
I'm disappointed in you, Dende.

130
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,125
[NAMEKS laughing]

131
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,916
[MOORI] You shouldn't
have given up so easily!

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,208
I was only testing you, my son!

133
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Of course, you
can use the balls.

134
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Sometimes, a guardian
must follow his heart

135
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,541
instead of the rules!

136
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,458
Ha. Lord Kais, forgive me, Sirs!

137
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,875
I really just couldn't resist.
Please, name your wishes.

138
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,958
[clears throat]
Dende, do the honors!

139
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,166
Gladly! Thank you!

140
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,416
[DENDE]
Vegeta! Vegeta, it's me, Dende!

141
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,083
We're on Namek right now,

142
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,291
and we have all seven
of the Dragon Balls!

143
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,500
We just need to know
what your wishes are.

144
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,250
[VEGETA]
Got it!

145
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,916
Now, listen carefully, Dende!
This is very important!

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,541
[DENDE]
Ready when you are!

147
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,208
I have two wishes
I want to make.

148
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,833
First, I want the planet
Earth to be restored

149
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,291
to its original state.

150
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,083
And second, I want all of
the people who were killed

151
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,541
since the morning of the
World Martial Arts Tournament

152
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,083
to be brought back to life!

153
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,958
Do you understand?

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,208
[VEGETA] Did you get that,
Dende? Those are my two wishes!

155
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,541
Uhh! Yes! I understand!

156
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,791
Should I make the wishes now?

157
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,125
[VEGETA]
Yes, right now!

158
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,958
[DENDE]
I-I'm sorry...

159
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,000
Dende! I'm putting my
faith in Vegeta's plan,

160
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,125
and I'd like for you
to do the same, okay?

161
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,458
[DENDE]
Of course, Goku!

162
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,291
What would you like the
third wish to be, Vegeta?

163
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,125
Only those two wishes matter
to me, so do what you please.

164
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,375
[GOKU]
Hey, just out of curiosity,

165
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,083
why didn't you ask the Dragon
to bring all of the people

166
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,000
who were killed
by Buu back to life?

167
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,958
Wouldn't that be easier?

168
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,208
Ha. No thanks! That would mean
Babidi would be revived,

169
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,583
and I never want to
see that little imp again!

170
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,750
Also, that wish wouldn't
restore all the innocent lives

171
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,166
I destroyed at the stadium.

172
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,416
I see! Wow! I'm impressed.

173
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,666
You really thought
this thing through.

174
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,250
[gasps]

175
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,708
No! I almost forgot! Porunga!

176
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,041
He only has the power to

177
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,125
bring one person
back to life, per wish!

178
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,791
Mm! You're kidding me!

179
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,625
That's right! He's
different than Shenron!

180
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,500
[DENDE]
This is awful!

181
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,291
We didn't give
Porunga that ability

182
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,875
because Nameks don't believe
in wishing people back to life.

183
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,500
[MOORI laughs]

184
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,083
As Earthlings say: Chill out!

185
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,125
After that Freiza debacle,

186
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,375
we restyled the Dragon Balls
and increased Porunga's power.

187
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,958
You mean, he can grant the wish?

188
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,583
Ah, yes he can.

189
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,208
Oh, sure, just great.

190
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,708
So much for the natural
evolution of the Universe!

191
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,083
[BUU screams]

192
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,833
[DENDE] Vegeta! Seems I was
wrong, everything's a go!

193
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,208
Thank goodness!

194
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,083
Please, proceed now!

195
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,708
[DENDE]
Right! We're on it!

196
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,541
[MOORI]
Allow me, I'll give it a whirl.

197
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,250
Arise, Porunga!

198
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:36,000
[OLD KAI, KABITO KAI gasp]

199
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,791
[PORUNGA]
Why have you awakened me?

200
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,500
[gasping]

201
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,458
It wasn't me!

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,041
[MOORI thinking]
What a magnificent sight.

203
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
[DENDE]
Porunga!

204
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,791
[PORUNGA growls]

205
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,791
Wow! He's huge! Amazing.

206
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,750
Why have you summoned me?

207
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,750
Name you first wish.
and I will grant it!

208
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,250
Ah, well, Mr. Guardian of Earth.

209
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,166
Go ahead! Get your planet back.

210
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,666
[gasps]

211
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,208
All right, Earth.

212
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,291
This time I'll keep you free
from harm, or I'll die trying!

213
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:50,208
I can't hear you!

214
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:59,666
[speaking Namekian]

215
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,458
[PORUNGA growls]

216
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,291
That is not an easy wish!

217
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,666
Okay, it shall be done.

218
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,541
Look! The Earth!
It's as good as new!

219
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,500
[laughing]

220
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,041
[PORUNGA] The Earth has been
restored to it's rightful place!

221
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,416
What is your next wish?

222
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Uh...

223
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,583
Well this one's gonna
be hard to translate.

224
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:16,083
[speaking Namekian]

225
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,208
I don't understand!

226
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,625
Oh, please use your power

227
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,166
to restore the lives of
all those who died on Earth

228
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,291
since the wizard
Babidi arrived there,

229
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,958
except for the most evil ones!

230
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,041
[PORUNGA] Do you realize
what you're asking of me?

231
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,500
[gasps]

232
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,333

Yes, I do!

[roars]

234
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:51,250
[PORUNGA] What you ask will take
some time, but it shall be done.

235
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,708
[gasps] Thank you!

236
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:57,583
Oh! Good heavens! Is such
a thing even possible?

237
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:10,375
[MR. SATAN groans]
Darn it! I said let go of him!

238
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,541
[barks, growls]

00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:20,250
[MR. SATAN, BUU grunting]

240
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,333
Let go of him or I'll
rip your stinkin' head off,

241
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,708
you bug pink pretzel!

242
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,166
[MR. SATAN groans]

243
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,041
Aahh! Stop!

[BUU groaning]

249
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,833
Shoot, Kakarot, check
it out! Do you feel that?

250
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:45,458
Yeah, the good Buu is
losing energy, and fast.

251
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,083
He won't last! We're
running out of time!

252
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:55,625
Blast it! Ah! What's
taking them so long?

253
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,291
Dende! Hurry it up, we haven't
got all day, you know!

254
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,000
[OLD KAI] Yeah, yeah, we
hear you, you hot head.

255
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,000

[PORUNGA]
Your wish has been granted!

The people of Earth have
been restored to their home!

people are back, they're alive!

00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,750
Superb!

262
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey! So what's next,
what's the plan? Huh?

[gasps]

264
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,875
Your halo, it's gone!
You're alive again!

You lucky dog!

266

Guess what else?!

267
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,166
The evil people
weren't wished back.

268
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,375
Verdict's in, you're a good guy!

269
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,416
Huh?!

270
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,125
What the heck! I'm
alive! I'll be darned!

271
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:06,083
Yep, we're alive all right.

[GOTEN]
I think we're back on Earth!

278
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,125
[TRUNKS]
That means we're alive!

279
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,833

282
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,333
or are we really back
on Kami's Lookout?

You've always been crazy!

[VIDEL] Maybe so, but
we really are back!

286
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,041

I know! I'll bet you're
going to have

291

Let's do it! Now, it's time!

297
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,166
It's time? Time for what?

298
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,791
The Spirit Bomb.

299
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,833
That's your big idea?
A spirit bomb?!

Vegeta prepares to implement
the final phase of his plan!

304

But can a Spirit Bomb
really save the day?

305

[GOKU]
A spirit bomb. Yeah right.

Goku's not so sure!
