Previously on Dragon Ball Z...

00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,875
Vegeta made an explosive return
to the Tournament Arena...

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,083
The hatred in his
heart reawakened

4
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,291
by Babidi's magic,
the Saiyan prince

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,375
had become a servant
to the forces of evil.

6
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:31,791
[GOKU] Babidi! Transport us to
a place away from these people!

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,000
If you give me that,
then I will fight Vegeta!

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,375
[NARRATOR] Babidi willingly
granted Goku's request,

9
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,416
and zapped the Z Fighters
from the stadium floor.

10
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,750
Now, miles from civilization,

11
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,958
the two Super Saiyans are free
to fight without restraint,

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,875
which is just what the wizard
wants, for every blow

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,541
they land is a boost
for Majin Buu!

14
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,000
Unless Gohan and the
Supreme Kai act quickly,

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,666
Buu will soon have the
energy he needs to emerge

16
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,125
from his cocoon!

17
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,000
[GOHAN thinking] I've never
sensed anything like this.

18
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,875

Buu reaches his full power.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,875
We have to strike.
Together, on my mark.

27

Hold nothing back, Gohan.

28
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,041
This creature must never
see the light of day.

29

34
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Let's take this outside.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,583
It seems a bit cramped
in here, doesn't it?

36
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,166
Yes, and when Buu wakes up,
I have a feeling he'll agree.

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,583
He's sure to be restless.

38
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,458
I hate to think what would
happen if we were trapped

39
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,500

cozy little place.

41

You need not worry what
your monster will do to you.

42
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,041
Not when you still have
me to contend with.

43

You are feeling up to this?

49
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,416
I'd hate for you to wear
yourself out and quit

50
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,291
in the middle of the fight...

51
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,541
Rest assured.

52
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,666
These two will be easily
removed from your sight.

53

[cackles] Good, you can dispose
of them any way you like.

56
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,000
Maybe you could even
turn them into stone!

57
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,875
Two more statues to
add to our collection.

58
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,208
No.

think you'd last this long.

Really? I could say the
same about you, Vegeta.

tricks while I've been away.

[BABIDI] Did I mention how
glad I am to see you, Kai?

72
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,208
Now I can finally avenge
my father... can't I?

73
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,083
You remember, don't you?
The way you murdered my father?

74
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,041
I suppose he let his guard down.

75
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,000
I won't make that mistake.

76
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,500
I won't be done in
like my father was,

77
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,750
especially not by you. I learned
from his shortcomings.

78
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,958
I've made his
weaknesses my strengths!

79
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,083
For example, I've learned
to keep better company.

80
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,500
Father never did have a
knack for spotting talent.

[SUPREME KAI thinking] He's
right. He's completely on guard.

83
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,458
A direct attack would play
right into his hands.

84
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,083
There must be a way!

00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,541

remember how to fight

care about them.

00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
Thank you, sir.

179
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,625
But I was mostly referring to
your final opponent, Number 18.

180
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,666
Looked like she gave you
some trouble out there.

183
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,625
[laughs] Maybe to the
eyes of an amateur...

184
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,666
I could've won that
fight in five seconds

185
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,916
if I'd wanted to,
but if I had...

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,416
...that wouldn't've been fair
to all the people who paid

187
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,708
good money to see
me in action today.

188
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,166
I make sure that my
fans get plenty of

189
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,250
bang for their buck!

190
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,166
So I intentionally
took my time.

192
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,916

Putting the fans first!

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,083
It's great to have such
a considerate champion!

194
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,958
"Considerate champion."

195
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,125
Really, guy, you flatter me.

196

But make sure you
write that down.

197
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,375
Mister Satan, could
you repeat the name

198
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,750
of that last technique you
used to beat Number 18?

199
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,791

203

call it something different
out in the ring...

204
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,458
Ha, ha. Is that so?

205
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,625
[REPORTER D] Oh, you're right.
How silly. My mistake!

206
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,625
But back to what
happened after the match.

207
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,458
Do you know who those men were
that attacked the stadium?

208
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,416
I guess they were
a couple of posers

209
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,750
who wanted to challenge
me for my title.

210
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,416
But they should've known better.

211
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,333
I'm an old pro at
dealin' with flashy tricks

212

and light shows,
explosives and stuff.

213
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
Naturally, when they
saw I wasn't

214
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,458
backin' down, they got
scared and ran off.

215

[REPORTERS]
Ooh!

216
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,541
I wanna send out a message!

To all you would-be-challengers

"Bring it on." Use all the
flashy tricks you want!

still here? I told her I'd pay!

There's some real fighting
going on out there.

Not like at that
stupid tournament.

230
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,375
I know. Who do you think it is?

231
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,041
My dad? Or your dad maybe?

232
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,750
[TRUNKS]
It might even be both of them!

233
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,250
Feels like it's happening
in more than one place.

I wanna find my dad first,
then we can go watch your dad.

Doesn't matter. It'll all be
over before we get there.

236
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,875
We might as well turn
around and go home.

237
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,083
No! No! No!

238
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,916

And the wizard!

257

These last seven years
in Other World,

258
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,541
I've been through the most
intense training sessions.

259
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,083
But we're still
completely even...

260
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,458
I guess this whole time,

261
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,208
you've been pushing yourself
even harder than I have.

That may be true.

263

I've pushed myself to the edge
of my limits and beyond.

But you've been born
with a natural talent

265

far beyond my own.

266

have closed the gap between us.

I realize that now.

It was made painfully
obvious to me today

269
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,500
as I watched your fight
with Babidi's monster.

To see the undeniable proof.

275
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,708
To discover that no
matter how hard I tried,

276
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,916
I would never be able
to catch you.

made up my mind.

You deliberately let yourself
fall under Babidi's spell.

of Babidi's magic.

The people who had
seen those fighters

292
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,416
in the previous tournament
couldn't understand

293
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,708
how they'd become so powerful.

294
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,041
But you and I know, don't we?

295
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,583
It was Babidi's magic.

296
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,958
And I knew that what his magic
had done for those fighters,

297
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,791
it could also do for me.

298
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,125
I knew that if I allowed myself
to fall under his control,

299
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,375
the difference in our
power would disappear.

300

with the results...

301

...even if they do
come at a price.

than justifies the means.

You've never allowed anyone to
help you before in your life--

305
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,125
Why start now? Why Babidi?

306
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
[VEGETA]
Because I wanted him to reawaken

to the way I was before!

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,125
I was the perfect warrior!

310
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,208

that I had settled down...

the evil in my heart...
