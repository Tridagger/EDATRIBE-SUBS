00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,458
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,500
the battle to decide the fate
of the Universe continued,

3
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,208
as Super Saiyan 3 Goku
went head to head

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,666
with the elastic Majin Buu.

[KID BUU screams]

8
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,750
[NARRATOR]
Goku fought valiantly,

9
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,666
but the more brilliant
the attack,

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,458
the more demoralizing the result

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,333
against the seemingly
invincible Buu.

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,166
[NARRATOR]
It was an impossible situation

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,375
of nightmarish proportions,

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,833
one made to order for
the unshakeable Saiyan.

15
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] And after Vegeta
had tried and failed

16
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,541
to measure up to the same test,

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,000
the proud Saiyan prince
finally realized

18
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,208
that Goku was truly
in a league of his own.

19
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,250
[VEGETA thinking]
You're better than me, Kakarot.

20
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,541
You are the best.

Huh. You can't deflect that one.

38

No way!

39
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,541

I'm going nowhere fast.

No, our beautiful planet.

He blasted straight through.

Enough, get a grip!

00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,791
The entire Universe
is at stake here!

59
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,541
Let him trash our planet
if he wants to.

Is that so?

73

Well, you wouldn't be the first.

74
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,041
And there's always that chance.

75
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,416
But, what I represent can
never be destroyed, Majin Buu!

Did he attack Goku?

He's making fun of him.

It doesn't matter how
much energy I put out,

I still don't get anywhere.

Kakarot.

00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,666
Hm? Hey, we'll switch
in a little while okay?

95
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,750
I still have some
fight left in me.

Ha. I know you don't intend
to switch, you can't fool me.

Come on, you know
better than anyone

98
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,625
that I don't stand a chance
against Buu at this level.

99
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,916
He'd tear me apart!

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,166
What? No! You'd do fine.

101
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,166
Mm. Don't give me that!

102
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
I know what you're
trying to do, Kakarot.

103
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,875
So forget it. I fought him.

104
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,916
I had my chance.
I know the truth.

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,166
He's stronger than me,
you know that.

106
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,708
Vegeta.

107
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,000
Go get him.
Don't you worry about me.

108
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,666
You're a Super Saiyan 3!

109
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,250
You should be able to generate
more than enough power

110
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,083
to destroy that monster!

111
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,875
[GOKU] Well, maybe I could have
done it when I was fresh,

112
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,333
but I let the fight drag
on so you could have a shot.

113
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,250
Huh?!

114
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,750
I should have done it! Darn it!
Now I'm weak! I'll need time.

115
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,083
How much time?

116
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,916
If I even had one minute.

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,250
Just one minute
with no interruptions.

118
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:31,208
In this fight,
one minute is eternity.

his life over there.

I've got it covered.

Get the rest that you need.

128
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,875
But, Vegeta. You could die.

129
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:01,833
If I can't last one lousy minute
then perhaps I deserve to die.

130
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,791
Hey, that's not true.

131
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,791

133

[VEGETA] All right, I'm going.
You have one minute.

134
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,916
Forget it. No way!

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,125
You've already tried fighting
him once. You could be killed!

[VEGETA] Tell me, is there
any other way, Kakarot?

137
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,458
[VEGETA]
Do you want to beat him, or not?

138
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,166
Yes, I do.

139
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,250
[VEGETA] Then what do you say we
drop this idiotic sentiment

140
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,125
and win this thing.

141
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:07,166
And don't worry about me,
I'll keep my end of the deal.

142
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:15,208
Hm. Why not? I'll do it.
All right, but on one condition.

143
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,958
I don't want you
to do anything reckless.

144
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,416
Just hold him off
and that's it, okay?

145
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,875
You don't have to win this.

146
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,333
So don't get angry
and blow yourself up again.

147
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,041
You died once.

148
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:33,958
If anything happens to you now,
you won't exist anymore.

149
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,375
There'll be nothing I can do
to bring you back.

150
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,750
Stay alive. Okay?

151
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,125
Thanks, but I'm already dead.

keep that up for a minute,

183
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,375
[GOKU]
This is not good.

184
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh no.

185
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,125

[VEGETA]
Hey!

190
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,416
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,291
Vegeta!

[VEGETA groaning]

193
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:39,416
What's wrong? Leaving? So soon?

194
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
[VEGETA]
You're no warrior!

195
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,041
You're just a mindless
freak of nature.

196
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,208
A big wad of spit out
chewing gum.

197
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:53,041
Is this what you want?
Well, is it?

198
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,958
I don't think so.
You're scared, aren't you?

199
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,500
Go ahead and run away!

200
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,000

That's it, yes.

203
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,833
Huh?!

204
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,291
Take this, fool!

205
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,625

[gasps]

216
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,666
[VEGETA]
What are you gawking at?

217
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,000
What did you think, huh?

218
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,333
[VEGETA] That I was gonna
roll over and die

219
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,583
from an attack like that?

220
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,250
[growls]

221
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,916
You're nothing,
just a trickster.

222
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,458
I am a warrior!

223
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,166
The Saiyan Prince!

224
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,583
Vegeta!

225
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:07,333
[KRILLIN] Vegeta has no reserves
left. He's in serious trouble.

226
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:12,916
Darn! Why's Goku taking so long?
It's been more than a minute.

227
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,583
[GOKU] I don't get it.
I should have been done by now.

228
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,708
Why isn't this working?

229
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,500
I need more time!
It's not enough!

230
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,625
[KID BUU]
Huh?!

[GOKU grunts]
Vegeta, no.

239
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,083
I can't take this.
It's too much to bear.

00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,833
[NARRATOR] As Goku struggles
to amass the power he needs,

241
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,583
Vegeta is being throttled
by the long arm of Majin Buu.

242
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,083
And the villain is finding
a sadistic pleasure

243
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,250
in squeezing the life
from the Saiyan prince.

244
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,083
How long can Vegeta withstand
the deadly assault,

245
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,291
and how long can
Goku stand to watch?

246
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,166
Stay tuned to find out!
