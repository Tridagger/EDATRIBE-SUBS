00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,875
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:20,500
Majin Buu continued his
all-out assault on Vegito!

3
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,166
But whenever Vegito found
himself in a tight squeeze,

4
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,000
he always seemed
to have the answer!

5
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,375
[VEGITO] Hey! Don't get
so down in the dumps!

6
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,083
You've won every
fight you've been in!

7
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,625
Everyone meets their
better sooner or later!

8
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,708
No! I won't lose! You'll see!

9
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,458
[NARRATOR] When it became
clear that brute strength

10
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,625
would not work against Vegito,

11
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,958
the desperate Buu
gave up the ghost,

12
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,791
and resorted to a
more unorthodox method!

13
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,416
[SUPER BUU]
Fool! Mock me while you can!

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,541
Super Kamikaze Ghost Attack!

15
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,750
[VEGITO gasps]

16
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,083
[NARRATOR] With ghostly
Kamahameha Waves on one side

17
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,083
and the Gallic
Gun on the other,

18
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,791
it looked like
curtains for Vegito!

19
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,875
[SUPER BUU cackles]

20
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,666
So it's a silly kid's
game, huh? Well, bug off!

21
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,916
Too bad it's not permanent!
It's a nice improvement!

22
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,500
You're using your eyes
instead of feeling where I am!

23
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,375
[yells]

24
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,375
You don't like
to lose, do ya?

25
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,833
[NARRATOR] It was a
hurting time for Majin Buu

26
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,375
who couldn't even land a
blow on the mighty Vegito!

27
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,125
[VEGITO] It's up to you!
Do you want to continue or not?

28
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,583
[NARRATOR]
But was the fight really over?

29
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,333
[SUPER BUU]
I like your style!

30
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,708
You're going to
make great candy!

31
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,916
[gasps]

32
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,000
[NARRATOR]
In a flash,

33
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,666
the devious Majin Buu
played his trump card,

34
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,750
and Vegito, the seemingly
invincible Super Saiyan tandem,

35
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,208
was reduced to a
coffee-flavored sucker!

36
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,833
Buu had managed to turn
the tides once again!

37
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,541
[KRILLIN]
What? Goku and Vegeta!

38
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:55,541
The two greatest fighters?
Reduced to a candy drop?!

39
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
What are we gonna do now?

40
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,541
[KRILLIN]
There's no one left...

41
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,000
[KING KAI gasping]

42
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,125
Huh?

43
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,458
[gulps]

44
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,875
M-M-M-M-M-Me? Are you crazy?

45
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,291
You want me to go
and fight Majin Buu?

46
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,166
[KING KAI]
Well!

47
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,541
It's a tough call!

48
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,875
But you're the only
ones left! You and Yamcha!

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,916
It's not ideal, I admit!

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,750
But when the first string fails,
you've gotta send in the B-team!

51
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,541
But this isn't sports!
This is life!

52
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,708
And I lost that game
not too long ago!

53
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
I was eaten!

54
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,583
Do you know what it's like being
eaten by a monster like that?!

55
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,333
Well, do you?!

56
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,583
Mmm! Not really!

57
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,333
Well, I do! And it's bogus!
I'm not food! I'm a person!

58
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,791
Forget it! Hmph!

59
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,458
[growls]

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,250
[YAMCHA] Hey, guys!
What's up? You look tense!

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,125
Huh?

62
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,250
Man! This place is great!

63
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,833
[KRILLIN] Yamcha, what do
you think you're doing

64
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,375
taking a steam bath
at a time like this?

65
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,708
Huh?

66
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,541
[YAMCHA] Dude! Just chill out!
I just got all relaxed!

67
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,916
I don't need that
right now! Come on!

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,875
You know! Shoot!

69
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,416
If this place had
some pretty girls,

70
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,041
I wouldn't even care
about going back to Earth!

71
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:35,833
Let Majin Buu have it!
All we lack is the chicks!

72
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,250
[gulps]

73
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,833
Oh, boy! So this
is the B-team, huh?

74
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,708
We're in big trouble!

75
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,166
[SUPER BUU]
Look at the mighty warriors!

76
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,666
[SUPER BUU cackles]

77
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,041
Yes! You're both so sweet!

78
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,041
[cackles]

79
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,250
Talk to me, Buttercup!
Chastise Majin Buu!

80
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,583
Yes! Tell me that I'm cooked!
That it's all over!

81
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,666
What else? Oh, yeah!

82
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,458
You wanted me to admit that
I was wrong and surrender!

83
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,250
Oh, yes! Remember?

84
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:31,208
[cackles]

85
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,875
[SUPER BUU]
Time to die!

86
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,791
[groans]

87
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,208
[VEGITO] You shouldn't
hurt yourself like that!

88
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:54,333
[ALL gasping]

89
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,541
[SUPER BUU] H-How is this
possible? You can still speak!

90
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,333
[VEGITO]
I can do more than that!

91
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,958
It seems I've retained
all of my power!

92
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:11,666
[VEGITO grunting]

93
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,916
[SUPER BUU yelps]

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,375
[VEGITO] I'm no ordinary
candy! I'm a jawbreaker!

95
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,958
The strongest piece
of candy there is!

96
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,708
Don't be a fool, Majin Buu!

97
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,791
You can still surrender!
It's not too late!

98
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,583
You're nuts!

99
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,416
Why would I want
to surrender to you?

100
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
You're just a little sucker!

101
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,250
[VEGITO] You want some of this?
Well, come and get it!

102
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,666
But I warn you!

103
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,375
Attacking something so
small and fast won't be easy!

104
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,708
Attacking?! You've got to
be kidding! No arms! No legs!

105
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,833
I'm not going to attack you!
I'm going to eat you!

106
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,583
[VEGITO]
All right, then! Eat me! Hiya!

107
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,583
[groans]

108
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,791
[SUPER BUU groans]

109
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,500
[VEGITO] I told him he shoulda
given up! How embarrassing!

110
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:24,125
[SUPER BUU, VEGITO grunting]

111
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,416
[SUPER BUU panting]

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
[VEGITO]
I guess you don't have

113
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,125
much of a sweet-tooth
today, huh?

114
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,875
Well, if you're
not going to eat me,

115
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,250
let me show you
one of my new moves!

116
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,333
Pinball Attack!

117
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,291
[gasps]

118
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,208
[SUPER BUU groans]

119
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
Chow time, sweety!

120
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:06,333
[SUPER BUU groaning]

121
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,958
Will you stop that!
Fight like a man!

122
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,166
Do you see a man around?

123
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,333
[SUPER BUU groans]

124
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,250
[VEGITO] Hey! What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to eat me!

125
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,791
I went right into your mouth!
What else do you want? Come on!

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,416
[groans]

127
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,333
[VEGITO] What now, Buu?
Shall we do it again?

128
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,333
Or would you rather fight
me in my original form?

129
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,541
[VEGITO]
Huh?

130
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,291
Mommy?

131
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,375
Oh, it's me again!

132
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,541
Lost your appetite, huh?

133
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,291
Sometimes too much candy
can be a bad thing!

134
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,416
It's not good for ya!

135
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:15,250
[KIBITO KAI] Look! He's normal!
Whew! Oh, boy! Thank goodness!

136
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,250
We can breathe easy again!

137
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,708
Can we? As long as that
beast is still alive,

138
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,458
the entire physical
cosmos faces extinction!

139
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,250
[sighs] You're right, sir!
It's far from over yet!

140
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,375
All right! All right! We know
how strong you are now!

141
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,750
Please! Just finish
him off while you can!

142
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,583
[KING YEMMA grunts, sighs]

143
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,708
That was close!
I thought it was all over!

144
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,958
Those two are something else!

145
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,958
[BABA]
They're too cocky if you ask me!

146
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,125
[BABA] It must be that Vegeta!
Goku's certainly not like that!

147
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,916
Yes! But Vegeta is
a better tactician!

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,291
He's smart, I'll give him that!

149
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,041
Hopefully they'll
balance themselves out!

150
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,875
If we're lucky that is!

151
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,916
How did you get
Vegeta to cooperate?

152
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,666
After all, the Yemma
Lock wouldn't work

153
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,916
on a guy like him, would it?

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,666
[KING YEMMA]
Mmm? Well, no!

155
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,958
I had to rely on my charisma
and great personal magnetism!

156
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,125
Don't give me that look, Baba!

157
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,541
I am the great
King Yemma, ya know!

158
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,125
[KING YEMMA] Although
enormous physical strength

159
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,166
is my trademark,

160
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,000
this time, I had
to rely on my wits!

161
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,041
--[VEGETA] Well?
--[KING YEMMA] Hm?

162
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,458
Ah! You're here!

163
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,500
That's right!
Now what do you want?

164
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, I'm sure
you've noticed by now

165
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,625
that you've gotten
your physical body back!

166
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,208
This is a rare privilege

167
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,250
which is reserved
for very special souls!

168
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,750
Usually, very good souls!

169
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,541
So what? Get to
the point, Yemma!

170
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,500
How would you
like another chance

171
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,125
to fight Majin Buu, Vegeta?

172
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,375
What?!

173
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,791
Of course, it's tricky!
A guy with your record!

174
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,958
Returning to Earth!
It's unheard of!

175
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,125
But, given the
extreme circumstances,

176
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,666
we can bend the rules!

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,958
Second chances! They're so rare!

178
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,875
Especially in combat!
Wouldn't you say?

179
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,541
But there are no guarantees!

180
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,375
Fighting Buu will be no picnic!
But then, you know that!

181
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,625
Waaaah!

182
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,125
[cackles]

183
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,375
You are a fool!
I'm going to crush you!

184
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,083
And throw you into the wind!

185
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,041
[growls]

186
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,625

[screams]

189
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,958
That was a waste! He lived!

190
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,708
Darn you!

191
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,250
[ATTENDANT 2 screams]

192
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,958
Uh-oh! Look out!

193
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:54,875
[yelling]

194
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,541
[VEGETA panting]

195
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, dear!

196
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,333
[grunts]

197
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,041
Count me in!

198
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,458
I can't wait to have
another crack at him!

199
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,166
[VEGETA] When do I leave, King
Yemma? I'm ready when you are!

200
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,125
[BABA]
Well, now it all makes sense!

201
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,166
[KING YEMMA] It does?
What do you mean by that?

202
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,708
[BABA] Take a look! The walls!
The new renovations!

203
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,083
It's all a result

204
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,583
of your charisma and
personal magnetism, isn't it?

205
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,666
[BABA] Too bad you can't
bottle it and sell it!

206
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,625
You silver-tongued devil, you!

207
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,041
[growls]

208
00:15:54,125 --> 00:16:02,708

00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,875
[SUPER BUU yells]

00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,416
[SUPER BUU groans]

218
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,333
[VEGITO] You're coming
apart on me, Majin Buu!

219
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,250
Is this how you
want it to end? Huh?

220
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,291
So much for the tough warrior!

221
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:37,458
[SUPER BUU cackles]

222
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,375
[MR. SATAN] Uh-oh! I'm
afraid that's not good!

223
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,666
Vegito!

224
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,333
Ah?

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,458
[VEGITO]
Break a leg, Buu!

226
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,916
[gasping]

227
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,208
[VEGITO yells]

[panting]

232
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,125
There, good as new!

233
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,250
Okay... If you say so!

234
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,541
Say what?

235
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,750
[gasps]

236
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,625
[SUPER BUU]
Darn you!

237
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,125
Fighting on an empty stomach?

238
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,416
I guess you don't have to worry

239
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,083
about those painful
punches to the gut!

240
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,875
[SUPER BUU growls]

241
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,458
Well!

242
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,666
[yawns] This is getting boring!

243
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,583
It's time to finish things up!

244
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,625
You think it's that
simple? Wake up!

245
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,125
[gags]

246
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,625
[VEGITO]
You wake up!

247
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,875
Are you so blind that you
still can't see the difference

248
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,000
between your power and mine?

249
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,458
Man! The nerve!

250
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,916
[VEGITO chuckles]
Yeah!

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,041
[gasps]

252
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,333
[VEGITO] Take ten! I'm going
to count to ten, Buu!

253
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,666
Say a prayer! Get something to
eat! Whatever you wanna do!

254
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,958
Then, you will die!

255
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,041
One...

256
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,166
Two...

257
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,458
Three...

258
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,125
You don't have to wait
if you don't want to!

259
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,541
Please! Charge me now if
you'd prefer! It's your call!

260
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,208
[VEGITO]
Four...

261
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,791
Five...

262
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,208
Six...

263
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,458
[SUPER BUU thinking] There's got
to be a way to kill this guy!

264
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,541
But how?

265
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,958
He's too strong
to fight head-on! Mm!

266
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,625
[SUPER BUU thinking]
My head tentacle!

267
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,041
[SUPER BUU thinking]
Good. Now, listen.

268
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,166
This could be our last chance.

269
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,500
[VEGITO]
Seven...

270
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,875
[VEGITO]
Eight...

271
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,458
[VEGITO thinking]
All right, Majin Buu.

272
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,250
You've cursed the Earth with
your presence long enough.

273
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,833
Your time's about to expire.

274
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,708
[SUPER BUU thinking]
Yes... That's it...

275
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
Lie still.

276
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,791
Nine...

277
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,708
[VEGITO thinking]
Okay. This had better work.

278
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,750
[gulps]

279
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,083
Ten!

280
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,750
[gasps]

281
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,916
[SUPER BUU]
Now! Close!

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,166
Blast it!

283
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,000
[cackles]

284
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,041

285
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:39,500
[cackling]

286
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,750
Bye-bye.

287
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,291
[MR. SATAN]
He-He's gone!

288
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
We're alone!

289
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,166
Goku, no! Vegita, come back!

290
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:04,208
[KIBITO KAI] Great galaxies!
It's over! He had it in the bag!

291
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:15,416
[KIBITO KAI] There's no one
left! It's... the end!

292
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,791
[laughs]

293
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,000
This is too good!
I beat you, fool!

294
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,583
No more loud mouth!
Majin Buu won!

295
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,375
Yes! I did it!
I did it! I did it!

296
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:33,916
[laughing]

297
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,208
[NARRATOR]
Down, down, down!

298
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,333
Deep into the bowels
of Buu they go!

299
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,208
Goku and Vegeta,

300
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,041
the two most powerful
warriors in the Universe,

301
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,666
have been toppled by
the infamous Majin Buu

302
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,333
and sealed in the wretched
slime of their living tomb!

303
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:55,583
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
