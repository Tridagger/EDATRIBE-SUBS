00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,625
As the two evil Saiyan
warriors hurtled towards Earth

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,208
in their space pods,

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,708
the Z warriors
were busy

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,041
beefing up their
martial arts skills.

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,500
Goku had made it to
King Kai's planet

7
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,916
but he was finding the gravity
a little tough to take.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,333
And it didn't
help matters

9
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,958
when he mistook the
King's pet ape Bubbles

10
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,708
for the mythical
martial master...

11
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,666
Once the proper
introductions were made,

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,166
Goku was put to the test to
see if he was worthy enough

13
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,625
to train with the
legendary King Kai...

14
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,708
His first assignment,
catch Bubbles,

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,375
and then he would be
permitted to move on

16
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,166
to the next phase
of his training...

17
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,208
It all seemed easy
enough at first,

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,916
but it proved to be a lot
harder than Goku imagined.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,250
That little monkey
sure could move!

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
And don't forget the intense
gravity of King Kai's planet.

21
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,875
It can really
bring a guy down!

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,708
While King Kai watched with
amusement from the sidelines,

23
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,541
Goku did his best to grab
the speedy little monkey!

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,916
Time and time again they
traveled around the planet

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,583
and before long they
were going in circles!

26
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,375
Then Goku made one
last leap of faith

27
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,500
and managed to get
a grip on Bubbles!

28
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
[GOKU] Heh. Gotcha! Yeah!

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,666
[NARRATOR] It was then that
King Kai realized that Goku

30
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,625
could indeed be
a worthy student.

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,958
But things are only going to
get harder from here on in...

32
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,791
And one question
remains...

33
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,750
What kind of
bizarre training

34
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,333
does the King have in
store for Goku now?

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,625
[GOKU] Woo-hoo! I did it!
I caught him! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

36
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,916
Look King Kai!
I caught the monkey!

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,958
[BUBBLES chatters]

38
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,458
I'm ready for the next phase
of my training King Kai!

39
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
Okay... If you say so.

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,625
Let's see now...
Phase two, huh?

41
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,625
Yeah!

42
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,500
No more
monkey business!

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,250
Heh!

45

[kissing sounds]

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,041
Can I do my next training
session without Bubbles?

47
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,708
He'll just
get in the way!

48
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,208
Hey! Don't be so rude!

49
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,166
All right then!
Let's start training!

50
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,125
Yeah! Let's get to work!

00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,000
Hm?

54
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,833
What did you do?

55
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,750
I yelled at the
top of my lungs!

56
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,166
Yeah, I'll say...

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
Um... Am I missing
something here?

58
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,458
Why did you do that, King Kai?

59
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,958
You'll see...

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,916
[GOKU] Uh...

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,416
[intense yelling]

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,166
That, my boy, is a
long distance call!

64

Don't you get it?

65
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,208
He can't be a
martial arts master!

[GREGORY] I'm not an
it, you lunk-head!

Hey! It's a little
grasshopper man!

00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,083
Yeah! So what?

And listen up!

My name's Gregory!

And I'm King Kai's most
trusted attendant!

78

So you watch
yourself!

Uhh...

A-hem. Yes, now
where was I?

86
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,958
Right! Who do you
think you are?

87
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,250
I heard what you
said about King Kai!

88
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,000
So you don't think
he's for real, huh?

89
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,250
No! His methods
just bug me!

concentrate with you laughing!

94
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,291
Yes, of course!
Sorry about that!

95
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,750
Goku, Gregory will be your
next test! Are you ready?

96

Hey, buddy,
I'm a grasshopper!

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,666
But King Kai...

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,666
I thought you were going
to train me personally?

100
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,833
You'll take on just about
anyone these days, won't you?

101
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,875
How am I supposed to work
with a guy like this

who doesn't know
the first thing

103
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,916
about showing respect
for his elders?!

104

You'll manage!

Now let's
get started!

What's that for?

107
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:50,416
That's kinda big! Are you sure
you're not overdoing it, sir?

108

Now Goku.
Take that hammer

114
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,833
and see if you can
hit Gregory with it!

115
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,458
Hit him? Uhh...

116
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,333
And if you can
complete this task

117
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,958
I will allow you to
train under me directly!

Don't get your
hopes up, buddy!

you hit me with that hammer!

00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:17,958
Help me! I can't get out!
Please Piccolo! Help me!

181
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,791
Just this one time!
Please...

182
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,416
I'll do better next time...
I promise!

183
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,708
Help me Piccolo...
Please!

184
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,208
[NARRATOR High above the
Earth on Kami's lookout,

185
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,750
the other Z
warriors continue

186
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,666
their intensive
training regime!

187
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,583
Tien and Yamcha
seem about equal!

188
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,541
They're
looking good!

Mm-hm...

00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,958
[TIEN chuckles]

193

[KRILLIN yells]

195
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,750
Hey come on!
Stop kidding around!

196
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,166
[YAJIROBE] Heh!

197
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,166
[KRILLIN yells]

198
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,375
[KRILLIN yells frantically]

199
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,125
[GOKU] Aw, come on,
slow down a little!

200
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,125
I won't hit you that
hard... I promise!

201
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,041
Time out!

202
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,416
[GOKU] Huh?

203
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,416
Whoa! Hey!
What's the deal?

204
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,291
It's break time!

205
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,083

206
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:38,833
Woohoo!

207
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,166
Uh--Don't feed him!

208
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:00,458

209
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,458
[GOKU belches]

210
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:08,291
[eating noises continue]

211
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,750
You worked up quite an
appetite, didn't you?

212
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,083
[GOKU] Boy, oh boy!
I sure did!

213
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,958
Will it slow
him down?

214
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,333
Oh, no, it makes
him much faster...

215
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,750
And it won't give
him a cramp!

216
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,000
[GOKU] You betcha!

217
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,375
[KING KAI] The Saiyans
are remarkably fast too!

218
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,458
But you are
not there yet!

219
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,416
Huh? Ah, the Saiyans!

220
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,208
What do you know
about them, King Kai?

221
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,458
What do you mean, what
does he know about them?

222
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,541
King Kai knows
everything!

223
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,500
There, there, Gregory!

224
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,416
Goku, you told me earlier
that you too are a Saiyan,

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,416
am I correct?

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,833
Huh?!

227
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,333
Yeah! But I don't know
anything about the Saiyans...

228
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,416
You see, they sent me to
Earth when I was just a baby!

229
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,416
Ah, well then... I can probably
tell you a few things

230
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,125
about the Saiyans
that you don't know!

231
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,458
[GOKU]
Wow! Really?

232
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,541
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm!

233
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,458
[GOKU]
Hold on!

234
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,000
Ah! How kind of you!

235
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,458
Ah, I feel like a king!

236
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,875
[GOKU] Mm-hm...

237
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:13,166
Mm. Yes... Now a long time ago,
before you were born...

238
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,125
There were two tribes
that lived on Planet Vegeta.

239
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,416
There were your
ancestors, the Saiyans...

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,166
And the other tribe was
known as the Tuffles.

241
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,833
[GOKU] The Saiyans
and the Tuffles, huh?

242
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,375
[KING KAI] That's correct.
Now, the Tuffles

243
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,875
were a so-called
advanced civilization...

244
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,083
They had cities much
like the ones on Earth

245
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,000
and enjoyed all of
the modern conveniences

246
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,416
such as air-travel
and mini malls.

247
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,958
They had long ago
outgrown energy sources

248
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,125
which polluted
their planet

249
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,250
and were enjoying
health and prosperity.

250
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,125
Not far from the big cities, in
the arid wastelands of Vegeta,

251
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,541
the Saiyans lived in
primitive fashion.

252
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,125
They were much larger in
size than the Tuffles

253
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,791
but much smaller
in number.

254
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
One thing all Saiyans
had in common

255
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,500
was that they
all had tails.

256
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,250
Another was their brutal
and violent nature...

257
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,708
They loved to fight.

258
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,000
But because they were
so few in number,

259
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,500
the Tuffles never worried
about the Saiyans.

260
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,208
That is until the day...

261
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,916
...they attacked!

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,583
And so the great war for
planet Vegeta began.

263
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,583
With the element of
surprise in their favor,

264
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,708
the Saiyans quickly
gained a strong foothold

265
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,708
in the war against
the Tuffles.

266
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
The Tuffles had
technology on their side.

267
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,500
They had devices that measured
their enemies fighting power

268
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,708
and advanced
weaponry

269
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,708
which they used to hold
the Saiyans at bay.

270
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Though few in number,

271
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,416
the Saiyans strength
was so incredible

272
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,333
that they too won their
fair share of the battles.

273
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,833
[SAIYAN #2 laughs]

274
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,541
[KING KAI] And just when it
seemed that there was

275
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,708
no end in sight to
this horrible war,

276
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,333
something
happened on Vegeta

277
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,875
that only happens there
once every eight years.

278
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,333
There was a full moon!

279
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,583
A decisive factor in the
war for planet Vegeta!

280
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,666
As you must know, Saiyans
have the ability to transform

281
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,875
into huge ape-like creatures
when the moon is full.

282
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,083
[roaring]

283
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
[TUFFLE #2]
Let's get out of here!

284
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,458
[roaring]

285
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,458
[KING KAI] It didn't take long
for these monsters to destroy

286
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,791
the Tuffles and their
advanced civilization...

287
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,791
But then a new problem
began for the Saiyans.

288
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,916
Without the technology
of the Tuffles,

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,125
the Saiyans couldn't
travel in space.

290
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,666
This meant they couldn't
satisfy the one desire

291
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,666
that they all shared,
the desire to fight.

292
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,958
I'm sure you've
heard the joke,

293
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,458
how many Saiyans does it
take to build a rocket-ship?

294
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
[GOKU] Uh? No...

295
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,000
[KING KAI chuckles]

296
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,125
It's a really good one!

297
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,458
[GOKU]
Later King Kai!

298
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,958
[KING KAI] Fine!
Well, not far away,

299
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,958
the Saiyans met
the Archosians...

300
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,750
Now, the Archosians had
money and technology,

301
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,541
but the planet
Archos was a dump.

302
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,041
So they hired the Saiyans to
conquer a planet for them!

303
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,500
An unholy partnership
was formed.

304
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,166
With Saiyan might and
Archosian ingenuity combined,

305
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,833
they formed a fleet
of planet pirates.

306
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,625
The plan that these
two sinister races

307
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,166
hatched meant that
there was nothing

308
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,958
they wouldn't do to
achieve their goals...

309
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,458
An armada of space pods
was designed to travel

310
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,708
the vast distances
of the universe.

311
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,666
They even sent babies like
yourself to distant planets.

312
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,458
The Saiyan leaders were more
than happy to send specimens

313
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
of their race into
the great unknown.

314
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,458
They knew that when
the babies grew up

315
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
they would extinguish
any and all inhabitants

316
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,125
of the planet
they landed on.

317
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,333
I'd like to
extinguish them!

318
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,791
Well, all misdeeds gather
their just rewards.

319
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,416
You see, like Earth, the planet
Vegeta also had a guardian.

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,416
This good man
used his power

321
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,333
to attract a vast system
of meteors to the planet.

322
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,416
He could no longer tolerate
the horrible burden

323
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,291
of the Saiyans'
dark deeds.

324
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,750
So he brought destruction
upon the planet,

325
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,208
which was plagued by the weight
of its inhabitants' evil.

326
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,875
Planet Vegeta
was demolished!

327
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,500
It kind of got a major
spanking you could say,

328
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
except with meteors.

329
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Only four Saiyans
survived the destruction

330
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
of planet Vegeta,

331
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,833
and you are
one of them.

332
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,333
No!

333
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm not one of them!
I'll never be!

334
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,291
[KING KAI]
Easy now...

335
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,625
Listen you might despise your
heritage, but at this point

336
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,833
the fact that you are a
Saiyan is a great asset!

337
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,833
Channel your anger. Use it
to enhance your training.

338
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,791
You're right! I can't wait
to start training again.

339
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,208
I'm in! If it's okay
with King Kai of course!

340
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,875
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

341
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,625
[GOKU] I am really
anxious to get started,

342
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,041
but uh, let me wolf
this down first!

343
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,291
[eating noises]

344
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,375
[GOKU thinking]
C'mon... C'mon...

345
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,416
[GREGORY] Huh?!

346
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,458
[GOKU thinking]
Missed him!

347
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,708
[KAMI] Gentlemen, Mr. Popo
and I are both very pleased

348
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,625
with the progress
you have made here.

349
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,416
Each of you has
reached a new level

350
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,375
of strength
and technique.

351
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,833
But the time has come for you
to go back down to Earth.

352
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,875
The future of the planet
is in your hands.

353
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,625
May you fight
with honor!

354
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,000
[ALL] Right!

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,375
Kami, can I take these
weighted clothes off now?

356
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,041
You may do
as you please.

357
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
So what are you guys
going to do down below?

358
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,416
Well, I say we go somewhere
and continue training.

359
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,916
That's a
good idea.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,708
[thinking] Hm. I wonder how
much Goku has improved...

361
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,250
[GOKU]
Ha, ha, ha! I got you now!

362
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,500
[GREGORY]
Oh, no you don't!

363
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
[clanking]

364
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,166
[KING KAI]
What a mess!

365
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,750
I hope my insurance covers this!

366
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
[GREGORY laughs]

367
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,333
[thinking]
I almost got him!

368
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,875
Hm. That was a close one!

369
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,958
Yeah!

370
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,208
That oughta do it!

371
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,083
Aahh!

372
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,000
Aahh!

373
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
All right!
Here goes!

374
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,833
Gotcha!

375
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,333
[BUBBLES chatters]

376
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,916
That wasn't too bad
now was it, Gregory?

377
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,250
What is that, a joke? Come on
my body is in super condition!

378
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,666
You couldn't hurt me with
that thing if you tried!

379
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,583
Really? Well, is
that a lump I see?

380
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,041
Oh! What did
you do to me?

381
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,666
[GOKU laughs]

382
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,875
[thinking] Goku is
indeed a rare man.

383
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,500
Perhaps he
is the one!

384
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,958
There are seventy days left.
He could do it!

385
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,541
He could master Kaio-Ken and
defeat those Saiyan warriors!

386
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,458
No one's ever been able
to master Kaio-Ken.

387
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,166
It's been like a
dream in my head.

388
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,875
Like a horse that's
too wild to ride!

389
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,458
But now,
there is a chance!

390
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,375
King Kai you
promised remember?

391
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,250
Do you really think
you're ready to learn

392
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,416
the mystic art of Kaio-Ken
from me as you are?

393
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, do you?

394
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,625
Yes, I do!

395
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,416
All right, first I want
you to visualize yourself

396
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,666
at your very best! Both in
body and in spirit! Got it?

397
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,208
Got it!

398
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Now that you understand, uh...
let's go take a lunch break!

399
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,958
[ROSHI] Well sis, I should
know better then to ask but,

400
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,250
can you tell us what
your crystal ball says

401
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,625
about the future?

402
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,541
Who's future?
Be specific!

403
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,541
Our planet's future...
Mother Earth's!

404
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,083
Hm. What's up?
You heard something?

405
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,250
No matter!

406
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,666
If it's going to
happen, I'll see it!

407
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,333
I always do!

408
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:08,708
[incantation vocalization]

409
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,666
Huh? Oh no!

410
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,875
As things stand right now,
the Earth has no future!

411
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,000
Eh?!

412
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:21,000
No! Attack! Don't just dodge!
Use your strength!

413
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,208
[GOKU yells]

414
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,708
[KING KAI snickers]

415
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,541
[NARRATOR] While our heroes
push themselves to the limit

416
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,166
with their
martial arts training,

417
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,500
on the outer edge
of the solar system,

418
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,375
a great evil
approaches.

419
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,125
The Saiyans, who are intent
on destroying Earth,

420
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,625
are already
passing by Jupiter.

421
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,416
Only one day remains
until their arrival.

422
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,375
Have the Z warriors properly
prepared themselves

423
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,541
to face
their wrath?

424
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
And will Goku make
it back in time

425
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,375
to fight side by side
with his son Gohan?

426
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,791
All these questions and
more will be answered

427
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,833
on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
