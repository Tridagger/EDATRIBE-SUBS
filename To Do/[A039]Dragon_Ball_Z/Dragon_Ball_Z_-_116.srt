00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,208
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,458
Gohan gave Garlic Jr.
quite a beating.

3
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,333
And Krillin put him through
plenty of pain as well.

4
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,583
But with Piccolo see-sawing
between strength and weakness,

5
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,916
the evil giant
regained the upper hand.

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,333
In the resting place
of guardians past,

7
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,250
Kami took care
of the distraction

8
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,791
while Mr. Popo handled
the Sacred Water.

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,583
And the precious water
was spread over the earth,

10
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,708
to negate the horrible effect
of the Black Water Mist.

11
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,666
My plan!

12
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,500
[NARRATOR] Garlic Jr. was
incensed by this latest attempt

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,458
to foil his dark plans.

14
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,125
And in a terrible rage,
he decided to pull out

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,333
all the stops and
reopen the Dead Zone.

16
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,541
A horrible void of darkness
that sucks people into it

17
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,625
like a vacuum and
holds them in a timeless,

18
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,416
spaceless prison forever.

19
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,791
The Dead Zone
will swallow you up

20
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,333
and keep you for all eternity!

21
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,875
There's no escape!

22
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,458
[NARRATOR] With Piccolo's
power waning

23
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,166
and Krillin
weakened from battle,

24
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
it was up to Gohan
to protect them

25
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,458
from the deadly suction
of the Dead Zone!

26
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,375
But how long can the
little warrior hold on?

27
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,708
Find out, today!

The Dead Zone! Yes, Garlic Jr.
has reopened the Dead Zone!

[KAMI] Fools! By hurting me,
you're helping Garlic Jr.!

It won't be long now!

That little pimple
of a shield is going to pop

70
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,791
and the three of you
are going to ooze into

71
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,583

Huh?

Look! Blow up the Makyo Star!

82
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,708
It's the source of his power!

83
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,250
[KRILLIN] But he's barely
able to hold the shield!

84

I don't know, Piccolo...

85

half baked to me...

we're goners!

Just do it, Gohan!
There's a whole world

can't promise I'm going to

180
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,666
make it through this one!

181
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,333
I... understand...

182
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:45,708
[PICCOLO growls]

183
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,375
Yes! Come, Piccolo!
Come to your death!

184
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,458
Yes! Perfect!

185
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,333
Now just a little
bit closer, you fool!

186
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,500
How about a Belly-Blast?

187
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,166
[GARLIC JR. yells]

188
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,625

[GARLIC JR. growls]

190
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,833
Gohan, do it! Attack!

191
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,208
What about Krillin?

192
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,958
Gohan! I'm fine!
Search your feelings!

193
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,625
You know it's the
best thing to do right now!

194
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:32,000
Krillin! I can't!
I need to protect you!

195
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,250
Forget about me!

196
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,708
[KRILLIN yells]

197
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,375
Krillin, don't go!

198
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:49,291
[PICCOLO grunts]

199
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,250
What's wrong?!
Can't take the heat?!

200
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,541
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

201
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,625
[PICCOLO growls]

202
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,333
What a nice gift!

203
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:15,875
Here you go!
Right back at you, Piccolo!

204
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:29,333
[GARLIC JR. growls]

205
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,791
[KRILLIN grunts]

206
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,958
Gohan, now!

207
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,791
Fire!

208
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,166
I've got you now!

209
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,750
[GOHAN yells]

210
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,041

[GARLIC JR. gasps]

212
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:06,083
[GARLIC JR.] What?!
No! It can't be!

213
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:19,041
[GARLIC JR. screams]

214
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,916
[GARLIC JR. screams]

215
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,083
[thinking] Kakarot, you're
so close I can smell you!

216
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,750
It won't be long now.
I'll become a Super Saiyan

217
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,416
and we'll see who's
really the strongest!

218
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,916
Huh...?

219
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,458
Huh?

220
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,916
[OOLONG &amp; PUAR groan]

221
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,250
[gasping, murmuring]

222
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,250
Uhh, hi there!

223
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,833
I'm sure you folks were
all wonderful subjects!

224
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:33,125
But, uh, I-I think it's time
that I, uh, abdicate the throne.

225
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,333
I was looking for Gohan!
How did I get way out here?

226
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,875
Boy is he going to be
in trouble when I find him!

227
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,250
Hey, you!

228
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,083
[gasping]

229
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,583
Yeah, you guys!

230
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,625
Don't you know
your moms are at home

231
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,166
worried sick about you?!

232
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,416
Get your butts home!

233
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,375
Piccolo...

234
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,375
You, too, Krillin...

235
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:30,250
Piccolo! Where are you?!

236
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,833
[GOHAN whimpers]

237
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:36,125
[GOHAN] Krillin... Why didn't
you stay under the shield...?

238
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,083
[GOHAN] Huh?

239
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,000
[GOHAN gasps]

240
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,916
Kami! And Popo!

241
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,666
[GOHAN chuckles]

242
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,833
Oh my gosh! I can't
believe you made it!

243
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,375
Yes, by a whisker.

244
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,458
[MR. POPO] But my plants got
sucked into the Dead Zone...

245
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,625
[KRILLIN (muffled)] Gohan!

246
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,583
Have a little
respect, would ya?!

247
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,416
It hurts bad enough as it is!

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,750
[KRILLIN grunts]

249
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,208
[KRILLIN] Oh, man...

250
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:10,750
[KRILLIN chuckles]

251
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,625
Whoo! Hiya!

252
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,666
Man! I can't believe it!

253
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,333
Krillin, it's really you!
You made it!

254
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,916
[GOHAN laughs]

255
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,041
You made it! Thank goodness!

256
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,333
Yeah! Thank goodness
you saved us, Gohan!

257
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,833
[PICCOLO] Hey! Knock off the
mushy stuff, you sissies!

258
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,416
[KRILLIN] Huh?

259
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
[GOHAN] Uh?

260
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,250
[GOHAN] Oh my gosh... Piccolo...

261
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,083
[KRILLIN laughs]

262
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,625
[KRILLIN] Check him out!

263
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,041
Wow! Piccolo!

264
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,708
Yeah, well, thanks for blowing
up the Makyo Star, kid.

265
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,041
Because of you, Garlic
shriveled up like a raisin.

266
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,958
I see! So the lion's
share of his energy

267
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,958
was actually coming
from the Makyo Star!

268
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,708
Well, I'll be a green,
pointy-eared monkey's uncle!

269
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,583
With the star gone,
he's through!

270
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,458
I hope he can learn
to like the Dead Zone...

271
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,833
...since he's now
a permanent resident.

272
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,583
Piccolo! We did it ourselves!

273
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
We didn't even
need my dad this time!

274
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,583
We needed your dad
very much, kid!

275
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,208
And he was here the whole time!

276
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,666
What? Are you sure?

277
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,291
Of course I'm sure! He was
here, inside of you, Gohan!

278
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,833
Hey, Piccolo?

279
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,000
[PICCOLO] Yes?

280
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,458
Gosh... you're such
an incredible friend.

281
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,250
[PICCOLO] You too,
Gohan. You too...

282
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:59,000
[GOHAN chuckles]

283
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,916
[PICCOLO] He's okay.
He just needs a little rest.

284
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,541
[PICCOLO] Sleep well,
Gohan. I'm proud of you.

285
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,500
[NARRATOR] And so the planet
Earth was back to normal again.

286
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,083
Roshi and friends began
restoring his damaged house.

287
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,000
[OOLONG screams]

288
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,083
[NARRATOR] Krillin and Maron
traded-in for a convertible,

289
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,583
Gohan was being more
closely guarded than ever,

290
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:40,083
and Piccolo resumed his solitary
life of training and meditation.

291
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,458
And though he didn't
accept Kami's offer

292
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,500
to officially take over
as guardian of the Earth,

293
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,416
you can rest assured
that not much escapes

294
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,791
from Piccolo's
ever-watchful gaze.
