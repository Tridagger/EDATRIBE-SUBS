00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,666
Arqua from the East Quadrant
started his fight against Goku

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,375
by transforming the arena
into a whirl-pooling aquarium.

4
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,791
[NARRATOR] Deep in the water
and deep into trouble,

5
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,083
Goku was unable to match

6
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,041
the finned fighter's
underwater speed.

7
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,291
[GOKU] Solar Flare!

8
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,416
[NARRATOR] But with the help
of the Solar Flare technique,

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,875
Goku managed to blind Arqua long
enough to escape into the air.

10
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,791
[NARRATOR] Wasting no time, Goku
used his most trusted attack:

11
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,041
The Kamehameha Wave.

12
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,000
[GOKU] Haaa!

13
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,416
[NARRATOR]
And Goku's fishy foe

14
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,875
was blown right
out of the water.

15
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,416
[ARQUA screams]

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,875
[grunts]

17
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,875
[NARRATOR] But the fighting
was far from over.

18
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,750
Next on the mat:
Pikkon vs. Olibu!

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,625
The most anticipated
match of the tournament.

20
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,750
Both fighters had been training
for centuries for this chance.

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
Both boasted incredible
skill and strength.

22
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,000
Both were hoping
to win the gold.

23
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,916
But only one would
stay standing...

24
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,791
[MUSHROOM MC]
It's official, people!

25
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,791
Pikkon haaas won!

26
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,416
[NARRATOR]
The battle between giants

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,291
has been fought to its end.

28
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,083
Olibu is out.

29
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, if Goku wants to
win the tournament,

30
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,583
he'll have to get past Pikkon.

31
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,541
[GOKU] Gee... Beating Pikkon
is gonna take all I've got...

32
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:26,333
[CROWD roars]

33
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,416
Yeah! Goku!

34
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,125
Make mince meat out of him!

35
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,500
Maraikoh! I know you're
not from my quadrant

36
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,708
but I want you to
pound that rookie!

37
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:58,083
It's quite something that our
newcomer has come this far...

38
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,958
[WINGED MAN] Hmph. You know he
won't make it through this bout.

39
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,166
No, there's something
about his energy--

40
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,041
he may be the first person
from the North Quadrant

41
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,416
to earn the
Grand Kai's lesson...

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
You're dreaming...

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,583
And who says the dead
don't know how to party?!

44
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, what do you say we move
right on to the first match

45
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,958
of the semifinals!

46
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,375
Maraikoh from the West...

47
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,166
And Goku from the North!

48
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,791
C'mon, people, let's do this!

Oh! Just look at that hit!

Goku's been knocked into orbit!

64
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,833

for those meteors!

sense his energy...

than that, folks!

[PIKKON thinking] He shows
more strength with every fight.

Oh yeah, that's right, West Kai.
He's from your quadrant, huh?

111

kinda rude for both my fighters

out of your system,
because there's no way

00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,083
[GOKU] Nah... It's
not important!

181
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,958
Not important?!

182
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,750
Huh...? Hey!

183
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,208
You better watch
your mouth, boy!

184
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,791
Hmph.

185
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not important 'cause I
already know who's gonna win!

186
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,625
What? Are... you psychic?

187
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,875
I... wanna know...

188
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,375
[GOKU]
I'll tell you in a minute!

189
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,333
First is food! Oh, wow!

192
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,875
Pick up the speed,
you jelly rolls!

193
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,416
Not one of you boys even
made it the semifinals!

194
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,291
Do you know how
embarrassed that makes me?!

195
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,375
Now you better get
those pedals moving

196
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,333
or you'll be running one
MILLION more laps!

197
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,666
I'm the queen,
you hear me?!

198
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,333
And queens should win the GOLD!

[screaming continues]

207
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,125
[MUSHROOM MC] Well,
that's it folks!

208
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,583
Whatever's left of Torbie
has definitely been defeated!

Alright!

Here we are at the final
matchup of the tournament!

[CROWD cheers]

214
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,458
Competing for gold from
the West Quadrant...

215
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,291
It's Pikkon!

216
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,791
[CROWD cheers]

217
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,083
And fighting against him
from the North Quadrant...

218
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,083
The rookie wonder Goku!

219
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,916
[MUSHROOM MC] Um, hello?

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,625
Okay, would all Gokus
please report to the arena?

221
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,666
--Your fighter is waiting...
--That's enough!

222
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,083
You can finish your meal

223
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,083
just as soon as you beat
the stuffing out of Pikkon!

224
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,583
Let's go!

225
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,375
[MUSHROOM MC] Well, folks
it seems like our contender's

226
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,541
having somewhat
of a lunch break.

227
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,208
[WEST KAI] Oh, this
boy is making me sick!

228
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,375
[GOKU] Wait, King Kai!
Let me have one more bite!

229
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,291
Come on!

230
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,416
[PIKKON] He's either
a fighting genius...

231
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,291
or a total fool...

232
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,666
[panting]

233
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,125
[EAST KAI] Come on, boys!

234
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Feel the burn!

235
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,333
Whoa!

236
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,125
The finals...

237
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,166
You boys better keep
up the running!

238
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,458
We're on the honor system here!

240
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,916

I know you're fast enough
to block those hits...

[PIKKON chuckles]

246
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,208
It's because those punches
of mine weren't strong enough

247
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,291
to hurt you, is that it?

248
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,916
Well, you'd better
start blocking

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,791
when I use my real strength.

250
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,375

together, Pikkon!

So... is this that
"real strength"

278
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,125
you were talking about?

279
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
What?!

280
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,125
[PIKKON] Or do you still think
you're just playing with me?

You're much stronger
than I thought, Goku.

290
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,208
Thanks, Pikkon...

291
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,125
You're not too bad
a fighter yourself.

00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,583
Hmph.

side of Pikkon before!

This stuff must
weigh a ton!

302

Okay. I get it.

303
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,500
You wear this heavy stuff
to help you train.

304
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,041
I should introduce you
sometime to my friend Piccolo.

305
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,291
Hmm...? Piccolo?

306
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,916
[GOKU] Yeah! He wears
weighted training clothes too.

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,625
You guys would get along great!

This should be good...

to be that kind of fight.

316
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,875
[NARRATOR] Well, well.
It seems both fighters

317
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,833
have been keeping
a few secrets.

318
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,833
With his heavy
training robe removed,

319
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,375
just how great will
Pikkon's true strength be?

320
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,125
And with Goku's upgrade to Super
Saiyan,

321
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,583
you can count on this battle
to be pretty extreme.

322
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,083
The tournament can
have only one winner.

323
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,833
Who will it be?
