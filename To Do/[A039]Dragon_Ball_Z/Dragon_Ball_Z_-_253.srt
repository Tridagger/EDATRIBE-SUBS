00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,791
With the wizard Babidi no longer
acting as his puppeteer,

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,833
the hideous Majin Buu set
forth to destroy the world.

4
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,208
And he came dangerously close!

5
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,416
[NARRATOR But somewhere beneath
the surface of the Earth,

6
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,375
the last hope of
a savior was waiting.

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,125
The world champion Mr. Satan

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,000
emerged from his
training facility,

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,583
determined to put an end

10
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,083
to Majin Buu's violent rampage!

11
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,000
[NARRATOR] But his method
of attack was quite different

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,916
from any the Z Fighters
had thought to try.

13
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,875
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

14
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,750
[NARRATOR] And, unfortunately,
it was also less productive.

15
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,125
[BUU] Buu really like when
the video game goes boom!

16
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,958
Wow, that's the part
most people would hate.

17
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,375
[thinking] Yeah, you just
enjoy your bath, tubby.

18
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,875
I've got you right
where I want you.

19
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,333
I hope.

20
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,250
[GOKU] Do you think
that Gohan's power

21
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,458
is really going to increase
like that old dude says?

22
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,625
I don't about you two,
but all this sitting still

23
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,916
just makes me want
to take another nap.

24
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,500
It will work.

25
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,833
There is no reason
to doubt my ancestor.

26
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,833
He seems very
confident of the process.

27
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,291
[GOKU]
I guess.

28

30
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,541

[snores]

32
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,125
I asked you a question!

[gasps]

34
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,041
Where am I?!

35
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,708
You fell asleep, didn't you?

36
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,750
No, I didn't!

37
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,916
I was in a meditative state!

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
It just appeared
that I was asleep.

39
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,208
It appeared to me
that you were snoring.

40
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,250
To the untrained, meditation
can appear as sleeping.

41
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,166
Besides, it's a well-known
fact that Kais do not lie.

42
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,625
[OLD KAI]
So, come now,

43
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,708
this is no time to be
questioning your tutor.

44
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,500
Let's get back to work!

[thinking]
I don't care what he says,

49
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,375
you don't have
a bubble floating

50
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,416
from your nose if you're awake.

51
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,166
Now, it's time
for the next step.

52
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,708
You must try fusing
as Super Saiyans.

53
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,958
Right!

54
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,375
[PICCOLO]
And if you are successful,

55
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,083
do not let your ambition
control your emotions.

56
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,583
You remember what happened
last time, don't you?

Not too smart, huh?

61
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,750
No, GO!

62
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,791
[PICCOLO] Good! Your energies
are aligned perfectly.

63
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,625
Now perform the technique!

64
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,208
Fu-sion HA!

Whoa, that is amazing!

00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,416
Yeah, and on their
first try, too!

70
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,416
[PICCOLO] Yes, it's an
impressive transformation,

71
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,291
but I'm very curious...

72
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,208
...about your control.

73
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,250
[GOTENKS]
Not so fast.

74
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,166
It's dangerous, showing off
in a place like this.

75
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,875
What's that?!

76
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,291
We don't want to
blow everything up, do we?

77
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
Better fly someplace else.

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,625

No! Gotenks!

Yee-haaw!

00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,375

do something about that.

83
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,625
His speed is better
than his self-control.

[chuckles]

85
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,166
Guess that was a little
too fast for Piccolo.

86
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh well, you
snooze, you lose.

00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,416
[GRAMPS] Come on, dear,
just a little farther.

88
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,208
As long as we make
it to the mountains,

89
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,208
we should be able
to hide from Majin Buu.

[GRANNY] Well, I just
hope our grandchildren

made it out of
West City in time.

Yeah, one shot and she's down!

98
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,083
You really think that's
the right thing to do?

00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,041
Smitty, it's the
end of the world.

100
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,041
Majin Buu is flying
around killing everyone,

why shouldn't I?

00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,250
All bets are off now,
and I'm cashing my chips in.

103

I ever wanted to do.

almost as good as me.

I never thought I had it in me.

That wasn't so bad, was it?

114
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,083
No, it wasn't,
it was a lotta fun!

115
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,958
Did you see 'em fall?

116
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,625
[VAN ZANT laughs]
And guess what, Smitty?!

117
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,833
We've got ourselves a
town that's still standing.

118
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,208
There outta be lots
of people in there!

119
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,166
What took you so long?

120
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,541
I've already been around
the world, like, eight times,

121
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,041
so I decided to relax a bit.

122
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,125
You were just wasting
energy... and time.

[GOTENKS laughs]

124
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,125
I won't need a lot
of time to beat Majin Buu.

125
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,208
Can't you see how strong I am?

126
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,208
Of course, I see it.

--[GOTENKS] So...
--[PICCOLO] No!

passed the test, then.

Wait!

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,875
I'm sorry, Piccolo,
I know you're right.

131
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,500
I really should
stop wasting time.

132
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,541
[PICCOLO]
No, Gotenks! Don't go!

133

He's going to get
himself killed!

134

He has less than a minute
before the fusion splits!

Oh, Mr. Buu,

00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,166
I'm sure it was just
your imagination.

144

Who would be stupid enough

145

to challenge such a
brilliant fighter as you?

Saved The World" again!

178
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,875
This ought to do nicely.

180
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,458
Don't be gone too

This is great!

188
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,916
Hey, Van Zant? Maybe this
isn't the best place to be.

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,666
I heard Majin Buu
built a house around here.

190
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,833
What if he hears all this

191
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,041
and comes looking
to hurt us, what then?

192
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,583
Every single person on
the Earth is gonna die soon.

193
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,000
Wouldn't you like to go out
with a bang in the end?

195
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,666

00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,458
Oh, no, what's he doing
back here already?

199
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,000
Mister Majin Buu, sir,
I-I'm really sorry,

200
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,333
but I'm not quite finished
cooking your dinner yet, sir.

201
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,500
[BUU]
You look at puppy dog.

202

[DOG whines]

203
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,125
Where in the world did
you find that little guy?

204
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,625
He no scared of Buu. He no run.

205
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:53,333
Me try saying words to him,
but he just go "beeee, beeee."

206
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,000
Uh, well, I don't know
how to talk to a dog either,

207
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,250
but it looks like
this poor little guy

208
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,333
mayt have hurt his back leg.

209
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,333
Maybe that's why
he didn't run away.

210
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,708
Huh?

211
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,791
You leg broken?

212
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,541
Me make better,
then you run away.

213

[gasps]

214
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,625
[BUU]
Now get scared and run.

215
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,875
Me make you dead.

[barks]

217
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Why he no run away?
He not scared of Buu, huh?

218
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,125
Nah, he's thanking
you for fixing his leg.

219
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,208
You're his new best friend.

220
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,833
Now he wants you to
play with him a bit.

221
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,083
You know, run around and stuff.

223
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,125

224
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,208
[MR. SATAN]
Well, you are.

225
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,000
You see his tail
wagging back and forth?

226
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,541
That means he likes you.

227
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,375
Buu friends with
you and puppy now?

228
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,166
[laughs]

229
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,083
Sure, we're all friends!

230
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,958
Ha, ha, ha!
Buu feel happy now!

231

[laughs]

232
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,333
Here, eat chocolate.

233
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,166
[MR. SATAN] Oh, now, chocolate
can make a dog really sick.

234
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,166
We should get
him some dog food.

235
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,500
[BUU] How do we get
little doggy food?

236
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,541
Why don't I run to the nearest
grocery store and pick some up?

237
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,583

238
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,583
[MR. SATAN]
I won't be gone long.

239
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,166

and play around for a while.

Okay!

243
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,875
Yeah, now's my chance.

244
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,625
One flip of the
switch, and... Ka-Boom!

246
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,916

[growls]

248
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,958
All right, maybe I'll give
this guy a little time.

249
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,833
[MR. SATAN] Who knows, if people
can change maybe he can, too.

250
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,041
Look at him, he's sure
got a good appetite.

251
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,083
Dog food no taste good.

252
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,583
Uh, excuse me Mr. Buu,

253
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,958
do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

254
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,333
Okay.

255
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,125
Uh, why do you fly around,
ah, ya know, killing people

256
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,708
and destroying
all our cities?

257
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,833
Buu was told to.

258
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,250
Who... told you that?

259
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,875
Bibidi told Buu to kill people.

260
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,125
Babidi said to destroy.

261
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,666
You know, you don't
have to listen to them.

262
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,250
Buu not know
what else Buu can do.

263
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,541
There's lots of things to do!

264
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,958
You can go to the movies,

265
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,791
play with your puppy,
watch football.

266
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,625
Anything as long as it
doesn't involve destruction.

you want to the world

Please, make it quick...

Is to kill people a bad thing?

273
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,083
Yes, it is a bad thing.

274
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
Then... no more.

275
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,083
[MR. SATAN] You're not
gonna kill people any more?

276
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,333
Mm-hmm.

277
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,916
[MR. SATAN] A-And won't
destroy any more cities?

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,375
Mm-hmm.

00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,875
[thinking] I did it! I got
this guy to change his ways

280
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,875
and I didn't have to
throw a punch or blow him up!

281
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,041
Oh, Mr. Satan, you
are truly the greatest!

And you're still
whimpering like a baby.

What if we find
Majin Buu first?

We... what?

288

We surprise him,

in his fat pink head.

the pain of loss.

send Buu on a vengeful
