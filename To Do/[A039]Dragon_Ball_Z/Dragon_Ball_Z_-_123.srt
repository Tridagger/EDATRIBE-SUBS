00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,500
[GOKU] Be right back!

2
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,625
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,625
a mysterious boy
named Trunks

4
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,791
arrived from the
future with a warning:

5
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,750
An unprecedented force
of evil is on its way!

6
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,625
[TRUNKS] ...morning of
May 12th at 10AM...

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,375
A horribly destructive duo
will show up on an island

8
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,708
nine miles southwest
of South City.

9
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,791
What's the deal?
Are they aliens?

10
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,166
[TRUNKS] No.

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,708
They're both androids
created right here on Earth.

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,250
There's no rhyme or
reason to what they do.

13
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,041
They're machines
of destruction.

14
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,166
Man-eaters!

15
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,625
It's mind-boggling
how strong they are.

16
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,500
[NARRATOR] And while Trunks bid
a final heartfelt farewell

17
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,208
to his past...

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,333
[TRUNKS] Father...

19
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm glad I got to see you.

20
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,666
Farewell, young Mother.

21
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,375
May the good spirits
keep you safe.

22
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,250
[NARRATOR] The fate of
the world once again rests

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,583
on the shoulders of
its greatest champion.

24
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,166
[VEGETA growls]

25
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,208
[NARRATOR] But is even
Goku's strength enough

26
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,166
to change the course of history?

27
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,125
Stay tuned!

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,291
[GOKU] Sorry, guys.

29
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,916
I guess all of this trouble
must have followed me

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,541
home from Namek.

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,250
Tell me, Kakarot,

32
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,208
Exactly how did you
escape from Namek anyway?

33
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,958
Oh yeah, that's right.

34
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,958
Frieza's ship was
wrecked wasn't it?

35
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,583
King Kai told us there was no
way you could have survived

36
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,916
when Namek exploded.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
We thought you were a goner.

38
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
How did you get away?

39
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

40
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,333
[thinking]
But there were moments

41
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,125
where I didn't
think I'd make it...

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,541
[GOKU growls]

43
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,666
[GOKU] C'mon, baby! Please work!

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,708
[beeping]

45
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,875
[GOKU] Work, you
sorry piece of junk!

46
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,333
[GOKU growls]

47
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,458
No! Wait! I take it back!
You're not a piece of junk!

48
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,916
[GOKU gasps]

49
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,416
Oh nooo!

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,250
[GOKU screams]

51
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,166
[KRILLIN] So Frieza's ship
wouldn't work at all?

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Wow, Goku! I bet you
must've been really scared.

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,291
Yeah, but it's a
good thing for me

54
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,041
I was able to keep a
clear head through it all.

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
Enough with the
suspense already!

56
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,833
Get on with the blasted story!

57
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,500
All right! Where was I...?

58
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:02,000
Hmm... Planet Namek was
just about to blow...

59
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,083
[GOKU] Come on,
you piece of junk!

60
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,208
Go! Go! Go!

61
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,833
[GOKU] I had almost
given up hope.

62
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,250
But then, at the last minute,

63
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,833
I caught a glimpse of
another space ship!

64
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,125
[VEGETA] Another ship?!

65
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,291
Ahh, it must have belonged
to the Ginyu Force!

66
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,625
[GOKU] Whoever it belonged to,

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,541
I knew it was my only
chance, so I went for it!

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,166
[GOKU] There was no time
for me to plot a course,

69
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,625
so I just fired up the
engines and punched it!

70
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,041
[GOKU] I made it off of Namek

71
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,250
with just a couple
of seconds to spare!

72
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,291
[GOKU] The only problem was I
had no idea where I was going!

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,083
[GOKU screams]

74
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,208
[GOKU] The next thing I
remember is crash landing

75
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,458
on some strange planet
light years away from Namek.

76
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,375
[GOKU groans]

77
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,666
[ALIENS warble]

78
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,250
[GOKU gasps]

79
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:34,333
[ALIENS yell]

80
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,875
[ALIENS warble]

81
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,416
It's my lucky day...

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,916
I didn't know that the
circus was in town...

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,375
[ALIENS continue warbling]

84
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,958
[GOKU] It turns out I'd landed
on the Planet Yardrat,

85
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,375
and the inhabitants
were really friendly!

86
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,625
They were kind enough to
nurse me back to health,

87
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,333
and they even
repaired my spaceship!

88
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,666
So once I was strong enough
to make the journey,

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,875
I packed up and headed home!

90
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,125
That may explain where you've
been for all of this time,

91
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,000
but there's still a few
things I'd like to know.

92
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,541
For starters...

93
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,708
where in the world did you get
that absurd looking outfit?

94
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,958
[GOKU] It's the latest fashion
on Planet Yardrat

95
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,208
but I guess it does
look a little strange.

96
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,416
But at least it's not pink!

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,791
Never mind!

98
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,833
Who cares about your
stupid clothes anyway?!

99
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,666
Now it's pretty obvious
that you've been training!

100
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,416
I want to see what
you've learned!

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,291
[GOKU] Hmm...

102
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,833
Now where to begin... Oh yeah!

103
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,166
Alright!

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,791
I knew that Goku wouldn't
come back empty handed!

105
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,541
Come on! Show us
some new tricks, Goku!

106
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,583
Alright, let's see if
I can remember it now!

107
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,458
How did it go again...?

108
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,333
It's not an easy trick to do...

109
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,375
I like to call it,
"The Instant Transmission!"

110
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,875
[ALL] The instant
what?!

111
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:54,125
Hey! Come on.
Let's see it!

112
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,666
Okay. Watch this!

113
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,000
Alright, to begin with,
I need to imagine a person.

114
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,791
A person far away...
Now who should it be?

115
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,375
Someone with a whole lot of
life energy would be good!

116
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,000
Now... who's it gonna be...?

117
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,041
I got it!

118
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,500
Ready?

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,500
3... 2... 1...

120
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,416
[gasping]

121
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,541
--He's gone?!
--He's gone?!

122
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,125
Wow!

123
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,833
Hmph. So, what's so great about
that? It's just super speed!

124
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,166
Ta-Dah! Check it out!

125
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,250
Wha--? But those glasses
are Master Roshi's!

126
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,708
Yeah, they are!

127
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,291
[ROSHI] Nooooo!

128
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,083
[ROSHI whimpers]

129
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,333
My glasses!

130
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,000
But... that's impossible!

131
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,500
Kame house is miles
away from here, Goku.

132
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,541
What's up?!

133
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,958
It's a secret.

134
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,000
[VEGETA growls]

135
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,541
Krillin, can I trust
you with these?

136
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,458
Sure, no problem-o!

137
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,875
Oh man, now he's
gonna get an attitude!

138
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,791
[GOKU laughs]

139
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
[GOKU] I'll say!

140
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,708
Great...

141
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,625
Now don't you think we ought to
talk about some other things...

142
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,750
like androids?

143
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:15,375
Androids?! Gosh! I guess I
almost forgot about them.

144
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,750
[ALLL gasp]

145
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,916
On May 12th, three
years from now,

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,833
on an island, 9 miles
southwest of South City

147
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,500
at 10 o'clock
in the morning,

148
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,458
two killer androids
will arrive--

149
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,166
[GOKU] Okay, okay!
Enough! Just joking!

150
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,750
We all remember.

151
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,541
So... What you're saying is we
should keep that day open, huh?

152
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,583
This one could get
a little bit rough.

153
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,666
So you'll have to decide
if you're in or you're out!

154
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,000
When the time comes,

155
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,875
you won't be able to hide
behind those sunglasses!

156
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,750
Yeah, that's for sure.

157
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,500
[KRILLIN chuckles]

158
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,041
Now hold on, I don't
remember putting you

159
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,708
in charge of this operation.

160
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,708
Are you challenging
me, Vegeta?!

161
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,291
Hmm...

162
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,041
Whoa, now!

163
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,875
[PICCOLO] Don't
cross me, Vegeta!

164
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,083
[VEGETA] Or what?!

165
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,000
[BULMA sighs]

166
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,791
Hey, hold on. I just
had an great idea...

167
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,583
I know a way we can save
the Earth and not fight!

168
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,208
Get rid of Dr. Gero!

169
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:14,958
Huh?!

170
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:20,375
[ALL gasping]

171
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,125
Here's what I think
we should do:

172
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,958
Use the Dragon Balls to
summon the Dragon,

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,791
He'll tell us where
the doctor is.

174
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,625
We take out the doctor and
all of our problems are solved!

175
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,500
Ya get it?

176
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,500
That's great! In fact, Bulma,

177
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm surprised I didn't think
of that before you did!

178
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,541
I mean who wants to wait
around for three years anyway?

179
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,250

to the great minds like my own.

Get over yourself!

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,291
You wouldn't know a great idea
if it hit you in the head,

00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,875
Wow, I can't believe it,
but I guess I have to

189
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,333
side with Vegeta.

--Besides, Dr. Gero

he hasn't done anything wrong.

Well, we'll just have to wait.

193

androids were strong enough

to wipe us all out!

Why do you want to rush off
and meet them head on?!

Think about it, guys.

You don't want to fight them!

looks like we have to.

Well, that's it. I know
what I have to do. I'm in!

Think about it. We're
a lot stronger together

than we are apart.

have no problem

beating those
androids, right?

213
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,166
Yeah, Bulma, your idea
was good in theory,

214
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,500
but maybe you ought to rethink
your position on this one.

don't want to get beaten up!

crampin' my style!

take over the Earth
and enslave everybody

you can handle it,

a line sometime!

up with you guys anyway!

was talking about.

was trying to say...

you got married

while you sleep" kit

tell me that Gohan's studies

than saving the Earth?

than Gohan's studies right now!

I guess I'm not used to the
gravity on Earth yet, ChiChi!

349
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,875
Listen, Goku. I'll let
Gohan train with you

350
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,791
but I want him to
try and study too.

351
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,291
I don't think that's
unreasonable.

352
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,125
I mean a boy his age can't
spend everyday rough housing.

353
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,541
He needs an education and I
want to make sure he gets one.

354
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,125
Have I made myself clear?!

355
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,666
That's one battle
Goku will never win.

356
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,500
Okay...

357
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
[TIEN grunts]

358
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,583
[TIEN growls]

359
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,875
[TIEN shouts]

[TIEN yells]

363
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,958
That... wasn't... bad, Tien...

364
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:31,666
[ROSHI giggles]

365
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,125
Hmm...?

366
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,083
[KRILLIN growls]

367
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,333
[KRILLIN] Kame... hame...

368
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,375
Well, hello there!

369
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,583
[KRILLIN grunts]

370
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,083
[ROSHI] Hey, Krillin!

371
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,291
[KRILLIN] Huh?

372
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
Why don't you give it
a rest for a while?

373
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,291
You know what they say.
"All work and no play makes--"

374
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,250
me-HAAA!

375
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,333
[ROSHI] Cut that out, Krillin!

376
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,416
You're gettin' my
magazines all wet!

377
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,208
[GOHAN grunts]

378
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,875
Ready, Gohan?

379
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,208
[GOHAN pants]

380
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,333
Yeah...

381
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,041
[GOKU yells]

382
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,250
[PICCOLO yells]

383
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,083
[GOHAN growls]

384
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:35,000
[GOKU &amp; PICCOLO yelling]

385
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,500
[BOTH shout]

386
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:45,166
[shouting,
blows landing]

387
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,250

[GOHAN grunts]

394
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,333
[GOHAN screams]

395
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,125
[PICCOLO] Well, I think
that's enough for today.

396
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, I'll say!

397
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:31,500
[GOHAN] No! Let's keep
going! I can take it!

398
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,791
I've... got to get strong.

399
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,708
[GOHAN grunts]

400
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:46,375
I... want to be as
strong as you two...

401
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,708
[GOHAN growls]

402
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,625
[AEROBICS GIRL] One... And
two... And three... And four!

403
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,166
Come on! One, two, three,

404
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,875
--four! One, and two--
--[YAMCHA chuckles]

405
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,375
Buddy, I can get you in
that class if you want!

406
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,833
No... Thanks.

407
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:20,166
Okay... Maybe the dance
class isn't such a bad idea.

408
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:30,625
[VEGETA grunts]

409
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,375
I'll show Kakarot...

410
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:37,166
that he's not the
only Super Saiyan...

411
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,083
in the universe!

412
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:39,916
[VEGETA grunts]

413
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,041
[NARRATOR] No pain, no gain.

414
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,333
That's a lesson Gohan is
learning the hard way

415
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,125
from Goku and Piccolo.

416
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,958
And he has three years
to get it right.

417
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,375
[GOHAN] Come on!

418
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,208
