00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,750
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,291
Majin Buu continued
his random destruction

3
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,875
of the cities of the Earth.

4
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,791
With no greater motive than
his own childish amusement,

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,833
Buu had already
annihilated two thirds

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,291
of the planet's population.

7
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,791
And still counting!

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,750
[laughs]

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,875
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,708
Goku arrived at the
Check-in Station.

11
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,125
Goku, I'm surprised at you.

12
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,250
You're not going to
cut in line, are you?

13
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,750
I sure am! Don't tell!

14
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,166
You crack me up!

15
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,500
So long!

16
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,833
[NARRATOR] Inside, a grumpy
King Yemma confirmed

17
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,500
that Gohan had not
checked in! He was alive!

18
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,916
Really? Woo, hoo! Yay, yay!
He's not dead! Awesome!

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,166
[laughing]

20
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,708
[NARRATOR]
Using Instant Transmission,

21
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,875
Goku was able to
find the special sanctuary

22
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,500
where Supreme Kai was
overseeing Gohan's training

23
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,041
with the Z Sword!

24
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,250
[NARRATOR] It was a
hair-raising arrival for Goku,

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,625
but now that father
and son have reunited,

26
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,333
let the training begin!

27
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,166
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fusion! Ha!

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,583
[PICCOLO]
Again!

29
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,750
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fu-sion! Ha!

30
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,583
You're not synchronized!

31
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,250
You've got to stay focused!
All right, take a breather.

32
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,875
Listen. It's not
just body movement.

33
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,333
Before you become one,
you have to be one.

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,125
You've got to think
the same thoughts,

35
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,083
breathe in the same rhythm!

36
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,916
How can I breathe when
he's cuttin' silent ones?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,291
Look who's talking!
Your breath smells like death!

38
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,500
It does not!

39
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,041
Does too!

40
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,875
[PICCOLO]
Errrgh! Enough!

41
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,416
What do you think you're doing?!

42
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,125
Get a hold of yourselves!

43
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,958
Can't you two sense what's
going on below us right now?

44
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,583
Innocent people
are being killed

45
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,458
and you're acting like this!

46
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,083
[TRUNKS grumbles]

47
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,750
[sighs]

48
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,625
Errm!
All right! Are we ready?

49
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,625
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes...

50
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,541
[PICCOLO]
Then let's see it then!

51
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,958
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fusion! Ha!

52
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,958
[PICCOLO]
Much better! Again!

53
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,541
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fusion! Ha!

54
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,791
[PICCOLO]
Again!

55
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,125
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fusion! Ha!

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,166
[ANDROID 18]
Fusion! Uhh!

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,250
I tell ya! It's enough to
drive someone crazy, isn't it?

58
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,416
[ANDROID 18] I even
dreamed about it last night.

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,958
Puar was trying to
fuse with the Ox-King!

60
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,875
[BULMA]
Ooh! How awful!

61
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Hey!

62
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,250
What? You think you're
about to win, don't you?

63
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,500
Well, forget it!

64
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,333
[KRILLIN] Let's see. Uh,
which one do I want? Uh...

65
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,416
[KRILLIN] Hmm...
It's so hard to know.

66
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,916
[ROSHI] Hm?

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,333
How strange!
Fusing together!

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,875
It's hard to imagine
those two as one boy.

69
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,333
[ROSHI] I wonder if boys
can fuse with girls.

70
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,833
[BULMA] Good questions.

71
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,125
Aaah!

72
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
[ROSHI laughs]
Why, thank you!

73
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,083
That's just the card
I wanted you to pick!

74
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,541
Heh, heh!

75
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,375
Haaa...!

76
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,958
[grunting]

77
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,000
Huaaah!

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,166
[GOKU]
Wow! Cool!

79
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,375
Haaa!

80
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,250
[GOKU]
Yeah! Nice!

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,791
Looking good, Gohan!
I'm impressed!

82
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,375
[chuckles]

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,708
[GOKU] I can't believe
that you've mastered it

84
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,208
like that in one day!

85
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,291
That's incredible, son!

86
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,833
[SUPREME KAI] Yes! Handling
the Z Sword in this fashion

87
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,166
is unprecedented.

88
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,625
You should be
very proud of yourself!

89
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,708
[chuckles nervously]

90
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,750
Gohan! Whatd'ya say we
put that baby to the test

91
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,958
and see how sharp it is?

92
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,083
Sure!

93
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,791
[GOKU] Great.
I'll toss. You slice.

94
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,500
Sounds good to me, Dad!

95
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:26,166
Let's see now. Hmm...
Yeah! Why not?

96
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,041
Uhuhhh, aah!

97
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,375
[GOKU] Let's start out
with this small one.

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,083
[GOHAN] Right, Dad.
Ready when you are.

99
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,750
[SUPREME KAI]
That's a small one?

100
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
'Kay! Coming atcha!

101
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,291
I hope this doesn't
over-stress the blade!

102
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,375
Nah! It'll handle it
like a champion!

103
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,250
Just watch and see!

104
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,666
After all,
this is the Z Sword!

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,541
[GOKU]
All right! Batter up!

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,000
[grunts]

107
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,791
[GOHAN]
Hu-aah!

108
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,208
[gasps]

109
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,458
[laughs]

110
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,750
My! That was superb, Gohan!

111
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,125
Thank you!

112
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,875
[KIBITO]
Yes! Amazing! Truly!

113
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,333
[laughs]

114
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,208
I think you're ready
for a big one, son!

115
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Just a minute!

116
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,791
[GOKU]
Uh?

117
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,375
How about more density
and a little less mass?

118
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,208
Here, Goku. Catch.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,708
Eee!

120
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,375
Whoa! What's this?

121
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,250
That is the hardest known
metal in the Universe.

122
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,708
It's called Katchin.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,125
Oh, Katchin?

124
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,333
[SUPREME KAI] Yes. This will
be a much better test.

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,375
[GOKU]
You're not kidding!

126
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,750
Hey. Gohan. Ready?

127
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,583
[GOHAN]
Let her fly, Dad!

128
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,250
All right! Here it comes!

129
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,708
[GOKU yells]

130
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,625
[GOHAN yells]

131
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,416
[yells]

132
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:30,291
Eee!

133
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,750
Uh!

134
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,000
Huh? Oh, no!
Now it's the Z Dagger!

135
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,208
[chuckles nervously]

136
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,583
Please! No! Tell me
it's not true, Kibito!

137
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,041
It's true!
It snapped in two!

138
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,833
Uh, oh! Wow!

139
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,708
I-I guess it's probably
called the "hardest metal

140
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,583
in the universe"
for a reason, isn't it.

141
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,166
But he who masters the sword
is supposed to have

142
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,541
the greatest power
in the Universe!

143
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,916
Wield the sword and you can
not be rivaled! It's legend!

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,458
Huh! I guess they must have
exaggerated a little bit!

145
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,666
Hey, guys! Look!

146
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,791
There is definitely a
bright side to all of this.

147
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,583
The sword training has made me
a lot stronger and faster.

148
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,375
See! Maybe the legend
means that the person

149
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,208
who is able to master
the handling of the Z Sword

150
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,541
attains the greatest
power in the Universe!

151
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,791
Hey, whatd'ya think?

152
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes! It's possible!

153
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,875
Your power has definitely
increased from handling it!

154
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,625
And if you're
stronger at this level,

155
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,625
that means you'll be much
stronger as a Super Saiyan!

156
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,875
Mm! Mmm!

157
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,166
Yes! Sure! That must be it!

158
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,791
Gohan doesn't need the sword,
he's already gained the power!

159
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,500
Yeah but, does Gohan's power
surpass Majin Buu's?

160
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
I'm not so sure.

161
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,708
[gasps]
What are you saying, Goku?

162
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,958
That we don't have a chance?

163
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,458
[MALE VOICE]
Quiet!

164
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,333
[BOTH shriek]

165
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,208
[MAN chuckles]
Ahh! Much better!

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,833
[chuckles]

167
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,833
Uh, sir. We were in
the middle of training.

168
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,666
[MAN]
You call that training?

169
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,083
[laughs]

170
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,583
[SUPREME KAI] Who are you?
How did you get here?

171
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,375
Who me?

172
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,083
Check out the
hair-style, youngster.

173
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:49,375
And the ear-loops! Yes! Yes!
Oh, and the dashing looks!

174
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm just an
older version of you!

175
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:56,208
Fifteen generations
to be precise! I'm Kai!

176
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:00,583
What?! Fifteen...
generations ago?

177
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,458
What? There're two
Supreme Kai's?

178
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,458
[GOHAN]
Mm-mmm!

179
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:34,916
[indistinct chatter]

180
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,166
[ATTENDANT 1]
Please remain calm!

181
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,583
King Yemma is working
as fast as he can!

182
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,625
Uhh! Excuse me, King Yemma?

183
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,208
What now?

184
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,833
Please, sir. We've been
working around the clock.

185
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,500
Can we please
just take a break?

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,416
Take a break?!

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,250
Uhh! We're starving,
our armpits stink,

188
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,750
and our feet ache!

189
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,333
We just want to take a shower
and get something to eat!

190
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,333
[ATTENDANT 1] My horns
are throbbing, King Yemma!

191
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,250
We just need a little rest!

192
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,791
A little rest
would do us all good!

193
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,750
But while I'm in charge,
we get the job done first!

194
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
[BOTH sigh]

195
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,416
Try to remember the days
when there weren't any souls.

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,666
And the two of you
stood around doing nothing!

197
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,416
While still getting paid!

198
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,375
[BOTH whimper]

199
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,333
[ATTENDANT 3]
King Yemma! More arrivals!

200
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,541
How many?

201
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,333
[ATTENDANT 3]
They're all from Earth, sir.

202
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,375
We estimate one million
five hundred thousand!

203
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,750
One million?!

204
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,708
[ATTENDANT 3]
And a half, sir. Yes.

205
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,083
[YEMMA grunts]

206
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,750
This is ridiculous!
Where's Goku when you need him?

207
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,041
You're how many years old?

208
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,291
Fifteen generations?

209
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,041
Remarkable, aye?

210
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,833
[coughs wheezingly]

211
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,625
Well then. Now. Yes.

212
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm sure you're wondering how
I'm still alive. So listen!

213
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,875
There was a terrible villain
who lived way back then.

214
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, not as
terrible as Majin Buu,

215
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,625
but still pretty bad.

216
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,416
The only thing he
feared was that

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,916
I would use my
awesome powers to stop him

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,250
and his evil ways.
So he tricked me.

219
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,416
He sealed me away
inside the Z Sword!

220
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,625
From whence I came.

221
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,916
[SUPREME KAI] You mean
you were trapped inside

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,625
the Z Sword all this time?

223
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:26,791
[OLD KAI] Mm, hmm! I sure was!
Now I've got a cramp!

224
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,041
I don't think this guy looks
as strong as he says, do you?

225
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,291
Not really.

226
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,250
Hey! Let's put him to the test!

227
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,291
What? Dad? I don't know if...

228
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,458
[GOKU]
Sshhh! Watch!

229
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,625
Ya!

230
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,958
[OLD KAI]
Aah!

231
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,333
[ALL yell]

232
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

233
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,791
Oh my dear ancestor!

234
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,708
[KIBITO] Please! Venerable Sir!
Are you all right?

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,208
How dare you?! Babies!
Babies in diapers!

236
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,916
That's what you two are!

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,250
Trying an attack like that on
a fearsome presence like me!

238
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,625
Are you cracked?!

239
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,458
Aah!

240
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,875
But sir! That attack
was just child's play!

241
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,958
My little brother
coulda handled that!

242
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,083
All of my enemies feared me!

243
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,625
But not because of
my strength!

244
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,375
My menacing capacities
are what struck terror

245
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,041
into their hearts!

246
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,250
Capacities?

247
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,083
Menacing?

248
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,625
Hmm? What do you mean?

249
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,791
I'm not telling! Nope!

250
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,791
Give me one good reason
why I should! Huh?

251
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,875
Blaaa, naaa!

252
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,958
[GOKU] Well, hmm...
Let me see here...

253
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,166
I got it! My old master
likes girly magazines!

254
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,333
We'll get you some!

255
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,333
Oh, boy! Uhh, Dad?

256
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,041
Goku, please!
How inappropriate!

257
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,833
Hm! I have no need
for such things!

258
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,208
With my omniscient vision,

259
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,041
I can see girls playing
volleyball on the beach!

260
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,833
[laughs]

261
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,916
You call yourself a Kai?!

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
[GOKU]
Hey, old man!

263
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,291
How 'bout we get you a date
with a real live Earth woman!

264
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,166
Mm! Is she a good kisser?

265
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah! Of course!

266
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,458
[laughs]

267
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,458
[GOKU thinking]
What luck!

268
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,125
This guy's just
like Master Roshi!

269
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,083
Dad? Are you nuts?

270
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,416
How are you going
to find someone

271
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,375
that wants to kiss that guy?

272
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,541
Hey! Don't worry. I can't go
back to Earth, but you can.

273
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,291
This is all too simple.
You can handle it, son.

274
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,708
It might require a
little sacrifice, though.

275
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,708
Can you get Videl to do it?

276
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,708
Dad, I'm not going
to ask my girlfriend

277
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,250
to kiss that old relic!

278
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,958
Okay! Okay! Sheesh!
Who else do we know?

279
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,416
[ROSHI] Well, I haven't heard
any Fusion Ha's in a while.

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,625
Piccolo must be
giving them a break.

281
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,375
It feels a little strange
to be playing cards

282
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,041
with the world being destroyed
right beneath us. Hmm!

283
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,250
How weird! I just had an
intense deja-vu, you guys!

284
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,125
Two cards.

285
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,375
Strange! I must've lived
through this before. Yeah!

286
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,458
[chuckles]

287
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,041
Then you know
you're about to lose!

288
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,958
Let's see. Come on! Please...

289
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,875
Yay! I did it! Ha-ha-ha!

290
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,291
Royal Flush!
Read 'em and weep!

291
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,291
[ROSHI, KRILLIN yell]

292
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,458
[BULMA giggles]

293
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,458
[GOKU sighs]

294
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,958
Hm...

295
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,958
Okay, I have someone in mind

296
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,125
but she's not exactly
a spring chicken.

297
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,125
Hm! It doesn't really matter.

298
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,666
As long as
she's a good kisser!

299
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,583
Hey what about Bulma?
She'd do it!

300
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,291
Do you think
she's a good kisser?

301
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:59,000
What? Why are you asking me?
I don't want any part of this!

302
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,916
Just getting
the details straight!

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,125
Now was that with
lipstick or without?

304
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,916
With! Definitely with! Yes!

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,791
Either way
would be fine, really.

306
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,291
I think it's worth it if this
guy's powers can help us win!

307
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,916
Bulma will listen
to you Gohan.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,083
One kiss
could save the world!

309
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,500
Dad! Have you looked
at that guy? Come on!

310
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,500
And what if his so called
powers don't help?

311
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,625
Do you know how mad
Bulma would be at me

312
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,291
if she kissed him for nothing?

313
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,708
It's a done deal.

314
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,208
Man, you're good!

315
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,875
So what are these
"capacities" of yours?

316
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,500
[clears throat]

317
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,833
How shall I say this?

318
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,083
Guess I'll put it
in layman's terms.

319
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,041
If I use my powers on a kitty
cat that goes "meow,"

320
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,750
he'll go...
[lion's roar]

321
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,125
Get it?
[lion's roar]

322
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:57,083
In other words, an ordinary
cat becomes a lion.

323
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,750
So you see...

324
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,291
Therein lies my talent--

325
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,000
I awaken people's
sleeping powers!

326
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,500
[SUPREME KAI, KIBITO gasp]

327
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,791
Oh, so then... you're not
really that strong yourself.

328
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:14,166
You fool! I can take a
person far beyond his limits!

329
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,875
Ugh! The bird becomes
an eagle! Get it?!

330
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,916
Yeah, it's just a
little hard to believe.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,458
[chuckles nervously]

332
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,333
[OLD KAI]
Young people!

333
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,083
You! How would you like to

334
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,583
have your sleeping
powers awakened?

335
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,416
Who? Me?

336
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,583
Yeah, you! Get over there!

337
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,125
Okay...

338
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,750
A guy like you with the
power to break the Z Sword--

339
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:47,833
I can do something with you.
Yes, you have great potential!

340
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,166
Funny though.

341
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,500
I always thought
it would be a Kai

342
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,166
that broke the
Z sword and rescued me.

343
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,041
But you're more of a shoe-shine
boy than a hero, huh?

344
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,583
The Kai's being
rescued by mere mortals.

345
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,791
Things have
sure gone down hill.

346
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,500
Mm! Well, sir,
I've always tried my best.

347
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,041
[OLD KAI]
Keep your chin up, lad!

348
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,791
Keep your chin up!

349
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,458
There.
Stay where you are, son.

350
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,583
Remain perfectly still.

351
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,833
Right.

352
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,750
Now just relax.

353
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Wake up you lazy,
no good powers.

354
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,333
Mmm!

355
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:34,208
Sleeping all of this time!
How dare you?! Wake up!

356
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,458
[SUPREME KAI gulps]

357
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:48,208
[OLD KAI moans, grunts]

358
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,875
Uh...

359
00:19:51,958 --> 00:20:01,916
[OLD KAI mumbles nonsensically]

360
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,333
[OLD KAI mumbles nonsensically]

361
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:14,041
Wake up, you!
Sleeping powers! Wake up now!

362
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,916
Whoo, wooo, wooo!

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,791
[GOHAN]
Uh, excuse me.

364
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,958
--[GOHAN] Uh... sir.
--[OLD KAI] Quiet, please!

365
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,250
Be still. This is what
sets the mood.

366
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,708
Sets the mood?
But I thought...

367
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, stop thinking. This is
just the opening ceremony.

368
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:45,041
[nonsensical mumbles continue]

369
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,083
Good grief! Wow! What next?

370
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,083
Excuse me. How long
is this going to take?

371
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,875
Five more hours.
Power raising.

372
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,750
Twenty more after that.

373
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,208
[GOHAN]
Aaah...!

374
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,375
[chuckles]

375
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,375
Well, bye guys. I'm gonna go
take a little nap.

376
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,041
Do your best, Gohan!

377
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,625
Dad! Don't go!

378
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,666
[GOKU] Get me up when your
sleeping powers wake up.

379
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:37,541
[chants nonsensically]

380
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:43,166
Well, Kibito this is quite an
unexpected turn of events.

381
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,541
Yes, sir. Very odd.

382
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,666
Why me?

383
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,666
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fusion! Ha!

384
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,041
Fu...sion! Ha!

385
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,208
Good! You've got it!
Your form is nearly perfect.

386
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,083
[BOTH]
Ah-aah!

387
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,291
All right.
Now it's time to see

388
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,708
if you two can actually do it!

389
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:13,166
Boys. Align your energies.
This is it!

390
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,708
[BOTH]
Right!

391
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,041
[PICCOLO] Remember.
Breathe in the same rhythm.

392
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,500
And when you see each other,

393
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,958
don't think of yourselves
as separate or different.

394
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,416
You're just seeing
another part of yourself.

395
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,916
Okay! Ready?!

396
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,375
[BOTH]
Yes!

397
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,875
[NARRATOR] It seems that Trunks
and Goten are getting closer

398
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,375
to reaching their goal.

399
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,166
But what about Gohan?

400
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,958
Does the mysterious old Kai
really have the power

401
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,791
to bring him
to higher heights?

402
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,333
Gohan seems skeptical!

403
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,166
As Supreme Kai marvels
at his ancient ancestor,

404
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,458
Goku drifts off
into a dreamy sleep,

405
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,875
worlds away from
any cares or concerns.

406
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,291
He'll need his rest...

407
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:55,166
for the next action packed
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
