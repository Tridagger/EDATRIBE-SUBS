1
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,791
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,833
When a violent aftershock
sent her Dragon Ball

3
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,458
tumbling
into the sea,

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,125
Bulma had
no choice

5
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,083
but to confront the
dangers of the deep!

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,416
[BULMA screams]

7
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,583
[NARRATOR] And with monstrous
creatures lurking at every turn,

8
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,166
Bulma quickly found
herself in deep trouble!

9
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,416
But the ever-resourceful girl
would not be sunk so easily!

10
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Thanks to some
quick thinking,

11
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,916
and some equally
impressive piloting skills,

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,041
Bulma was able to
out-maneuver her fishy foes

13
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,416
and reclaim her prize!

14
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,875
[NARRATOR] But no sooner
had she reached the safety

15
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,041
of the beach that her
troubles really began!

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,291
[BULMA whimpers]

17
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,291
[BLUEBERRY] Where are the
rest of the Dragon Balls?!

18
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,291
[BULMA screams]

19
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,916
[RASPBERRY] Where's Vegeta?!

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,500
[BULMA whimpers]

21
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay. If you don't
want to talk to us,

22
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,000
you can talk to
Lord Frieza instead!

23
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,708
F-Frieza...!

24
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,083
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues today!

25
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:35,375
[BULMA] Put me down! I already
told you everything I know!

26
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,708
Vegeta's the one who's
got all the Dragon Balls!

27
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,583
Don't you get it? It doesn't
matter what you do to me!

28
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,750
I can't help you! I don't have
the information Frieza wants!

29
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,083
A-and that means...

30
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,791
[BULMA screams]

31
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,333
It means I'm
done for...

32
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,541
[BULMA sniffs]

33
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,875
This is really it,

34
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,041
and there's no one coming
to save me this time...

35
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,666
[BULMA sobbing softly]

36
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,875
[BULMA] I can't
believe it's over...

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,916
After all the crazy adventures
I've had in my life...

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,041
Meeting Goku and
the gang...

39
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,791
Finding out about
Goku's powers...

40
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,666
And the strange transformation
that Saiyans undergo

41
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,375
at the full moon...

42
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,666
[BULMA sobs]

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,750
[BULMA] And taking on
that awful Emperor Pilaf

44
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,875
and his evil
sidekicks...

45
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,083
[BULMA sobs softly]

46
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,041
[BULMA] I've had so
many close calls

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,833
searching for
the Dragon Balls...

48
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,333
So many close calls...

49
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,458
But this time...

50
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,666
This time...

51
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,583
No! Stop! Pleeeease!
I told you for the last time!

52
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,500
I promise I don't know
anything! Please!

53
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,625
[BLUEBERRY] Ah, shut up.

54
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,166
[BLUEBERRY gasps]

55
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Yaah!

56
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,916
[BULMA screams]

57
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,708
[BULMA shouting]

58
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,125
[screams]

59
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,833
[BLUEBERRY] Girl, you're
getting to be a major pain!

60
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,000
[RASPBERRY] And don't think
all your tears and moaning

61
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,833
are going to get
you out of this!

62
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,166
We're taking you to
Frieza, and that's that.

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,875
How many times do I
have to tell you goons?!

64
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,541
I don't know where
the Dragon Balls are!

65
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,083
[BULMA sobbing]

66
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,958
Yeah, yeah.
We heard you already.

67
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,666
But I'm sure a little
visit with Frieza

68
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,708
will help jog
your memory.

69
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,125
[BULMA squeals]

70
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:58,625
[BULMA panting frantically]

71
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,875
[BULMA wailing]

72
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,125
I really wanna know.

73
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,500
Just what are
these Dragon Balls

74
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,458
that they're worth puttin'
up with all of this?!

75
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,291
Who knows?
And who cares?

76
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,666
It's not like it's our place
to ask questions, now is it?

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,958
[BULMA panting]

78
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,875
You mean to tell me that
you two muscle-heads

79
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,666
don't even know what those
Dragon Balls can do?!

80
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,750
Uhh... Hey, what if I
told you the Dragon Balls

81
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,541
could make you the most
powerful beings in the universe?

82
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,166
Hmph. Yeah, right.

83
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,416
[BULMA squeals]

84
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,625
[BULMA] Honest!
I'm not lying!

85
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,916
All you have to do is
gather the seven Dragon Balls,

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,833
and any wish you
make comes true!

87
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,666
Save it,
would ya?!

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,083
[BULMA whines frustratedly]

89
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
No! You don't
understand!

90
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm saying
the two of you

91
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,833
could be even more powerful
than Frieza himself!

92
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,291
What?!

93
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,875
[BULMA] I'm telling you!
Just think about it!

94
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,083
Why do you
think everyone

95
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,958
wants to get their
hands on them so badly?

96
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,708
Hey...
Shut her up!

97
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,166
We've wasted enough time
listening to her babbling.

98
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,708
Yeah...
He's right!

99
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,166
Why are you guys standing
around wasting your time on me,

100
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,458
when you could be
out there collecting

101
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,583
Dragon Balls
for yourselves?

102
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,458
[RASPBERRY] Hey...
What're you doing?

103
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,875
Think! You can have
everything you ever wanted,

104
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,791
anything in your
wildest dreams!

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,500
Just one little wish,
and it's all yours!

106
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,416
Can't you see
the girl's lying?

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,291
[BLUEBERRY]
And what if she isn't?

108
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,000
[BULMA giggling]

109
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,708
[BLUEBERRY snickers]

110
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,583
[BLUEBERRY] Very interesting...

111
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,875
Huh? What?

112
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,291
Here's what I say:

113
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,916
If we find all the Dragon
Balls, at the very least,

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,041
Frieza's sure to
give us a big reward.

115
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,791
Of course... Before
we bring 'em back,

116
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,916
we'll try
making a wish

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,791
of our own and see
if it comes true.

118
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,833
Oh, and it will!
Take my word for it!

119
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,375
Okay then, I say it's time
we got started looking.

120
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,458
[BULMA gasps]

121
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,583
Wait... just
a sec, please...

122
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,250
Don't you think I'd
just slow you down?

123
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,666
[BLUEBERRY] You
got two choices:

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,541
You can come with us,
or I can kill you here.

125
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,958
[BULMA screams]

126
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,166
No...

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,625
[BULMA squeals]

128
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,000
Now, tell us
where they are.

129
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,291
[BULMA whimpering]

130
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,708
They're in the sea! They
sank to the very bottom!

131
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,958
[BULMA yells]

132
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,333
If you're lying,
then so will you!

133
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,166
Well, are you
coming or what?

134
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,958
As if I have
any choice!

135
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:25,416
[GOKU panting]

136
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,000
[grunting]

137
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,041
Kaio-ken!

138
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,500
Hmm!

139
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,625
[GOKU grunting]

140
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,125
There...

141
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,291
[GOKU growling]

142
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,750
Rraaugh!

143
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Ka...

144
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,625
Me...

145
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,750
Ha...

146
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,791
Me...

147
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,500
Haaaaaa!

148
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,083
[GOKU screams]

149
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,166
[GOKU grunting]

150
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,083
Wow, I'm
still here...

151
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,750
Well, I guess
that's a good sign

152
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
that I'm making progress
with my training.

153
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,541
[BULMA] Ugh!

154
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,125
[BULMA whimpers]

155
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,041
[BLUEBERRY]
Oh, no you don't.

156
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,583
[BULMA] Hey, what do
you think you're doing?!

157
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,250
You can't treat
a lady like this!

158
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,458
You're ruining
my outfit!

159
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,083
We're gonna take
a little swim

160
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,625
and see if we can't find
those Dragon Balls.

161
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,375
A little swim?
Weren't you listening?

162
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,291
I told you, they're at the
very bottom of the sea!

163
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,708
Yeah, so you said.

164
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,666
[BULMA] Well, I hate
to spoil your plans,

165
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,583
but here's a
news flash:

166
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,541
I have a hard time
breathing underwater!

167
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,583
Not to mention, I'm not
wearing waterproof mascara!

168
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,000
Hmm?

169
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,291
[BULMA laughs]

170
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,750
Oh, yeah...

171
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Ugh. Now what
am I gonna do?

172
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,541
Once they find out there
aren't any Dragon Balls here,

173
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll never see
dry land again!

174
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,541
[BULMA screams]

175
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,708
[BULMA] All right,
all right!

176
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,875
I'm going, already!
Knock it off!

177
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,875
Oh, come on. Just think,
Bulma! Think!

178
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,916
There's gotta be some
way to outsmart these guys.

179
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,083
Where are they?!

180
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,916
[BULMA chuckles nervously]

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,416
N-Now I remember!

182
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,458
They're just a little
further! Over here! Come on!

183
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,833
[thinking] This
is the place...

184
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,083
I just hope they're both
stupid enough to fall for it!

185
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,250
[BULMA] Right this way to the
Dragon Balls, gentlemen!

186
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,208
Right down
the middle!

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,125
[BULMA] No, please,
after you...

188
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,875
Ah! Hey! What
are you doing?!

189
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,125
[BULMA screams]

190
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:57,291
[BULMA] So this is it.
The place I'm gonna die.

191
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,291
[BULMA] Wait a minute!
Let's not do anything rash!

192
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,208
We're almost there!
As a matter of fact,

193
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,958
it's just inside that cave
there... Yeah, the cave!

194
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,583
[BULMA]
Ah! What the...?

195
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,708
[BLUEBERRY] Huh...?

196
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,250
[BULMA] Ha, ha! See?
Just like I said!

197
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,416
Dragon Balls!
Hundreds of Dragon Balls!

198
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,416
[BULMA] Well, what the
heck are you waiting for?

199
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,875
An invitation!? GO!!

200
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,041
C'mon boys, take as
many as you like!

201
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,458
Then you can
make your wish!

202
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:14,333
[BLUEBERRY grunting]

203
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:22,333
[BOTH grunting]

204
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,875
[BULMA gasps]

205
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,750
Nice...

206
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,208
[grunting continues]

207
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,666
[BOTH] Huh?

208
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,625
[BULMA giggles]

209
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,583
[BLUEBERRY screaming]

210
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,666
[RASPBERRY] She's getting away!

211
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,791
[BOTH scream]

212
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,791
All right, Mrs. Crab,
do your stuff!

213
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,458
[RASPBERRY yells]

214
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,375
[BULMA whimpering]

215
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,500
[BULMA sighs]

216
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,916
[panting]

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,083
[BULMA screams]

218
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,083
[BLUEBERRY &amp; RASPBERRY growling]

219
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,125
[BULMA screams]

220
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,833
Oh, I don't believe
this! I just can't win!

221
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,833
[BULMA gasps]

222
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:08,416
[BOTH grunting]

223
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,833
[BULMA screams]

224
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,208
Oh, man... I almost wish
I'd never heard of these

225
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,125
stupid Dragon Balls!

226
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,125
Huh?

227
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,166
[BULMA] Noo!

228
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,916
[BULMA] Krillin? Gohan?
Please hurry...

229
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,958
[BULMA wails]

230
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,958
[GOHAN] Krillin, we've
been flying for days now...

231
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,750
How much
farther is it?

232
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,833
Well, I don't
know exactly...

233
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,708
But I'd say we still
have a ways to go yet.

234
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,375
[GOHAN whines]

235
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,875
[KRILLIN] All right.

236
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,416
I guess we can risk
picking up the pace a bit.

237
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
We should be far enough
away from Vegeta now

238
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,000
that he won't be
able to sense us.

239
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,208
Yeah, and not
only that,

240
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,083
my dad should be getting
here any minute now!

241
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,583
He'll need
our help!

242
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,333
Well, when you put it that way,
we've got no time to lose!

243
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,416
Right!

244
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,875
[KRILLIN] Let's go!

245
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,958
The good news is,
at top speed,

246
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,833
we'll probably be
there in an hour or two.

247
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,041
[GOHAN chuckles]

248
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,500
Yeah!

249
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,166
[VEGETA] Hmm?!

250
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,083
[VEGETA] Ah! I've
found them at last!

251
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,375
Interesting...
Those meddling earth fools

252
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,958
are halfway across
the planet.

253
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,583
I was sure they'd
make an attempt

254
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,416
to steal my
Dragon Balls.

255
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,333
But it seems they've got
something else in mind...

256
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,708
Whatever they're up to,
if I lose them now,

257
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,916
I may not get another
chance to make them tell me

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,541
where they've hidden the
final Dragon Ball.

259
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,541
And if I take this
one with me,

260
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,458
even if their woman friend
manages to find this place

261
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,416
with their tracking device,
they won't get all seven.

262
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,166
They'll get no
mercy from me!

263
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,958
This time
they're dead!

264
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,333
[SUBORDINATE]
Lord Frieza!

265
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,416
We've just received a report
from the Ginyu Force!

266
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,833
They are currently passing
through Sector 9-0-3-4 XY.

267
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,291
We can expect their arrival
on the planet within the hour!

268
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,958
[FRIEZA]
Excellent...

269
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,916
And considering the
fact that Vegeta

270
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,958
has been keeping his
pointy little head down

271
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,416
for the last
few days,

272
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,916
I think it's
safe to assume

273
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,750
that he still hasn't
managed to collect

274
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,000
all seven of
my Dragon Balls.

275
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,208
Too bad for him.

276
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,375
Because now that the
Ginyu Force is arriving

277
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,333
with their scouters,
there won't be anywhere

278
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,666
on this miserable planet
left for him to hide.

279
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,625
[NARRATOR] With the
fearsome Ginyu Force

280
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,500
only moments away
from Planet Namek,

281
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,583
it seems Frieza is but
one small step away

282
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,750
from achieving his
ultimate goal!

283
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,458
But if Gohan and Krillin
can somehow elude Vegeta

284
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,208
long enough to reach Guru,
the Eldest Namek,

285
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,041
a sliver of hope
may still remain!

286
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:55,458
It's do or die!
Next Dragon Ball Z!
