1
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,250
[GOKU] Now's your chance!

2
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] It was a moment
that shook the earth...

3
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,583
When a brave young boy
stepped into his father's shoes,

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,166
and put an end to the evil
creation known as Cell.

5
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:30,083
[CELL yells]

6
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,416
[NARRATOR]
That was several years ago.

7
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,625
[NARRATOR] Thanks to
the sacrifice of a hero

8
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,416
named Goku, and the
great courage of his son,

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,875
the Earth's future
has been redirected,

10
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,291
and its people have a new
chance at keeping the peace.

11
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,375
[NARRATOR] And in many ways,

12
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
that chance
has not been wasted.

13
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,625
These last few years
have been calm and prosperous,

14
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,583
as the entire world
was reminded

15
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,041
of how precious peace can be.

16
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,250
[NARRATOR] Of course,
it never takes long

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,666
for that lesson
to be forgotten.

18
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,916
[ROBBER 1] Let's do this!

--[FEMALE CLERK 1 shrieks]
--[ROBBER 3] Hey, sweetie!

23
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,458
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere,
a young man is flying towards

24
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,500
that same city on
a familiar golden cloud.

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,666
The boy who saved
the world has become...

26
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,416
a teenager.

27
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,375
[NARRATOR] With no more
trips across the galaxy

28
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,250
or lethal androids to fight,
Gohan has at last

29
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,833
been free to do his studies
like his mother wanted.

30
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,916
And since his mountain village
was far from any schools,

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,166
he did his education at home,
under ChiChi's careful eye.

32
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,250
But now, Gohan has decided

33
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,708
to enroll in high school
with other students,

34
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,750
ready to try his luck
at normal life.

35
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,708
Here we go!
I guess this is Satan City.

36
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,375
Hey, thanks
for the lift, Nimbus!

37
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,875
I'll catch you
after class, okay?

38
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,916
[GOHAN thinking]
Dad, you've got to see this.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,125
I know you'd
have a good laugh.

40
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,875
The whole world thinks Hercule
was the one who beat Cell.

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,166
And now they've even
named a city after him!

42
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,291
[GOHAN chuckles]
Probably for the best.

43
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,250
"Goku-And-Gohan Town" would
sound kind of silly. Heh.

44
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,000
[NARRATOR] Hurry, Gohan.
You'd hate to be late to class!

45
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,000
[whimpering]

46
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,958
That's right! Nobody be a hero!

47
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,833
Stay down!

48
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,083
[ROBBER 5] Let's get moving!

[ROBBER 1]
You heard him, lady! Hurry up!

50
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,291
Done! All the bags are filled!

51
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,583
Fine! Let's roll!

52
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,708
And now I'd like to thank you
all for your cooperation!

00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Ah, look at the time.

55
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,750
At this rate,
I'll never make it.

56
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,458
[GOHAN] Turbo speed!

00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,125

Aw... Another batch of crooks.

It never ends!

00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,625
I guess if I transform
then no one will recognize me!

[GOHAN grunts]

67
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,083

you pigs can do?!

Amazing!

83
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,666
Ehhh! Oh dear.

84
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
But where'd he go?

[BYSTANDERS murmur]

86
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,375

You!

Tell me who did this!

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,833
It hardly looks
like police work!

00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,666
[GOHAN] Oh...
I-I guess I wasn't looking...

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,875
I can't believe I missed it!

93
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,333
I should've stopped them!

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
[OLD MAN] Oh... Hey, Videl!

95
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,625
I was wondering
when you'd show up!

96
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,375
Wasn't that
Golden Fighter incredible?

97
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,333
A golden fighter? Explain.

98
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,791
You mean you really
didn't see him?

99
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,916
He was some kind of
freakish superhuman!

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,375
Wuuuh--I saw him knock down
a truck by yelling at it!

101
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,083
Actually I assumed
he was a buddy of yours

102
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,083
since he went to
your high school.

103
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,500
Huh?

104
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,208
Yeah, he had a badge just like
that one on his shirt.

105
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,083
All the kids at school
have to wear this thing.

106
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:12,000
Well if he really goes there...
I will find him!

Hey... Sharpner...

Don't tell me
you're the Golden Fighter!

Oh spare me!

112
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,666
I don't have time
to play superhero.

113
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,083
I spent all morning
working out my arms.

114
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,583
So Videl...

115
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,625
Do you think this guy could
be stronger than your pops?!

116
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,083
What a joke!
We all know Videl's dad

117
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,708
is the strongest there is!

118
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,708
He could knock this gold boy
out by flexing his biceps!

119
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,791
He's strong.

Today we are being graced
with a new class member

who actually
knows how to read.

That's your cue, my boy.

Oh. Good morning.

126

My name's Gohan.
Nice to meet you.

Oooh! Look at him, Videl!
He's a cutie!

What kind of name is Gohan?

129
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
Huh?

130
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,250
That's weird.
He looks familiar...

[SHARPNER chuckles]

132
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,458
He was probably
on a TV spelling bee.

133
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,916
[MALE TEACHER]
Gohan here made perfect scores

learn from his example.

wherever you'd like to sit.

who Videl's pop is?

of Mr. Satan!

of a daughter of a celebrity

is pretty good too, you know!

Where are you from?
You're out of the gossip loop!

like a teenage boy

glowing golden hair!

00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,625
[VIDEL] Hmph!

180
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,458
[GOHAN thinking] Does she know?!

181
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,333
Now, let's see
if you can find

182
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,333
the unessential clause
in this sentence.

183
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,250
"On the bus I told my friend

184
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,375
who knew me well
a very important secret."

185
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,791
--[FEMALE TEACHER] Well...
--[VIDEL] Gohan!

186
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,833
Huh?

187
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,416
I remembered something.

188
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,541
What the Gold Fighter
was said to be wearing...

189
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,166
It was a white shirt,
a black vest,

190
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,041
and red pants.
Sound familiar?

191
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,041
Uh...

192
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,833
[ERASA] Hey, that's funny!

193
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,250
You and the
Gold Fighter dress alike!

194
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,833
Uh, yeah. Funny...

195
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,208
[FEMALE TEACHER] You three
in the back! Pay attention!

196
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,541
Yes. Yes ma'am.

197
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,875
Good... Now then...

198
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,833
The essential clause
"that" is...

199
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,291
[SHARPNER laughs]

200
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,958
Come on, Videl.

201
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,666
You know he can't
be the Gold Fighter.

202
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,375
Who in the world's ever heard
of a little book nerd

203
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,791
secretly being a superhero?

204
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,375
The guy's gotta be buff.

205
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,083
Ignore him.

206
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,666
I bet you could
fight crime if you wanted.

207
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,708
Oh, I doubt it...

208
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,291
[VIDEL thinking]
Of course it's not him.

209
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,625
His hair's not even right.
But then again...

210
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,416
Those fighters
in the Cell Game videos

211
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,750
turned their hair gold, too.

212
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,791
Although Dad said
it was a cheap trick.

213
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,375
[ERASA] So, uh, did you
just move into the city?

214
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,500
Maybe we could
study at your house.

215
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,291
Well... actually I commute here.

216
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
Oh, that's cool. Where from?

217
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:50,166
The... 439 Mountain Area.
See, it's... pretty small.

218
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,333
What?! Oh, get out of here!

219
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,250
The 439 Area
is like 500 miles away!

220
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,833
Hey! Excuse me, miss!

221
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,833
But I am trying to
teach a class here!

222
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,583
[ERASA gasps] I'm sorry!

223
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,375
How in the world
do you get here?!

224
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,875
That's gotta be close to
a five hour car drive!

225
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,125
Yes, well, uh...

226
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,125
That's how dedicated
I am to my education.

227
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,000
[GOHAN chuckles]

228
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,083
[GOHAN thinking] I can't
believe I just said that.

229
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,041
Now, let's move forward.

230
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,333
Creating the complex sentence.

231
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,708
Can I get a volunteer to read
this sample paragraph?

232
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,166
[GOHAN thinking] That's crazy!

233
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,416
They even talk about Hercule
in the grammar exercises.

234
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,375
Hey! Brains!

235
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,208
Volunteer and show us
how good you read!

236
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,291
[GOHAN] Huh?

237
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,708
Yeah! Do it!

238
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,458
--[ERASA giggles]
--[GOHAN yells nervously]

239
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,583
[FEMALE TEACHER]
Excellent! A volunteer!

240
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,708
Now, I haven't quite
learned your name yet.

241
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:58,250
This is Gohan,
the perfect test-score boy.

242
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,791
Oh, that's right.

243
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,916
Well, Gohan, now go ahead.

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,125
Yes, ma'am...

245
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,875
Now what am I...
doing exactly? Heh heh.

246
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,916
[SHARPNER chuckles]

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,125
You're reading the paragraph!

248
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,458
Oh right!

249
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,125
"Mr. Satan went to
the city that was then called

250
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,250
Orange Star City
and started a happy family.

251
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,833
After he beat Cell,
who was very evil,

252
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,458
the city changed its name.

253
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,250
Even though
the world is now safe,

254
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,541
Mr. Satan keeps
his fitness routine,

255
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,208
which includes running laps
and breaking heavy rocks."

256
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,666
[MR. SATAN sneezes]

257
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,875
You guys need to
work a little harder!

258
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,791
Being the greatest fighter in
the world isn't easy you know!

259
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,208
[MR. SATAN laughs]

260
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,458
[birds chirping]

261
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,833
All right, boys and girls.

262
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,583
Today, we'll be battling it out
in the great sport of baseball.

263
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,291
Brains...
You know what baseball is?

264
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,833
Uh, yeah. Well, I've read
a couple books about it.

265
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,958
Oh, have you? [chuckles]

266
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:05,083
Well then, I'm sure you'll be
the next all-star on your team!

267
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,875
Hey, you can have him.

268
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,458
My team just filled up!

269
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,500
Oh yeah, thanks.

270
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,166
Come on!
Give him a break.

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,583
I bet he could
think of a bunch of

272
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,750
really great strategies since
he's such a smarty!

273
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,541
Okay. Fine...

274
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,375
I'm putting you
in right field.

275
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,625
Do you know where that is?

276
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,250
Yeah! On the right! Right?

277
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,000
Right...
Just get on to the field.

278
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,250
[CHICHI] It sure is quiet
around here without Gohan.

279
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,833
I should've gone with him.

280
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,375
I'm so nervous.

281
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,833
I sure hope those
teenagers treat him right!

282
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,375
[metal clangs]

283
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,666
[GOHAN thinking] Mom told me
not to show off my real power,

284
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,625
and I'm really trying not to.

285
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,375
But why should I hide it?

286
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,541
This whole "fitting in"
thing is really weird.

287
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,375
[SHARPNER clears throat]

288
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,083
Hmph! Hope you're
ready for a strike!

289
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,208
[SHARPNER chuckles]

290
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,791
[VIDEL grunts]

291
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,291
[SHARPNER grunts]

292
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,708
Aah!

293
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,875
[cheering]
[BOY] What a hit!

294
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,458
[ALL gasp]

295
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,500
[GOHAN thinking] The runner
on third's left the base.

296
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,583
That means if I throw it
to third, he'll be out!

297
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,166
Okay...

298
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,208
Nice and slow. Not too hard.

299
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,666
[GOHAN grunts]

300
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,500
Aaah...

301
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:51,958
[grunts, groans]

302
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,125
Like, third and out.

303
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,666
All right!

304
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,500
I think I'm really getting
the hang of this game!

305
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,958
Uh?

306
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,250
[VIDEL gasps]

307
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,791
[GOHAN thinking] Oops...
I guess that was a little much.

308
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,750
[COACH]
That move was beautiful, Gohan!

309
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,125
You must have jumped
twenty-five feet into the air!

310
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,250
Way to go, son!

311
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,000
[GOHAN]
Oh, it was beginner's luck.

312
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,000
I-I just got some...
new shoes. Yeah!

313
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,500
With the air cushions, y'know!

314
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
They sure make
a difference, huh?

315
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,000
Right. It's gotta be the shoes.

316
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,583
Hey, man, I think it's
your turn to bat, isn't it?

317
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,041
Huh? Oh! Yeah, I'm up!

318
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,541
Hold on, guys! Here I come!

319
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,375
So, does he swing
as hard as he throws?

320
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,750
You heard him! He said
it was just beginner's luck!

321
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,666
That's the left-handed
batter's box, son...

322
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,916
[GOHAN] Is that bad?

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,541
Well, no, just...

324
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,750
most right-handers
bat from the other side.

325
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,333
Oh? How come?

326
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,291
Well... why don't you swing
there and see how it works?

327
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,458
So brain-boy thinks
he can catch my hits?

328
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,375
I'll just have to
give him a good scare.

329
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,666
[GOHAN thinking] I don't want to
show any more of my strength.

330
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,500
I better not swing.

331
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,875
[SHARPNER] I'll have you
ducking for cover like a sissy.

332
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,458
[SHARPNER chuckles]

333
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,916
[SHARPNER grunts]

334
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,500
Watch out!

335
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,500
[GOHAN grunts]

336
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
Ngh!

337
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,750
Aah! You idiot!

338
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,333
Why didn't you
duck like a sissy?!

339
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,875
[CATCHER 4 whimpers]

340
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,458
Coach... if I get hit,
that means that I walk, right?

341
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,041
--[COACH] Right.
--[GOHAN chuckles]

342
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,333
[GOHAN thinking]
That worked perfectly!

343
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,000
I got to base and didn't have
to show my strength! Heh heh.

344
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,000
What... the heck... is he?!

345
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,750
Bizarre...

346
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:09,208
[school bell chimes]

347
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,500
Gohan. What clubs
have you joined?

348
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,083
I haven't... joined any...

349
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,291
Good. You can
join the boxing club.

350
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,708
With a little practice, you just
might become a good fighter.

351
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,333
Thanks. But I don't think
I can join any clubs...

352
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
'cause...

353
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,125
'Cause he's got an extra,
extra long drive home

354
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,500
and doesn't have any time
to spend on clubs, right, Gohan?

355
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Yeah, that's it!

356
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,250
[ERASA] Now Gohan...

357
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,291
what's say you give me
a ride home on your way out?

358
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,625
Oh well, uh--
I'm afraid that my ride

359
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,666
is just a one-seater!

360
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,583
I've got room
in my car, Erasa.

361
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,250
Sounds like a plan to me!

362
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,666
Now this is strange.

363
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
He says he lives very far away

364
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,750
but now he seems
to be walking home.

365
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,041
[GOHAN] Hmm?

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,541
[VIDEL panting]

367
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,416
Huh?

368
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,000
[GOHAN] Whew!

369
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,458
So many close calls!

370
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,583
I need a way
to use my powers...

371
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,541
without letting all of
my classmates know...

372
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,416
[GOHAN] Hmm...
Maybe Bulma can help...

373
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,583
[NARRATOR] So Gohan's first day
of class comes to an end.

374
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:55,083
But it seems the real
excitement is just starting up.
