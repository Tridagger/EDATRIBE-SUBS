1
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,000
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,125
Krillin met with
a terrible fate,

3
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,875
much to the horror
of his companions.

4
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,958
[NARRATOR] Krillin was
then flung mercilessly

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,208
below to a watery grave
by the evil, super-giant.

6
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

7
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,250
[NARRATOR] While Gohan
was left alone

8
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,916
to defend his friend's honor,

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,791
Dende recovered Krillin
from the depths of the sea.

10
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,250
Kid, no! Move! Look out!

11
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,916
[NARRATOR] The young Gohan
made an incredible stand

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,458
against Frieza, but his valiant
efforts would eventually crumble

13
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,208
under the weight of
Frieza's enormous power.

14
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
Bye-bye... Brat!

15
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,625
[GOHAN screams]

16
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,916
[NARRATOR] Is there
any hope left

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,625
for the courageous,
little warrior

18
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,791
when even Vegeta seems too
scared to lend a hand?

19
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,458
[NARRATOR] Find out today!

20
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,583
[GOHAN groans]

21
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:39,875
[FRIEZA chuckles]

22
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,625
[skull crackling]

23
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,625
[GOHAN screams]

24
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,541
Poor boy! Vegeta, how can
you be so cold-hearted?

25
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,083
Can't you see that
the boy is in pain?

26
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,166
I guess you're just too
petrified to help him,

27
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,166
aren't you?

28
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,916
[FRIEZA laughs]

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,500
What a shame. He was
such a brave little kid.

30
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,500
Too bad! It's hard to find
good friends in this world.

31
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,166
[FRIEZA chuckles]

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,666
[GOHAN groans]

33
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,541
[VEGETA] Even if I managed
get Frieza off of him,

34
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,458
the kid's still finished.

35
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,791
It'd be better if he was
just put out of his misery.

36
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,208
[GOHAN groans]

37
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,083
[FRIEZA] There, there.
It will all be over soon.

38
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,625
[GOKU thinking] Uh-oh!

39
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,000
Somebody's energy signal
is disappearing!

40
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,083
Whoever it is
is in deep trouble!

41
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,458
What? It's Gohan! I need
to get out of this thing!

42
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,583
[GOKU thinking] It's no use!

43
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,125
I've got to stay
here a little longer

44
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,041
or I won't be able
to help him anyway!

45
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,375
[GOKU thinking]
Hang in there, son!

46
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,833
Please!

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,916
Uh-oh! Gohan's energy
signal is fading!

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,458
I'm not gonna let it happen!

49
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,041
We've been through
too much together...

50
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,625
[PICCOLO] You were just a
pampered kid when I took you in.

51
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,291
But you never gave up.

52
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,041
You never failed to
surprise me either.

53
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,041
[PICCOLO] Maybe I shouldn't
have been so hard on you...

54
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,625
But you took it
without complaint...

55
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:59,250
And I could tell that despite
the hardship I put you through,

56
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,166
you truly cared about me...

57
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,000
So I died for you.

58
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,500
[PICCOLO] And I'd do
it all over again.

59
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,375
Gohan, it feels good
knowing that I've helped

60
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,125
my only true friend...

61
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,166
[GOHAN] No, Piccolo! No!

62
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,958
I'm almost there!
Don't you let go!

63
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,000
[GOHAN groans]

64
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,375
[VEGETA chuckles]

65
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,958
Why can't I stomach this?

66
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,416
I've seen much worse than
this without blinking an eye.

67
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,958
[GOKU thinking]
Okay, this is it!

68
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,166
Healed or not, I've got
to try to help Gohan!

69
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:07,458
[GOKU grunts]

70
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,541
[FRIEZA chuckles]

71
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,041
Sayonara, kid!

72
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,000
[VOICE] Destructo Disk!

73
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,458
Huh?!

74
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,125
[FRIEZA yells]

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,250
What? It's that guy?!
But how? He was shish-kabob!

76
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
These Earth-scum tricksters!

77
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,666
They're just like weeds!
You have to get 'em by the root!

78
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,583
Argh, you wouldn't dare!

79
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,458
Destructo Disk!

80
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,750
[GOKU thinking]
Krillin's back!

81
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,583
And he's just as strong
as ever! But how?

82
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,458
[KRILLIN] Hey, Frieza!

83
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,791
What? Rrrrgh!

84
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,416
I dare ya! Try it one more time!

85
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,875
Here! Here's your target, baby!

86
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:37,541
Damn you! Fool!
You're a dead man!

87
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,250
[KRILLIN] I've got to keep
him away from Gohan

88
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,666
for a little while.

89
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,250
And, somehow, I've got to
stay alive while doing it.

90
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,125
[KRILLIN] C'mon, you can
do it! Stay focused!

91
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,041
Don't lose your cool!
Don't even look back!

92
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,625
[FRIEZA] You're a dead man!

93
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,125
Oh, man!

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,250
[KRILLIN] I shouldn't
have looked!

95
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,708
Huh?

96
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,041
[KRILLIN] This might
buy me a little time...

97
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,166
[KRILLIN screams]

98
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,708
What fun! I love Cat and Mouse!

99
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,958
This one's even small
enough to eat, yum!

100
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,125
[KRILLIN gasps]

101
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,291
[KRILLIN screams]

102
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,833
[KRILLIN screams]

103
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,458
[KRILLIN screams]

104
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,291
[various screaming and shouting]

105
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,833
Man!

106
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,916
Fool! You can't hide!

107
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:45,375
[FRIEZA] Ha, ha, ha! That should
do it! I'll smoke him out!

108
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,250
[KRILLIN coughs]

109
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,958
[FRIEZA laughs]

110
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,375
[FRIEZA] Hello, there. You've
been quite the trouble-maker,

111
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,875
haven't you?

112
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,666
Well I do have a sense of humor,
and it was all in good fun

113
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,250
except for one minor detail.

114
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,916
You cut off my tail and now
I'm going to eat you for dinner!

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,666
This guy's nuts! Well...
Here goes nothing.

116
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
Haaah!

117
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,666
Ah, just what I needed! A little
fishing to relax my nerves!

118
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,000
I left my fishing rod at home.

119
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,625
So I guess I'll have
to blast him out.

120
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,041
[FRIEZA] Well, here it goes!

121
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,958
Mmm?

122
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,750
[FRIEZA] Enough of this!
I'm wasting my time!

123
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,958
[FRIEZA] There are much
bigger fish in the sea!

124
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,000
Hyaah!

125
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,541
Solar Flare!

126
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,666
[FRIEZA grunts]

127
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,083
Solar Flare!

128
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,833
[FRIEZA groans]

129
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,375
[FRIEZA groans]

130
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,416
You'll pay!

131
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,000
[DENDE] Gohan, it's me, Dende.

132
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,583
Stay calm! You're gonna be fine!

133
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,708
Dende...

134
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,875
Those damn Earthlings!
They're going to pay for this!

135
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,791
Comin' through!
Look out, everyone!

136
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,166
Huh...?

137
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,625
[VEGETA gasps]

138
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
So that's how they did it!

139
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Hey, man, are you deaf
or something? Huh? Huh?

140
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,333
Hey, right on!
Mission accomplished!

141
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,833
You mind telling me why in
the heck you fools decided

142
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,875
to keep that kid's
power a secret from me?!

143
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,458
What d'you mean? We didn't
know he could heal people!

144
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,500
If we had known that,
don't you think we would have

145
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,125
had him heal Goku?!

146
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,958
[GOHAN laughs]

147
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,500
[DENDE] Alright, Gohan!

148
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,250
[DENDE giggles]

149
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:31,083
Gosh, Dende, you're super!
This is so cool! I feel great!

150
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,416
[DENDE] No problem!

151
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,875
[FRIEZA] Huhhh...?

152
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,250
Oh, great! Look who's back?

153
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,291
What? Him too?!

154
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:50,208
[GOHAN growls]

155
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,083
[VEGETA chuckles]

156
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,000
The kid's a true
Saiyan, all right.

157
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,583
His power level increases
after every battle.

158
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,375
His rage is red hot.

159
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,500
[GOHAN growls]

160
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,958
Right!

161
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
Oh, ho, ho, lookit him,
he's flustered.

162
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,541
I think we might just actually
have a chance to beat him

163
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,125
if we attack together!

164
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,875
What's wrong? I clobber
them and then...

165
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,708
Maybe they did wish
for immortality!

166
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,666
Let's hit 'im, boys!

167
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,916
[shouting]

168
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,041
[FRIEZA yells]

169
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,166
Is that the best you can do?

170
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,583
You're pathetic!
Really. Is that it?

171
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,666
I think you better come up with
a new game plan, pretty soon.

172
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,541
Ah... What now?

173
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,791
I don't know!

174
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,333
[GOHAN growls]

175
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:22,083
There's nothing to do! He's
much stronger! But who cares?!

176
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,541
Sometimes you've got
to attack head on!

177
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,208
Hey! Wait!

178
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,791
[VEGETA] No, don't!
It's suicide!

179
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,666
[FRIEZA chuckles]

180
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,000
Hmm?

181
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,458
Huh?!

182
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
It's Piccolo!

183
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,250
Am I dreaming?
Is it really you?

184
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,125
Good to see you, Gohan.

185
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,625
[GOHAN laughs]

186
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:11,208
So it worked! The Dragon came
through for us after all!

187
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,666
This is incredible!

188
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,375
So that's him? Frieza?

189
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
[GOHAN] Yeah,
that's him alright.

190
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:35,791
I see. King Kai thinks he's
unbeatable. We'll find out.

191
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,250
You're right. We will.
But who are you?

192
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,416
Just another weak Namekian?

193
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,083
Wait, I recognize you.

194
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,958
You're the one we destroyed
so easily on Earth.

195
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,291
I can't believe these
fools wasted their wishes

196
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,375
bringing you back to life.

197
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,000
Do me a favor. Just keep
your big mouth shut.

198
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,958
Then, after we beat Frieza,

199
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,958
it'll be you and
me, head to head.

200
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,500
Yeah, like that's
actually going to happen.

201
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,083
[VEGETA laughs]

202
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,166
I guess some people just aren't
satisfied with dying only once,

203
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,625
are they?

204
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,625
[KRILLIN] Man, I hope Piccolo
knows what he's doing...

205
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,916
I can tell that he's a
lot stronger than before,

206
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,166
but I'm not sure if he really
knows what he's up against here.

207
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:28,916
I suggest you go about
your business, Namekian.

208
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,250
As of yet, I haven't decided
to kill you, but I'm real close.

209
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,083
Now go before it's too late.

210
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,125
Please, it would ease my
conscience knowing

211
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,333
that I spared one of you.

212
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,458
[GOKU thinking] Someone
else has arrived, but who?

213
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,541
Is it... Piccolo?

214
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,083
No, it can't be!

215
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:02,375
Whoever it is is much
stronger than Piccolo.

216
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,500
Gohan seems to be
completely fine now.

217
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,500
That's a mystery in itself...

218
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,125
What in the world is
going on out there?

219
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,416
None of it makes any sense!

220
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,875
Enough! Come on, I'd like to
do this while I'm still young!

221
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,250
Alright, guys! Just stay out
of this if you don't mind!

222
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,416
Huh?!

223
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,083
They didn't say that
Piccolo was a Namek!

224
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,458
Oh, wow, this is incredible!

225
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,250
[PICCOLO] I think
it would be best

226
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,791
if you took cover
somewhere, Dende.

227
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,416
What...?

228
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,833
Do it!

229
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,000
O-oh! U-uh right!

230
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,333
Whoa! How does he know who I am?

231
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,875
[GOHAN] Man, guys, I don't
like this. Piccolo!

232
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,750
No way! I know he's strong

233
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,708
but I'm just not sure he can
really do it all by himself!

234
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Look at him. He's
determined to win or die!

235
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,166
This'll be a great show! I guess
I'll just kick back and watch!

236
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,875
[GOKU thinking] Uh-oh...

237
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,416
Everybody's just standing
still out there!

238
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,916
I don't like it!

239
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,416
Something major is
about to go down!

240
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,875
[NARRATOR] With the
help of the Dragon,

241
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,666
Piccolo has crossed
over dimensions

242
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,583
and through time and space to
arrive at the battlefield.

243
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:45,625
But is the mighty Namek biting
off more than he can chew?

244
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,583
Perhaps his
challenge will buy Goku

245
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,500
the precious time that he
needs to regain his strength.

246
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,791
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
