1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm getting a terrible feeling.

3
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,458
[NARRATOR] The Supreme Kai's
fears were realized

4
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,458
when the seal around
Majin Buu was broken,

5
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,333
and the doomsday
creature from the past

6
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,750
materialized into life
from a strange cloud of smoke.

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,125
Buuuuuuuuuu!!!!!

8
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,833
[NARRATOR]
To Gohan, Buu seemed harmless

9
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,000
with his childlike behavior,
but the Supreme Kai knew better,

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,541
and any doubts about Buu's
powers were soon squashed...

11
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,791
Aaaaah!

12
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,166
[NARRATOR] ...when he
attacked the taunting Dabura!

13
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,666
The powerful King of
Demons had insulted Buu,

14
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,833
unimpressed by this new arrival.

15
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,375
And with the greatest of ease,

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,625
Buu gave Dabura a one-way ticket
into a distant cliff wall.

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,625
Oh! Did you see the
way he bounced?! Ha!

18
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,583
[NARRATOR] Rather than be upset
about losing his right-hand man,

19
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,083
Babidi was ecstatic!

20
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,875
To this creature
without loyalties,

21
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,500
it was merely a
changing of the guard.

22
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,583
[NARRATOR] With Majin Buu's
terrible strength confirmed,

23
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,041
Gohan and the Supreme Kai
made a desperate escape.

24
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,708
For they had become
Buu's next target.

25
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,208
The chase began,

26
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,833
and Gohan was confident he
would buy them time to regroup,

27
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:24,416
but Buu displayed another of
his talents, unmatchable speed!

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,750
Ah!

29
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,916
[NARRATOR] And with one
mighty hit, Gohan was out.

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,375
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile...

31
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,708
It seemed Goku had convinced
Vegeta to postpone their fight

32
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,541
and stop Majin Buu,

33
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,916
[NARRATOR] But the Saiyan
Prince preyed once again

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
on Goku's trust.

35
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,916
Vowing to destroy
Buu without any help,

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,916
he has knocked Goku unconscious,
and taken the last Senzu Bean.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,458
But the immediate concern is
this: The Supreme Kai is alone,

38
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,750
and must face his greatest fear!

39
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,666
Ah... Ah...

40
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,541
[snickers]

41
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,625
Yes, now torture him Majin Buu!

42
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,333
Make that purple
rat scared like a baby!

43
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,708
[GOHAN grunts]

44
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,875
[thinking]
Gohan...

45
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,916
Haha. Haha. Buuu!

46
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:04,875
Huh?

47
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,500
[BUU giggles]

48
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,708
[SUPREME KAI]
Do you remember me Buu?

49
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Hyaaaaaahh!

50
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,041
Haahhh...

51
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,500
[snickers]

52
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,166
[BUU]
Down! Down!

53
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,875
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

54
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,458
Huh?

55
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,375
It's no use!

56
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,541
Aaaaaaugh!

57
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,458
He's getting butchered!

58
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,416
[laughs]

59
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,958
Oh Buu, you are a beauty!
[cackles]

60
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,791
Yes! Yes!

61
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,833
[GOHAN]
Aaaaaah!

62
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:11,083
[GOHAN groans]

63
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,416
I'm not letting you down!

64
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,416
[BUU] You grounded drop dead!
Nya! Nya! Buu has win!

65
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,250
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! Pow! POW!!

66
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:36,416
[SUPREME KAI groans]

67
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,333
[BUU]
Hello! You back!

68
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:38,875
Huh?

69
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,958
Woo! Hoohoohoo!

70
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,458
[BUU]
I drop you down you went dead!

71
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:52,458
Now you back!
I drop you more! [laughs]

72
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,000
Buu!

73
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,000
You'll stop this!

74
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,458
[BUU]
No stop!

75
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,833
[grunts]

76
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:16,541
No stop! No stop!
No stop! No no no no!

77
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,958
Hyarrrgh!

78
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,041
[BUU]
Whoa!

79
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,625
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
Yes. That should hold him.

80
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,375
Eh heh! Hahaha! Wooo!

81
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,583
Uh...?

82
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,708
[BUU]
Haha! Me try!

83
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,208
Ah hahaha!

84
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:57,458
[screaming]
Aaaaaughh!

85
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,750
Hmmm...

86
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,833
--[screaming gets louder]

87
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,166
--Huh?
--[screaming gets louder]

88
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,916
[BABIDI]
Watch out! Not this way!!

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,166
[BABIDI]
Ow!

90
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,708
[exhales]

91
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,875
Huh?

92
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,166
Well what do we have here? Has
the rat Kai come back so soon?

93
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,125
That's funny. [snickers]

94
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,625
I thought you were running away!

95
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,541
Oh look! You seem to be
in a great amount of pain!

96
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,833
Oh, what a
terrible misfortune!

97
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,541
Buuuuu!!

98
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,791
Huh?

99
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,250
No, Buu! Watch out!

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,083
[screams]

101
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,416
What's going on here Kai?
You taking a nap on the job?

102
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,958
I don't know how a guy like you

103
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,041
got so high up
on the food chain!

104
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,583
[BABIDI laughs]

105
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,333
He's out folks!
Can't go another inch!

106
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,083
Maybe I should be polite
and give him a mercy killing!

107
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,875
Hahahaha!

108
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,291
[distant cry]

109
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,375
Huh?

110
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,708
It's me, Supreme Kai.
Let's get out of here.

111
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,208
Darn it! Mocking him
was just getting fun!

112
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
[gasps]

113
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,875
Hohohoho!

114
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,166
[GOHAN thinking]
What is this thing?!

115
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,791
His skin just absorbs
everything I give him!

116
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,500
You a big pest! You leave!

117
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,583
Watch out for his blast!

118
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:11,083
[screams]

119
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,791
[SUPREME KAI]
He'll.. die...

120
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,291
[cackles]

121
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,708
And that's the end of you!

122
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,375
You're headed
straight into outer space!

123
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,583
[SUPREME KAI thinking] Stay
down, Gohan they won't find you.

124
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,125
Hey, you didn't do
something tricky now, did you?

125
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,500
[SUPREME KAI thinking] You
have to keep on living, Gohan...

126
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:03,166
You could be our best hope.

127
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,666
[MR. SATAN thinking]
All right all right,

128
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,916
so, uh, the guys from
the Cell Games are back.

129
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,708
Well, a couple of them, and...

130
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,375
But where did all those
other weirdos come from, and...?

131
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,625
And why was my Videl acting so
chummy with that pretty boy one?

132
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,083
And he had the nerve
to go off and start flying,

133
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,000
which means he
must've been a trickster,

134
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,041
or some kind of evil alien!

135
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,375
And Videl is
absolutely not allowed

136
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,958
to go out with evil alien boys!

137
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,250
No way!!

138
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,166
Ah, huh? Huh?!

139
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,083
Oh, hold on a second!
Something doesn't add up here!

140
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,750
Huh? If only tricksters
and aliens can fly,

141
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,291
then how was my daughter
up in the air with them?

142
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,666
Hey! Now I understand it!

143
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,916
Human beings must've been
capable of flying all along!

144
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,791
Obviously it's just a matter of
sufficient upper body strength!

145
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,166
So of course the world
champion can do it no sweat!

146
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,541
[MR. SATAN]
All right! Here I go!

147
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,250
[MR. SATAN] Well, uh,
it's kind of cold out there.

148
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,541
[clears throat]

149
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,333
[chuckles]

150
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,708
Those know-nothing
losers think they're so cool,

151
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,666
but it probably took
them a couple decades

152
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,083
just to build up the
arm muscles it takes to fly!

153
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,166
Too bad they're not here
to watch me learn in one day!

154
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
Hyaaaaahh!

155
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,250
Uhhhff...

156
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,958
[grunts]

157
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,791
I must have just slipped. Yeah.

158
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,875
Doh...!

159
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,750
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

160
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,125
Oh... Uh, hi... I'm the second
vice president of your fan club.

161
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,958
We said we'd come by.

162
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,083
Oh yeah of course,
just come on in!

163
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:34,000
I was perfecting my world-famous
carpet-diving attack technique!

164
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,333
Yeah... Carpet...
Heh heh... Yeah...

165
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:44,541
[chuckles]

166
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,500
What a wonderful day this is!

167
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,083
Though I fully plan
to rip you into pieces.

168
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:53,166
Let me first say thank you.
After all, if it weren't for all

169
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
the incredibly strong
fighters you brought me

170
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,833
I wouldn't have been able to
bring Majin Buu back to life!

171
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,583
[BABIDI laughs]

172
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,958
Normally I'd let my one of
my slaves do the dirty work...

173
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,791
But to show you my appreciation
I think I'll kill you myself!

174
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,708
See what a marvelous
circle this is?

175
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,708
You killed my father
and now I kill you!

176
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:13,875
[groans]

177
