00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,708
Cell continued his
quest for Android 18.

3
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,541
Hoping to flush her out
from hiding, the vile android

4
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,125
launched a series of blind
attacks on the islands below,

5
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:29,708
raining down terror on hundreds
of unsuspecting civilians.

6
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,333
He's a monster on a
mission who won't stop

7
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:36,708
until he gets what he's after.
And now he's after Android 18.

8
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,541
Because once he absorbs her,
Cell will reach his final stage

9
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,958
and become a
pure entity of evil.

10
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,041
[NARRATOR] And back at Kami's
Place,

11
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,166
Vegeta and Trunks completed
their intensive training.

12
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,833
Eager to demonstrate
his new-found abilities,

13
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,708
Vegeta took off to face
Cell on his own.

14
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,625
Trunks followed close behind,

15
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,833
ready at any moment
to back up his father.

16
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,791
Oh good! The fireworks
have already started!

17
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,000
[NARRATOR] While Vegeta prepared
for his confrontation with Cell,

18
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,916
Goku and Gohan
crossed the threshold

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,416
into the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber.

20
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,375
If they can endure it, they
will get a year of training

21
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,208
in a single day and become
stronger than ever before.

22
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,041
But is taking a day away
from the pursuit of Cell

23
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,750
a wise decision?

You said he wasn't
going to destroy them!

31

[SQUIRRELS squeak]

33
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,958
Cell will find us
if we stay here.

We've got to get away!

35
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,750
[ANDROID 18] Ugh... But
you're in no shape to travel.

36
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,208
But he'll see us for
sure if we try to leave now.

37
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,750
Maybe your friends can help us.

Where are they?

All this time,
I've wasted looking.

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,000
I should have been
complete by now.

43
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,291
I will find her.

This must be Cell's handiwork.

I don't know what Kakarot and

He must be even more anxious to
fight Cell than I thought!

[thinking] I can't
let him get away!

54
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,291
[BULMA] Do you think Vegeta
can handle Cell by himself?

55
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,583
I have no idea how powerful
Trunks and Vegeta have become.

56
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,416
But they've got to try
and stop him. If they can...

57
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,041
If Cell gets his way and
manages to absorb Android 18,

58
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,166

Cell wins. We lose.

00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,875
[CELL chuckles]

178
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,208
Very well.

179
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,125
I must say I am impressed
by your determination.

180
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,583
I agree with Cell.

181
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,708
Vegeta is no match for him.

182
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,791
He has no chance!

183
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,041
What are you thinking, 16?

184
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,708
Don't you think now would
be a good time to escape?

185
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,125
16, I'm talking to you!

186
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,708
Wait, stay here until
they start fighting, 18.

187
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,875
Vegeta has changed.

188
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,958
His power has grown since
the last time you fought.

189
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,166
He just may have a chance.

190
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,833
What? How?

191
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,083
How could he have
changed that much, so quickly?

192
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Was he just toying
around with me?

193
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,666
Do you really think
he might beat Cell?

194
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
Are you ready now

195
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,500
to witness a power not seen
for thousands of years?

196
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,916
[CELL chuckles]

[VEGETA yells]

199
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,750
All right.

00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:20,791
[yelling continues]

[PICCOLO gasps]

202
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,791
[PICCOLO] Can you sense
Vegeta's energy, Tien?

203
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,458
It's growing!

204
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,250
And now... we wait!

205
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,583
No, I can't wait.

206
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,708
Vegeta can't beat Cell alone.

207
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,458
[PICCOLO] Let him try.

208
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,833
He's determined to
prove himself to all of us.

209
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,541
Vegeta! It's your turn!

210
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,083
Now show us what a pure
blooded Saiyan can really do!

211
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,958
[GOKU] Don't let the vastness of
this place get to you, Gohan.

212
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,625
[GOHAN] Where does it end?
and... and where does it begin?

213
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,708
[GOKU] Gohan!

214
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,708
I don't want you to go out
there without me, okay?

215
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,291
You could get lost
and never get back.

216
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,291
Yeah, okay.

217
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,541
[GOKU] The temperature
can change fast.

218
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,375
The air gets denser
the deeper you go

219
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,083
and the gravity is
ten times that of Earth's.

220
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,833
It's not a very safe place
to be by yourself.

221
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,083
We'll be here for a year

222
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,583
so we have to make sure
we don't get separated.

223
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
Oh! Wow!

224
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,041
A year in this place?

225
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,541
Gohan, this isn't
going to be a holiday.

226
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,125
We came here to train.

227
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,041
[GOHAN grunts]

228
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,708
[GOKU] Oh yeah!
Watch that first step.

229
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,166
It's a doozy.

230
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,708
Huh...?

231
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,375
I know this is your first time
training under this gravity.

232
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,458
It's tough! But trust me,
you'll get used to it.

233
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,208
Listen, Son, you are going
to become a Super Saiyan.

234
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,750
[GOHAN] Me a Super Saiyan?

235
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes!

236
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,583
Wow! Really? You mean,
you think I really can?

237
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,916
[GOKU] In time!

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,791
But you have to take this
training very seriously.

239
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,041
Of course, we'll take
it one step at a time.

240
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,916
When you're ready,
you'll move to the next level.

241
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,750
But it's not going to be easy.

242
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,750
[GOHAN] I understand,
but how hard will it be?

243
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,416
[GOKU] It'll be the toughest
thing you've ever done.

244
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,875
[GOKU chuckles]

245
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,833
Hey, you're my son.

246
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,958
I know that you'll
be able to do it.

247
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,166
And don't forget,

248
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,333
you're a descendant
of the Saiyan race too.

249
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,458
I want you to do the
best that you can!

250
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,041
And no matter what, I'll always
be proud of you. Understand?

251
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,083
Sure, Dad.

252
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,250
--Good.
--[GOHAN chuckles]

253
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,500
[GOKU] Then we're gonna try
to reach a power level

254
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,333
higher than Super Saiyan.

255
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:18,375
That is the only thing that
matters to us in this place.

256
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,916
Gohan, I want you to train hard
and become stronger than me.

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,208
Wha--?! What?
Me stronger than you?!

258
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,250
[GOKU] That's right!

259
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,208
That's what I want to see.

260
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,458
And I think we can
do it together.

261
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,833
[GOHAN] I hope you're right.

262
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,333
But Dad? Trunks said
that I eventually become

263
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,875
a Super Saiyan in the future
and the androids still get me!

264
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you think that
prediction will still come true?

265
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,833
[GOKU] That's nonsense, Gohan.

266
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,958
The future has changed a
lot since Trunks said that.

267
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,708
I was supposed to get
sick and kick the bucket.

268
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,250
But look, I'm still here
so you can't believe

269
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,875
everything Trunks has said.
Things have changed.

270
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,583
Oh yeah!

271
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,541
It's all up to us, now!

272
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,791
Okay! Let's do it!

273
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,000
Right. Gohan,
you should know

274
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,291
I'm a stricter teacher
than Piccolo!

275
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,416
Think you can handle it?

276
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,875
Yeah, sure!

this kind of power?
