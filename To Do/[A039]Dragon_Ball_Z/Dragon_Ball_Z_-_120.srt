00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,666
shocking as it seems,
it looks as though everyone's

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,333
worst nightmare has
actually become a reality.

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,958
[NARRATOR] And now the entire
gang must prepare itself

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,791
for a close encounter with
the two most terrible forces

6
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,833
of darkness that the
universe has ever known:

7
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,583
It's King Cold and Frieza.

8
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,416
But even Piccolo knows.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,791
Without Goku here,
they'd all be crazy

10
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,541
to take on these evil titans!

11
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,416
[VEGETA]
You really have no choice!

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,083
So what say
we put an end

13
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,583
to all this pathetic whimpering!

14
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,291
[FRIEZA]
Begin your search!

15
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,500
And when you find them,
show no mercy!

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,791
[NARRATOR]
But just when you thought

17
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,375
nothing could stand
in Frieza's way...

18
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,250
A mysterious young stranger
lands on the scene!

19
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,291
[BOY]
Ah, so you must be Frieza!

20
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,083
[BOY]
Ah, so you must be Frieza!

21
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,875
I've been waiting a long
time to meet you face-to-face.

22
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,791
Well, we have a guest.

23
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,958
Now I'm going to destroy you.

24
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,750
Ooh! We'd better run!

25
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,875
Isn't that right, Father?

26
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,791
[FRIEZA chuckling]

27
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,458
You don't know what
you're up against, boy!

28
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,833
[BOY] I know exactly what
I'm up against Frieza,

29
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,625
and let me tell you,
I'm not worried.

30
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:01,000
Make no mistake. I'm going
to finish you once and for all.

31
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,625
[FRIEZA] Well, you certainly
are an arrogant little thing...

32
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,416
And maybe in whatever
little hole you just

33
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,125
crawled out of,
you're pretty tough!

34
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,666
But you're no match for me!

35
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,000
Really, fighting a pitiful,
young punk like you

36
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,041
isn't even worth my time!

37
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,000
[BOY] Maybe I haven't
made myself clear yet!

38
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,500
You're finished, Frieza!

39
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,250
[FRIEZA growls]

40
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,416
Enough idle talk!

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,625
Foot soldier!

42
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,625
Sire!

43
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,333
Vaporize this little rodent!

44
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,375
[GREEN SOLDIER]
With pleasure!

45
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,708
[FRIEZA]
The rest of you, spread out!

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,041
[BOY] I think it's only fair
that I should warn you, guys.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,041
You don't stand a
chance against me.

48
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
Kid, you don't scare us!

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey! Stand back! I need
some room to work here!

50
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,875
[GREEN SOLDIER] Hmph!
His power is only at level five!

51
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:06,916
Well, kiddo, I hope
you've said your goodbyes!

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,083
'Cause it's about
time for you to go!

53
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,583
[GREEN SOLDIER gasps]

54
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,625
But-- I...

55
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,875
[GREEN SOLDIER gasps]

56
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,875
[GREEN SOLDIER yells]

57
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,500
Well!

58
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,291
Seems the little
dog has some bite

59
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,333
to go with his bark after all!

60
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,208
Why... you... Attack!

61
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

62
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:36,500
[SOLDIER gasping, whimpering]

63
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:46,166
[SOLDIER gasping, whimpering]

64
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,375
[FRIEZA]
Coward!

65
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,833
[crunching]

66
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,250
Why? Lord Frieza? Why...

67
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,666
I must admit I'm impressed!

68
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,333
[ALL gasp]

69
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,000
Guys? Hey! What's going on?

70
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,833
I'm sensing another
huge power level, and...

71
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,250
...and this one makes
Frieza's seem like nothing!

72
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,916
You know, guys,
it's not too late!

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,833
We can still
turn around and go home

74
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,958
if we want... right?

75
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,833
[TIEN]
Be strong, Yamcha!

76
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,583
[VEGETA thinking] Incredible!
I've never sensed anything

77
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,166
like this before!

78
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,458
Where would someone with this
kind of power have come from?

79
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,208
What a pleasant surprise.

80
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[FRIEZA]
You're right, Father.

81
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,125
This may prove to be a bit more
amusing than I had thought!

82
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,750
And now, you two
are going down!

83
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,208
[KING COLD chuckling]
One thing is certain:

84
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,791
If nothing else, I'd say
this little creature

85
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,875
is quite the comedian!

86
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,208
He is at that.

87
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,250
I'll tell you what, kid...

88
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,500
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

89
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,083
He who acquires
his skills quickly

90
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,833
is he who is the
first to perish.

91
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,333
Thanks for the tip.

92
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,666
Huh? Why you--

93
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,916
[BOY] Listen up! Now I've
got one for you, Frieza.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,750
Know your enemy!

95
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,916
You've already made some pretty
big assumptions about me,

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,166
and that's a mistake that's
going to cost you dearly!

97
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,500
You insolent brat!

98
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,916
You should really learn
to control your tongue!

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,125
Just destroy him, already
We haven't got all day.

100
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,333
[FRIEZA] Really, Father!
Have some patience!

101
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,916
I'm just trying to have a
little fun, if you don't mind!

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,375
He's right, though.
You really don't have all day.

103
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
More like five minutes...

104
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,958
Oh, that's too bad.

105
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,333
[FRIEZA chuckles]

106
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,625
And here I've made dinner plans!

107
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,458
[BOY] So I've heard!
Well sorry, Frieza,

108
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,375
but I'm canceling your
date with Goku!

109
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,750
[FRIEZA grunts]

110
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,708
What's a "Goku"?

111
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:27,250
Father, I know you're bored,
but please try to keep up.

112
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,333
So I take it you know
that worthless Saiyan?

113
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:35,333
By reputation,
but we'll meet soon.

114
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:39,166
Oh! Don't be so certain.

115
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,500
But I couldn't be
more certain, Frieza!

116
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,208
Any time now, Goku
will be coming home,

117
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,791
and only one of us is going to
be here waiting for him, get it?

118
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:55,000
Definitely! As it so happens

119
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,375
I was just about to suggest
that very thing myself.

120
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,333
It's so nice that
you and I can finally agree

121
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,500
on something, don't you think?

122
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,000
[TRUNKS chuckles]

123
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,000
For once, you're right!

124
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:11,166
Well, then I guess all that's
left is for me to decide

125
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,416
just how I'm going
to annihilate you.

126
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,541
[BOY]
Enough kidding around!

127
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,583
Huh?

128
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,916
It's time you understood
who I really am.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,791
So, I'll tell you what.

130
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm going to let the two
of you in on a little secret.

131
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,166
You're about to find
out what it's like

132
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,458
to fight a real Super Saiyan!

133
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,958
And I'm not talking about Goku!

134
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:34,916
What?!

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,541
[KING COLD growls]

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,041
[FRIEZA chuckles]

137
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,125
You crack me up, kid!

138
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

139
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,625
[FRIEZA] I've never met
anyone who laid it on

140
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,583
quite as thick as you!

141
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,458
[FRIEZA cackling]

142
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,125
[KING COLD chuckles]

143
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:05,958
[FRIEZA cackles,
KING COLD laughs]

144
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,666
Huh?

145
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,125
No! It can't be!

146
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,416
What is he?

147
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,708
[BOY yelling]

148
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:50,791
But... But... it's--
It's imposible!

149
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:59,666
[yelling]

150
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,083
[BOTH gasp]

151
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,291
[YAMCHA] Sounds like the
fight's starting without us!

152
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,875
[BULMA] Oh! Somebody stop
this thing! I want to get off!

153
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
It might be my dad!

154
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,333
You think?

155
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,708
Who else would try to
take on Frieza alone?

156
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,291
I don't know!

157
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:19,291
[VEGETA thinking] Kakarot! No! I
absolutely refuse to believe it!

158
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,500
There's no way his power level
could have increased this much!

159
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,125
It's impossible! Even if
he is a Super Saiyan!

160
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:41,041
[FRIEZA gasping]

161
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,291
[GOKU]
Frieza!

162
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,916
So this is a "Super Saiyan"...

163
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
It's those eyes!

164
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,250
They have the same eyes!

165
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,666
[FRIEZA gasping]

166
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,791
Is it something I said?

167
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,708
No! Saiyan!

168
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,083
[KRILLIN]
If that's Goku...

169
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,208
[KRILLIN yelling]

170
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,666
[VEGETA]
No! You'll give us all away!

171
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,458
Until I know what
we're dealing with,

172
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:14,250
I'd prefer to remain unnoticed!
So unless I tell you otherwise,

173
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,208
you stay put!

174
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,208
Are you hurt?

175
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,000
Just my pride...

176
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,666
Man, Gohan! What are
we supposed to do?

177
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,000
[GOHAN mumbling] I don't know...

178
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,416
What if Goku actually
is over there?

179
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
And what if he needs
are help right now,

180
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,416
while we're all just sitting
here doing absolutely nothing?!

181
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,041
Hey, maybe it would
help us relax a little

182
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,041
if we all sing a song!

183
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,416
Shut up! You haven't had
one useful thing to say

184
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,041
since you got here.

185
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,291
Now you stay in the back
and keep quite, woman!

186
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,875
I don't have time for
your stupidity right now.

187
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,458
Wha-- Stupid?

188
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,458
Take that back,
Bulma isn't stupid.

189
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,875
So you think I'm smart then?

190
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,041
Well, I guess you're
as smart as you can be,

191
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,458
being a girl and all.

192
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,750
[YAMCHA yells]

193
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,291
I'm not letting go
until you say you're sorry!

194
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,125
All right, all right! I'm sorry!

195
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,250
[GOHAN laughing]

196
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,291
[ALL laughing]

197
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,500
Oh! You make me sick!

198
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,500
This might just be our last
chance to laugh, you guys.

199
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,625
[BULMA]
Wait!

200
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh, how could they just
leave me behind like that!

201
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,291
Does this mean we can go now?

202
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,500
No! I won't turn back now!

203
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,833
Huh?

204
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,375
They think they can
ditch me 'cause I'm a girl!

205
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,500
Well I'll show them
what this girl can do!

206
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
Those boys better watch out!

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,375
'Cause here I come!

208
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,083
[BULMA laughing]

209
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,541
[BULMA]
Come on, Puar!

210
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,625
We'll teach those guys
not to run off and leave us!

211
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,291
My, I would say that was
all rather anticlimactic,

212
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,791
wouldn't you?
I mean, the little runt

213
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,375
certainly didn't last
very long, now did he?

214
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,750
Well, what did you
expect? He was only a--

215
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,333
[FRIEZA gasping]

216
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,000
Monkey...

217
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,125
[FRIEZA growls]

218
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,083
[BOY] I really hope that's
not the best you can do,

219
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,250
'cause if it is,
you better give up now!

220
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,708
You can't win, Frieza.

221
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:57,250
We'll just see about
that, boy! Take this!

222
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,500
Frieza!

223
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,833
[FRIEZA yelling]

224
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,416
You'll destroy us all!

225
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,416
[BOY yells]

226
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,583
[grunting]

227
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,791
What!

228
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,041
What the--?

229
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,958
[BULMA] Hey, what's
going on? I can't see!

230
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,625
What in the world happened
down there, Yamcha?

231
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,666
[BOY] It looks to me like you're
running out of tricks, Frieza!

232
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,458
This Saiyan is
really something else!

233
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,291
[KING KAI] I didn't think it
was really possible, Bubbles.

234
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,291
But this new kid is much
stronger than Frieza!

235
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,875
And after all that Frieza
did on Planet Namek...

236
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,041
I hope this kid
cleans his clock!

237
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:20,291
You hear me? Kick his butt, kid!

238
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,500
[KING KAI laughing]

239
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,541
Huh?

240
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,416
[BUBBLES babbles]

241
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,041
[KING KAI growls]

242
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,708
Okay! That's two! I'll
give you one more chance

243
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,083
to hit me with
everything you've got!

244
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,291
And then it's
strike three, Frieza.

245
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,666
Game over, you're out!

246
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,333
[FRIEZA] Hmph! It's time
we put an end to this!

247
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:07,125
[FRIEZA yelling]

248
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,125
[KING KAI gasps]

249
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,500
Oh no! It's just like on Namek!

250
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,125
Frieza's going for broke!

251
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,541
He's trying to destroy
the entire planet!

252
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,958
[FRIEZA cackling]

253
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,125
Hurry up! Are you going
to end this or not?

254
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:31,166
Just watch me!
This one's for you, Father!

255
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,750
[FRIEZA cackling]

256
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,583
What the...

257
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:52,791
Huh!

258
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,375
Everyone! Get down!

259
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,666
[KING COLD] You know, Frieza,
you could have done this

260
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,333
right from the start and
saved us a good deal of effort!

261
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,333
[FRIEZA] There's just no
pleasing you sometimes, Father!

262
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,791
Huh?

263
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,875
There's no way!

264
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,000
How?!

265
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,125
Impossible!

266
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,583
[FRIEZA growls]

267
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,375
Why you little...

268
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,791
Excuse me! Is this yours?

269
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,333
[FRIEZA chuckles]

270
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
[KING COLD]
Well done, Frieza!

271
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,416
It only took you four tries
to destroy that little boy!

272
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,875
[FRIEZA] I was just warming up,
Father! That's all! Really!

273
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,958
[KING COLD chuckling]
Of course, son! Of course!

274
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,125
Hey! Frieza!

275
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,750
Huh?

276
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,208
[FRIEZA gasps]

277
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,583
Ugh! When I get my hands on--

278
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:59,625
[BOY yelling]

279
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,083
[yelling continues]

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,875
[KING COLD gasps]

281
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,125
[NARRATOR]
Can it really be true?

282
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,083
