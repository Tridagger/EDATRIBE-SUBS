1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,166
We've got trouble, you guys!

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,583
What's the matter?

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:21,166
It's the Leucocyte! It was
just fired at Point Delta!

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,833
But that's where Gai is.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,375
The Leucocyte. It's a cluster
of Quasi-Zenith satellites

6
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,166
arranged as a constellation
directly over the Earth.

7
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,583
Once the constellation
is completed.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,541
It'll have ubiquitous
coverage of Japan

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,458
and be able to strike
any target at any time.

10
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,208
But, why would
they build that?

11
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,708
To exterminate
the Japanese people.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,666
Gai?

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,708
You're alive!
Are you injured?

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,833
Just a few scratches.

15
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,375
What about Kyo and the others?

16
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,208
They weren't as fortunate.

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,708
Our reinforcements
were taken out

18
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,958
and none of the supplies
are salvageable.

19
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,458
Should we delay and
reassess our strategy?

20
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:12,083
No, we don't have any time
to waste! Nothing stops!

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,291
All right. Are you ready, Gai?

22
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,541
Yeah.

23
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,291
I'll get straight
to our objective.

24
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,000
The Leucocyte system.
We're taking it down.

25
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,791
Its control center is at the
base of the Tsukigase Dam.

26
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,708
We will infiltrate through
the ground level entrance.

27
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,333
And then terminate
the control cores.

28
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,750
So what do we do,
just smash them up?

29
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,750
Kenji.

30
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:26,625
Coming up. Here we
have the Leucocyte.

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,500
It's controlled through
an earthbound state

32
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,125
of the art quantum
cryptography system.

33
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,666
And it's 200 meters
beneath a dam.

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,833
Here we have the control system
in question. The cores of the

35
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,041
device are housed in a
superconductive "float cage".

36
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,250
It switches to a hibernation
mode in response

37
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,166
to any physical tampering.
And therein lies the rub.

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,000
You can't manipulate this thing
from the outside at all.

39
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,375
So, if you want
to signal it to stop.

40
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,375
You've got to manipulate the
cores without touching them.

41
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,875
How is that possible?

42
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,458
That's where Shu and
Kenji fit into the plan.

43
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,833
Shu's ability
to draw out a Void.

44
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,166
And Kenji's
gravity manipulation.

45
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,000
These are the keys
to this operation.

46
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,708
However, our reinforcements have
been drastically minimized.

47
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,916
This is the schematic for
a new strategy. It raises our

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,166
projected casualties from five
percent to thirty five percent.

49
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,875
But it can still work. I'd
like you all to look it over.

50
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,333
Hold on. So you're saying
that one out of three of us

51
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,541
will die? That's too many!

52
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,375
Would you prefer to
apply that percentage

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,041
to the whole country? We have
no choice but to act now.

54
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,458
Well I don't like it! I don't
want to be responsible

55
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,791
for somebody's death
if I happen to screw up!

56
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,833
Fine. Let it be
on my head, then.

57
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,583
What about Kyo and the others?

58
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,333
Were they just
statistics to you?

59
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,625
Count me out. I don't want
the guilt of your sins.

60
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,125
All right, Shu. Are you done
acting like a spoiled brat?

61
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,583
What? I'm saying
all this for your sake!

62
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,166
Or were you just going
to blindly follow him

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,791
to your death, huh?

64
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,625
Okay, enough! Who do you think
sounds like the asshole?

65
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,708
It sure as hell isn't Gai.
Read the social cues, man.

66
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,500
Just look around you.

67
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,083
What do we do now?

68
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:33,541
Nothing. The strategy
stays the same. Dismissed.

69
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,666
Shu?

70
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,166
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?

71
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,250
Listen, sorry about
earlier. I should've

72
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,791
known you wouldn't leave Gai.

73
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,291
Nobody would choose me over him,
I was just fooling myself.

74
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,833
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself. I hate that.

75
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,041
You're right.

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,875
Listen.

77
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,333
There's something important
that I think you need to see.

78
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,000
Leucocyte 3 will enter
its planned orbit

79
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,666
in four hours, thereby
completing the cage.

80
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,333
You're on standby until
we've secured the process.

81
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,833
It's a shame that
you aren't going

82
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,875
to have time to see it through.
Funeral Parlor will attack

83
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,291
in two hours and
seventeen minutes.

84
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,541
Do you have an informant
amongst their ranks?

85
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,750
No, it's just a gut feeling.
A theory I'm hoping to test.

86
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,375
Little bit of a game.

87
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,916
That would make this the first
time that I hope your instincts

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,083
are off the mark, Segai.
Keep me posted.

89
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,708
Why two hours and
seventeen minutes, you think?

90
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,666
Well that's when
the sun sets, obviously.

91
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,541
Oh, good point.
They want the cover of night.

92
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,791
This is your first battle
since you've recovered.

93
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you feel up to it?

94
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,375
What?

95
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,958
When the hell have
I ever "not been up to it"?

96
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,250
Those little maggots are going
to pay for stealing my Steiner.

97
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,125
Yes, I'll crush them. Even
if they try to surrender.

98
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,541
I'll line them up and
pull the trigger.

99
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,625
Sir? I'm sorry,
were you talking to me?

100
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,916
Come on! I can hardly wait
to see what you have

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,583
in store for me this
time. Don't let me down.

102
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,416
My heart just might break in two
if you don't show up, Shu Ouma.

103
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,458
I'm not sure what the hell I'm
doing. It's been a long time

104
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:34,000
since something's gotten to me
the way he did. To be honest,

105
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,166
It took all of my strength to
not drop my "leader" act.

106
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,583
I wasn't the only one who
survived the Leucocyte attack.

107
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,625
Kyo was still
alive just barely.

108
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,833
Gai, thank you so much.
I'll never forget everything

109
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:10,000
you've done for me. I'll never
forget. Thank you, Gai.

110
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:24,458
She was smiling. She was glad
that I was okay. Glad that she

111
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:30,708
was dying instead of me.
I couldn't help but ask myself.

112
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,083
Am I actually capable
of repaying such

113
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:38,000
a great sacrifice? Shouldn't
I be better than this?

114
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,625
The truth is,
I'm a much weaker man

115
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:53,208
than I've led them all
to believe. I'm worthless.

116
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,750
I should be the first one
selected out, the first to die.

117
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,333
Are you spying on me now?

118
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,291
Haven't you done enough damage?

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,916
I'm not sure
I wanted to hear that.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,416
I didn't know there
was that side to you.

121
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,583
Just what kind of person
were you convinced I was?

122
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,541
Sorry I'm human. Sometimes
I lose confidence in myself.

123
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
And sometimes I use people.

124
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,708
People like Inori?

125
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,750
Yeah, sure.

126
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,750
Did you think I could
sacrifice them,

127
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,541
and not feel the weight of
their lives on my shoulders?

128
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,958
I'm not indifferent to
their deaths, Shu.

129
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,166
I just know,
what they're worth.

130
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,416
From now on,
you've got my help.

131
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,250
Then you're a fool, too.

132
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,791
We're all set.

133
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,791
Begin the mission.

134
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,083
Black Swan to all units,
combat has now begun!

135
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,958
Enemy approaching!

136
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,291
Where the hell are they?

137
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,500
Major Segai!

138
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,125
Would you kindly tell
the Lieutenant, it's time?

139
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,750
I have missed that sound!
It feels good to be doing

140
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,333
what I do best.

141
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,541
I never got to thank you
for this sweet ride.

142
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:03,000
Steiner! My Steiner,
give it back! It's mine!

143
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,916
Mine! Give it back!

144
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,958
Thanks, Ogumo!

145
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,166
Gai, the diversion's working
like a charm. Are you in yet?

146
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,250
Yeah. I've got to shut
down the transmission.

147
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,541
Say a prayer for us.

148
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
Come back in one piece, okay?

149
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,833
You got it.

150
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:26,916
Run!

151
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,958
You saving your bullets
for something special, Shu?

152
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,333
I'm kind of focused
on running for my life!

153
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:40,500
Excuses, excuses. Just kill
some people. And, kaboom!

154
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,708
The cores are in here.
Let's move!

155
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,791
There's too many of them!

156
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,375
I'll hold them off while
you move in. All right? Gai?

157
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,583
If that's what you want.

158
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,333
Thank you.

159
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:19,708
I don't want to have to kill
you. But I will. It's your call.

160
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,750
Dammit!

161
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,250
All right, this was
your decision.

162
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,458
Inori! You too?

163
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,083
Come on, enough with
the moral outrage.

164
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,833
Let's go ahead and do this Void
thing. Just make it snappy.

165
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,875
It isn't a whole lot of fun.

166
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,041
There's been a breech.
It's the core room!

167
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
Go ahead and make the swap.

168
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,458
You just can't make up
your mind, can you?

169
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,791
Now where are my manners?
I really should

170
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,583
say hello to our guests.

171
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,708
Aim for the center?

172
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,166
That's right.
And keep it steady.

173
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,458
Funell will input the shut down
command once the circuit is cut.

174
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,541
Surprise! It's nice
to finally see you, Gai.

175
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,541
I've been looking forward
to paying you back

176
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,875
for making a fool out of me.

177
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,833
What now?

178
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,416
Stay focused on your task!

179
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:00,458
Daryl! Don't forget the cores
are in there! Be careful!

180
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,666
Shu!

181
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,166
What the hell?

182
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,833
Get off of me!
You piece of shit!

183
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,583
That was a close one. Gai!

184
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,541
Bring it home,
Toku! Hey?

185
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,833
Bad news, Gai!

186
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,000
What is it?

187
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,666
There's something wrong
with Leucocyte 1!

188
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,958
The altitude control
is malfunctioning.

189
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,958
It's plummeting to Earth!

190
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,166
At the rate it's falling,
Leucocyte 1 will crash

191
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,208
with most of its mass intact.
In the center of Tokyo!

192
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey, Shu. Give me the pen.

193
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,333
The transmitter pen GHQ forced
you to take. Give it to me.

194
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,083
I guess you had it
all figured out.

195
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,291
So you decided not to push
the buttons, huh, Shu?

196
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,833
Kind of a letdown, but it all
worked out for the best.

197
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,666
You must be Segai?

198
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,875
I'm honored you know
my name, Gai Tsutsugami.

199
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,166
I'll make you a deal.
I'll use this to stop

200
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,791
the satellite's fall.
And in exchange.

201
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,791
You erase every single
piece of information

202
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,750
that you've
gathered on Shu Ouma.

203
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,958
Your pen doesn't send
a beacon to GHQ.

204
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,125
It signals the Leucocyte,
Shu. It was programmed

205
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,666
to fire at your location when
you pushed the buttons.

206
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,708
Which means, if we can manage
to get the firing satellite

207
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,333
lined up with this pen. And
with the falling satellite

208
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,000
in between. Then we can
destroy it before it crashes.

209
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,666
Whoa, hold on!
That means the person who's

210
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,250
holding the pen would be
right in the line of fire!

211
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,583
Why is Gai outside? What the
hell happened to the plan?

212
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,041
I have no idea, but we need
to make sure he's covered!

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,291
Am I just going to stand back
and watch again?

214
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,791
Can I really live with that?

215
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,583
You can save them
if you want. Do you?

216
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,791
What do you mean?

217
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,791
First, tell me.
Do you really want to help?

218
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,125
Do you want to save Gai?
Is he worth saving?

219
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,416
I thought you'd say that.

220
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,375
It's come down to this.
I can stand back

221
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,958
and let the world die.
Or I can take its place.

222
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,041
Gai!

223
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:19,291
What're you doing here?
Where did you get that Void?

224
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,833
Someone thought of
a way out of this without

225
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,208
getting you killed.
So I'm not letting you do this!

226
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,541
Kay, Tsugumi.
How much time is left?

227
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,291
You've only got about thirty
seconds! Everyone hear that?

228
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,791
Thirty seconds and counting!

229
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
Roger. Black Swan.

230
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,041
No, you don't!

231
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,291
This is for all of us.
All of our power combined!

232
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,458
Now!

233
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,416
He did it!

234
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,125
Why'd you do it, Shu?
Do you really think the world

235
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,625
would miss one sinner?

236
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:55,416
I told you I would help,
didn't I? You see?

237
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,083
Now we're in it together.

238
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:12,791
Thank you, Shuichiro. Cocytus
trembled with your efforts.

239
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:18,541
It won't be much longer
before she awakens.

240
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,375
She'll rise from her slumber
seeking her beloved king.
