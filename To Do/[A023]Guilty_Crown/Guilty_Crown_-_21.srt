1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,791
I'm glad to see
you're finally awake.

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,333
Your queen will be happy.

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,166
Her chosen king has returned.

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome back, Gai.

5
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,041
King?

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,041
Mana's on her way,
soon to be reborn in Cocytus.

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,583
Just as the law
of nature demands.

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,291
She is the mold
of the new human race.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,875
The embodiment of
its will to evolve.

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,291
And she has deigned you
to be her king.

11
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,541
Neither of us can stop it.

12
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,541
There's not a person
alive that can stop it.

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,041
Not even Mana herself.

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,833
What you're saying is,
I'm not allowed to end this.

15
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,166
Master Gai.

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,958
The United Nations forces have
begun their advance on Ward 24.

17
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,791
Alright.

18
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,250
Stand by until I get there.

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,958
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:17,333
Are you sad, Gai?

21
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,041
What makes you think that?

22
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,333
I don't think it, I feel it.

23
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,541
Just now.

24
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,958
It's like your heart
reached out for mine.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,541
My wish is about to come true.

26
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,833
So you see, I couldn't be
any happier than I am now.

27
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,583
You're wrong.

28
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,250
We've moved in this close and
they haven't fired on us yet?

29
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,375
Strange.

30
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,750
Their threat to use
the 256 Leucocytes

31
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,708
was nothing but a bluff.
They've only got the one

32
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,458
we failed to destroy
the first time.

33
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,583
The rest that show up are
nothing but digital phantoms

34
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,750
and decoys that have been put
in place by their hackers.

35
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,375
So they were buying time.
And everyone who could've

36
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,000
stopped them fell for it
like a bunch of fools.

37
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,208
The whole world, including us,
just sat on our hands,

38
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,750
until it was too late.

39
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,666
But we've still
made it in time.

40
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,625
True, it may not be very much
time, but we've still got

41
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,208
the chance to fix this.
The chance to stop Gai,

42
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,458
and to save Inori.

43
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,916
Precisely.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,208
If we can retrieve Inori,
Gai's plan goes up in smoke.

45
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,041
And more importantly, we might
even be able to wipe out

46
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,708
the Apocalypse Virus
all over the world.

47
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,583
Things look bleak, but we have
the opportunity to illuminate

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,708
the way for a new future.

49
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,375
And so we will. I never
thought I'd say this,

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,541
but the fate of humanity
may very well be resting

51
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:32,166
in our hands. Well, guys.
You know what's at stake here;

52
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
let's win this. Agreed?

53
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,250
I'm gonna borrow this.
Okay, Ogumo?

54
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,041
You think this protocol will
work. Take a look for me?

55
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,208
I think so. As long as
they don't discover us.

56
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,166
Would you mind helping me
into the chair?

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,458
So, Shu.

58
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,958
Yeah?

59
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,750
Could you shoot? If he was
standing right in front of you,

60
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,833
could you pull the
trigger on Gai?

61
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
Yes, I could.

62
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,583
You're a good person, you know.

63
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,041
Where the hell
did that come from?

64
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm the one whose job it is
to get dirty. Not you, okay?

65
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,500
You stay just the way you are.

66
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,125
Shu.

67
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,625
Although. If I wind up in
a jam during the battle,

68
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,708
I will have to use your Void.
I'm sorry, but I can't

69
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,625
get this done without
making you my accomplice.

70
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,208
That's fine with me.

71
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,250
I knew what I was getting into
when I loaned you my heart.

72
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,458
Just remember. I didn't give
it to you for keeps, okay?

73
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,166
I do want it back. So you better
not go off and die with it.

74
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,958
I'll do my best. Thank you.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,000
Attack units on course.
Approaching Point Delta

76
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,500
without interference.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,791
Commence with the attack.
Launch all Endlave units!

78
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,166
All units begin descent!
Repeat, begin descent.

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,750
Go, go, go!

80
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,291
They brought
every one they could.

81
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,416
Boy, they must really hate
your guts. Huh, Gai?

82
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,208
I'm doing it.

83
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,833
That's cool with me.

84
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,875
87 percent of
their fleet destroyed!

85
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,791
No sign of retaliation!

86
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,541
The outcome is predetermined.
It's our job to efficiently

87
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,625
clear the path
leading to the end.

88
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,750
Activate all Endlave forces.
I want the Ghost Unit on

89
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,541
the front lines.

90
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,958
Lieutenant, we're
counting on you.

91
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,500
Hey. Tell me this. What
are you even doing here?

92
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,250
It's clear the whole
thing leaves a bad taste

93
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,875
in your mouth.

94
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,000
What about you? Why volunteer
to be their guinea pig?

95
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,833
You haven't really done
much to hide the fact

96
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,875
that you want to destroy Gai.

97
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,458
Can you really blame me?
I'm pissed they used

98
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:05,250
my own Void against me.
Also. This is my life.

99
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:10,458
I wanna decide how it ends.
Isn't that right, Gespenst?

100
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,791
I wish the U.N. hadn't
fallen so quickly.

101
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,708
We really could've
used that distraction.

102
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,000
We better hurry.

103
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,958
Let's move!

104
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,541
We're registering
a new enemy in block 7!

105
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,625
And it's not the U.N.!

106
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,125
Funeral Parlor!

107
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,333
Send in the Ghosts!

108
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,375
Are they down?

109
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,166
'Fraid not. You just
attacked a Void.

110
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,625
They took out the copies!

111
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,833
Just as I had expected.
And hoped. Tsugumi.

112
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,333
That should've given you
a strong enough reading

113
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,500
to analyze their security
banks. Can you do it?

114
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,500
You forget who
you're talking to?

115
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,083
Tell me one time
I haven't blown your mind.

116
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,500
There it is! The
backdoor Haruka left!

117
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,958
What's happening?!

118
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,750
They've infiltrated our system!

119
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
They're not moving.

120
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,291
They've shut down.

121
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,291
Don't throw away this
chance! Get our troops

122
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,833
on the ground and put
them down right now!

123
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,791
Souta!

124
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,875
Their forces have
penetrated Area 4!

125
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,833
The U.N. fleet is
resuming their advance!

126
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,416
Get our system up!

127
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,458
Well this is it. Here's
where we have to part.

128
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,333
But that doesn't mean
I won't be with you.

129
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,791
I'll royally screw them
over on the digital end.

130
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,958
Thanks.

131
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,375
Sounds good. We'll need it.

132
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,041
You just do your part and save
Inori. That's not a request;

133
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,000
I demand a happy ending.

134
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,458
Your time's up. I'm erasing all
of your memories and emotions.

135
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,500
Every part of you that
made you an individual being.

136
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,166
It won't be long now
before you're reborn as Mana.

137
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,333
Go on and resent me, Inori.

138
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,875
If I hadn't woken you, none of
this would ever have happened.

139
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,208
You'd have remained in stasis.

140
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:15,416
And then, you never would have
known the meaning of loss.

141
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:24,083
No. You're wrong there. I can't
resent you. I'm grateful.

142
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,791
Because of you,
I got to experience life.

143
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:32,000
If you hadn't woken me,
I never would've met Shu.

144
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,000
Ayase!

145
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,708
I've got the rest!

146
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,708
And what was so precious that
Shu gave you? I'm curious.

147
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,916
What wonderful things
did he show you?

148
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,750
He showed me the world.

149
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:04,291
All of its sadness,
it's pain and its beauty.

150
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:10,916
Shu suffered, doubted
himself. He hurt people.

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,791
And made mistakes. And he
felt remorse and shame

152
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:19,291
for his actions. That's why,
that's the true reason

153
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,708
I love him.

154
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:32,791
His boundless humanity. Shu
showed me how to be human.

155
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,625
Shu! That's too much!

156
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,000
It's okay. I promise.

157
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,166
Idiot!

158
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,250
He showed me how to live. Even
though I'm not a real human,

159
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,833
he gave me the chance
to fall in love,

160
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:54,250
just like a normal person.

161
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,375
Tsugumi. We've reached the
checkpoint. What's next?

162
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,250
Tsugumi! You there?

163
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,250
Looks like they've got
their system back up.

164
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
They must've recovered
control somehow.

165
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,666
Inori. Where are you?

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,958
Is that so? Shu means that
much to you, does he?

167
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,833
Who is Shu?

168
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,708
I guess that's the name of
the only man you ever loved.

169
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:42,000
Wildflower, boldly blooming

170
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,791
Tell me how--

171
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,041
I hear you.

172
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,291
Inori's singing.

173
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,000
Is there something
wrong with him?

174
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,875
I can't hear anyone singing.

175
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,875
Follow me! I know the way!

176
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,416
It doesn't make much sense, but
still, I believe he hears her.

177
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Right then! It's not like we
have anything else to go on.

178
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,333
Just remain calm,
and please walk, no running!

179
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:17,791
Valiantly blooming flower

180
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:26,125
What can you see
from your field?

181
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:33,375
Why can't people
forgive each other?

182
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,916
Where are we?

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,916
This is the hub
of Central Command.

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,583
We can take the elevator
straight to the top from here-

185
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:52,541
Welcome, Shu. Glad you could
make it. And how nice.

186
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,166
Some of your followers
tagged along.

187
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,625
We're comrades!
Not his damned followers!

188
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,833
Is that what you believe?
The illusion of camaraderie

189
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,500
is an effective tactic.

190
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,666
Enough of this.
You and I need to have

191
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,875
a private conversation, Shu.
You might wanna say goodbye.

192
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,041
This is probably the last time
you'll ever see them.

193
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,375
Shu!

194
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,416
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
You focus on protecting

195
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,083
everyone else!

196
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,375
Well you've certainly got
your confidence up these days,

197
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,916
don't you? Those are
some pretty big shoes

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
you're trying
to fill, oh savior.

199
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,500
Who are you? Or should
I ask what are you?

200
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,916
Simply, I am the
living incarnation of Daath.

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,125
In fact, I am the impetus behind
the will of the human race.

202
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,666
To be clear, you could
even say that I am Daath.

203
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,125
You've impressed us. We never
expected that you would

204
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,125
recover the kingly
power stolen from you.

205
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,416
And you made us rethink
examine our intentions.

206
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,583
Maybe Gai's not it. Maybe
you are the rightful heir,

207
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,333
the one meant to be
Adam to Mana's Eve.

208
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,208
And therefore, Shu Ouma,
we have a question for you.

209
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,416
Think carefully
before you answer.

210
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,875
There's only one way for
mankind to progress from here.

211
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,166
Complete obliteration
at the hands of Adam.

212
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,500
And it's all in your hands. Will
you spend eternity with Mana?

213
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,500
And shape the next phase
of humanity?

214
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,291
You can't be serious.

215
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,166
Just a simple yes
or no answer will do.

216
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,125
Hell no.

217
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:41,625
That's what I figured you'd
say. But Gai? No hesitation.

218
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,208
He said yes before I could
even finish the question.

219
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,291
I suppose that's the
difference between you two.

220
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:58,083
Oh, well. In the name
of Daath's reign,

221
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,666
I strip you of your right to
the succession of the throne.

222
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,791
Yahiro!

223
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,166
Is that an exit?

224
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,208
It sure is, but good luck.

225
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,458
The chances of you even
reaching it are kind of slim.

226
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,083
Don't tell me it's you?!

227
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,250
You better believe it,
sweetheart. Let's settle this,

228
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,000
Funeral Parlor.
Once and for all!

229
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,875
Selection and evolution,
an inescapable process

230
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,708
for every living thing.

231
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,791
Resisting it is futile
and yet here you are.

232
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,208
You've got some nerve
to refuse Mana twice.

233
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,625
She so badly wanted you.
And look who you've devoted

234
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,375
yourself to. A soulless
test-tube child.

235
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,125
Shut up!

236
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,625
Argo!

237
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,250
You're wrong about Inori.
You know nothing about her.

238
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,625
I'm the only one
who understands her.

239
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:18,166
She's real. She fought the
ugliness you planted within her.

240
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,875
And she suffered.

241
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,833
Even when I hated myself for
making the same mistakes,

242
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,125
she gave me the love I needed.

243
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,250
No matter what happened,
she was always there.

244
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,666
She always had faith in me!

245
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,833
And this time, I'll be
there to stand by her side.

246
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,750
I won't let you
take her. I won't!

247
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,375
Go ahead and try your best,
then. If you're really

248
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,916
that determined, Shu.
Try to resist your despair.

249
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,208
I'm sorry, but you
just missed her.

250
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:55,458
Mana must devour Inori to
be reborn. Our fallen Eve

251
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,500
has been resurrected.

252
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,458
The time has finally come.
The Apocalypse is now upon us.

253
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,375
I'm too late.
