1
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,375
This is where you lose her,
forever. Say goodbye, Shu.

2
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,500
This is why I can't
trust you, on your own.

3
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,208
Gai?

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,250
A Void? The entire district?

5
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,916
Correct! The tower standing
over Roppongi Fort

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,291
is a phantasm given form
from a single girl's heart.

7
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,208
I'm guessing
that girl is Mana Ouma?

8
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,791
I promised you information
on Voids as payment

9
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,750
for your services.
Consider yourself paid.

10
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,500
I appreciate the
work you've done

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,416
but I'm afraid you can't
go any further than this.

12
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,750
It's all business with him.

13
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,583
Impossible, you can't be!

14
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,291
So it's finally
coming back to you.

15
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:31,625
You're just as dense
as you were back then. Shu.

16
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,333
I remember!

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,750
The grave keeper of Daath.
So you finally show yourself.

18
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,500
Grave keeper?

19
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,791
I couldn't help but admire
Shuichiro's dogged effort.

20
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,875
So it only made sense
that he and I work together.

21
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,583
Shu, follow him. They're
planning to sacrifice Inori,

22
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,125
in order to awaken Mana.

23
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:56,208
Mana? Get down here!
Bring her back!

24
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,625
Shu!

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,958
What's going on up there?

26
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
Inori!

27
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,083
You know, Shu, you can't really
understand where you're going

28
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,416
until you know where it is
you've been. It's time you

29
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,833
open up those memories,
and quit hiding from them.

30
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:41,583
Shu. We're here now.
You can open your eyes, go on.

31
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,666
Wow, this is so cool!
Really, Mana!

32
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,041
You like it? This is my
secret place to get away

33
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,333
but I'll share it with you
since you're my brother.

34
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,791
Hey, look. What is that?

35
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
Is he dead?

36
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:43,666
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
My name is Shu, Shu Ouma.

37
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,041
And I'm his sister,
Mana. What's your name?

38
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,958
Maybe he can't remember.
Do you know who you are?

39
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,000
What's your name?

40
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,791
I'm not sure.

41
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,000
Triton.

42
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:02,125
You must've come from the ocean.
So we'll call you Triton.

43
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,500
It's a pretty cool name, right?

44
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:10,250
That's right. That day on the
beach, my big sister Mana

45
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,291
and I found a boy,
washed up on the shore.

46
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:19,500
A boy we came to know
by the name of Triton. Gai.

47
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,416
Unsure of his own
identity, he spent a summer

48
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,666
living with us. The year
of Lost Christmas.

49
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,208
The last time any of us felt
like we had a reason to smile.

50
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,833
Hey! Are you serious
about jumping?

51
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,250
Yeah, it'll be fine.
Just believe in me!

52
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,833
Okay, it's your turn! Come on!

53
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,750
See, I knew you could do it.

54
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,875
Yeah.

55
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,958
After all that time
we spent together.

56
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,958
It was only natural that
we became best friends.

57
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:09,125
Almost brothers.
My life felt complete.

58
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,625
I had my gentle and
loving big sister, Mana.

59
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,208
And my best friend, Gai.
That summer together

60
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:22,000
was easily the happiest time
of my entire life. So why then?

61
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,666
Why did I forget about something
that meant so much to me?

62
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,916
About Gai? And my sister.

63
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,750
So you've woken up?

64
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,083
Where are we?

65
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,458
Inori!

66
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,625
What the hell are you doing
to her? Give her back to me,

67
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,958
you bastard!

68
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,750
You should understand that
this girl has never been

69
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,458
anything more than a temporary
body that we created

70
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,041
to use as an interface for
communication with Mana.

71
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,333
Why would we give back something
that was ours to begin with?

72
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,958
Created?

73
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
Your sister was the
first person to touch

74
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,250
the creation rock and
therefore the first one

75
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:15,291
to succumb to the Apocalypse
Virus. She is our Eve.

76
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,166
Although her soul had
lost its body, it's now

77
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,916
being siphoned into a new form.
Thanks to our diligence,

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,250
she'll soon set foot
in this world again.

79
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,791
Her resurrection
will bring with it

80
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,208
the finality Lost Christmas
lacked. The Apocalypse Virus

81
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,875
will coat the face
of the earth like a scab.

82
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,791
It is my purpose in life
to witness that event!

83
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,375
For some reason,
Daath is convinced

84
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,958
you have some potential.
Although you strike me

85
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,750
as nothing more than a
clueless child. Now stay put!

86
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,708
Keep your mouth shut,
and observe!

87
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,625
Inori!

88
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,583
This is not
the time to interfere.

89
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,833
It's rather rude.
He's about to ask

90
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,333
for Mana's hand
in marriage, after all.

91
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,833
What are you talking about?

92
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,750
Her chosen partner
is a lucky man.

93
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,500
He will be the father
of the new human race.

94
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,083
Not that she has much say
in the matter. Even Eve,

95
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,791
with all her selfish ways,
can be controlled by the stone.

96
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,375
I do hope we can count on
her brother's blessing

97
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
for this union?

98
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,375
I don't understand.

99
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,000
Marry?

100
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:39,041
That's right. You won't feel too
lonely if I marry someone else.

101
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,125
Will you, Shu?

102
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,291
Marry who?

103
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,041
I don't know yet.
Maybe it'll be Triton.

104
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,875
Triton? You can't marry him!

105
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:57,416
Oh, don't be silly. I'm only
joking. I wouldn't do that.

106
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,750
Although I have caught him
looking at me a few times,

107
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,416
you know. Leering at me,
the way a man would.

108
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't want him to do that?

109
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't want him to, but you
can look at me that way.

110
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,041
Why can I?

111
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,000
Because, Shu, I love you.

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,458
You've got the virus.
Those spots are from the virus

113
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,791
in that rock, aren't they?
It makes people crazy.

114
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,708
I overheard your dad
talking about it.

115
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,291
Tell me, Mana. What do you
want to do with Shu?

116
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,458
If it wasn't for me, you'd
be lying dead on that beach.

117
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,500
I saved your life,
which means you're mine.

118
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,625
And I can do anything
I want with you. Can't I?

119
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,875
Um, Mana?

120
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,625
Listen, Triton,
I'm going to marry, Shu.

121
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,958
And no one's going to get in
my way. That understood?

122
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey, Shu? Promise me something.
Promise, that you'll marry me.

123
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,458
With this perfect pairing,
we sanctify the chosen union.

124
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:57,083
By performing the bond of blood.
That will shape the new race.

125
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,875
Stop it!

126
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,541
Now, now, Shu.

127
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,291
You really have
no right to get jealous.

128
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,041
After all, you were
the one to shun me.

129
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:28,500
I was completely devastated.
But you knew that, didn't you?

130
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,666
What do you mean?

131
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,541
Was I that unimportant
to you? That you'd forget?

132
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,875
Let me share my pain with you.

133
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,333
Are you okay, Shu?

134
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,833
Ayase!

135
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,416
And this is why I can't
trust you on your own!

136
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,833
Gai! You're still alive!

137
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:59,375
He missed my vital organs. The
cancer crystals shielded them.

138
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
Gai Tsutsugami.

139
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,875
This is the moment I've been
waiting for! All this time,

140
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,541
I've finally got you and
Mana in the same place!

141
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,083
The hidden camera feed
is a bit staticky.

142
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,291
It was just as bad the first
time I got footage of

143
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,750
a Void in action. It's clear
enough to see, though.

144
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,583
It's Sephira's prototype
filter. I'd like to know

145
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,583
just why you let us through?

146
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,708
It hurt my feelings that
I didn't get invited

147
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,375
to the party. I figured
I'd let you crash it for me.

148
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,041
You're too late, Tsutsugami!
This is the course of destiny.

149
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,541
Shu, get moving!

150
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,708
Shu!

151
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
Tsugumi! Emergency bailout!

152
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,208
No! I can still fight!

153
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:18,000
We form with these vows,
an unbreakable chain.

154
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,833
Shu, dig deep. You have
to remember! Some part of you

155
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,000
must know what
happened that day!

156
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,791
What day?

157
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,541
Lost Christmas.

158
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,208
December Two Thousand
Twenty-nine. We had left

159
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,458
your summer home and come
to Tokyo. Your new mother,

160
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:45,791
Haruka, had brought us here.
And on December 24th,

161
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,708
I asked you to meet me
at a church in Roppongi.

162
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,541
I wanted to tell you about
the Mana you didn't know.

163
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,666
But,

164
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:01,833
to my surprise. You weren't
the one who showed up.

165
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,333
Merry Christmas, Triton.

166
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,916
Oh, uh, thanks.

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,041
Open it.

168
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,041
You're my little knight,
aren't you, Triton?

169
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,375
This way you can
always protect me.

170
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,958
Let's see you shoot the
star on top of the tree.

171
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Poor Triton. You do know
that I loved you, right?

172
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,500
Just kidding.

173
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:58,291
Triton? Triton!
What happened? Triton!

174
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,416
Forget him. Come here
and take this, Shu.

175
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,708
If you and
I intertwine our DNA,

176
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,208
we can create a beautiful
new world together.

177
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,375
It's okay, Shu. There's
nothing to be scared of.

178
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,416
Don't you want to do something
fun? Just you and me?

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,541
Get away! Stay back!
You monster!

180
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,083
Mana?

181
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,625
No!

182
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:55,125
I'm sorry, forgive me,
please, Shu.

183
00:16:55,208 --> 00:17:00,000
Please don't be frightened.
I need your help!

184
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,000
It's all so fast.
I'm becoming somebody else!

185
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,750
Her fear boiled over.
And she destroyed herself

186
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,500
with her own
out-of-control power.

187
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:27,333
That's right. I remember.
She asked for our help that day.

188
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,541
She asked, but there was nothing
we could do to help her.

189
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,541
We were useless.
Then you said something.

190
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:43,750
I'm going to get stronger.
Goodbye, Shu.

191
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,833
I'd forgotten. I was
hiding from the past.

192
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,958
Trying to protect myself.

193
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,500
You're whole again.
So now you know, Shu.

194
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,416
You know exactly
what we have to do.

195
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,291
We have to take
Mana's soul back from them.

196
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,833
You got it. They've forced her
to awaken against her will.

197
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,791
And you and I are going
to put her back to sleep.

198
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,916
Use the Void's power, Shu.
Send her back to oblivion!

199
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,250
You've unlocked the shackles
of memory and now you think

200
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,291
you're ready to take your place
as king. Is that it, Shu?

201
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,500
We're running out of time.
Draw out my heart, Shu.

202
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,833
Take my Void! And then
I want you to hand it to me.

203
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,708
With the power you're feeling,
I know you can do it!

204
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,791
Don't let go of
my hand until it's done.

205
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,625
So this is Gai's Void.

206
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,833
All right, Shu.
I need you to cover me

207
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,291
while I make
a beeline for Mana.

208
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,916
I've got your back.

209
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,250
Let's go!

210
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,750
Inori!

211
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,708
Shu. Are you trying
to make me jealous?

212
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,791
Gai!

213
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,833
It's a Void that forces other
people's Voids to manifest!

214
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
Of course, I should expect
nothing less from him.

215
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,791
Do it! Get going!

216
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,041
Right!

217
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,458
Stop!

218
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,833
Shuichiro, you've done
enough. You did your best,

219
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,125
and you failed.

220
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,791
Gai!

221
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,541
Put the blade through me
and stab Mana, Shu!

222
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,166
I'm a dead man anyway
you look at it. So do it!

223
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,583
No!

224
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,416
Shu. Who do I remind you
of right now?

225
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,791
You were always so
decisive when we were kids.

226
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,333
You were brave and strong.
More than anything,

227
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,041
I wanted to be like you.

228
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
What? What are you
talking about, Gai?

229
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,958
You haven't lost the
ability to be that person.

230
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,250
If I can change myself,
then so can you.

231
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,458
You don't need me
to do this anymore.

232
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,875
Come on. Hurry up and do it!

233
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,458
Gai.

234
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Shu.

235
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,875
It's you. Triton.

236
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,750
Mana. I've finally
repaid the favor.

237
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,208
Oh god! Gai!

238
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,916
It's okay. This is
how Gai wanted it.

239
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,333
I heard him, Shu.
He said thank you.
