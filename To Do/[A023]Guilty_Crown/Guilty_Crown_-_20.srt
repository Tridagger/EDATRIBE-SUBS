1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,291
Shu Ouma has managed
to obtain the Void Genome.

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,541
He's recovered
the king's power.

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:23,333
To make matters worse,
he's materialized his own Void.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,208
I'm aware of this.

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,750
Is that so? May I ask how?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,875
How are you
feeling today, Mana?

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,916
A little cramped.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,833
This girl has a remarkably
strong will for a clone.

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:41,458
Regardless, I'll possess
every inch of her soon enough.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,208
And there won't be any limit
to the fun we'll have together.

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,916
Right, Triton?

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,041
Yahiro. I've been
looking for you.

13
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,083
Shu was pretty great,
wasn't he?

14
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:34,416
Yeah. Have you found time
to talk to him yet?

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,041
What could I say
to him after all this?

16
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,416
There's a broadcast
from Ward 24!

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,625
Gai's gonna talk!

18
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,041
Come on!

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,416
I gave you all very simple
instructions to follow.

20
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
To stay out of my way. Despite
this, there have already been

21
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,791
34 attempted
physical infiltrations,

22
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,708
and 42,000 attempted
hackings of Ward 24.

23
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,583
These attempts can
only mean one thing.

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:09,583
Clearly you are all anxious to
die. You want to be annihilated.

25
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,625
Very well. I shall grant your
wish. Each individual life

26
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,750
will be measured
by the world itself,

27
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,958
and your fates determined
by the winds of change.

28
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:24,041
The world as you know it, will
come to an end on December 25th.

29
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,333
We will clear the way for
the new world to begin.

30
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,708
Kuhouin had one last request. He
left me in charge of his assets

31
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,833
and connections, for the
sole purpose of insuring

32
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,916
that Gai is defeated.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,875
Tomorrow morning, I'm joining
forces with another squadron.

34
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,500
A private military contractor
we're bringing in. All I need

35
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:55,458
to know is can I count on you
to fight alongside us, Shu?

36
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,125
And all of you. Ask
yourselves that question.

37
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,583
Are you ready to do what
needs to be done to beat him?

38
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:05,666
That sounds nice. But
first off, answer me this.

39
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,416
What's Gai doing? Just what
the hell is he planning on?

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,833
The Fourth Apocalypse.
He intends to spread

41
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,166
a Lost Christmas-type
epidemic across the face

42
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
of the entire planet.
That's what.

43
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,791
Shibungi?! I thought
you were dead!

44
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:26,250
I am quite alive. Shu.
Take this. Gai instructed me

45
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,166
to give it to you.

46
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,083
Isn't that?

47
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,666
The diary of Dr. Kurosu Ouma.

48
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,333
That's my father's?

49
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,000
They have the right to know
the truth before they die,

50
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:43,125
and the onus to comprehend
it. Especially Shu.

51
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,208
I can't imagine you would
want it any other way.

52
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,625
After all, weren't you Kurosu
Ouma's best friend, Father?

53
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,625
Best friend, huh? There was a
time I thought of him that way.

54
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,833
So long ago, back in the
days of my graduate studies

55
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,500
at Tennozu College. My only
relationship at that time

56
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,416
was with my academic pursuits,
and other people were

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,625
nothing but
annoyances. However.

58
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,416
Keido! Your paper is
a thing of true beauty!

59
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,458
Your work has literally
moved me to tears!

60
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,208
When I first met him,
the young Kurosu Ouma.

61
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,750
He opened my eyes to the world.
I realized there were others

62
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,625
who could operate on the same
level of conceptual abstraction

63
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,791
that I did. Others I
could argue theory with

64
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,541
and compete against.

65
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,125
We challenged each other.
It wasn't long before

66
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,833
the Genomic Resonance theory
Kurosu constructed on

67
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,166
the basis of my Intron
RAM Hypothesis commanded

68
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,375
worldwide attention as
the key to unlocking

69
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,250
the mysteries of evolution
and natural selection.

70
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,458
Kurosu! Look!
Your paper was pub-

71
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,250
Saeko Shijou. A renowned
student of the college's

72
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,333
medical school. Little did
I know, she was already

73
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,125
carrying Kurosu's
first child. Before long,

74
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,250
the two were married.
They relocated to Oshima

75
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,625
to be close to her family.

76
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,041
Five years later, fate struck.

77
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,375
Shuichiro! Check this out!

78
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,750
Amino acid bonding?!
The reading.

79
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,333
It's a Genomic
Resonance reaction!

80
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,958
My little Mana's the one
who found the meteorite.

81
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,375
She's the one we
should be thanking.

82
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,791
I was right, this is a virus.
It's not very infectious

83
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:58,208
on its own, although, when it's
activated by Genomic Resonance.

84
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,416
It inserts itself into the
introns, replicates like crazy,

85
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,000
and causes
structural sclerosis.

86
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,333
Wait, are you saying?

87
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,583
It's an instrument that plays
the notes of Genomic Resonance.

88
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a trumpet of
the Apocalypse.

89
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,458
She's progressing nicely,
isn't she?

90
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,833
Who are you?

91
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,583
My name is Yu.
I represent Daath.

92
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,458
Daath?

93
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,541
The meteorite Mana
discovered has planted

94
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,291
the seeds of Apocalypse
across this island nation.

95
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,291
Once the seeds are fertilized,
the people of your country

96
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,000
will serve as the hosts
of their germination.

97
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,166
Mana's maturation into Eve
will serve as the catalyst.

98
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,541
And it will start.
The fourth Apocalypse.

99
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,916
The natural selection and
subsequent evolution

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,083
of all life. To put
it in other words,

101
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:03,083
Apocalypse is god's discerning
hand. Divine providence.

102
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,583
Kurosu, I've been
informed that your wife

103
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,541
is already deeply symptomatic.
But you must spare the life

104
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:15,041
of her unborn child.
He is our future.

105
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:19,500
It seems that Eve is intent
to declare him as her Adam.

106
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,083
His warnings were heeded
and Shu Ouma was born.

107
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,791
But at the cost of
his own mother's life.

108
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:40,208
Eve had chosen her
Adam. In other words,

109
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,416
Kurosu's children were set to be
the progenitors of our future.

110
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,666
His malformed genes would shape
the next generation of Earth.

111
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,791
When I realized that,
something inside me broke.

112
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,833
Kurosu has refused
to work with me.

113
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,541
I'd like to know
where you stand, Shuichiro.

114
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Start talking.

115
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,791
Another illegal immigrant?

116
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,833
Or perhaps the victim of
human trafficking. He was

117
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,958
the only one found alive.

118
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:27,916
You're awake. Well, boy,
from this point forward,

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,291
you can think of me
as your father.

120
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,625
Keido took custody as he
said he would, but only

121
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,708
to treat me as a lab rat.
He took me to a facility.

122
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,291
A place filled with boys
suffering his attempts to find

123
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,291
a mate for Mana.
A hellish nursery of sorts.

124
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
Experiment after experiment.

125
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
We were pumped
full of Apocalypse.

126
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,791
Each dose stronger than the
last. Until finally, I ran.

127
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,166
Triton.

128
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,250
You must've come from the ocean.
So we'll call you Triton.

129
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,500
It's a pretty cool name, right?

130
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,208
Ironic, isn't it? My desperate
attempt to escape the fate

131
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,541
that Keido had devised for me
landed me in the epicenter

132
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:30,833
of his grand design.
You understand that.

133
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,541
Don't you, Shu?

134
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,083
Wow. I haven't
seen you in a while.

135
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,625
Uhhh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't hear you come in.

136
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,333
You're one of my
new grad students?

137
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,041
It's nice to meet you.

138
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,541
Well, we've kinda met
before. I used to bring you

139
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,708
blankets whenever I found
you passed out in your lab.

140
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,125
Huh?

141
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,291
I'm Shuichiro Keido's little
sister. Name's Haruka.

142
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
Oh! How rude of me!

143
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,083
I had skipped my senior year and
only recently started college.

144
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,708
Just a typical smart ass
with no real life experience.

145
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,625
To put it lightly, I was
curious about Kurosu.

146
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,791
He had left his children in
Oshima to focus on his research.

147
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,666
Sometimes he'd forget to eat or
sleep when he was hard at work.

148
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,791
In my eyes, he was a
martyr taking on the virus

149
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,708
all by himself.

150
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,083
I've decided. I'm
gonna marry Kurosu.

151
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,458
Kurosu? You are?

152
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,125
He needs me. He's such
a lonely person.

153
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,625
You know that, right?
You're his rival, after all.

154
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,291
I'm sure you must have noticed.

155
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,833
Do whatever you want.

156
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,500
Well thanks for
the encouragement.

157
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:21,208
How's his research coming along?
Any progress on the virus?

158
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,458
A hell of a lot more than you've
made, I can promise you that.

159
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,333
He told me himself.

160
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,333
And later that year, I did
just what I said I would.

161
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,166
I married Kurosu and brought
his children to live with us,

162
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,416
including the boy he'd adopted.
We were going to spend

163
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,333
our first Christmas
together as a family.

164
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:48,291
But Fate had other
plans. December 24th.

165
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,416
Two Thousand Twenty-Nine.

166
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,791
Papa sure is late.

167
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,541
And where is Shu?

168
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,333
He and Triton are on
their way. He sent me

169
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,416
a text message earlier.
Why don't you go get Papa?

170
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,916
I don't mind staying here to
wait for Shu. Papa probably got

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,083
caught up in his research
and lost track of time.

172
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,708
Well. Are you
sure you'll be okay?

173
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,958
Uh huh.

174
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,708
The Apocalypse Virus
attacks the heart first,

175
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,625
crystalizing it and producing
a rampant cellular meiosis.

176
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,958
But my research has lead me to a
genetic code that may be able

177
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,791
to suppress and
contain the process.

178
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:46,125
I've named this miracle code
the Void Genome.

179
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,250
The Void Genome focuses the
random and capricious nature

180
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,791
of the seeds' selection
process by exteriorizing and

181
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,125
giving corporeal
form to the heart.

182
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,666
So the Apocalypse
is not divine providence.

183
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,833
We can prevent it
with human intelligence.

184
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,875
That's a dirty hobby
you've got there, Shuichiro.

185
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
Peeking into other
people's private journals.

186
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,250
Kurosu. So you've
really done it.

187
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,208
You've unraveled the virus.
Without anyone's help,

188
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,541
you've broken the
mysteries of evolution.

189
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,666
I'm a little surprised,
to be honest.

190
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,375
You realize Daath is out of
patience with you, right?

191
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,000
You need to present
this research to them.

192
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,625
Let me negotiate
with them for you.

193
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,208
We can work together
on this, Kurosu.

194
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,916
No. That's really
not necessary.

195
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,708
Other facilities may prefer to
work as a team, but I'm beyond

196
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,458
that at this point. Too
many cooks in the kitchen.

197
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,791
It would only
dilute my thinking.

198
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,625
You think I'm a fool!

199
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,583
Where'd that come from?

200
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm just another ignorant
cook who will ruin

201
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,458
your precious recipe,
is that what you're saying?!

202
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,458
No, I didn't mean that!
I'm thinking about you.

203
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,708
I don't wanna put my friend
in the same jeopardy I'm in.

204
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,750
Don't give me that bullshit! You
were jealous of my success.

205
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,291
Everything you've done is to try
to make me look foolish. Yes!

206
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,166
You forged all of
your results, didn't you?!

207
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,291
You sound like a mad man.
Tell me, what reason could I

208
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,125
possibly have to be
jealous of you?

209
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,916
You've got me there.
And I admit it, Kurosu.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,125
You're every bit the
genius people claim.

211
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,375
But there is one thing
that you're wrong about.

212
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,125
I'm not your friend. You've
always been my enemy.

213
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:00,958
Kurosu!

214
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,000
Noooooooooo!

215
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,875
Looks like
my guess was correct.

216
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,208
Your Void can temporarily
contain the Voids of others.

217
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,125
Not only that, it's capable
of isolating and absorbing

218
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,416
the cancer cells. It actually
consumes the entire strain

219
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
of the Apocalypse Virus.

220
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:39,250
That's great. That must mean
Souta's fully cured then.

221
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,291
Please listen to me, Shu!

222
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,958
You can't use
that power anymore!

223
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:48,333
I know how determined you are
to get Inori back from Gai,

224
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,125
but there's a good chance
that it might be too late.

225
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,041
You didn't know this, but
they've already succeeded

226
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,541
in transplanting Mana's
consciousness into Inori.

227
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,250
In fact. All they need
to complete the process

228
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,458
is to find the genetic
fragments that were scattered

229
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,875
on Lost Christmas. They
have to collect the shards

230
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,000
of her that were absorbed by
other people's Voids that day.

231
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,333
You weren't aware of it,
but that's what they had

232
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,166
tricked you into doing
these last few months

233
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,666
She's whole now. She's retained
every bit of her lost power.

234
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,583
All of it. That's why Gai
is setting deadlines.

235
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,125
I understand what you're saying,
but that's all the more reason

236
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,291
I should go. Wouldn't you say?

237
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,875
Shu.

238
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,208
The choppers are fueled up
and ready to take off.

239
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,125
You are coming
with us. Right, Shu?

240
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,833
Connect those cables!

241
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,708
Yeah, the APUs,
they're hooked up!

242
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,500
Cargo comin' through!

243
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,375
It's almost time for them to
get going. Hey. Are you sure

244
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,958
you wanna leave things like
this with him, Souta?

245
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,125
Hey, Shu.

246
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,250
Now that everyone's gathered
together, I've made up my mind.

247
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,333
I'm giving you your Voids back.

248
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,500
You're doing what?

249
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,333
Hold on, Shu. That will
deplete your Void

250
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
and leave you
powerless, won't it?

251
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,041
I have to give them back.
I can't risk my life like this

252
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,208
while in possession of them.
If I die, they will too.

253
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,833
Don't worry. I can still
hold onto the symptoms

254
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,541
of the virus. You too,
Ayase. Come here.

255
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,875
But.

256
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,750
Hey! Screw that, man!
Yesterday you made a big deal

257
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,583
about how much you needed
them, and now you wanna

258
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,625
give 'em back? How the hell
do you expect to fight

259
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,166
without 'em?!

260
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,125
I've got enough strength in
my arm to aim a gun, don't I?

261
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,333
That's insane! You don't
honestly believe you can

262
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,625
defeat Gai that way. Think!

263
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,041
The only priority I have
right now is saving Inori

264
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,541
and stopping the virus.
Defeating Gai is

265
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,750
an afterthought. Is there
anything wrong with that?

266
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,916
I want you to keep
my Void when you go.

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,541
If you were to fail
for some reason,

268
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,416
all of our lives
would be forfeit anyway.

269
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,041
Yep. That about sums it up.

270
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,125
I have to say,
I agree with Ayase, Souta?

271
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,791
What do you think?

272
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,750
It's fine. I never
asked for it back.

273
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,333
Not that I understand it.
But I guess it's fine.

274
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,916
What the hell, just keep it!

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,583
I am; I'm not trying
to give it back.

276
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,416
I just wanna shake
hands with you, Souta.

277
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,625
We have to shake
hands to make up.

278
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,291
You're the one who told me
that. We can't say goodbye

279
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,583
and just leave things like
this. I refuse to do that.

280
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,291
Your hand. I'm sorry, Shu.

281
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,916
It's not your fault, Souta.

282
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,041
I was. I was scared of you.
I hated feeling like that.

283
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,125
It sucked!

284
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,791
I was scared of me too.

285
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,750
Just promise me, Shu, that
you'll always be my friend.

286
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,458
No matter what.

287
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,916
Of course. Of course we're
friends. And for the rest

288
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,666
of our lives. Nothing
will change that.

289
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,875
Kurosu could do
anything by himself.

290
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,541
He thrived in isolation.
But it's not that he wanted

291
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:16,625
to be alone. In truth,
he was a very lonely man

292
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:22,208
because of it. He knew the
importance of being with people.

293
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:26,500
And that's why he named you
"Shu". It means "together".
