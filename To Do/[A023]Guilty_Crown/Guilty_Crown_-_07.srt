1
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,208
Keep life going.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,833
For the sake
of new lives to come--

3
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,833
I haven't taken the monorail
to school in a while.

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:24,250
Huh, feels like I spent way
longer with Funeral Parlor

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:29,583
than I actually did. I got to
go back. But I don't want to.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,041
Look who's back, guys! Mister
"I got arrested by the GHQ."

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,166
I heard about him.
Hiromi saw it all go down!

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,541
Looks totally guilty.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,666
Come on, just ignore them.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,916
Better watch out!
Dude's a criminal, Inori!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,916
No telling what
he might do to you!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,625
Care to show me
the evidence you've compiled?

13
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,291
Oh wait, that's right, you
don't have any proof, do you?

14
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,041
So just drop it!

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666
You're back, Shu!

16
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,541
I hope the GHQ took
it easy on you in there.

17
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,875
I'm sure that the debriefing
process was a real nuisance.

18
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,625
But it's our duty to help
the government, right?

19
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,916
Yeah, totally!
Turns out I found

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,833
a cell phone that
some GHQ guy had lost, so.

21
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,125
Well, then. I trust this will
put an end to those rumors

22
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,500
that've been making the rounds.
If anyone does give you grief--

23
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,958
Shu!

24
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,000
They finally let your ass
outta jail, huh buddy?

25
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,083
Spill, dude, how was
your time in the big house?

26
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,625
They interrogated you, didn't
they? What's the food like?

27
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,250
Was it Japanese,
or like burgers and junk?

28
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,125
Uh. Japanese.

29
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Hey Shu? I just have to ask.

30
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,875
The guys in prison,
did they try anything

31
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,000
while you were in there?

32
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,125
Huh?

33
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,791
Do you see any
badass soldiers there?

34
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,875
Tell me you saw some Endlaves!

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,958
--Were you scared?
--Were you cuffed?

36
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,291
Come on, everybody! Let's
use our inside voices, yeah?

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,833
Safe to say, no one
will bother you anymore.

38
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,833
So it seems.

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,916
Hey.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,750
Thank you, for helping me out
like that. It means a lot to me.

41
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,875
Oh, don't mention it.
Just doing my job

42
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,583
as student council
president, that's all.

43
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,708
Arisa Kuhouin can stop
by our class anytime!

44
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,458
Her grandpa's the head of the
Kuhouin Group, so she's rich.

45
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,875
Plus she's clearly a fox
from top to bottom.

46
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,541
Got a kick-ass personality
and she's smart.

47
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,583
So, here's the World History
homework you missed.

48
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,041
And this folder is all
Infection Control stuff.

49
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,958
A little bit of a yawn, but.

50
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,958
Thanks a lot, Hare.
You're pretty darn awesome,

51
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,416
you know that?

52
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,250
It's nothing.

53
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,833
Man. yeah. I forgot
all about that I.C. exam.

54
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,541
Hey, Shu.

55
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,583
You seem kind of, different.

56
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,791
Yeah? Like how?

57
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,875
Oh, but first.

58
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,375
Has anybody heard from Yahiro?
I mean, I heard he hasn't

59
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,416
been to school since
the day I got picked up.

60
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,625
Do you know where he is?

61
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,416
Why do you care?
Yahiro betrayed you.

62
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,458
That's a good question.

63
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
Shu, honey! Are you here?

64
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,291
Haruka!

65
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,125
"Haruka?"

66
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,541
You gotta hide!

67
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,375
I'm ho--

68
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,625
Well!

69
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you? What'd you do,
strip in the hall?

70
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,916
Well hello to you, too.
What happened to,

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,791
"Hi Mom, glad to see you!"

72
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm glad, but come on!

73
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,958
Chill out, my little prude.

74
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,875
Hello, there! Haruka Ouma.
And who are you?

75
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,083
Inori Yuzuriha, ma'am. Your
son's been letting me stay here.

76
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,333
Yeah, it's not what you think!
She has this mean older brother

77
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,958
and there's nowhere
else for her to go!

78
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,708
So I've been letting
her lay low here!

79
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,083
He's awful. But he acts like
a freaking saint whenever

80
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,208
other people are around.
So, no one knows.

81
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,833
And he's kind of cool.
What am I babbling about?

82
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,916
Uh, let me start over!
Okay, here's the deal!

83
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,541
Son of a bitch!
God, I'm starving!

84
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,625
Huh?

85
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,041
You hungry, Inori?
'Cause I'm buying.

86
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,291
The choices are pizza,
pizza, and pizza.

87
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,708
Ooh, and cake for dessert.
That's happening. Shu.

88
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,125
Go get it, would you?

89
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,375
What, now?

90
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,583
I need more than beer,
silly! You can tell me

91
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,625
the whole story over dinner!

92
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,708
Gai, are you sure
you're okay with Shu

93
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,750
going back to school again?

94
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,250
Better for him
to hide in plain sight.

95
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,000
Inori's there with him,
if nothing else.

96
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
Listen. These last
few missions have left us

97
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,666
dangerously low
in terms of supplies.

98
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,583
We got some money
out of the OAU, didn't we?

99
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,791
The issue's not inadequate
funding. We need a benefactor

100
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,000
to do the purchasing
on our behalf.

101
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,125
Funeral Parlor is
in need of a partner.

102
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,000
There are external
factors at work, sir.

103
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,500
Yes, the Kuhouin Group's
overall market share

104
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,541
is down 25 points
from last year.

105
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,333
But with the GHQ putting Article
301 into effect last month,

106
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,250
we're just lucky
it's not even lower.

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,333
I don't pay you
to feed me excuses.

108
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,166
Next time,
you bring me results.

109
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,916
Arisa, my dear. You'll accompany
me to the party tomorrow.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
With pleasure, Grandfather.

111
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,375
You'll have to deal
with all this backroom

112
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,291
skullduggery someday.
Best see it in action.

113
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,916
You're right, sir.

114
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:23,416
I won't let you down. Such is
my duty, as Arisa Kuhouin.

115
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,875
Good job, kiddo,
she's cute! A little weird,

116
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,125
but whatever.
Something about her

117
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,500
you just want to take
care of, don't you?

118
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,208
Yeah, I do.

119
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,708
It's like. Inori is way
stronger than I am, but.

120
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,583
She can be really
fragile sometimes, too.

121
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,125
Cut it out! Stop being
all clingy and drunk.

122
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,208
Oh, you're too grown up
for hugs? Is that it?

123
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,541
Knock yourself out
I don't care.

124
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,166
Jackpot!

125
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,541
Isn't it gorgeous?
If I wear this dress,

126
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,458
I'm sure to knock them
dead tomorrow night!

127
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,291
I know that I'm new around
here. But I'm sure my gumption

128
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,458
will be knocking you
dead soon enough!

129
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,666
It's all about attitude with
me, men! Go big or go home!

130
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
Uh, I'm not trying
to be disrespectful,

131
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,708
Colonel Eagleman,
but I don't think.

132
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,208
Dan!

133
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,375
"Colonel" is so stuffy, and
I'm tryin' to keep it real!

134
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,916
Just call me Dan!

135
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,708
Colonel Dan, sir, these Dragoons
are surface-to-air missiles.

136
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,125
So, they weren't
exactly designed

137
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,625
to be fired horizontally.

138
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,208
We can do this!

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,125
Flying up takes oomph! But going
sideways should be easier!

140
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,833
You have a target
in mind, or should we

141
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,250
just fire them at will?

142
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,541
Good question, Scarface!
That's what I'm talking about!

143
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,958
It's Segai.

144
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,958
An anti-GHQ Japanese national
is having a fancy party

145
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,041
at sea, fellas! I'd bet my
backside he's sailing out

146
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,958
past quarantined waters to make
some deal with the enemy.

147
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,208
Where exactly
did you get that intel?

148
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,458
Oh, it was an anonymous tip
from a concerned citizen.

149
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,625
Most of you Japanese don't
have a chip on your shoulder.

150
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,000
You realize how totally
screwed you'd be without

151
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,875
the good ol' GHQ
bailing you out!

152
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,416
It's been ten long years
since we ceded control

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,666
of our nation to the GHQ.
Judging by their apathy,

154
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,000
our countrymen are happy
to let this occupation continue.

155
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,791
But Japan is our land. The time
has long since come for us

156
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,083
to stand on our own two feet
and hold our heads high!

157
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,083
You seem a bit nervous, Shu.

158
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,125
Of course I'm nervous!
You called me about this

159
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,916
at the absolute last minute!

160
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,916
Should've declined.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,458
Yeah that would
have gone over well.

162
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,875
So, what are we doing here?

163
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,333
There's someone with whom I
wish to speak. But they don't

164
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,708
make themselves available
to the public very often.

165
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,125
And you figured
we'd just party-crash

166
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,625
and force ourselves on him?

167
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,458
In a nutshell, yeah.

168
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,833
I didn't think you'd do me
the honor of coming tonight.

169
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,333
Did you tell Keido about this?

170
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,833
No.

171
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:24,333
After all, what took place
is in part my responsibility.

172
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:29,500
What happened was tragic.
But it was just an accident.

173
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,750
Haruka?

174
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,250
I didn't know this was the party
she needed that dress for!

175
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,083
Sorry about that.

176
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,250
Shu Ouma? What on earth
are you doing here?

177
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,583
Gotta go!

178
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,791
Wait a second!

179
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,541
Gai!

180
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,916
I'm tagging out! Bye!

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,833
Shu Ouma, stop running
this instant!

182
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,833
Step aside. Or can't
you see I'm in a hurry?

183
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,541
I'm sorry. You reminded me
of a childhood friend.

184
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,041
Is that so?

185
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,166
Indeed. She was my
beloved Catherine.

186
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,833
The best pet armadillo
a boy ever had.

187
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,208
You really do remind me so much
of her, the adorable way she'd

188
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,000
curl up into a tight little ball
to protect herself from danger.

189
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,708
You deserve better than having
to serve as a GHQ errand-boy.

190
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,625
Not at all, sir. The Leucocyte
Plan has been foiled;

191
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,666
after all, it's only natural
that the Anti Bodies

192
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,291
be disbanded for now.

193
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,083
What about Daryl and Rowan?

194
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Should've run when
they had the chance.

195
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,916
Now they're stuck
helping the quarterback

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,958
with his little game plan.

197
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,916
The Dragoons are ready
to be fired sideways, sir.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,125
Right on, guys!
That was some good hustle!

199
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,416
And call me Dan, remember?

200
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,416
You have got to be kidding me!

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,791
Where's our target?

202
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,541
It's en route from
Point L-11 to Point R-22,

203
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,041
just like your
anonymous tipster said.

204
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm Haruka, Sephirah Genomics.
It's a pleasure.

205
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,750
I've never seen her doing
anything work-related before.

206
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,291
Shu! You got to find Gai! GHQ
SAMs are locking onto the ship!

207
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,791
What's a SAM?

208
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,916
Tactical missiles! One hit
and everyone on board is dead!

209
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,208
Haruka!

210
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,916
You have to
get off that thing now!

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,375
There should be life rafts!
Grab Gai and run for it!

212
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,958
No way!

213
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,875
If I run, what happens to all
the other people on the ship?

214
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,125
It's not on you to save them!

215
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,833
She's right. And what
could you possibly do?

216
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,458
We'll figure something out.
We don't have a choice!

217
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,541
I don't recall sending
you an invitation,

218
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,041
Gai Tsutsugami
of Funeral Parlor.

219
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,625
I trust that it was
nothing more than

220
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,458
a harmless oversight
on your part.

221
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,958
Do you, now.

222
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,291
I come to you with
a proposition. To save Japan.

223
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,416
Gai!

224
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,791
Excuse me.

225
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,125
Tsugumi just told me
that GHQ missiles

226
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,416
are locking onto the ship!

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,583
They want us dead that badly?

228
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,666
Give me your orders,
Gai! I'm not going

229
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,458
to let them kill
all these people!

230
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,833
Meet me up on the quarterdeck.
I'll be there in five.

231
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,250
I'll be there. Understood!

232
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,166
Hold on to your ass,
traitor! You just messed with

233
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,333
the wrong colonel!
Ready! Fire!

234
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,291
I will save them!

235
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,583
Miss Arisa? Might I have
the pleasure of this dance?

236
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,041
Ignore him;
I'm the better dancer.

237
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,666
Hah! That's nonsense.

238
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,291
Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

239
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,208
Sorry, gents!
Her dance-card just filled up.

240
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,333
Less than a minute till impact!

241
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,083
Let go of me! I've never met
a ruder man in all of my life!

242
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,500
Many thanks. It's good to know
I'm making an impression.

243
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,791
Just who are you?

244
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,041
Close your eyes.

245
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,791
For my next trick. I'll cast
a spell on you. One that will

246
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,250
allow you to become
your true self.

247
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,333
My true self?

248
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,791
Yes, the one you hide away.

249
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,125
I'm going to count down
from three. And then,

250
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:56,125
you will open your eyes.
Three, two, one. Voila!

251
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,916
Ouma?

252
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,583
I'm sorry!

253
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,666
It's about to hit!

254
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,875
The missile has!
Wait, it's gone!

255
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,416
Come again?!

256
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,333
Impossible! Something must
be wrong with the sensors.

257
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,666
We just weren't gung-ho enough!

258
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,875
What?

259
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,291
Only one thing to do!
This time we'll just

260
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,333
have to fire them all!

261
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,041
All?

262
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,458
Right! Time for some
piss and vinegar!

263
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,541
Fire!

264
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,791
You've got more
Dragoons inbound!

265
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,458
One, two--scratch
that! A ton of them!

266
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,125
Copy!

267
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,250
I'm on it!

268
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,750
There is the shield
of a coward.

269
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,041
That protects
the frightened heart.

270
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,000
That is your Void, Arisa.
Your flaw and triumph.

271
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,958
Hey, guys!

272
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,750
Why aren't you firing, huh?

273
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,583
There's nothing left, to fire.

274
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,708
I admit, your claims of being
able to defend against

275
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,458
a second-order
Leucocyte were valid.

276
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,375
That live demonstration
of yours is hard to argue with.

277
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,291
Very well, you have a deal.

278
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you very much, sir. I'll
inform Gai of your decision.

279
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,750
Good news for once.
The Kuhouin Group has agreed

280
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,916
to facilitate the routing
of our supplies within Japan.

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
All right!

282
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,000
So I can plug
into Steiner again?

283
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey guys, we still don't
know how the GHQ heard

284
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,750
about that party on
the boat to start with.

285
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,458
It was an anonymous tip
from a concerned citizen.

286
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,500
Huh?

287
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,083
Concerned that they wouldn't
take the bait if we didn't

288
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,791
hand it to them,
that is. Well played, Gai.

289
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,250
You got a bit woozy
and fainted up on deck.

290
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,791
Do you remember anything?

291
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,916
No, but thank you for being
enough of a gentleman

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,416
to bring me here.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,875
You talk in your sleep,
you know?

294
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,666
Eavesdropping? A true gentleman
would never do that!

295
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,291
Just terrible at this sort
of thing, aren't you?

296
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,083
At what? In all I do, I've been
trained to be the very best!

297
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,916
What am I terrible at?

298
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,375
At letting people near you.

299
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,708
Have fun at school!

300
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,041
Hey! Would you get back
in the apartment already,

301
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,000
you're half naked!

302
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,375
Okay!

303
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,583
Why does she do that?

304
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,458
You enjoy each other,
don't you?

305
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,791
Huh?

306
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,250
Right? You two have fun.

307
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey, Inori?

308
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,583
You know for the first time,
I'm kind of glad that

309
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,125
I can pull out Voids.

310
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,666
Good.

311
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,875
I promise. I'll protect Shu.
Just like you'd want me to.
