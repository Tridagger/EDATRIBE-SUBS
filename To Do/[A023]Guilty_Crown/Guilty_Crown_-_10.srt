1
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,125
You know the plan, people.
Shu will attack them with

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:24,583
Inori's Void. Once he does, we
seize that second truck ASAP.

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,875
The target will reach
the attack point in

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:33,708
six, five, four,
three, two, one!

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,916
Go!

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,833
Shu, engage them!

7
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,375
Get your ass in gear already!
They're going to see us!

8
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,791
Just pull the Void!

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:49,791
I can't!

10
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,333
Dammit! They're onto us!

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,166
Shu! What's wrong? Talk to me!

12
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,166
If you don't move, they're dead!

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,750
We need you right now!

14
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,083
Please, Shu.

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,083
No, come back!

16
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,125
All units, this is Gai!
Abort the mission! Repeat!

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,791
Abort the mission!

18
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:55,333
Blooming wildflower--

19
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,833
Tell me, Shu, do you love me?

20
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,708
Course I do!

21
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,333
Then promise me, that you'll
make your big sister happy.

22
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:14,833
Summer's sun clouded over,
the wind streamed by.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:22,000
The two overlapped.

24
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,250
Hey! Are you awake?
I'm coming up!

25
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,750
Rise and shine, Shu!
Did you sleep okay?

26
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,416
Yeah.

27
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,125
Here!

28
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,250
I grabbed you a breakfast
sandwich on the way,

29
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,958
does that sound all right?

30
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,000
I got to admit,
you surprised me yesterday.

31
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,208
You know, messaging
me for help and all.

32
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,166
I guess you're not going
to tell me what's wrong, huh.

33
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,500
What could be so terrible that
you don't want to go home?

34
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,333
Maybe you can tell me
later, if you want?

35
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,791
Going to answer?

36
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,291
I see.

37
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,833
No. Leave him be for the moment.

38
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,291
Damn that Shu.

39
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,708
Sorry to have made you wait.

40
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,583
Hello again, Mr. Tsutsugami.
It's been a while.

41
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,875
Please, call me Gai.

42
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,458
There's no need to be
so formal with each other.

43
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,416
Interesting reading. Truth be
told, I'd never have guessed

44
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,250
that you were
his son, young man.

45
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,541
Whose son is he?

46
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,875
Knowing that, I put
this question to you.

47
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,166
What's your angle?
Why are you fighting?

48
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,750
What's worth risking
life and limb for?

49
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,291
It's all for a girl, of course.

50
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,083
She's the reason I do this,
to hold her close.

51
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,000
Is that good enough for you?

52
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:30,708
Liberating Japan to impress some
girl, are you? I'll be damned.

53
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,875
The stolen rock will arrive
in Haneda the day after next.

54
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,333
From the looks of things,
Yan will send it overseas

55
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,125
at the first opportunity.

56
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,125
In every sense, that stone
belongs to the Japanese people.

57
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,250
Wouldn't you agree, young man?

58
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,208
Yes, sir. We'll keep
it here, no matter what.

59
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,125
Who would've thought,
this rock envied the world over?

60
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:00,583
Would just fall into my hands
as though preordained.

61
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,708
Men have been catapulted
into the White House

62
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,708
by far less than this, my dear.

63
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,291
Such ambition, Emily. I like it.

64
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,958
Still, I wonder what Keido's
playing at. He steals this,

65
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,458
and then instead
of running for it,

66
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,791
he waltzes straight
into custody?

67
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,916
Welcome back! I'm really glad
you're coming to school again!

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,041
I mean, you couldn't
just ditch forever.

69
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,250
And school's not
so bad! Is it?

70
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,916
Inori's out today, right?

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,125
Yo!

72
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,916
Look who finally came!
So where've you been

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,166
hiding out lately, huh loser?

74
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,125
I, uh!

75
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,333
Oh, I'm sorry! Are you okay?

76
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
Yeah, I'm fine.

77
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,708
Oh no!

78
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,208
Shu! Are you okay?
What happened?

79
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,625
I'll go get you some water.
You wait here.

80
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,000
What the hell is your problem?

81
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,541
Ayase.

82
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,791
I can't do this. I'm out.

83
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,458
Are you hearing yourself?
One terminally ill kid dies,

84
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,500
and you're willing to throw in
the towel, just like that?

85
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,750
I was sure I could hack it.
I mean, I have changed.

86
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:47,666
I thought I could be all
ruthless, like Gai. But--

87
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,875
I'm not ruthless. I'm not Gai.
I'm just Shu Ouma.

88
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,791
You want to play the
self-pity card? Run away?

89
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,375
How can you quit on us?
There's work to do!

90
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
Ayase, enough!

91
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,916
Don't do this, Gai!
I know he'll come around!

92
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,875
We found the rock. And
you're going to help us get

93
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:18,833
our hands on it. Quit your
whining and stand up. Now!

94
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,166
This isn't my fight!

95
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,375
Shu!

96
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,083
It never was!
I didn't ask for this power!

97
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,500
It was an accident!
A mistake!

98
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,458
I've heard it said, that the
Void Genom can be harvested

99
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,625
if its host dies. I wonder?

100
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,958
You're dead to me, Shu. I never
want to lay eyes on you again!

101
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,625
Inori will be coming home.

102
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,791
You're such a coward!
How'd I ever delude myself

103
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,708
into thinking you
were one of us?

104
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,083
So, you're still here?

105
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:26,583
Hey, uh, listen can we stay
in touch? I could call.

106
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,791
Here.

107
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,625
This is a brand new song.
I'd really like for you

108
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,458
to listen to it, Shu.

109
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,416
Shu.

110
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,708
Shu.

111
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,625
Monster!

112
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,333
I'm sorry! I--!

113
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,375
Please, just don't.

114
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,833
It doesn't matter. Goodbye.

115
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:17,250
She's the reason I tried
so hard to be like him.

116
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:22,666
But that isn't what I want.
So I guess it's better this way.

117
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,125
It's over. I'm back to normal.

118
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,083
I should be relieved.

119
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,458
Inori, how do I forget you?

120
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,041
Major General Yan is
heading home for a little while,

121
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,708
and he's taking some
top-secret stuff with him!

122
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,625
It's our job to make sure
that bird gets airborne!

123
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,625
Let's do this thing! Booyah!

124
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,875
The Major General should be
taking the stage any moment now.

125
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,125
--Daryl, I know--
--Excuse us.

126
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,875
I'm doing this more and more.
Am I running out of time?

127
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,000
Gai?

128
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,000
Tell me something.
Am I a monster?

129
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:24,750
Did Shu call you one? It doesn't
matter. Unless you love him?

130
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:36,541
Do I love him, Gai? This
feeling I have, could that be

131
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:41,208
what it is? Could it be love?

132
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,375
So, in the end
you choose him, too.

133
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,500
For now, just survive.

134
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,708
We'll talk about it
again later.

135
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,541
Excuse me, sir?

136
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,000
Dammit, Keido, what in
the hell were you thinking?

137
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,166
Using Kurosu's ID
to steal that rock,

138
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,083
and then handing
it over to Yan?

139
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,083
Seriously, do you have anything
to say in your own defense?

140
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,916
I saw a familiar face on the
island. They grow up so fast,

141
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,125
don't they?

142
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,083
Don't you drag him into it!

143
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,958
It's too late for that.
He has the king's power,

144
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,500
that boy of yours.

145
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,291
Oh, no, Shu!
He has the Void Genome?

146
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,375
There's more, my dear.
Seems he's thick as thieves

147
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,041
with Funeral Parlor.

148
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,375
All thanks to that
girl, Inori Yuzuriha.

149
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,416
Tell me, did you really think
a beauty of her caliber

150
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,708
was with your son by some
coincidence of the heart?

151
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,833
It's time.

152
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,083
All right. Take the door!

153
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,458
We'll reach Point B
in 30 seconds.

154
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,000
Gotcha!

155
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,208
Just remember I can't control
all of the security cameras

156
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,541
past there,
so be careful, okay?

157
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,500
All units listen up!

158
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,583
We only have thirty minutes
until that transport

159
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,250
is airborne.

160
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,333
My team will seize
the plane within that window.

161
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,416
After we announce the seizure,
the Endlave unit will

162
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,583
take the field and back us up.

163
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,416
Got it?

164
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,000
Affirmative!

165
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,416
Aye-aye!

166
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,666
You dragged me out here,
so you better get this right.

167
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,000
That's the idea.

168
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,541
Major General Yan, sir!
Have yourself a good flight!

169
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,208
I assume the plane
is ready for us, Colonel?

170
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,166
Yes sir! Everything's
been prepared for you

171
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,875
by the exceedingly
gung-ho Major Segai!

172
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,958
Be a dear and switch
the camera to G7.

173
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,000
Begging your pardon, sir, but
there's no such channel as G7.

174
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,666
Usually, you'd be right.
But wouldn't you know

175
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,458
I just so happened
to set one up.

176
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,625
Let's see.

177
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,333
Bingo.

178
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,958
Are we ready for broadcast?

179
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,000
All systems are go.
It'll play on every

180
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,125
GHQ-controlled transmitter
in the city, Major.

181
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,500
Thank you for that.

182
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,791
This is Major Segai speaking.
All you members of my

183
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,125
much-maligned Anti Bodies,
take Vaccine D now.

184
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:37,041
I repeat: All members of my
much maligned Anti Bodies,

185
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,500
self-administer Vaccine D.

186
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,583
Hostiles!

187
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,041
I trust this will suffice? I'm
nothing if not thorough, Chief.

188
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
Don't come crying to me later.

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,083
How're they doing?

190
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,458
They've boarded the plane.
So far, so good.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,625
Something's not right here. But
it's too late to back out now.

192
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,208
It's unmanned!
What the hell's going on?

193
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,833
Gai Tsutsugami! I'm sending
you straight to heaven!

194
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,125
What's all this
commotion, Colonel?

195
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,916
What is this?

196
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,166
I was actually kind of enjoying
the lecture, you know.

197
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Classic lit. For some reason
I find that stuff fascinating.

198
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,458
I didn't know.

199
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,000
Then you haven't
been listening!

200
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,083
Huh?

201
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,291
I want to be close
to you. Please.

202
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:50,458
It's okay. I mean.
You love me, don't you, Hare?

203
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,541
Shu!

204
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,041
Hare!

205
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,458
Look, I'm sorry!

206
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,416
For what?

207
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,291
What are you apologizing for?
I want to hear you say it!

208
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,250
I, uh--

209
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,625
You don't even know! I'm not
some cardboard cutout, Shu!

210
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,708
I'm a person! You can't prop
me up in the empty spot

211
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,500
where Inori used to be!

212
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,791
No, I didn't mean to--

213
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,041
Just because you can
pull stuff out of people,

214
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,583
it doesn't mean people
are objects, Shu!

215
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:30,166
Yeah, I saw it. I watched you
pull some scissory thing out

216
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,583
of Yahiro's chest and use
it to take down an Endlave.

217
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,125
I felt so bad for you
when I saw it happen.

218
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,583
I can't imagine what it's like
to carry a burden like that.

219
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,291
But that doesn't mean
you get to be cruel!

220
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,583
The Shu I love would
never be so heartless!

221
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm sorry, Hare.

222
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,500
Please forgive me.

223
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,791
That feeling. What is it?

224
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,458
Do you hear that?

225
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,250
Dammit! The control
column isn't responding!

226
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
Quick, Tsugumi! Block the
remote control function!

227
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,083
Yeah, give me a sec!

228
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,583
There, she's all yours!

229
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,375
This is genomic resonance!
Don't tell me one of those

230
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,583
jackbooted thugs
activated the stone?

231
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,541
Help me!

232
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,583
I've been sent
to escort you out.

233
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,458
Chief Keido.

234
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,750
Gai!

235
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,083
Argo! Look out!

236
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,500
Aya, run for it!

237
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,875
People are going to die because
of you! Why would you do this?

238
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:24,791
To grant mankind a future.
Now, let us begin, or rather;

239
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,625
finish what we started
on that fateful Christmas!

240
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:38,250
I haven't felt
like this since. Oh no!

241
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,250
Somebody make it stop!
This isn't the right song!

242
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:52,083
If it plays for much longer,
she's going to wake up.

243
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,000
What a naughty man you
are, Shuichiro. Don't you

244
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:12,250
know better? Of course, I find
this all quite entertaining.

245
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,416
Stop it!
