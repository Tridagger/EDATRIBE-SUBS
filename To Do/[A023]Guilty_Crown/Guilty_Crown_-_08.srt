1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,416
Shu, honey! Be all manly,
would you? Wait a sec!

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
What are you
packing that bag for?

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,416
How many times
do I have to say it?

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,250
The AV Club is going on a trip.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,208
Huh? That does ring
a bell. A little one.

6
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,500
You're sure you told me?

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,875
No, you're psychic.

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,083
I'm not going to be
back home for a while, okay?

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,416
What? You're running off
to leave me all by myself?

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,375
Stop being all co-dependent!

11
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,708
You don't want me to die
of loneliness, do you?

12
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,208
Guess I'd better pack
a bag and come along, huh!

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,708
Are you trying
to break my neck?

14
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:57,291
Did you hear, Inori? Shu's
abandoning me! His own mother!

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,375
Huh?

16
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,375
Enough with the
clingy-mom sleeper-hold!

17
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,375
You're going to Oshima.
See? I remember.

18
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,666
Yeah.

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,041
Well then.

20
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,916
Have fun. And go
say hi to your dad.

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Welcome to paradise!

22
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,458
It's so beautiful out today!
Nothing but sunshine!

23
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,208
Hey, you sure you're
not pulling our leg

24
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,208
with this whole
"vacation home" thing?

25
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,875
Nah, it's real. I actually lived
out here back when I was a kid.

26
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,833
Yeah? Well thanks, man!

27
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,041
Souta Tamadate?

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,458
You mean the guy in my class?

29
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,083
That's the one.
Bring him to Oshima.

30
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,083
We're going to infiltrate
a GHQ facility there.

31
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,958
We'll need Tamadate's Void
on hand to get through

32
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,666
their security setup.

33
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,166
Of course it's got to be him.

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,666
All you have to do is ask him on
a trip. How hard could that be?

35
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,375
Yeah, I'll do it.

36
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:39,125
That's the spirit. Hey, your
friend will be perfectly safe.

37
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,833
My friend, huh?
Shows what you know, Gai.

38
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,458
This place is the bomb.
It's a full-on mansion!

39
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,750
Yeah, no kidding! What do
your folks do for a living,

40
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,041
anyway Shu?

41
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,666
Hey, why's my
vacation home so big?

42
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,291
The Kuhouin Group told Gai
that we could borrow this one.

43
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,375
There a problem?

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,583
Stop getting all
lovey-dovey, you guys.

45
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,583
Save it for home, would you?

46
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,375
Who says we're
getting lovey-dovey?

47
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,333
Don't play dumb, man!
You know you're shacking up!

48
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,041
Are you saying
they live together?

49
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, I saw them
going home together.

50
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,250
Secret is out, dude!
You're busted! So how'd your

51
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,291
torrid romance begin?
The public wants to know!

52
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,250
Give it a rest! Look, there's
nothing going on between us!

53
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,666
Her older brother's
kind of a jerk,

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
and she needs
a place to crash. So-

55
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,375
Yeah, right. You are
totally full of crap!

56
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,833
The lovebirds need some
privacy, guys! Which means

57
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,708
there's more beach
for me! Come on!

58
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,958
Hey! Shouldn't we
at least unpack?

59
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,458
We didn't come out here
to unpack! You nerds can just

60
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,708
stand around if you want to,
but this bad boy is in

61
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,208
vacation mode!

62
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,916
You get back here, Souta!

63
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,041
Last one in's a rotten egg!

64
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,750
Hurry it up, slowpokes!

65
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,041
Why's he got to be
so ridiculous all the time?

66
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,500
Souta's just being himself.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,750
What's his deal?

68
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,416
Man, Souta drives me nuts.
He's pushy, and loud,

69
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,041
and he's always getting
in people's faces.

70
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,916
If it weren't for this mission
I wouldn't go anywhere with him.

71
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,750
Of course, it isn't all bad.

72
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,541
This is what I get
for not making my move.

73
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,291
You can do it, Hare!

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,916
Heya, Shu!

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,333
I think it's high time
we got in the water already!

76
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,625
Actually, I was just going to.

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,375
Hurry up!

78
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,708
Oh, oh man!

79
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,333
Hare, you got to let go!
Running is hard right now!

80
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,666
Against all odds,
Tamadate seems to have

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,458
made it here in one piece.

82
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,083
Shu's having way too much
fun to be on a mission.

83
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,416
My assignments never
involve bikinis.

84
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,041
A little R&amp;R never hurt
anyone. The real issue

85
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,458
is how we're going to get
around security tonight.

86
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,375
Tsugumi and Ayase are
looking into it as we speak.

87
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,500
And we just cool our jets
in the meantime, huh?

88
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,083
I wonder what kind of
"buried treasure"

89
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,750
we're out here
to dig up, anyway.

90
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,166
"Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to trust in Gai."

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,750
Tell me, Argo.

92
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,583
Yeah?

93
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,041
Aren't you hot in that attire?

94
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,791
Hot and bothered.
Does that count?

95
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,791
No!

96
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,208
Hey, uh, where's Shu?

97
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,833
He headed out before us,
said there was somewhere

98
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,208
he needed to go.

99
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,791
Oh, I forgot. Shu's dad
is buried here on Oshima.

100
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,208
Wheelchair girl!
Is this yours?

101
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,833
Thank you, good sir.

102
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,791
Ta ta, then.

103
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,125
That chick must be way loaded!
She had a maid and everything!

104
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,375
Tsugumi, tell me again
why we're dressed like this?

105
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,833
Your outfit is adorable!
Surely my mistress doesn't

106
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,583
object to that!

107
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,333
Kurosu Ouma was
a brilliant man.

108
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,708
You've heard of him?

109
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,125
Sure, he worked as a professor
at Tennozu College.

110
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,500
And he was the world's
leading expert

111
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,708
on the Apocalypse
Virus when he died.

112
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,583
Wait, are you kidding me?

113
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,916
You don't know
your own father's work?

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,791
We don't really talk about
the past too much, I guess.

115
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,500
I knew he was Haruka's
teacher, but that's about it.

116
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,833
Haruka?

117
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:22,791
Oh. I call my mom by her
first name. To be honest,

118
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:27,916
I hardly remember my dad at all.
I mean he died ten years ago.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,208
During the Lost Christmas?
A lot of lives were

120
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,125
forever changed that day.

121
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,583
Tell me, Gai, what're you
doing up here anyway?

122
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,541
Not visiting anyone.
You here for the view?

123
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,750
Indeed.

124
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,958
Straight ahead.

125
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,750
A shrine gate?

126
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,125
At first glance.

127
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
Trip lasers.

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,208
A GHQ lab is hidden inside. I'm
here to take what lies within.

129
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,791
What would that be exactly?

130
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,750
The rock that started this.

131
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,166
Taking possession of it is our
number one priority right now,

132
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,666
period. You and the Void you can
draw are key to our success.

133
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,916
We can't do this without you.
Or without him.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Because Souta's our
equipment. Yeah, I get it.

135
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,875
The mission begins at 2200
hours. All you have to do

136
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,791
is get him to the rendezvous
point by then and we're good.

137
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,791
You make it sound so easy.

138
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,125
What's so difficult about it?
Just bait your hook properly.

139
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,625
Excuse me?

140
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,208
Souta's an ardent fan
of Egoist, isn't he?

141
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,291
So, Inori's the bait? Is
that what you're suggesting?

142
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,958
But of course. You lure
a person in with whatever

143
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,833
it is they desire.
It's not rocket science.

144
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,875
You can't make her
a bargaining chip!

145
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,458
It's like trying to reason
with a brick wall.

146
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,583
If this is beyond
your capabilities, Shu,

147
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
don't bother showing up.

148
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,458
Hey, wait!

149
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,958
I didn't say that!

150
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,833
I haven't gone on a trip
with friends in forever!

151
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,375
Thanks for coming along, Kanon.
I'm really glad you did!

152
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,958
Of course I came. I mean I am
a member of the club, you know.

153
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,333
Just not officially,
that's all.

154
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,833
Yeah but since Yahiro's
not here, I thought.

155
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,333
So what if he's here?
Like I care about that!

156
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,125
Anyway, I'm happy
that you tagged along.

157
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,666
I don't even know what I'd do if
Inori were the only other girl.

158
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,625
Whoa! Inori, look at you!

159
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,875
Your skin is gorgeous!
Can I touch it?

160
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,458
Huh? Um.

161
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,791
It's so soft! What do you use
on it? Is it that soft all over?

162
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,166
Please, don't, I-

163
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,250
If she has any feelings for Shu,
I don't stand a freaking chance.

164
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,375
So, Shu. Spill it.

165
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,250
Huh? About what?

166
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,208
Is there really, like, nothing
going on between you and Inori?

167
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,875
It's like I
told you before, man.

168
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,208
Inori and I are just friends.

169
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,208
Then I'm going for it.
I'm going to make a move.

170
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:31,083
I like her, so screw it.
I'll give it a shot.

171
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,250
You know what you should do?

172
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,875
A mission in which
one uses one's friends.

173
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,708
Not very well suited
to our Shu, would you say?

174
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,125
Friends are an asset,
like anything else.

175
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,958
It's a waste not to use them.

176
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,041
How very "Gai".

177
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,625
Besides, a life without
turmoil is a life unlived.

178
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,125
He's doing his friend a favor
by stirring up some emotion,

179
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,708
just this once.

180
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,250
So your name is, Gai.

181
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,416
Excuse me, sir.

182
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,750
What you want?

183
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,041
Are you sure about this?

184
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,416
It doesn't matter;
I'm not even convinced

185
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm the little
bastard's real father.

186
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,333
His mother was a woman
of less-than-sterling virtue,

187
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,166
I fear. Nothing
like you, my dear.

188
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,208
Hey, thanks for coming out.

189
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,208
The stars are
real pretty out here, huh?

190
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,916
You hardly see them in Tokyo.
I mean, the part of Tokyo

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,458
that isn't this.

192
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,500
Just calm down. You can
leave them alone together.

193
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,041
Nothing's going to happen.

194
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,708
Look, there's something
I want to show you.

195
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,250
I was watching the new
Egoist video the other day.

196
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,083
And it really got under my skin,
like in the good way, you know?

197
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,791
So I borrowed your song
and made one of my own.

198
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,666
What's he doing?

199
00:13:53,458 --> 00:14:03,666
Blooming wildflower
I beg you, please tell me--

200
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,625
That's something I would do.
Does he think she'll just fall

201
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,625
for any guy with
editing software?

202
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,833
It's pretty.

203
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,250
Uh listen, Inori?

204
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,791
I know that, that we only
met a little while ago,

205
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,041
and we don't talk much.
But whenever I hear you singing,

206
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,416
it feels like my heart's
going to miss a beat!

207
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,500
You don't know me!
But I think you should!

208
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:34,541
Because I, Well, I think
you should know! I'm! Inori!

209
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,291
I'm in lo-!

210
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,583
Hold it right there!

211
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,875
Shu?

212
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,583
What the hell
are you doing, man?

213
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,041
Inori's my everything, you jerk!

214
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,583
Shu?

215
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,375
Geez, way to drop the ball!
You weren't supposed

216
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,750
to pull his Void yet, Romeo!

217
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,250
How long have you been watching?

218
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,791
You have no self-control,
you know that?

219
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,166
Ayase?

220
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,708
"Inori's my everything,
you jerk!"

221
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,208
Hey! Forget that!

222
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,250
Well, this is
an unexpected turn.

223
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,708
What do you recommend, Gai?

224
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,333
We stick to the plan,
is that understood?

225
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,708
We can still pull
this off. And we will.

226
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,875
Got it!

227
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,791
"Inori's my everything,"
huh? Pathetic.

228
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,125
Good, you're finally here.

229
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,750
Tsugumi's blinded the
guards, but they're of

230
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:56,958
little importance. The real
challenge lies within. Ogumo!

231
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,333
Yes, sir.

232
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,166
Bad form, interrupting
a guy's confession like that.

233
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,916
Shu! I want you
to shoot the gate with

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,666
that camera you pulled.

235
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,125
I didn't realize this was
a Void for opening things.

236
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,208
Let's go!

237
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,500
Hey!

238
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,333
Didn't realize it
was you, Keido, sir!

239
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,833
Don't you worry about it.

240
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,208
I'm just a ghost,
as are you now.

241
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,208
It sounds like they're onto us!

242
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,708
No! They can't know
we're here! Which means-

243
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,375
Hurry!

244
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,208
Shu!

245
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,000
Come on!

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,125
Why would Souta have a camera
for a Void? I don't get it.

247
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,458
I don't know, and frankly,
I couldn't care less.

248
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,375
I just know that we need him.

249
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,916
Souta's Void's the only
thing that can cut through

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,458
this security mechanism.
We just point and shoot.

251
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,125
So this whole room
is one big lock?

252
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,541
Our objective lies
just beyond us, Shu. Do it!

253
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,416
You first.

254
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,791
It's empty!

255
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,875
Gai? What are you?

256
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,125
We're leaving!

257
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,250
Keido, I should have
known you'd pull this.

258
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,375
Dante said, "The double
grief of a lost bliss,

259
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:28,041
is to recall those
happier hours while in pain."

260
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,250
Kurosu, I will not be deterred.

261
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,458
You okay?

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,083
Shu? Wait! Where's Inori?

263
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
She's back at the house.

264
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,500
So, what happened?

265
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,583
Look, Souta. I'm sorry, but I
can't help with Inori anymore.

266
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,125
Oh, I get it. You're
going after her now too, huh?

267
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,916
If that's how you feel, why
didn't you say something.

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,083
I even asked if there was
anything was between you!

269
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,583
I don't understand you
at all! What the hell?

270
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,291
Like you're one to talk!
You're so damn pushy and loud

271
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,541
and clueless all the
time, Souta! Seriously,

272
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,166
you bug the crap outta me!

273
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,958
Sorry! But that's
really how I feel, okay?

274
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:48,291
He must hate me now.
I can't blame him.

275
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,375
But I'm glad
I told him, at least.

276
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,750
It was the right thing to do.

277
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,750
I thought that
might be the case.

278
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,333
What?

279
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,958
Hey, thanks for giving it to me
straight. 'Cause sometimes,

280
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,458
you can be kind of distant.
You know what I'm saying, dude?

281
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,750
Anyway.

282
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,458
Hell, if we're being honest
here, sometimes you bug

283
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,458
the crap outta me.

284
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:19,333
It's cool, that you told me.
It means a lot, for real.

285
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,916
Guess that we're friends
at least a little bit,

286
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,708
or why bother?

287
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,916
It's a little late to be asking.

288
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,041
But what exactly
are Voids, anyway?

289
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,375
I don't really understand
what they're all about yet,

290
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,583
but I think at some point,
I'm going to have to.

291
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,333
I should know. I mean,
I'm reaching in and

292
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,875
touching their hearts.

293
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,458
Gai told me they change.
Just like a person's heart

294
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,791
can change,
their Void changes, too.

295
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,750
He said that?
Guess that's good to know.

296
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,500
So, if I form
a bond with someone.

297
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,708
Does that mean,
my power will change, too?
