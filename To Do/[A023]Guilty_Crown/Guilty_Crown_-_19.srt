1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,208
Quite a sight,
seeing him in action.

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,166
You've belonged to this side
ever since they created you.

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,291
And yet you think you could
just hand yourself over

4
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,500
to some human. Monster.

5
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,500
Alas, it doesn't
quite hit the mark.

6
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,750
Please, Mana. Forgive me.

7
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,750
It's empty! But she
should be in there!

8
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,583
Not only is Mana not here,
she never really was.

9
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,833
You're the same as you
were back then, aren't you?

10
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,791
The rarest of breeds, an actual
idealist, just like he was.

11
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,166
That man of yours. Brilliant
though he may have been.

12
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,875
I was never sure
that you were the one

13
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,791
who murdered him until now.

14
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,500
Sorry, sister dear.

15
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,583
But why?! He was
your best friend!

16
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,291
Yes, he was. Tragic, really.

17
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,041
C'mon. Hands in the air.

18
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,291
What's going on? I'm telling
you, I didn't do anything!

19
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,208
Don't move, Arisa.

20
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,416
It's you.

21
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,833
I sold you out and now
you've come to take revenge?

22
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,125
I couldn't care less about
that. All I want from you

23
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,000
is Inori's location.

24
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,500
Don't be a fool!

25
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,833
Attention all units. Dr.
Haruka Ouma has committed

26
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,708
high treason and
is now on the run.

27
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,416
If found, she is to be
arrested on sight.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,666
I repeat: Dr. Haruka Ouma
has committed high treason

29
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,916
and is now on the run. If found,
she is to be arrested on sight.

30
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,458
That's a sensitive -
materials case.

31
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,750
What's so funny?

32
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,208
Ah, the delightful frisson
of a puzzle well-solved!

33
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,250
If I may,
my Lord High President.

34
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,375
Sir, I would give my eyeteeth
to track her down for you.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,291
You're not cleared
to leave. Step out.

36
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,041
I'm going after Dr. Ouma.
I'll clear it with Gai

37
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,583
once I'm on the road.

38
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,625
Wait! Come back! You can't just
flout the chain of command!

39
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,500
When we locate her,
you are going to let me

40
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,708
speak to your mother.
That understood?

41
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,875
Is that your condition
for giving me information

42
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,875
about where Inori's being kept?

43
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,333
She knows Gai. She understands
the way his mind works.

44
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,458
I want to know him like that.
His past, what he wants,

45
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,291
his failings,
what hurts him, everything.

46
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,041
This had better work.
I've got nowhere else to go.

47
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,875
Dr. Ouma, I presume?

48
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,541
You're a sight for sore
eyes. It's been a while.

49
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,625
No way! Kurachi?!

50
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,208
I thought you
might turn up soon.

51
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,250
Sounds like you made
one hell of an exit, there.

52
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,583
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

53
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,375
Well, you're welcome
to join up with us.

54
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,666
Mr. Kuhouin would
have wanted it that way.

55
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,083
Wait--"wanted?"
Are you saying that?

56
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
It was a hero's death at least.

57
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,208
Before I ran from the GHQ.
I tried to murder Mana,

58
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
but they already suspected me.

59
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,041
Haruka, what are you
saying? Isn't Mana-?

60
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,583
She's my daughter, yes.

61
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,333
So that girl is
Shu's older sister?

62
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,416
How do you know Shu?

63
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
We were friends
in Funeral Parlor.

64
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:10,791
Really? My little boy. I can't
wrap my head around it.

65
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,666
I've been so busy with work,
I barely know him.

66
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:22,000
No, that's a lie. I've been
avoiding him. For years.

67
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,750
Haruka's my mom,
but not by blood.

68
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,291
She was actually my father's
second wife. But then-

69
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,791
Right after they got married,
he was gone.

70
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,916
I wasn't her child,
but she raised me anyway.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,250
It wasn't out of
a sense of duty.

72
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,833
I did it because I cared
about that sweet little boy.

73
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:52,750
I'd lost a husband,
and he'd lost everything.

74
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,458
We propped each other up.

75
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,208
I think maybe we were just
what each other needed

76
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,208
to recover from the shock.

77
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,291
Sooo, there is indeed a Funeral
Parlor hideout in there?

78
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,291
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

79
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,333
I- I swear!

80
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,875
Once more, with feeling!

81
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,208
No, please! I swear on my life!
Please, you gotta believe me!

82
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,666
Picking up bodies.
We got 'em, sir.

83
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,250
You're an honest woman.
Truly, the rarest of fauna.

84
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,291
No good deed
goes unpunished, love.

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,000
Someone's coming up.

86
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,458
'Scuse me? I heard
you guys might have

87
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,083
some vaccine to spare?

88
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,666
Huh?

89
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,333
The government's running out,
and... look, we got money...!

90
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,333
We're willing to pay...!

91
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,333
I have two kids at home who
are overdue for their dosage!

92
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,583
Help us!

93
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,333
How dare you keep it for
yourself?! Shame on you!

94
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,750
You sons-of-bitches!

95
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,583
Let us in!

96
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,625
Open up, dammit!

97
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,583
We said we'd pay ya
for it! Come on!

98
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,166
Open that door!

99
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,875
Listen to me! We don't even have
enough vaccine for ourselves!

100
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:19,541
You're lying!

101
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,791
We're not dumb, man!

102
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,458
Why don't you open that
door and prove it, huh?!

103
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,666
Hey, if that's what
it's gonna take to

104
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,583
calm you guys down, fine.

105
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,875
Y'see? It's just
an office building.

106
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,458
Wish we could help ya, but-

107
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,958
Such honesty. It'll
be the death of you.

108
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,500
Ogumo!

109
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,916
Get her out!
You hear me?!

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333
Don't worry about me.

111
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,916
You bastard!

112
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,541
The harder they fall. Huh.

113
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,333
Uh oh. Where'd
they scamper off to?

114
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,041
Shouldn't we go back for them?

115
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,291
We're of no use to
anybody if we're dead.

116
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,833
Maybe we we'll be able to
rendezvous with another cell.

117
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,666
What's in here, anyway?

118
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,333
That's our nuclear option.

119
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,375
This is! Oh my god!

120
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,125
A Void genome.
The last one in existence.

121
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,000
That tiny vial
is our one and only hope.

122
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,291
If we try to attack Gai, we'll
all be dead before we can blink!

123
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,583
So what, we just
sit here like bitches?!

124
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,083
Come on.

125
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,291
They took out Ogumo--what
chance do the rest of us have?

126
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,458
Don't write off
Ogumo just yet.

127
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666
Argo's checking
his last coordinates.

128
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,375
How's he doing?

129
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:23,458
It's just getting worse, bit
by bit. Can't we do anything?

130
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,291
I'm sorry. But once they
hit Stage 3 our vaccine

131
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,291
is just too weak.

132
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,166
Hey, you guys! Argo's back!

133
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,041
What about Gumy?
He isn't with you?

134
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,875
Yeah, he is.

135
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,666
Where is he?

136
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,708
He's with us all.

137
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,000
No. Him, too?

138
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,291
He sacrificed his life for me.

139
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,041
Ogumo.

140
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,666
I'm gonna miss 'im!

141
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,625
Just look at you.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,708
When I met you five years ago
during my mercenary days

143
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,750
in Africa, I knew that you
were more than just another

144
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,000
child soldier sent
out to kill me.

145
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,041
I've shed blood in pursuit of
your coronation ever since.

146
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:33,208
All that blood-- for what?
So you can sit on your perch.

147
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,125
You can stare down at mankind
and judge us from on high.

148
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,083
Spare me your petty scorn.

149
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,208
My goal was the
same then as now.

150
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,125
You all chose to shackle
your dreams to my feet.

151
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,166
Don't cry when
I stray from your path.

152
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,791
Tell me! What did we
fight for all these years?!

153
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,500
Did Funeral Parlor
mean anything at all?!

154
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,083
What does it matter?

155
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
It's hard to imagine now, but
I actually thought of you

156
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,916
as a friend once.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,083
A king has no friends. He
has subordinates. Pawns.

158
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,041
You have enlightened me.

159
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,583
In this final moment, I see you
for what you genuinely are.

160
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,916
I spent years trying to
present you with a crown,

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,666
but from this point on, I
strive only to take your head.

162
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,625
Here.

163
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,291
Oh, thank you.

164
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,125
If I used that. You think
I could defeat Gai?

165
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:47,541
You'd have the same ability
he does, at least. That is-

166
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,958
-Unless your body rejects it.
Then it would just

167
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,333
tear you apart, cell by cell.

168
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,541
I'm such a hypocrite.
I want someone to take

169
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,458
that chance, but I don't want
that someone to be Shu.

170
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,083
You want to protect him.

171
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,833
Being burdened with
that responsibility

172
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,625
was never easy for Shu,
so it makes sense.

173
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,083
It isn't just that.

174
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,375
Using the genome again,
would probably kill him.

175
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,041
We were never meant
to have such power.

176
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:33,875
This is a party, gentlemen.
Let's pull out all the stops!

177
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,958
It looks like we're too late.

178
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,166
What are you doing?!
Get back here!

179
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,208
Haruka!

180
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,208
C'mon, just leave me.

181
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,083
Not gonna happen.
We all get out.

182
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,000
That's how this goes down.

183
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,541
Yahiro.

184
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,375
Stop playing the
coquette, you teases!

185
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,583
Let your bullets fill
the air! Embrace them

186
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,125
in a tempest of death!

187
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,625
No good! I'm not picking
anybody up out there!

188
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,833
We'll double back.

189
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,250
If we go back now,
they're just gonna flank us!

190
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,541
So what do we do, genius?!

191
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,208
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,375
Dr. Ouma. I want you to use
the Void genome on me.

193
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,416
There was a time, when your
son gave me the courage

194
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,416
to stand up and fight.
But today, I have to stand

195
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,375
on my own.

196
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,583
I'm ready! Even if I have
to face Gai himself!

197
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,666
Aya, wait! Where'd
this come from?!

198
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,083
No, it's okay. I've given it
a lot of thought. Really.

199
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,958
It's what I want!

200
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,000
This is serendipitous!

201
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,291
Only three ampules
were produced.

202
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,333
I've been trying to
ferret out the last one

203
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,791
for quite some time now.
And of course, Dr. Ouma

204
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,166
simply had it
with her all along.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,166
I'll be taking it now--
I hope no one objects.

206
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,125
Why do you even want it?

207
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,416
Not that my motives
concern you in the least,

208
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,541
but I want to bask
in its sublime glow.

209
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,166
That genome lets you reach
into a person's very heart.

210
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,791
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to realize that kind of truth!

211
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,166
Then let's see if
you can beat me to it!

212
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,583
Oh, you little scoundrel!

213
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,500
Not on your life!

214
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,208
Oh dear.

215
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,958
Drat.

216
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,791
Shu!

217
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,041
Stop!

218
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,791
No, don't! Please! You can't
do this to yourself again!

219
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,208
But I have to, don't you
see? You know it's funny.

220
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,791
This is where it all
began. Only this time.

221
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,375
I'm choosing this for myself.

222
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:51,291
Shu! Please, just listen to me!
You can't use the genome again!

223
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,958
Your body won't be able
to handle the strain!

224
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,583
It's okay, mom, I know.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,625
I wish I'd called you
that before, 'cause really,

226
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,708
that's what you've been to me.

227
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,708
I don't want this to be
goodbye. I'm so sorry.

228
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,458
But if I can stop him,
my life was well-spent.

229
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,791
Shu, no!

230
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,500
Please, stooooop!

231
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:35,125
There it is, shining before
me! I see the light of Truth!

232
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,083
Oh, no! Shuuu!

233
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,083
It's him. But of course.

234
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,416
I'm tired of always
running away. Right here,

235
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,666
in this moment, I'm going
to find out what I'm made of!

236
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,958
His missing arm!

237
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,791
Shu.

238
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:24,875
Unto us a king is born!
Honor him into oblivion!

239
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
Ayase, sorry about this.

240
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,750
It's okay.

241
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,375
No holding back! Fire
'til your weapons melt!

242
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,416
Shu.

243
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,375
I don't have any right
to ask you this, and I'm sorry

244
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,000
I have to, but this one
last time will you let me

245
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
borrow your powers, Yahiro?

246
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,416
Yeah. Course I will.

247
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,208
That's how we're playing, huh?!
Then kiss your friend goodbye!

248
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,041
You're not a
murderer! Admit it!

249
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
You may be right.
But I can learn.

250
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,375
What?

251
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,416
I'll bathe in blood, if it
keeps my friends alive!

252
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:56,666
I feel it! Another's
essence piercing my soul!

253
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,291
I can feel the
Void liiiiiiiiight!

254
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,916
Shuuuu!

255
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,250
Shu!

256
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,666
No!

257
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,375
Look at his face!

258
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,666
The virus!

259
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,416
Where did that
come from so suddenly?

260
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,916
It's mine.

261
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,541
My cancer. Somehow
he took it from me.

262
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,166
Did Shu's Void do this?!

263
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:51,708
His Void is unique. It gathers
in whatever is nearby.

264
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,708
Virtue and weakness together.
Light and darkness alike.

265
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,291
Everything.

266
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:03,583
Shu, is it your destiny
to die for us?

267
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:09,333
Guess there's no point in
fighting against fate, Kurosu.

268
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:14,625
If the Apocalypse virus turns
suffering into hatred, I swear,

269
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,208
I'll take every last bit of it.

270
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,625
I'll give my life,
to grant the others a future.

271
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,750
I'll be there soon, Inori.
