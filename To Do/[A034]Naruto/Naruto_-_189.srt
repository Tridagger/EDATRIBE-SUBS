00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:14,416
-Naruto!

00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,316
CHOJI: Incoming!

5
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:27,855
-Thank goodness.

6
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,224
You're just in the nick of time.

7
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:32,427
-Oh, yeah!

8
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,696
Hey Naruto, you OK down there?

9
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,930
-Never better.

10
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,800
You saved my life just in
time to crush me to death.

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,702
-Just doing my job, man.

12
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,669
-Ahh!

13
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,971
-Chubbies rule!

14
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:45,340
-Choji, don't do it!

15
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,275
It's not going to work on him!

16
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,747
-No fair.

17
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,216
-[laughs] Isn't water amazing?

18
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,051
Whatever you throw
my way, this bubble

19
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,221
will protect me from the
impact In here, my defense is

20
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:01,189
iron clad.

21
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,425
-That is kind of cool.

22
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,894
-Now what?

23
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,397
-Flower Ninja Art,
Bloom Myriad of Flowers!

24
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,706
-Whoo!

25
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,341
You save me there.

26
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,042
-Where'd he go?

27
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,751
-Shouldn't play with fire.

28
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,052
Somebody could get hurt.

29
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,410
-No matter how many knives
you have up your sleeve,

30
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:58,012
all the water in the
ground is at my disposal,

31
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,180
waiting to be used.

32
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,383
-So how do we beat a
ninjutsu that never runs out?

33
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,418
Maybe we better--

34
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,819
-Run really fast?

35
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,421
-It's called a tactical retreat!

36
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,431
-Sorry, but you're
not getting away.

37
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,671
Summoning jutsu!

38
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,673
Dinner time!

[music playing]

40
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:47,862
-This way!

41
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:50,198
We got to keep running!

42
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,300
If that water catches
us, we're sunk!

43
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,069
-They're coming around
on this side also!

44
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:57,839
-They're trying to head us off!

45
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,675
-[laughs] Better not slow down.

46
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,145
My pets haven't been fed
for a very long time.

47
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,747
-We can't outrun them forever.

48
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:07,815
-You think?

49
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,675
Guess we'll have to
beat him up after all.

50
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:10,117
-Great!

51
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,285
How?

52
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,653
Nothing we're trying has
hurt this guy even a little.

53
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:25,933
-Darn it!

54
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:29,344
Ah!

55
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,308
Notice anything weird
about the way he runs?

56
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:34,876
-Huh?

57
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:40,915
Yeah?

58
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:41,883
Like what?

59
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,084
-I don't know.

60
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:45,353
-Why did you ask then?

61
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,921
-Wait a second.

62
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:50,324
Naruto, are you talking
about how he holds his tonfa?

63
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:51,759
-Oh, yeah, huh?

64
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,095
This guy carries his tonfa
like they're dowsing rods.

65
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,796
-That's what it is.

66
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,265
-It's called dowsing.

67
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:00,668
You just concentrate hard
on what you're looking for,

68
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,804
and they react when you're
getting close to it.

69
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:05,439
-What, dowsing rods?

70
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:06,807
Of course!

71
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,143
Naruto, Choji,
maybe there's still

72
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,212
a chance we can win this fight.

73
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,346
-Huh?

74
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,049
-If those tonfa are the
secret of his attack,

75
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:18,119
then maybe-- follow my lead!

76
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:21,155
-I think it's time we bring
this chase to a finish.

77
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:24,692
NARUTO: Shadow Clone Jutsu!

78
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:25,159
-Huh!

79
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,327
Child's play.

80
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,766
You're not getting away from me!

81
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,601
-I'm not going anywhere!

82
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:43,044
-Huh?

83
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:58,859
[laughs] You almost had me
there for a second, didn't you?

84
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,294
But not quite.

85
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,228
-What the--

86
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:10,805
-I'm starting to
think that maybe I've

87
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,840
been going a little
too easy on you.

88
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,111
-Ahhhh!

89
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,913
-Hey, what's all
the yelling for?

90
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:19,947
-Run, Choji!

91
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,315
Run for your life!

92
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:21,916
-Huh?

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,855
Yaaa!

00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:31,225
[screaming]

95
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,113
-Ah!

96
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:53,005
-Yurinojo, you've
got to be more-- oh!

97
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:53,455
-Yurinojo!

98
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,056
Choji!

99
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,386
Get out of there!

100
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:06,827
Behind you!

101
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,195
Look behind you!

102
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,131
Just turn around!

103
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:12,099
-Hmm?

104
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,760
-I said you need to turn around!

105
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,202
Turn!

106
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:15,770
Look!

107
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,741
-Ahhh!

108
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,676
-Choji!

109
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,645
-[screaming]

110
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,353
-Choji!

111
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,322
-[screaming]

112
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,404
--[laughs] Fight's
over, time to eat.

113
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:53,441
Our special for
tonight, raw shinobi.

114
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,643
-Oh, this fight is
over, all right,

115
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:58,212
but all you're going to get
is a big knuckle sandwich.

116
00:08:58,212 --> 00:08:59,780
-How's that?

117
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:00,881
-Bottom's up, Choji!

118
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,250
Drink that water
as fast as you can!

119
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:03,851
-Hmm?

120
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,163
Um-hm!

121
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,431
-[laughs] Clever, but pointless.

122
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:21,969
I'll just keep calling up
more until I finished you all.

123
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:22,870
What's wrong?

124
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:25,973
Where is it?

125
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:28,442
-Sorry, but you're
in for a dry spell.

126
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,711
-What do you mean?

127
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,248
-The water you depend on
is nowhere to be found.

128
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,717
Take a good, long look around.

129
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,952
That's right.

130
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:43,190
We're standing on solid
rock, and so are you.

131
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:46,193
[thump]

132
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,695
-Urp!

133
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:48,796
Oh, you needed that?

134
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:58,672
-Yurinojo's onto your secret, so
no more funny stuff out of you.

135
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,708
You know, he wasn't
the only one who

136
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,009
thought you were acting fishy.

137
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,779
When I went to check
the trap earlier,

138
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,081
I took a shortcut that led
through this huge outcropping

139
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,817
of rocks.

140
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,252
I half expected
to see you there.

141
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,821
In fact, I was kind of
surprised you weren't.

142
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,089
Now I understand why.

143
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,125
YURINOJO: The answer was
right in front of us.

144
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,694
Naruto never saw you
when he took his shortcut

145
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,864
because you were steering
clear of areas without water.

146
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,300
You wielded those tonfa
not only as weapons,

147
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,868
but as dowsing rods.

148
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,970
And as soon as you
couldn't rely on them,

149
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,373
we were able to lure
you onto drier terrain.

150
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,841
-Hold on.

151
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,811
So that was the reason
you cracked my tonfa?

152
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,813
-Clearly it wasn't
mere coincidence.

153
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,114
-Of course if wasn't.

154
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:45,786
Yurinojo was able to figure out
exactly what you were up to.

155
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,321
-I got a lot of
water weight now,

156
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,089
so this one's going to hurt.

157
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,094
-Watery Human Boulder!

158
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:58,406
-Ahhh!

159
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,848
[laughter]

160
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,083
-He threw a shark
at the wrong ninja.

161
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:18,219
-Yeah!

162
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:18,919
-Oh!

163
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:20,154
-Huh?

164
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,188
-Yurinojo!

165
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,289
-It's my ribs.

166
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:24,225
Don't worry about me.

167
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,427
There are three of these thugs.

168
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,230
Go on, make sure
the princess is OK.

169
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,431
I beg of you.

170
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,066
-Consider it done.

171
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,268
Choji, stick around
and make sure he's OK.

172
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,669
YURINOJO: Thanks.

173
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,738
-Hinata may be fast,
but I can catch up.

174
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:47,381
--[gasping] I have
to rest for a while.

175
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,415
-Good idea.

176
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,818
We can wait for the
others right here.

177
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,821
-[gasping]

178
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,093
We will do no such thing.

179
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,928
After I'm done
catching my breath,

180
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,197
you're going to escort me to
safety, and that's an order.

181
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,900
-But Naruto and the others
haven't shown up yet.

182
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,102
-Well, that's their
problem, isn't it?

183
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:11,005
If they do get into trouble
out here, it's their own fault.

184
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:12,840
I wanted to use the
peasants as decoys,

185
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,342
but you three insisted
on the long way.

186
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,279
We'd all be home free by now
if you ninja weren't so soft.

187
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:22,116
-How could you after
what happened to

188
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,817
-What's the problem?

189
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,120
Every ninja risks his
life to perform his duty,

190
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,188
and Kikunojo was aware of that.

191
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,824
Even if he dies, if
I'm alive then there's

192
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,393
still a chance that
the Land of Greens

193
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:36,096
might exist as it once did,
but that hope perishes with me.

194
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,364
-Princess--

195
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:40,234
-Hinata, you can't imagine
the things I've been through.

196
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,837
Taken from my parents and held
hostage in a foreign land,

197
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,806
bullied night and day.

198
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,076
But that suffering has
taught me a valuable lesson.

199
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,780
I realized while I was just
a child anyone foolish enough

200
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,716
to put their faith in people
deserves whatever they get.

201
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,952
Someone like your friend
Naruto, for instance,

202
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,954
who let's his emotions
cloud his judgment

203
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:01,822
instead of focusing on
the mission at hand.

204
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,291
A ninja like that who's too
weak to get the job done

205
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,159
is worthless.

206
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,727
-What do you know about Naruto?

207
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,430
You don't get to stand here
and judge him like that!

208
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,699
At least you had a mom and dad.

209
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,000
Naruto's an orphan.

210
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,736
He lives all by
himself, totally alone.

211
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,106
He's worked hard, trying to
win everyone's acceptance

212
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:22,376
and become the next
Hokage, giving it his all.

213
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,912
He's had a difficult
life himself,

214
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,814
but he would never
think of sacrificing

215
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,315
somebody else for
his own well-being.

216
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,683
You know why?

217
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,820
Because he's a good person,
and a good ninja too!

218
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,056
-And he's not the
princess of a feudal land.

219
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,424
-I-I'm sorry.

220
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,027
That was very rude of me.

221
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,363
-Hm!

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,933
Hinata, you're pretty fond
of Naruto, aren't you?

223
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,869
-Uh--

224
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,170
-Say no more.

225
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,772
Let's wait for the
others, shall we?

226
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,674
-Yes, of course.

227
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
-That pack must be really heavy.

228
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,310
Let me give you a hand.

229
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,078
-Oh, uh, thank you.

230
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,219
-Ah!

231
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,954
Stupid girl.

232
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:08,956
I'm not dying out
here, and that's final.

233
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,836
-Well, don't you look fierce
down there in the dirt.

234
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,171
-Jiga.

235
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,939
You got to help me.

236
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,674
I'm your brother.

237
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,211
-Doesn't matter to me, because
with you out of the picture,

238
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,747
instead of me getting
a third, Renga and I

239
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,749
can split the profits in half.

240
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:36,917
-But Jiga--

241
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,352
-It's nothing personal.

242
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:39,086
-Wait!

243
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:39,920
Listen to me.

244
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,226
No!

245
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,328
What are you doing?

246
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:51,265
Jiga!

247
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:51,865
Ahhh!

248
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,839
-[laughs]

249
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:18,032
-Hinata!

250
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:21,995
You all right?

251
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,235
-Naruto.

252
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:29,837
Oh!

253
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,772
Where is the princess?

254
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,973
-Beats the heck out of me.

255
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,341
I was about to ask you.

256
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,944
-I said let's wait for the
others, then I turned away,

257
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,212
and then--

258
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,848
-How'd you let an amateur get
close enough to clobber you

259
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,650
in the back of the head?

260
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,285
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

261
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,988
-She's out here somewhere,
and now she's all by herself.

262
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,356
-Naruto, wait.

263
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,758
Maybe we should head
back to the Hidden Leaf

264
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,794
and ask the Hokage
what to do about this.

265
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,828
-No!

266
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,763
We don't have time
to go ask for advice.

267
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,432
There are still two
more of these evil ninja

268
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,900
punks sneaking around.

269
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,169
And if the princess gets
caught by either of them,

270
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,437
they're going to snuff her out.

271
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,939
-But this isn't the mission
we were sent out to perform.

272
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,408
What if we can't
handle the other two?

273
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,178
Maybe we're not good enough.

274
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,080
-Good point.

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,414
You're right, Hinata.

276
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,217
This isn't the mission
we came out here to do.

277
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,220
But the princess, she's
running for her life,

278
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,825
doing the best she can, and
now she's doing it by herself.

279
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,227
Yeah, she's bossy and mean
and acts like the world

280
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,697
revolves around her, I know,
but what kind of person

281
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,266
would just writer her off?

282
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,835
-Well, if that's
how you feel, then--

283
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,203
-Here's the plan.

284
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,006
Yurinojo took a hit
to the ribs earlier.

285
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,675
You help Choji take care
of him while I go on ahead

286
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,110
and save the princess.

287
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,077
See you later.

288
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,249
-Naruto, be careful.

289
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,830
-Right over there!

MALE SPEAKER: Your reflexes
are pretty good, kid.

291
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,838
I see how you could beat Ruiga.

292
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,213
-I'm guessing you're
the second Janin then?

293
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,348
MALE SPEAKER: Well, gosh.

294
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:25,419
To think that a great ninja like
you knows about little old me.

295
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,687
You're lucky.

296
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,655
It's an honor getting
destroyed by Jiga.

297
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,358
Definitely something you can
brag about in the afterlife.

-This guy's no push over, and
what kind of ninjutsu is that?

303
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,919
Ahh!

304
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,288
-Didn't meet ninja, huh?

00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,357
Once Renga and I have
bled this country dry,

306
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:07,361
we'll give your village a visit.

going to let you do that?

What the--

00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:21,808
-Surprise.

310

You didn't know I had
magnetic ninjutsu.

-Nah, ain't my style.

You can use it instead.

What the heck's
going on around here?

-What should I do?

329

I've been looking for Choji
but I can't find him anywhere.

330
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,195
Maybe they're not
out in the open.

Maybe they're in hiding.

Yes, of course,

as a magnet whenever I want.

this mountain is full of iron.

here, I'm invincible.

put it, but I also

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,748
-[laughs]

362
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,198
-Naruto!

363
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,203
[theme music]

364
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,022
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

365
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,158
My gentle fist won't work
against his ninja art.

366
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:09,029
It's tough, but I can't beat
him if I fight him head on.

367
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:13,266
But if I don't beat him
soon, Naruto's going to-- no,

368
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,834
I'm not going to
let that happen.

369
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,771
I'll find a weak
spot in this jutsu.

370
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:20,707
I'll stop this guy if
it's the last thing I do!

371
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,775
I promise!

372
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:22,943
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, "The Byakugan

373
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:24,244
Sees The Blind Spot!"

374
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:27,714
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I'm going
to give this one attack my all!
