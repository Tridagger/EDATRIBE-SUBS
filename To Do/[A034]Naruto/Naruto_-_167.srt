00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:12,135
[theme music]

2
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,202
[running water]

3
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,568
-What's this?

4
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,135
Where does this water lead?

5
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:18,902
[yells]

6
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,635
Hey, what's the matter
with you, Naruto?

7
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:52,368
Snap out of it.

8
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,068
Come on.

9
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:53,835
Get a hold of yourself.

10
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,802
[laughter]

11
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,102
CHISHIMA: Naruto!

12
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,802
-Those kids are having
such a good time.

13
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:09,568
CHISHIMA: Naruto, hey!

14
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:10,868
Naruto!

15
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:13,268
-Huh?

16
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,468
Hey!

17
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:24,535
You jerk, let go-- This
is that lake from before.

18
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:32,735
You jerk, let go-- This
is that lake from before.

19
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:35,368
-Hey, Naruto.

20
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:36,902
-Chishima, it's you.

21
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:37,968
Wait a sec.

22
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,502
So I guess it must
have been your voice I

23
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:42,602
heard calling out my name.

24
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:43,535
-How do you feel?

25
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,735
Are you all right?

26
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,235
-I should ask you that.

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,902
You ought to rest
with that injury.

28
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:48,602
-Don't worry.

29
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:50,902
It's not that serious.

30
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,868
We just have to find Lady Toki.

31
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:53,968
-You're right.

32
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,602
And where is Moso hiding?

33
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,368
We need him too.

34
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,935
-Looking for me?

35
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,468
-Moso.

36
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,735
-Lady Toki.

37
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,168
-Chishima, forgive me.

38
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:09,368
I'm sorry I had to deceive
you for such a long time.

39
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,235
-No.

40
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:11,802
Don't worry about that.

41
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,202
I had my suspicions
for a while now.

42
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:17,868
-You people know too many
of this land's dark secrets.

43
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:19,502
But you'll be
taking those secrets

44
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:21,702
to the grave when I send
you all to your doom.

45
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,768
-Finally showed us
your real face, huh?

46
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:37,335
-I am called Hoki,
a wandering ninja.

47
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,735
And no matter how you
may try to stop me,

48
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:43,068
I shall take over this once
peaceful land for myself.

49
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:44,402
Water style.

50
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:45,702
Water dragon jutsu.

51
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:14,902
-Chishima!

52
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,235
-Chishima, talk to me.

53
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,502
You gotta hang in there.

54
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,435
-So was I fast enough?

55
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,802
You're OK?

56
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,602
Thank goodness.

57
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:29,102
-Chishima!

58
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:35,068
Lady Toki, I remember.

59
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,235
There were so many wonderful
days spent together

60
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:41,235
at this lake playing here
with you and with Lord Sagi.

61
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:48,735
In those days, the Land of
Birds was so tranquil, so gentle

62
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,435
and warm.

63
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:56,968
With all your resolve, you can
again restore the Land of Birds

64
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,468
to the way it once was.

65
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,602
-Chishima.

66
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,268
-Come on.

67
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,068
Don't give up on me.

68
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,468
-Naruto, please.

69
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,602
I beg this of you.

70
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,535
Help Lady Toki.

71
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:15,235
Will you help my friend?

72
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:16,402
-Yes.

73
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:18,468
And if a Leaf Village
ninja promises something,

74
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:21,735
it means he'll never
rest till it's done.

75
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,102
-Then promise me.

76
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,602
Protect her.

77
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:31,202
Lady Toki means
everything to me.

78
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,502
-Hold on a second.

79
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,735
Then you have feelings for her.

80
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:39,335
-That ramen was so good.

81
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,602
-It was.

82
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,368
I'll treat you again some time.

83
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,735
-Oh, Naruto, thank you.

84
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:48,235
Goodbye.

85
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:54,302
-No, wait.

86
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:02,335
Chishima.

87
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:06,968
-No.

88
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,802
Chishima!

89
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:14,135
--[laughs] That fool was just
another convenient pawn.

90
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,535
Certainly nothing to
get so upset about.

91
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:17,768
-Shut up.

92
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,235
He wasn't a pawn.

93
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:22,668
This man loved the Land of
Birds with all his heart.

94
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:28,402
And he gave his life trying to
protect it from evil like you.

95
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:31,535
I'm finished listening to you.

96
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,435
You've said enough.

97
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:34,335
Now you'll pay.

98
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:37,935
-Oh, will I now?

99
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,268
Threaten me all you
want, but what exactly

100
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,302
are you going to do to stop me?

101
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,735
Water style.

102
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:44,902
Giant vortex jutsu.

103
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,202
So long.

104
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:14,968
-Man, you're persistent.

105
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:26,668
-Gentle fist.

106
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:39,135
-That was careless, cocky
ninja Kakashi Hatake.

107
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,602
If I can take you down, one
who possesses the Sharingan,

108
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:45,468
everyone will know of the
wandering ninja's power.

109
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,035
-What?

110
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,202
A clone?

111
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,668
-Sorry to disappoint
you, but I don't even

112
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:01,168
need to use the
Sharingan on you to win.

113
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:07,935
-It's this way.

114
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:08,435
-Naruto.

115
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:15,502
-If we follow this--

116
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:16,268
-Yes.

117
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:17,135
It will lead us to Naruto.

118
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:29,268
-Unfortunately, dear, I
cannot allow you to avenge

119
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,335
your beloved fallen comrade.

120
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,335
But out of sympathy,
I can send you

121
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:37,168
to where your father
and brother are.

122
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,435
-I don't care.

123
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:41,102
Just get on with it.

124
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,335
Do it quickly.

125
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:46,268
-You sure know when
to give up, don't you?

126
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,168
-What does it matter.

127
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:48,835
They're dead.

128
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,168
I'm the only one left.

129
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:54,068
My whole family is gone.

130
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:57,235
And now that I can't
even take my revenge,

131
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,635
there's no point to life, none.

132
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:02,102
-You're a courageous woman.

133
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,002
All right.

134
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,768
Then so be it.

135
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:07,202
I will grant your wish.

136
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:08,368
Prepare yourself.

137
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,835
-Naruto, wake up.

138
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,968
Save Toki.

139
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:34,168
Wake up and save
my little sister.

140
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:37,402
I entrusted her with the
future of the Land of Birds.

141
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,468
I left her my watch.

142
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:44,168
But Toki became obsessed with
her intense desire for revenge.

143
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:47,435
For her heart, it's
like time is stuck.

144
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:50,068
And as a mere soul,
I cannot change it.

145
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:53,335
So I bet of you, please
change it for me.

146
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:58,902
Push her time out of the
past and towards the future.

147
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:00,468
-What was that?

148
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:01,135
A vision?

149
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,129
-Goodbye.

150
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,835
What the--

151
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,802
-Hold it right there!

152
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,667
-What the--

153
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:32,667
-Hold it right there!

154
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,134
-Naruto.

155
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,834
-You're not going
to believe this,

156
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,401
but I think I just met
your brother in a dream.

157
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,734
-You saw Sagi?

158
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,167
-And he told me something.

159
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,001
Your brother doesn't
want you to avenge

160
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,801
his and your father's death.

161
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,534
He said you should move on and
take care of this land instead.

162
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:01,601
-But--

163
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,701
-Not just for Sagi
but for Chishima too.

164
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:08,534
You gotta make the Land
of Birds great again.

165
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,501
You see?

166
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:12,467
Your life, it matters.

167
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:12,967
-Naruto.

168
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,334
-None of this will make
a bit of difference.

169
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,234
The two of you are going
to die here anyway.

170
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,701
-You're finished, Hoki.

171
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,267
You really think you'll
take over this land?

172
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:37,734
-What's this?

173
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:38,934
-No way.

174
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,067
A person who has an impure
heart, a heart that's

175
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:45,167
bent on revenge, can
never hope to govern.

176
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,934
Don't you get it?

177
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,001
The reason this was
such a wonderful place

178
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,167
was because Chishima, Sagi, and
Toki's hearts were connected.

179
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:53,734
They were one.

180
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,534
Even if you cheat your way
into a position of power,

181
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,034
you will never win over
the hearts of the people.

182
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,734
-Well, that's what you think.

183
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:02,534
-Fine, then.

184
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,967
Multi-shadow clone jutsu.

185
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,067
-You Leaf Village amateur.

186
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,367
No matter.

187
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,567
I'll gladly send you off to
meet the ones I've already

188
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,767
gotten rid of with my
multi-shadow clone jutsu.

189
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,867
-I hate to tell you, but it
ain't gonna be that easy.

190
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,567
-Go on and try me.

191
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,134
If you can even
find the real me.

192
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,301
-You're going down.

193
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:37,001
-Let's move.

194
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,867
-Aw, man.

195
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,667
Which of those guys is he?

196
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:03,167
Huh?

197
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:17,334
-Naruto, don't give up yet.

198
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:21,467
--[laughs] What idiot would
come straight to the front when

199
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:23,701
using shadow clones?

200
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:29,601
I was hoping you'd let me
have some fun, but oh, well.

201
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,667
Those who don't know
how to use their power

202
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:34,501
don't deserve to live.

203
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,934
-Don't get cocky.

204
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,101
I'm not finished
kicking your butt yet.

205
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:43,867
-You rat.

206
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,367
-Let's do it.

207
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:52,334
Naruto!

208
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,301
You want the real me?

209
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,301
Well, here I come.

210
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,301
Uzumaki Barrage!

211
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,101
I did it.

212
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:07,601
-Chishima.

213
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:14,601
Chishima, please don't leave me.

214
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,567
I need you.

215
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,601
Don't go.

216
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,067
You can't leave me here alone.

217
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,401
Open your eyes, I beg you.

218
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,467
-Lady Toki.

219
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,534
-Chishima!

220
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,534
You're all right.

221
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,534
-Lady Toki.

222
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,367
-Glad you made it, buddy.

223
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,101
-Naruto, I'm grateful.

224
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:22,001
-I was only trying to
complete my mission.

225
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:26,301
And besides, I had
to make sure that guy

226
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:28,134
pays for the crimes
her committed.

227
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,034
Right?

228
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,901
-You did.

229
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,901
-You know, I'm sure Sagi's
pretty happy right now too.

230
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,167
-That's right.

231
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,634
You met my elder brother.

232
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,834
-Sure did.

233
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,434
I saw Sagi in a dream.

234
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,034
But even if it was a dream,
it doesn't change the fact

235
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,401
that he asked me
to do something.

236
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,734
-What was it?

237
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,501
What did he ask you to do?

238
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,867
-Well, he said something
about how your time got stuck

239
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,634
and you needed a push.

240
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,534
-My time?

241
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:56,634
-Yeah.

242
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,201
He said that if you
forgot about revenge,

243
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,601
time would start moving forward.

244
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,967
-Thank you, Sagi.

245
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,434
-Hey.

246
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:10,934
-Huh?

247
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,867
-Naruto.

248
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,834
-Kakashi-sensei.

249
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,801
Neji, Tenten.

250
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:28,667
This stinks.

251
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,134
We don't get any bonus
now because of Moso.

252
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,601
The person who signs the
paychecks was the bad guy.

253
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:34,734
-It's not that bad.

254
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,867
-Yeah, it is.

255
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,467
-It looks like the
wandering ninja

256
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,701
are going to get a
pretty severe sentence.

257
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,101
-Good.

258
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,901
Now Toki will finally be able
to break this cycle of revenge.

259
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:44,667
[drumming]

260
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,767
-Hey, it's going to start.

261
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:50,167
-Everyone kneel before
the feudal lord.

262
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:53,534
-Oh.

263
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,501
-Oh, wow.

264
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,501
-My friends, I must
apologize to you

265
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:14,367
for falsely using my brother's
good name to deceive you,

266
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,601
and for not fulfilling
my duties as your daimyo.

267
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,201
I have done such wrong
that I should, perhaps,

268
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,801
relinquish my title
and pass it to another.

269
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,601
However, if somehow
you can forgive me,

270
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,467
I swear I will use my
position to reinvigorate

271
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:34,034
the Land of Birds for Owashi,
my late father, and Sagi,

272
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,534
my brother, and for
someone who loves

273
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:41,067
this land more than any other,
my dear friend Chishima.

274
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,301
-My lady.

275
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,601
-As long as I
shall live, I swear

276
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,701
I'll fight for the
sake of our land.

277
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:50,201
-She's doing a pretty
good job, isn't she?

278
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,667
-She's doing awesome.

279
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:56,267
-I am in full
agreement, Lady Toki.

280
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,001
And do you, the
people, also concur?

281
00:18:59,034 --> 00:18:59,701
-Yes, sir.

282
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,967
-I'm humbled.

283
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:07,801
Thank you, Komi, for accepting
me as your new feudal lord.

284
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,234
Thank you all.

285
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,167
And a special thanks to
someone who taught me

286
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:16,201
what the true focus of my
life should be, a young ninja.

287
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:17,467
-You're embarrassing me.

288
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:25,501
-Please, travel safe on the
road back to your village.

289
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:26,001
-Thanks.

290
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,201
We will.

291
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:30,034
-Chishima, keep an eye on
Lady Toki now, will you?

292
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,001
-Thank you again, Naruto.

293
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,334
-Yes.

294
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,734
And you all must come back
and visit us again very soon.

295
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:36,934
-You got it.

296
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,967
But next time, I'm gonna
come here for a vacation.

297
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,034
-Goodbye.

298
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:41,534
-All right.

299
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,501
Goodbye.

300
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:43,501
Be well.

301
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:44,367
-See you around.

302
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:54,634
That Lady Toki, she was so nice
and downright gorgeous too,

303
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,734
wasn't she?

304
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,767
-I'm certain she'll
make the Land of Birds

305
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,401
as wonderful as it once was.

306
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:00,801
-Mm hm.

307
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,734
-But the way, Naruto, is it true
you ran into the ghost of Sagi?

308
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,601
-What, are you kidding
me or something?

309
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:06,701
Come on.

310
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,501
There's no such thing
as a ghost, Tenten.

311
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,134
I was just having a dream.

312
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,734
-Well, I'm not so
sure it was a dream.

313
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,667
-You what?

314
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,034
Wait, what are
you talking about?

315
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,634
-Naruto, do you remember
the very first time

316
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,234
we encountered the
cursed warrior?

317
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:21,034
-Yeah, sure.

318
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,067
-Mm.

319
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,001
The armor was empty
inside, right?

320
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:34,901
-Ah!

321
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,301
It's empty.

322
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,734
But that can't be.

323
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:42,767
U-- unless-- I remember.

324
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:45,067
But wasn't that just
some kind of trick,

325
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,734
like a string or a wire?

326
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:47,934
-No.

327
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,101
I definitely saw someone
or thing with my Byakugan.

328
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,167
-Hold on.

329
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,201
Now that you mention
it, at the time,

330
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,167
didn't you say there
was no sign of life?

331
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:56,234
-Yes.

332
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,201
I could see the
cursed warrior, but I

333
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:00,467
couldn't sense even
a flicker of life.

334
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:02,501
-A ghost, in other words.

335
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,301
-No way!

336
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,101
You're telling me
I was standing face

337
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,701
to face with a real, life ghost?

338
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,601
-Calm down, Naruto.

339
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:10,101
-No.

340
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,067
No way.

341
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,234
You're kidding me.

342
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:15,634
Please tell me this is
just a really bad joke!

343
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,903
[theme music]

344
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:03,436
-Pork.

00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:03,903
-Chicken.

346
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,669
-Beef.

347
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:05,169
-Is this a guessing game?

348
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:05,669
-Sprouts.

349
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:06,203
-Spinach.

350
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,136
-Scallions.

-Oh, stir fried
beef and veggies.

352
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:08,536
-Egg.

-Seaweed.

355
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,903
-Um, a beef, vegetable,
and seaweed omelette?

356
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:12,703
-Pickled bamboo.

357
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,003
-Barbecued pork.

358
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:14,703
-Fish cake.

359
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:15,236
-I got it.

360
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,169
It's ramen.

00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:16,969

-Yeah, you should know by now.

with eggs on top.

00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:26,969
