00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,311
[theme music]

2
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,124
TSUNADE: There has been a
coup in the Land of Greens?

3
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,193
-Yes, it's been confirmed.

4
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,028
The lord of the land
has been overthrown

5
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,597
with the help of some
of his very own people.

6
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,199
-And Naruto's squad?

7
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,267
-Their progress from
their last known position

8
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,637
would bring them to
right about here.

9
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,406
TSUNADE: So they must have
already crossed the border.

10
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,975
-Well, the area's been
declared a demilitarized zone

11
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,276
by the neighboring lands.

12
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,179
And considering the nonmilitary
nature of Naruto's mission,

13
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,182
I'm sure he and the
others are safe.

14
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,350
-Hm, I'm not.

15
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,284
-But why?

16
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,053
What do you mean?

17
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,356
-These separate events
happening at the same time,

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,026
you really think
it's a coincidence?

19
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,460
-Are you saying the
mission to escort

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,163
the merchants is tied up
with the coup somehow?

21
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,098
-It seems more than likely.

22
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,601
In any case, we can't worry
about Naruto and the others

23
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,602
now.

24
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,170
The Land of Greens
must be recaptured

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,706
and the usurpers expelled
as soon as possible.

26
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,042
The longer things are left
like this, the more likely

27
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,710
a full-scaled war
will break out.

28
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,744
-That's true.

29
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,380
-Shizune, summon
every available ninja

30
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,016
and get them ready to move
on the Land of Greens.

31
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,051
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,132
-OK.

33
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,634
Now, you've made me mad!

34
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,571
-Stubborn little brat!

35
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,039
-Ugh!

36
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:26,973
-Hah!

37
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,076
You won't get up again.

38
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,712
-Naruto!

39
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,714
-I hate to disappoint you.

40
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,582
-Hey, impressive!

41
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,184
At least, you have some spirit.

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,352
But try getting up from this.

43
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,455
Ninja Art Magnet!

44
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,723
Electromagnetic Illusion!

00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,196
[static noise]

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,001
-Naruto!

47
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,369
-Save your breath.

48
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,705
He can't hear you.

49
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,475
My magnetic sand interferes
with the electric impulses

50
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,076
in his brain.

51
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,478
Huh, hear you?

52
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,181
Right now, he can't
even think straight.

53
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,517
Rrrh!

54
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,485
-Ugh!

55
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,320
-And now, this
magnetized cable is

56
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,188
going to take you
down, literally!

57
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:15,589
Rrgh!

58
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:19,526
-No!

59
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,467
-[grunts]

60
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,468
-Are you all right?

61
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
-Aah!

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,410
[gasping]

63
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,012
-Thank goodness.

64
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,481
-Get out of here.

65
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,716
Go on.

66
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,717
-Mm-hm.

67
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,286
I'm not going to leave you.

68
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,656
-Hinata, he's too strong--
more than you can handle.

69
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,326
Huh?

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,327
-No way.

71
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,363
I won't let him have you.

72
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,697
-Hinata!

73
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,200
[groans]

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,536
-Hah, don't even try.

75
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,738
Just tell me where the girl is.

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,340
-Byakugan!

77
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,477
-Now, Electromagnetic Illusion!

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,480
-Protective 8
Trigrams, 64 Palms!

79
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:38,405
-What the-- I thought so.

80
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,740
That's the Byakugan
of the Leaf Village.

81
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,275
Hah, interesting.

82
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,711
The famous Byakugan, huh?

83
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,346
Let's find out how it works.

84
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,647
Can you see your
way out of this?

85
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,188
-Yes!

86
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:55,589
Hai!

87
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,096
It worked.

88
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,464
-Not even close.

89
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,066
I'm afraid it will
take a lot more

90
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,501
than that level of Taijutsu!

91
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,102
-Huh.

92
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,140
-[chuckles]

93
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,082
-Aah!

94
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,084
-Heh, hopeless.

95
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,453
-Aah!

96
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,054
[groans]

97
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,968
[gasping]

98
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,675
-Disappointing.

99
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,511
I expected more of a challenge.

100
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,513
Now, why don't we end this?

101
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,050
Just tell me where
you've hidden the girl.

102
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,319
Tell me and I may let you live.

103
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,420
The boy, too.

104
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,124
But you better hurry,
he hasn't got long.

105
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,992
-Uh.

106
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,728
-Run, Hinata, while you can.

107
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,363
-Tell me, where is she?

108
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,232
-No.

109
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,535
-Do you actually believe
you can defeat me?

110
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,272
Or is it just that you don't
care about saving the boy?

111
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,541
HINATA (VOICEOVER): If I tell
him what he wants to know,

112
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,444
Naruto will never forgive me.

113
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,979
-Huh!

114
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,181
And if that's that way you want
it, we'll do it the hard way!

115
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,588
I've just magnetized that
rock wall behind you.

116
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,092
I can turn any of these
rocks into a powerful magnet,

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,460
so you've nowhere to run.

118
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,072
Hm?

119
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,673
JIGA (VOICEOVER): Very clever.

120
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,009
She diverted them all
by throwing a paper bomb

121
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,077
at the last minute.

122
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,183
Not quite all.

123
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,289
You won't get away.

124
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,457
-[gasping]

125
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,533
-Hinata.

126
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,235
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Don't worry, Naruto.

127
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,403
I'll come back for you.

128
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,371
I promise.

129
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,275
He's too powerful.

130
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,244
I can never defeat him.

131
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,580
Can I even survive against him?

132
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,061
He's caught up with me already?

133
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,062
What do I do?

134
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,002
Uh, what's this?

135
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,372
Some kind of iron sand?

136
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,573
Oh!

137
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,309
That's what he was doing--
knocking off the iron sand

138
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,311
that his magnetized
body had attracted.

139
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,718
That's why he didn't
attack me right away.

140
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,687
He had to shake off the
magnetic sand from his body.

141
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,690
If he doesn't, he'll
attract the very weapons

142
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,292
he uses against us.

143
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,695
That explains his pattern of
attack-- alternating Ninja Art

144
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,298
Magnet with the
Iron Sand Gejutsu.

145
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,700
It's as if he has to
give himself enough time

146
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,670
to turn his magnetized
body on and off.

147
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,675
Perhaps there is a way
to defeat him after all.

148
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,643
-Enough of this!

149
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,178
Play time's over!

150
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,549
Give up.

151
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,117
Can't you see it's pointless?

152
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,053
-Not while there's still
breath left in my body!

153
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,256
Giving up is not
part of my ninja way!

154
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,524
-It's your funeral!

155
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,093
-Naruto is my friend.

156
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,296
I will never forgive you
for what you did to him!

157
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,565
-You'll join your friend
in the spirit world

158
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,001
after you've told me
where the girl is!

159
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:02,435
Eeyah!

160
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,043
Now, don't be shy.

161
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,312
Come a little closer!

162
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,248
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Now, Hinata,
you only have one chance.

163
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,585
Make it count!

164
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,185
-Hai!

165
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,758
-Uh!

166
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,428
-Heh, did you think
that same attack

167
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,063
would work at me
better this time?

168
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,435
-Yes, I did.

169
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,704
-Huh?

170
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,304
Hrngh.

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,709
-No!

172
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,146
-[gasping]

173
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,984
The only one who's going to
the spirit world are you and I!

174
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,317
-Ugh!

175
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,352
Ugh!

176
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:52,752
Aargh!

177
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:05,265
What do you think you're doing?

178
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,267
Get off!

179
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,635
-Argh!

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,638
Ugh!

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,574
-Little fool, you annoy me.

182
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,309
I've changed my mind.

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,311
I'm going to finish you off now.

184
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:18,711
Huh?

185
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,018
Huh?

186
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,019
What?

187
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,655
What the devil's going on?

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,392
-Just now, I hit one
of your chakra points,

189
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:37,230
disrupting the flow of
chakra through your body.

190
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,500
And now, your body
is a powerful magnet

191
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,136
that you can't switch off.

192
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,340
-That's why you led me to
this canyon full of iron sand.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,174
Urgh!

194
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,409
Make it stop.

195
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,745
Urrgh, urgh.

196
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,348
-I did it.

197
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:59,319
Naruto, I-- um, mm.

198
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,372
-I can't move at all.

199
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,707
SPEAKER: Human Boulder!

200
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,178
Yaah!

201
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,617
Naruto.

202
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,053
-[gasping]

203
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,456
Choji.

204
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,258
Uhh.

205
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,560
-You sure you're
all right, Naruto?

206
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,096
-Yeah, I'm sorry, Yurinojo.

207
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:43,630
-For what?

208
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,698
What happened?

209
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,135
I was attacked by that second
ninja, and I let him beat me.

210
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,204
-What about Hinata
and the princess?

211
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,572
-Hinata!

212
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,673
I got to get going!

213
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,609
-Oh, Naruto, you're in
no shape to go anywhere.

214
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,111
-She's in danger!

215
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:58,511
-Hold on.

216
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,112
Wait!

217
00:12:59,145 --> 00:12:59,512
-Naruto!

218
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,028
-Hinata!

219
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:19,999
Aaah!

220
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,510
-Hinata, are you OK?

221
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,045
-Hinata?

222
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,713
Hinata?

223
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,982
-Naruto, you're here.

224
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,251
And Choji?

225
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:38,651
Yurinojo?

226
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,555
You did this.

227
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,491
You did this all just for me?

228
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,293
-Sure, what did you expect?

229
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,662
What do you think
friends are for?

230
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,764
-Uh, yeah.

231
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,468
-Say, where did Mr.
Magnet Man get off to?

232
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,203
-He won't bother us anymore.

233
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,238
He's buried under the sand.

234
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,206
-He's what?

235
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,207
You mean, you did it?

236
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,209
You really beat him?

237
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,577
-Yeah.

238
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,480
Well, I mean, I
did what I could.

239
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,682
-Man, Hinata, you're amazing!

240
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,385
You saw how well I handled him.

241
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,622
-Uh, you don't know what that
means coming from you, Naruto.

242
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,326
Uh, look, Naruto, it's yours.

243
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,394
-My headband?

244
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,530
But where did you-- ah.

245
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,200
-Our mission is far
from being over.

246
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,469
There is still Princess Haruna.

247
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,738
You must find her
and protect her.

248
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,672
-Don't worry.

249
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,344
I'm going to take care of it.

250
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,146
And I swear to you
by this headband,

251
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,349
I'll make sure nothing
happens to her.

252
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,387
Besides, I can't let you go
around making me look bad.

253
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,721
[chuckles]

254
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,256
-Of course not.

255
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,624
-You guys, stay.

256
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,025
Look after Hinata.

257
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,027
Can you do that?

258
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:55,695
-Right.

259
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,163
-We'll take care of her, Naruto.

260
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,476
-Well, who would have thought?

261
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,246
Ruiga and Jiga have
both been defeated.

262
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,650
Ha, it saves me the trouble.

263
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:28,628
But still, there's not a person
alive who can defeat my jutsu.

264
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,763
I sense today is going
to be a sunny day.

265
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,504
-Haruna, are you here?

266
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,072
Huh?

267
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:49,081
Is that-- it's her!

268
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:49,749
Haruna!

269
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,617
Haruna!

270
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,585
-[groans]

271
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,355
-Are you OK?

272
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,228
-Hm.

273
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,629
-[sighs]

274
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,097
You had me worried for a second.

275
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,432
-Uhh.

276
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,400
-Aaah!

277
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,734
What are you doing?

278
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,603
It's me!

279
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,204
-What?

280
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,038
Naruto?

281
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,739
-I came to help you.

282
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,108
What was that all about?

283
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,478
-I'm sorry.

284
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,214
-What do you mean running
off all by yourself anyway?

285
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,982
-I'm all alone now.

286
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,418
I can't depend on anyone.

287
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,488
The rest of you are only
here to assure my survival,

288
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,490
nothing else.

289
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,359
As long as I survive, there's
a chance the Land of Greens

290
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,228
can be restored.

291
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,431
That's all that really
matters in the end, isn't it?

292
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,399
I am the rightful heir.

293
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,437
I must reclaim the power
that is rightly mine.

294
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,739
Once I'm lord of
the Land of Greens,

295
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:50,476
the people will flock to serve
me, their faith restored.

296
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,013
The land will be again
what it once was.

297
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,114
-You think?

298
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,216
I'm not so sure about that.

299
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,751
-Are you saying
the Land of Greens

300
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,486
can never be great again?

301
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,354
-No!

302
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,055
No, that's not what I meant.

303
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,727
But I was thinking if
I lived in your land,

304
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:17,737
was one of your people, if I was
a ninja, like Yurinojo-- what

305
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,572
I'm trying to say
is I don't think

306
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,075
I'd be able to serve
a lord like you.

307
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,277
-How dare you?

308
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,511
How dare you say that?

309
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,280
What can you possibly
know about it?

310
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,215
You know nothing of
what I've gone through,

311
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,552
living my life as a hostage
ever since I was a child.

312
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,555
Surrounded by strangers,
watched 24 hours a day,

313
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,657
never getting to do what I want!

314
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,458
You have no idea
of the loneliness.

315
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,196
I couldn't take it.

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,066
Eventually, I became
very, very ill.

317
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,337
I almost died before my parents
finally let me come home.

318
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,605
Say it.

319
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,508
If you think something's wrong
with that, say it, Naruto.

320
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,410
Could it be wrong
when it was all

321
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,479
for the sake of
the Land of Greens?

322
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,348
Is it wrong for a
mother and father

323
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,518
to send their child away to live
among strangers as a hostage?

324
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,653
Is it, Naruto?

325
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,387
Answer me!

326
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,099
I depend on no one.

327
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,235
I will do this on my own.

328
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,203
-Hold on.

329
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,607
I'm coming with you.

330
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,076
Like it or not, I made
a promise to Hinata.

331
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,410
And I'm going to protect you.

332
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,348
-To Hinata?

333
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,252
-She got pretty badly
injured fighting

334
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,188
that second ninja
who was after you.

335
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,056
-She what?

336
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,158
But I was sure that
you and the rest

337
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,395
have decided that protecting
me wasn't part of your mission.

338
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,564
If that's true, why
are you doing this?

339
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,499
-It's just the way we are.

340
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,103
We don't like it when see
somebody getting a raw deal,

341
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,306
even if that somebody
is maybe not, well,

342
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,577
the nicest person in the world.

343
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,145
But that's not important.

344
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,480
There's a narrow
canyon up ahead.

345
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,315
And we've got to get through it.

346
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,983
The village is on
the other side.

347
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,419
And hopefully, they
won't follow us there.

348
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,187
Come on, let's go!

349
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:15,588
-Uhh.

350
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,467
-Be careful where you step.

351
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,170
This deer trail hasn't
been used for ages.

352
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,039
They'll never think of
looking for us here.

353
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,206
[crackling]

354
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,607
-Huh?

355
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,079
Huh?

356
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,188
-Sorry to disappoint you.

357
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,023
All that trouble for nothing.

358
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:55,327
There's nowhere on earth
you can hide from me.

359
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,696
-Urgh.

360
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,631
Ugh.

361
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,231
-Huh?

362
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,633
Choji!

363
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,602
-Needless to say,
resistance is futile.

364
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,604
You may all consider
yourselves my hostages.

365
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,210
Take the three of them
back to the castle at once.

366
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,379
-My lord.

367
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,748
-I wouldn't want any of
you getting hurt now.

368
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm about to use
some powerful jutsu.

369
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,753
Hm.

370
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,689
-[panting]

371
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,171
There it is, Haruna.

372
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,172
We're almost there.

373
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,046
Well, what are we
waiting for, then?

374
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,414
Let's go!

375
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,982
-Hm.

376
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:50,716
Ugh!

377
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,383
-Huh?

378
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,352
What is it?

379
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,653
-I'm OK.

380
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,155
[whistling]

381
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,223
-Uh-oh!

382
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:57,623
Ngh!

383
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,561
What was that?

384
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,496
MAN: Bravo!

385
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,730
-Huh?

386
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,000
MAN: I must commend you for
anticipating that attack.

387
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:08,968
-Who's that?

388
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,735
Where are you?

389
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,604
-[laughs]

390
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,639
I'm right up here.

391
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:19,111
You were so close, but you'll
never reach that village now.

392
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm afraid your
journey ends here.

393
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,191
[music playing]

394
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:03,716
-Oh, man, this guy's really
getting on my nerves!

395
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,252
Going on and on about
his all-powerful jutsu,

396
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,721
bragging about how
invincible he is!

397
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,422
Of course, he does have a point.

398
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:13,325
I haven't found any way to
get past his offenses yet.

399
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,195
And Haruna's injured,
so she's not much help.

400
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,529
In fact, we're cornered.

401
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,533
Come to think of it, maybe he's
got a reason to brag after all!

402
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,436
Next time, "Forecast Death!

403
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,973
Cloudy with a Chance of Sun."

404
