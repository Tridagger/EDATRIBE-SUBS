00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,850
NARUTO: Hey, where's
Sasuke's room?

5
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,152
NURSE: Sorry, no
visitors allowed.

6
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:50,021
NARUTO: What?

7
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:51,322
Are you kidding me?

8
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:52,657
NURSE: Those are the rules.

9
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,459
NARUTO: Ah, come on, lady!

10
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,628
-Naruto, this is a
hospital, keep it down.

11
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,162
NARUTO: Boy, am I
glad to see you.

12
00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,697
I gotta ask you a favor.

13
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,965
-Stop right there.

14
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,700
I already know what
you're going to ask.

15
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,201
So I've been looking
for someone that

16
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:07,572
can oversee your training
for the final rounds.

17
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:08,806
-Hold on!

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,276
Why can't you train me, Sensei?

19
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,478
-I have other matters to handle.

20
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,049
I don't have time to
deal with you, Naruto.

21
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,483
[groans]

22
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:19,284
-Hey!

23
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:20,818
Aha!

24
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:24,189
You're going to train Sasuke
aren't you, Kakashi Sensei.

25
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,091
-Now, now, don't complain.

26
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:29,761
Listen, I found you an even
better teacher than me.

27
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,529
-Well, who is it?

28
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:34,266
-It is I.

29
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:35,133
-Uh?

30
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,234
You!

31
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:39,371
You closet pervert.

32
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,472
-Such insolence.

00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:42,207
[music playing]

NARUTO: Ebisu Returns:
Naruto's Toughest Training Yet.

35
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:53,451
-No, no, no, not that guy.

36
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:55,788
-He's a what?

37
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,089
What did you call him?

38
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:58,056
-You're kidding me!

39
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,825
Of all the guys you
could've picked,

40
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,326
you pick this guy to train me?

41
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,260
What a joke!

42
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:03,962
He's weaker than I am.

43
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,231
-What makes you say that?

44
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:07,199
-I'm serious.

45
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,401
You should have seen him.

46
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,670
He saw my Harem jutsu once
and he fell to pieces.

47
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:12,971
Transform!

48
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:13,739
-Oh!

49
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,341
Master Ebisu.

50
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:16,342
Oh!

51
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,310
Master!

52
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:18,911
[screams]

53
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:23,749
-Oh no!

54
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:27,686
Not that again!

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,021
-Harem jutsu.

56
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:32,391
-Oh, it's nothing, just
a little joke we shared.

57
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,592
Haha.

58
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,994
(WHISPERS) Look,
I'll make you a deal.

59
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,529
Keep quiet about that
and I'll buy you anything

60
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,763
you want to eat.

61
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,233
Barbecue, ramen, you name it.

62
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,734
-Anything I want?

63
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,604
-Well, well, I had no idea
you two were acquainted.

64
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:46,840
[laughs]

65
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:49,843
-Yes, we go way back.

66
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:53,780
I will always be haunted
by that humiliation.

67
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,649
-I still don't get
why it has to be him?

68
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,551
I mean, anybody else.

69
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,019
-Look, you!

70
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,855
If it hadn't been for Kakashi,
who asked me this favor,

71
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,757
I would never
consider training you.

72
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,091
-Yeah, well then don't!

73
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:08,695
-Hey, hey, come on, you
two, let's calm down.

74
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:12,431
Listen, Naruto, you're
wrong about Ebisu Sensei.

75
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,033
He's a special jonin.

76
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,103
A private tutor, who
only trains the elite.

77
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,673
Frankly, he's a better
teacher than I am.

78
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:20,273
-Aww.

79
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,979
-Anyway, Naruto, I've got to
say that of the three genin

80
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,283
in Squad 7, you're the one
whose basic skills need the most

81
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,550
work.

82
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,287
That's what I want you to
focus on this time around.

83
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920
-Wait!

84
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,088
Hold on a second!

85
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,089
Are you honestly
saying that I'm not

86
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:39,526
as good as Sasuke or Sakura?

87
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,927
[sighs]

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,897
-Naruto, no matter how
many skills you master,

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,501
the fundamentals are,
well, fundamental and yours

90
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,969
could be improved.

91
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,638
So if you really want to
become strong then just

92
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,909
be quiet and pay attention.

93
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:59,646
All right, Ebisu Sensei, I
leave him in your capable hands.

94
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,982
-I'll do what I can.

95
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,151
[groans]

96
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:07,254
KAKASHI: I know it seems
harsh but trust me.

97
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,323
It's for your own good.

98
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,324
Just do your best.

99
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,561
-Well, come on.

100
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:15,362
Let's get started.

101
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,068
-OK but I don't buy it.

102
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,002
-Huh?

103
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,571
-This whole thing
is totally nuts!

104
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:26,841
Even if I do need to work on
my fundamentals, how the heck

105
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,308
are they supposed
to get better when

106
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,578
I've got a teacher who's
weaker at this stuff than I am?

107
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,382
-I beg your pardon but who do
you think you're calling weak?

108
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,350
-You do you think?

109
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:36,717
Who else is standing here!

110
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,219
-If this is all because of that
ridiculous and inappropriate

111
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,357
jutsu of yours, it took me
by surprise, that's all.

112
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,992
I wouldn't be too hasty to
judge my abilities based

113
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,362
on one incident a long time ago.

114
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:52,233
-Just 'cause you ended up flat
on your back and out cold.

115
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:56,271
-All right, then, let's
put it to a test, shall we?

116
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,038
-Huh?

117
00:05:57,072 --> 00:06:00,075
-Naruto, try and run away.

118
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,209
-Huh?

119
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,377
-I mean it.

120
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,145
I want you to try running
as fast as you can.

121
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:07,482
If you can get away from you,
I'll resign as your trainer.

122
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,749
-Is that a promise?

123
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,886
-Certainly, and
what's more, since I

124
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,520
know how much you
prefer Kakashi,

125
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:15,490
I think I can arrange to take
over enough of his other duties

126
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,158
so that he can be your trainer.

127
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:17,625
-Yeah?

128
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,927
Really?

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,228
-Of course.

130
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:22,597
An elite jonin never
goes back on his word.

131
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,334
But it's all contingent on
you being able to out run me.

132
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,770
-Man, this is the easiest
deal I've ever made.

133
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,205
So long, sucker!

134
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,075
[laughs]

135
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,783
-(LAUGHING) Piece of cake!

136
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,753
Eat my dust, you closet perv.

137
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,321
I'll send you a postcard.

138
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,329
Ha!

139
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,263
Lost him!

140
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,931
I guess now that
old sour puss will

141
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,600
have to admit he's dealing
with an exceptional ninja.

142
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,835
EBISU: Am I really?

143
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:00,436
Who?

144
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:08,210
If that's the best you can do,
we might as well stop right now

145
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,446
and save us both some time.

146
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,080
-Yeah?

147
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,448
Well, not so fast.

148
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,282
Just wait.

149
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,816
You haven't seen anything yet.

150
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,817
[pop]

151
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,419
I'm just getting started.

152
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:26,328
-Mm.

153
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,730
[panting]

154
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:38,074
-I gotta admit, he may
be a grumpy old stiff,

155
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:39,676
but he's better than I thought.

156
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:44,380
Keep moving.

157
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:51,253
[laughs]

158
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,200
[gasps]

159
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,907
EBISU (VOICEOVER):
Control yourself, Ebisu.

160
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,009
NARUTO: (LAUGHING)
There he goes again,

161
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,245
can't keep his
eyes off the girls.

162
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,151
-Just what do you think
you're doing, Naruto?

163
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:29,259
It was a good idea actually,
just not good enough.

164
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:33,130
-All right then,
give this a shot.

165
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,731
Shadow Clone jutsu.

166
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,671
Well, what are you waiting for?

167
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:45,542
Catch us if you can.

168
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,245
-Again, not bad.

169
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,981
However, you're not
the only one who

170
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,550
can perform the Shadow
Clone jutsu, my friend.

171
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:58,789
You can't get away.

172
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,260
-Not again!

173
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,569
That does it!

174
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,537
I've had enough of you!

175
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:14,538
[splat]

176
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,322
-All right, that's one down.

177
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,193
That's two down.

178
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,905
I've got you now!

179
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,273
[screams]

180
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,943
-Where do you
think you're going?

181
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:52,911
Ha!

182
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:53,878
Got you.

183
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,414
Hold it right there.

184
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:57,215
You don't.

185
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,850
I don't think so!

186
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,751
Take that!

187
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:01,853
And that!

188
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,255
[panting]

189
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,062
-Well, had enough?

190
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,597
[screams]

191
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,270
-Man!

192
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,605
You're a real pain,
you know that?

193
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,541
Why can't you just go
away and leave me alone!

194
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,776
-It wouldn't be much of
a chase if I did that.

195
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,714
I'm supposed to be trying
to catch you, remember?

196
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,483
-He's got a point.

197
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:34,085
-So Naruto, I hope
you have a better

198
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,087
opinion of my abilities now.

199
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,623
If you've had enough,
let's begin your training.

200
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:39,324
-Yeah, right.

201
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,227
Stick it in your ear.

202
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,563
I'm still going to get
rid of you somehow.

203
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:48,500
Kakashi is the only
one I'll let train me.

204
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:52,271
Either he trains
me or no one does!

205
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,606
-I see the river hasn't
cooled off your spirit.

206
00:10:58,877 --> 00:10:59,811
Look at him.

207
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,280
He's turned the tables.

208
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:04,516
Instead of trying to escape,
he's coming right at me.

209
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,787
Well, Kakashi always said he was
an unpredictable knuckleheaded

210
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,188
ninja.

211
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:11,356
-Time I gave you some training!

212
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,127
Huh?

213
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,729
It was a clone?

214
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,311
-Sorry Naruto.

215
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,913
This game is over.

216
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,176
-Rats!

217
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,924
WAITRESS: One plain
ramen and one miso ramen

218
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,127
with barbecue pork.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,796
MAN: There you go.

220
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,132
EBISU: Now, Naruto,
having had a chance

221
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,501
to observe your
technique firsthand

222
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,604
and going off what Kakashi
told me, it's clear to me

223
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:03,243
that one of your weakest
points is chakra control.

224
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,844
-Chakra control?

225
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,446
-Exactly.

226
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,614
When we compare your abilities
in this department with those

227
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,351
of your teammates,
Sakura and Sasuke,

228
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:14,387
your deficiency becomes obvious.

229
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,657
As you may know, in order to
successfully perform ninjutsu,

230
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,594
genjutsu, and the like, a ninja
must first build up his chakra.

231
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,528
-Yeah.

232
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:25,098
Like you said, I
already know that.

233
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:26,599
-I would hope so.

234
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:29,169
Well, then, let's compare
you to your teammates

235
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,704
in this department
and perhaps you'll

236
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:34,307
begin to see just how inferior
your abilities really are.

237
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,743
-You've got an annoying
way of putting things.

238
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:41,548
-As agreed, I'm buying you lunch
so just be quiet and listen.

239
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:46,252
First, let's examine how Sakura
prepares for a clone jutsu.

240
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,621
-Clone jutsu.

241
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:54,260
-She's perfect at building up
her chakra to its full extent

242
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,262
and because she's
so efficient, she

243
00:12:56,296 --> 00:13:01,167
can make clones without
wasting any excess energy.

244
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,838
And for Sasuke, it must be said
he's not nearly as efficient

245
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:09,109
when it comes to building
up a full supply of chakra.

246
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,043
-Clone jutsu.

247
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,817
-But you see, his
control over the chakra

248
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,786
itself is so flawless that
he has no problem producing

249
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,823
five clones as
easily as Sakura can.

250
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:25,592
So the result is the
same, even if Sasuke

251
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,962
does waste more chakra
in getting there.

252
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:30,397
-What do you know and I
thought Sasuke was perfect

253
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,432
in everything.

254
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,967
-Wipe that smile off your face.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,170
You are in no position to
make fun of anyone else.

256
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:38,072
-Why?

257
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:41,275
-You are no good at building up
your chakra or controlling it.

258
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,344
The result being you
require much more

259
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,080
chakra to produce to any clones.

260
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:47,348
NARUTO: What the?

261
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,617
EBISU: You have to
exert much more effort.

262
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,854
And even then, after all the
effort and wasting much more

263
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,356
chakra than either
Sakura or Sasuke.

264
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,825
-Clone jutsu.

265
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:00,628
-You can barely produce
two clones at best.

266
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,966
In fact, using the
same amount of chakra

267
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:08,503
you use, Sakura and Sasuke
could come up with 10 clones.

268
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,110
You see how the three of you
have very different levels

269
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,079
of ability just
on this one jutsu?

270
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,784
Oh well, I may have
been exaggerating

271
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,919
a bit in my comparison,
but the bottom line

272
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:27,622
is you waste too much of
your strength, Naruto,

273
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,324
and build up too much chakra.

274
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,426
You need to learn some
control, that's all.

275
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,727
-Yeah, well if
I'm such a lame-o,

276
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,429
how come there have
been times when

277
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,697
I've done better than they have?

278
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,265
-That's not the same thing.

279
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,701
That's only because you have
reserves of energy and stamina

280
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,003
that are hardly even human.

281
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,707
EBISU (VOICEOVER):
After all, how

282
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,577
can I expect him to have control
when he has the nine-tailed fox

283
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,047
spirits chakra
sealed within him.

284
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:58,020
The point is, we both know
you are strong, Naruto,

285
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,421
but you could be
so much stronger

286
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,223
if you'd let me show you how.

287
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:01,957
-Really?

288
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,125
You mean it?

289
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,160
-I not only mean
it, I guarantee it.

290
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:07,095
Now if you're
ready, let's begin.

291
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:09,031
MAN: Sir, your bill.

292
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,633
-Oh, I forgot.

293
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,673
[laughs]

294
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,141
EBISU: (SCREAMING) Naruto!

295
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:20,175
[cash register cha-ching]

296
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:20,876
WAITRESS: Thank you, come again.

297
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:33,121
-OK, you mind explaining
why you've dragged me

298
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:34,657
up here to these hot springs?

299
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,692
Is a bath part of my training?

300
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,328
Not that I'd mind soaking
my feet after that hike--

301
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,729
-Naruto!

302
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,498
Where do you think you're going?

303
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,999
That's the women's bath.

304
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,735
I will not allow any
disreputable behavior,

305
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:47,836
young man.

306
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,173
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Disreputable behavior.

307
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,774
What's he talking about?

308
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,043
Like I was trying
to sneak a peek.

309
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,644
Huh.

310
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,481
From what I know about him, he's
the real pervert around here.

311
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,085
-What is it?

312
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,152
What's that look?

313
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:03,987
-Oh, nothing.

314
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,088
Nothing.

315
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,691
Anyway, what in the
world are we doing here?

316
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:10,593
Are you going to train me
how to wash behind my ears?

317
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:14,964
-Not quite, but you're right,
it is part of your training.

318
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:15,564
-Huh?

319
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:19,536
-Right here.

320
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,904
This is the place.

321
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:21,638
-A bath?

322
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,372
OK, what's going on?

323
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,941
-Don't take that tone with me.

324
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:28,011
Like I told you before, this
is all part of your training.

325
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,647
-OK, maybe you ought to
try taking it from the top.

326
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,783
What am I training for again?

327
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,419
[chortles]

328
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,922
-I'm going to teach you
how to walk on water.

329
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:39,523
-Huh?

330
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,060
-What is it now?

331
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:47,797
-Do you seriously expect me
to believe that you really

332
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,466
know how to walk on water?

333
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,469
-Of course I do!

334
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,838
According to what
Kakashi told me,

335
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,406
you've already
been trained in how

336
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,109
to climb a tree without
using your hands, right?

337
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,411
This is a variation of that.

338
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,579
-I don't know.

339
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,014
That was a long time ago.

340
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,850
I'm not so good at remembering
stuff that far back.

341
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,853
-Well, in tree
climbing, the key is

342
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:11,055
to build up chakra in
the points of contact

343
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,324
and then to maintain at a
steady rate of discharge.

344
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,693
Of course, trees are
stationary objects

345
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:19,897
so the discharge rate
remains constant.

346
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,499
All the same, it's
an excellent exercise

347
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,135
for developing basic
chakra control.

348
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,872
Now, to walk on water, you not
only have to build up chakra

349
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:31,041
at the points of contact, you
must also constantly adjust

350
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,778
the rate of discharge in
order to maintain your balance

351
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,481
on the water's shifting surface.

352
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,948
-Mmm hmm.

353
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:39,550
-This is obviously more
difficult than just maintaining

354
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,619
a fixed flow of chakra.

355
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:43,754
But that's what chakra
control is all about,

356
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,991
being able to discharge it at
a steady aura to varying rate.

357
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,193
You understand?

358
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,961
-I wish I did.

359
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,932
-Well, perhaps it would be
easier if I just showed you.

360
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:59,337
First, built up chakra in
the soles of your feet.

361
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,105
Then carefully
calibrating the amount

362
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,975
you discharge from each foot in
order to maintain your balance.

363
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,648
There, you see?

364
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,250
That's how it's done.

365
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,652
-Cool!

366
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,854
OK, let me give it a try now.

367
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,959
First, build up
chakra in your feet.

368
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:24,762
And then calibrating
a whatever it is.

369
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,131
Ah!

370
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,132
-Not quite.

371
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,634
[screams]

372
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,503
-Oh, by the way, don't
forget it's a hot spring.

373
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:34,840
You don't want to keep
falling in like that.

374
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,075
You'll be boiled like a lobster.

375
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,544
-Very funny.

376
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,079
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can do this.

377
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,283
I got it now!

378
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,291
[splash]

379
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,793
Hot, hot, hot!

380
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,131
EBISU (VOICEOVER): Well, you
seem unusually diligent today,

381
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:00,732
Konahamaru.

382
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:04,736
Excellent.

383
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,039
It looks like my guidance
is finally paying off.

384
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,409
Isn't it about time you're
launching another surprise

385
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,844
attack against Lord Hokage?

386
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,181
-Naw, I don't do that
kind of thing anymore.

387
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,582
-That's astounding.

388
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,250
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

389
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:20,919
So you understand that the
shortcut to becoming Hokage

390
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,155
is to do exactly as I say.

391
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,992
-Well, there aren't
any shortcuts here.

392
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,427
-Huh?

393
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,097
-Naruto told me that.

394
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,267
He said I had to learn that
if I ever wanted to be Hokage.

395
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,475
-Whoa.

396
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:46,545
I'm actually
starting to get this.

397
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,047
EBISU (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

398
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,248
He's right.

399
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,918
To think that he's already
started to master it.

400
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:56,088
I never imagined that he
would have come so far.

401
00:19:56,122 --> 00:20:00,092
Indeed, there are no
shortcuts in anything.

402
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,629
Perhaps you were a better
teacher to Konahamaru

403
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:03,863
than I was.

404
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:07,066
It seems I was wrong
about you, Naruto.

405
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,837
There is more within
you than a demon spirit.

406
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,240
There is the heart of a splendid
Hidden Leaf Village ninja.

407
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,976
-Ahh!

408
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,646
[splash]

409
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,781
[laughter]

410
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,089
-Are you peeking in the
women's bath, old man?

411
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:32,192
I'm will not allow any
disreputable behavior.

412
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:37,998
-Oh please.

413
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:38,565
-Huh?

414
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,334
What on earth?

415
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,902
What are you doing?

416
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:55,515
-What's wrong with you?

417
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,784
Keep it down.

418
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:59,586
Do you want to get
us busted, you idiot?

419
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,555
-Huh?

420
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:03,924
Who is this guy?

421
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,293
He flattened my trainer.

422
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:10,430
And what's worse, he's an
even bigger perv than Ebisu.

423
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,935
[laughter]

424
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:22,164
[music playing]

425
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,156
NARUTO: I don't know
who he is, but no one

426
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:55,525
interrupts by training
and gets away with it.

427
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,028
Especially not some
perv in a fright wig,

428
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,595
riding a giant bull frog.

429
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,965
Guess I'll just have
to train on him.

430
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:06,336
Only thing is, I wish he
wasn't quite so fast or strong.

431
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,005
What is this guy, a super ninja?

432
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,930
Next time.

433
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:12,396
"Long Time No See,
Jiraiya Returns."

434
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,996
Oh, brother.

435
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,196
Again with the girls.

436
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,930
Can't anyone around here
keep his mind on the job?
