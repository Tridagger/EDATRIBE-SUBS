-I'm not really sure.

7
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,562
She collapsed so suddenly.

8
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:16,433
-I see.

We should get back to the inn.

00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:24,553
-Wait a minute, Shino, what's
going to happen to Isaribi?

12
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:25,890
-Who cares what happens to her?

13
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,794
She's the demon of the ocean.

14
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:29,365
-Yeah, I know, but--

15
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,971
-What exactly went on between
the two of you, anyway?

16
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:33,508
-What do you mean?

17
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,649
I told you before, didn't I?

18
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,253
That girl totally saved my butt!

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,675
-Uh, I'm very sorry.

23
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,952
It just slipped out of my hand.

24
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:19,554
-Ah.

25
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,805
-I'll get this
cleaned up right away.

26
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:27,741
-Anko.

27
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,679
-Yes?

28
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,549
-The work I've been doing here?

29
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,789
The Hokage already
knows about it.

30
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:34,791
-Understood.

[music playing]

32
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:49,460
-So you're telling us this
girl Isaribi saved your life?

33
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:50,763
-That's right.

34
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,871
If she hadn't come when she
did, I wouldn't even be here.

35
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:56,678
-That may be, but
there's no question

36
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,418
she's in league with
the men who attacked us.

37
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:02,759
And anyway, our
hands are tied here.

38
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,998
Our mission is to protect
the government's money,

39
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:07,370
and catch the
demon of the ocean.

40
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:08,474
-He's right.

41
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:09,977
I mean all you have
to do is look at her.

42
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,617
She's obviously this demon
thing we're looking for.

43
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,719
-Yeah, sure.

44
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,357
But there's got to be a
reason for all of this.

45
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,094
Maybe if we were to
go after her, then--

46
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:18,364
-Will you drop it already?

47
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:19,667
You're not going
to go after her.

48
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:22,541
You don't even have
a clue where to look.

49
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:23,376
-Actually, I might.

50
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:24,579
-Wait, for real?

51
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:25,381
But how?

52
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,918
-I overheard something.

53
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,355
There's an island
out here that's

54
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,931
at the heart of all those people
being taken away by spirits.

55
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,635
-So where do we find it?

56
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:36,575
-It's a barren crag where
the demon of the ocean lives,

57
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,711
Demon Island.

58
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,048
-Demon Island?

59
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,418
-Oh, sensei, you're up.

60
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,588
Are you feeling all right?

61
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,790
-Yeah, I am.

62
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,428
But forget about me.

63
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,468
There's something I need to
tell you guys about the demon.

64
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:50,075
This isn't some sea
creature we're dealing with.

65
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,779
Our demon was made in a lab.

66
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:53,049
It used to be human.

67
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:54,586
-Huh?

68
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:55,922

up like that again.

-Yes, sir.

73
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:51,859
-Look!

74
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,096
It's the monster!

75
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:53,764
-What monster?

76
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:54,532
-Get out of here.

77
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,201
-You're a bad omen.

78
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:58,041
-Yeah, take this!

79
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,043
-Hey, it's that girl.

80
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,549
The one who got taken
away by spirits.

81
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,855
-She was the only
one who came back.

82
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:06,194
-Yeah, steer clear of her.

00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,700
[music playing]

84
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,159
-It used to be a human?

85
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,897
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,235
-A good number of people
did mysteriously vanish

87
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,207
in the Land of the
Sea 10 years ago,

88
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,744
but it wasn't
because of any demon.

89
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,219
They were being snatched up
and used as test subjects.

90
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:33,727
In experiments
conducted by Orochimaru.

91
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,218
-Orochimaru.

92
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:40,578
So you're telling me he's
mixed up in this somehow?

93
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:41,948
-I don't understand, though.

94
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:42,951
Orochimaru?

95
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:43,953
An experiment?

96
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,124
Where is all this coming from?

97
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,230
-I think I'd better
start at the beginning,

98
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:51,271
back when he left the village.

99
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:54,746
More than 10 years
ago, Orochimaru's lust

100
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,820
for knowledge and power
became so insatiable

101
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,861
that he gradually exceeded
the normal limitations

102
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:04,135
of a shinobi, and
began experimenting

103
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,873
with forbidden jutsu.

104
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,057
-Oh, such a pity.

105
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,195
-Of course this all
became common knowledge

106
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,065
in the Leaf Village.

107
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:20,809
-After him!

108
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,747
-Don't let that
traitor get away!

109
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:30,399
-But his missions had taken
him far and wide in this world.

110
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,306
The Hidden Leaf Village
wasn't the only place

111
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,046
he had research
facilities set up.

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,090
-And one of those is hidden
on Demon Island, I take it.

113
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:44,033
-So the people who disappeared?

114
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,372
-Human guinea pigs.

115
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,408
-That psychotic lunatic.

116
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,649
What the heck does
he think people are?

117
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,053
-So what's our next move?

118
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,155
-Isn't it obvious?

119
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:54,893
We bust into their hideout.

120
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:58,769
We're going to march right in
and get Isaribi out of there.

121
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,407
-Sounds like a plan.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,948
Let's pay the demon of the
ocean a visit, shall we?

123
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:04,917
[waves]

124
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:13,004
-So sensei, how exactly
do you know so much

125
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,376
about this Demon Island, anyway?

126
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,849
-Orochimaru was the
was the Jonin I trained

127
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,386
under back in the day.

128
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,956
What

129
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:22,293
-Oh!

130
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:27,171
-Tell me when we get
close to the island.

131
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,745
The pain is getting worse.

132
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,125
-Someone draws near.

133
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,965
-So what do you
think we should do?

134
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:40,203
-I leave that to you.

135
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:40,772
-All right.

136
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:44,380
-Hm.

137
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,285
The arrogance.

138
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,223
He'll get his soon enough.

139
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:49,159
[waves]

140
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:58,080
-Oh.

141
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,019
-This way.

142
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:00,542
-Hurry!

143
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,881
-How's it look, Shino?

144
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,551
-We're good.

145
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,088
-OK.

146
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,058
[footsteps]

147
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,380
-So one of their
ships is on the move?

148
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,820
Well, perfect timing.

149
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:28,822
Well done.

150
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,359
Sending you back
to Mother Island

151
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,297
really paid off then, huh?

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,533
What's the matter?

153
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,009
You look a little pale today.

154
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:40,484
-Do you think I'll ever
be, be normal again?

155
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:43,024
I've gathered information
on the ships docked back

156
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:45,897
at the village, just
like you told me to.

157
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:48,136
I've pillaged them for you.

158
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:48,904
So--

159
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,074
-I cannot believe this.

160
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:51,611
You're not serious, are you?

161
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,482
You're my magnum opus child.

162
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,888
I mean, you're the
prototype for this project.

163
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,626
You know what the deal is.

164
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,866
The data that you're
generating is invaluable.

165
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,440
Besides, your total
cooperation was

166
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,611
one of the conditions
of our agreement.

167
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,383
Look, don't worry.

168
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,390
We'll have all the data
we need pretty soon.

169
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,428
I'll honor my promise.

170
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:15,268
Just as long as you don't
give me any reason not to,

171
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,638
is that clear?

172
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:17,641
-Yes.

173
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,281
-Well then, if it
is, why don't you

174
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,987
go and keep our
guests company, dear?

175
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:23,512
-Very well.

176
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,039
-You really are
cruel, you know that?

177
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:37,122
-It doesn't look like
anyone's home right now.

178
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:37,646
-Sh!

179
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:51,958
-So what do you guys think
they're doing in here?

180
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:52,434
-Birds?

181
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,136
Or fish?

182
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:07,003
-Easy.

183
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,071
You're in a tight spot now, huh?

184
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:10,043
You should never have
messed with Shinobi

185
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:11,413
from the Hidden Leaf.

186
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:15,390
You little!

187
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,760
[music playing]

188
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,719
[screaming]

189
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:48,571
-Everyone OK?

190
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,244
-You bet!

191
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,146
[laughter]

192
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,189
-What a joke.

193
00:11:56,223 --> 00:12:00,166
Don't you people get
tired of saving the day?

194
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,407
-You're the guy from last night.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,613
-I recognize that face.

196
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:08,853
The Chunin Exams,
if memory serves.

197
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,742
-Yeah, you're right.

198
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,649
He was matched up against
Sasuke, wasn't he?

199
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,155
-You mean the guy
who was with Kabuto?

200
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,224
-You got that right.

201
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,731
Of course that was the
last time I saw him.

202
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,201
It's been awhile now.

203
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,609
-He used a jutsu that siphoned
off his opponent's chakra.

204
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:34,383
-You were the guy who sucked
up all of Sasuke's strength.

205
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,318
I remember now.

206
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,524
-Well come and
get it, you three.

207
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,698
Let me show you just how
much I've changed since then.

208
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:41,366
-Fine.

209
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,235
Get ready, pal.

210
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,641
I'm going to put
your lights out.

211
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:45,710
-Naruto, wait.

212
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:46,378
-Why?

213
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:47,281
What is it?

214
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:48,718
-You go on ahead.

215
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,890
I think I'm better
suited for this.

216
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,627
-Huh?

217
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,873
-His jutsu will be a problem
for your style of close combat.

218
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:01,348
Besides, we can't all
stick around here.

219
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:01,917
-All right.

220
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,788
Wipe the floor with him.

221
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:05,358
-Be careful!

222
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:05,882
-Not so--

223
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,676
-Parasitic insects, huh?

224
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,693
[gasping]

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,191
[door creaking]

226
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,570
[music playing]

227
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:43,518
-Found him.

228
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,520
[footsteps]

229
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:49,949
What the?

230
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:56,984
-Welcome.

231
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,357
Or should I say,
long time, no see.

232
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,701
-What's going on here?

233
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,439
Amachi?

234
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:08,879
-I have to admit, I'm a little
surprised that you'd return,

235
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,319
after all that
happened back then.

236
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:12,889
-What are you talking about?

237
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,894
-You mean you don't remember?

238
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:17,768
-Look, I don't have time
to waste on you, OK?

239
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,806
Where is Orochimaru?

240
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,878
-Orochimaru?

241
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,382
-Cut the act.

242
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:24,518
He's here now, isn't he?

243
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,500
-So, the curse mark's acting
up, even after he split.

244
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,772
I wouldn't have guessed
that was possible.

245
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,643
Well, you're half right, anyway.

246
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:35,845
Orochimaru was here.

247
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,822
But that was well over two
weeks ago at this point.

248
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:40,758
-I don't believe you.

249
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:41,827
-Believe whatever you want.

250
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,464
It doesn't matter to me.

251
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:46,605
-So you mean to tell me that
the pain I'm feeling right now

252
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,549
is from him being here
close to a full month ago?

253
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:51,985
-Just a minute.

254
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,556
-Sensei!

255
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,959
-Hey, glad you could make it.

256
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,661
-Well, well.

257
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,833
You brought Genin.

258
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,408
Look at you, you're
all grown up now, Anko.

259
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,344
-Who is this clown?

260
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,814
-Meet Amachi.

261
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:06,387
He's a medical ninja who's
teamed up with Orochimaru,

262
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,593
and conducts research here.

263
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,664
His master's not around, though.

264
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:14,708
This whole rigmarole
is Amachi's doing.

265
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,846
-So he's behind it all.

266
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,087
You and your crazy
experiments are finished, pal!

267
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,056
-Crazy?

268
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,894
This isn't a joke.

269
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,902
I've devoted my entire
life to this research.

270
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,639
-Research, huh?

271
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:28,909
-Look here.

272
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:32,517
This girl is capable of adapting
to an aquatic environment.

273
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,756
Combining the ability
to breathe underwater

274
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:37,496
with advanced
strength and agility.

275
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,002
It's always been my
dream, a ninja corps

276
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,606
for underwater warfare.

277
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,812
And this girl here
is the first step.

278
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,917
-A ninja corps for
underwater warfare?

279
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,119
-That's right.

280
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:50,027
An unparalleled military
force that can move freely

281
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,865
on both land and sea.

282
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,538
Once I've done it, we'll
spread across the nations

283
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,880
and take complete control
of marine shipping routes.

284
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,617
Astounding, isn't it?

285
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,025
With that kind of strength,
the world will kneel before me,

286
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,166
and Orochimaru will rue the
day he abandoned my work.

287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,538
But it will be too late!

288
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,176
-These are people
you're talking about.

289
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,713
They're not your tools.

290
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:12,749
-Oh, that's a shame.

291
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,954
I figured someone
your age would have

292
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:17,427
grasped the
importance of my work.

293
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,797
Well, no big deal.

294
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:22,105
You're just another bunch of
brainless guinea pigs, right?

295
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,776
Who cares what you think.

296
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,079
-Oh yeah?

297
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:25,681
Ha!

298
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,034
-Thank you, Isaribi.

299
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,739
-Come on, out of the way.

300
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:36,708
-I'm not moving.

301
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,961
-Aw, come on.

302
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,768
Running in circles won't
get you anywhere, kid.

303
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,171
[rumbling]

304
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,180
-No!

305
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:02,737
-I don't get it.

306
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,208
Why are protecting this moron?

307
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:06,046
I mean, he's the one
who did this to you.

308
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,015
-I know!

309
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:10,524
But, but I don't
have a choice now.

310
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:13,631
He's the only person who can
turn my body back to normal

311
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:14,634
again.

312
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,541
He promised me that he would.

313
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:18,276
Here, look.

314
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,756
-What are you?

315
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,293
-Look at me.

316
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,198
People in this world
judge others based solely

317
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,701
on their appearance.

318
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:32,611
They stay away when they
see me covered in bandages.

319
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,315
Imagine what they'd
do if they saw

320
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:36,821
a monster covered in scales?

321
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,327
I just want my body back, OK?

322
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,663
I want to be human.

323
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:43,270
I'll do whatever it
takes to be myself again.

324
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,108
-But you still are human.

325
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,247
It doesn't matter
what you look like.

326
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,053
And yet you're attacking
ships with these guys

327
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,924
and sending them to the bottom.

328
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,996
It's not a face that
makes someone a monster,

329
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,636
it's the choices they
make with their life.

330
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:57,605
-Just shut up!

331
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:58,574
Stop it!

332
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,947
-But I didn't--

333
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,951
-I don't want to hear any more.

334
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,054
Just shut up!

335
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:07,864
Why does everyone have
to be so cruel to me?

336
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:09,834
-You don't get it.

337
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:13,978
You see, you and I, you
and I are exactly alike.

338
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:14,981
-Be quiet!

339
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,953
You're human, aren't you?

340
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,893
You have no idea what
I'm going through.

341
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:23,268
I, I only wish I was like you.

342
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,208
[crying]

343
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:28,180
-Now, now, don't cry.

344
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:33,727
I'll have you back to
normal in no time, Isaribi.

345
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:34,168
-Watch out!

346
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,822
-That paper bomb was
right on the money.

347
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,259
Thanks for distracting
them, Isaribi.

348
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,344
-Are you OK?

349
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,048
-Take care of it, will you?

350
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:56,949
-Got it.

351
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,656
-Isaribi, let's go.

352
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,296
-Wait a minute!

353
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,435
It's not too late yet.

354
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,678
Don't go.

355
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,395
-What say we get this
out of the way, everyone.

356
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,364
-Give it up.

357
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:17,700
It's over, friend.

358
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,073
You're one more guinea pig
for Amachi's collection.

359
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,489
An insect clone?

360
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,427
We both steal chakra
from our opponents,

361
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,699
so this won't be an

Nice work, Ino.

it is you're doing,

but you'd better let go of me.

This isn't fair.

would find this place.

make it in time, huh?
