1
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,130
-Gaara.

2
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,698
-Kankuro.

3
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,001
-Gaara.

4
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:43,701
-Primary Lotus!

5
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,607
-I'm at the end of my rope.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,976
I can't hold on any longer.

7
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:53,945
-[laughing]

8
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,780
-You're staring
death in the face.

9
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,482
Shouldn't you be
screaming for mercy?

10
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,884
Huh?

11
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,853
-[laughs]

12
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:04,455
-Now die!

13
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,224
-You're mine!

14
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,458
-You're gonna die, kid!

15
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:11,162
Wipe that grin off your face!

16
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,131
-[scream]

17
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:18,703
-What the--

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,677
-[scream]

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,046
-Who are you?

20
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:35,987
-What do you know?

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,990
Looks like we're
on the same side.

22
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:47,932
-Who are you?

23
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,535
-Allies of the Leaf Village.

24
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,903
-We're shinobi.

25
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,471
-Of the Sand.

26
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,454
-Yeah.

27
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:11,856
Well, careful getting home.

28
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:12,457
-OK.

29
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,696
-I'll see you next time
you need to be rescued.

30
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,599
Just let me know and I'll
come, you big crybaby.

31
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,701
-You girls are all alike.

32
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:27,138
You had to get the
last word in, huh?

33
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,107
-[laughing]

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,110
-Hmph.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,679
-We owe you for that one.

36
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,048
Time we paid you back!

37
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:52,697
-What's up, Shikamaru?

38
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,599
What's the matter?

39
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,501
-We're going to
wait here for now.

40
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,535
-Wait here?

41
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,836
Are you out of
your mind, or what?

42
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,572
It's no time to
be taking a break.

43
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:02,740
-Put a lid on it, Naruto.

44
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,909
-[barking]

45
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:05,877
-That's right.

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,978
Shikamaru's leading
this mission,

47
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,479
not you, you knucklehead.

48
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:09,314
-Yeah.

49
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:09,814
Come on.

50
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,854
Get with it.

51
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:13,584
You have to obey
your leader, Naruto.

52
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:14,185
-Hmph!

53
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:14,785
Fine.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,701
Whatever.

55
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,506
-I'm counting on you, Shino.

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,008
[theme song]

57
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,759
-What's happening?

58
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,194
Are they still coming?

59
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:30,662
-Oh, yes.

60
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,098
We made sure that by leaving
tracks, they couldn't miss.

61
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,167
They're hot on our
trail, all right.

62
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,175
It's perfect.

63
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,744
They'll be within range shortly.

64
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,513
There are three of
them, including Gaara.

65
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,182
-As for the other
two, divvy them up

66
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,618
however you like, and take
them on in one to one combat.

67
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,489
Meanwhile, I'll lure Gaara into
the reverse scale position.

68
00:05:57,522 --> 00:06:00,058
-OK, but I get
first crack at them.

69
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:00,692
-All right.

70
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,526
You're on.

71
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:18,577
-Hokyo's clever little plan is
a waste of time, if you ask me.

72
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,112
There's only three of them.

73
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,180
No reason I can't take
care of them myself.

74
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,520
Kujaku, double edged sword!

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,488
Tempest wind!

76
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:37,129
-What's going on?

77
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,665
-A wind user.

78
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,700
Just my thing.

79
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:00,819
-Excellent.

80
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,521
-Not bad, Temari.

81
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,022
-What did you expect?

82
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,123
-Not bad at all.

83
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:17,636
Not everyone can blow
away my tempest wind.

84
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,570
And look at you.

85
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,572
You're just a kid.

86
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,541
Ha.

87
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,942
-You two go on ahead.

88
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:24,976
-What?

89
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,112
You're good taking
her on by yourself?

90
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,647
-Are you sure of this?

91
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:29,181
-No problem.

92
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,483
We're two peas in a pod.

93
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:35,086
She and I are going to
swap wind jutsu techniques.

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,189
Get moving, Gaara.

95
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,158
Save your student.

96
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,526
-You're right.

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,594
Thank you.

98
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:43,595
-Be careful.

99
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,729
-Right.

100
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,531
-You're finished!

101
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,133
-I was about to
say the same thing.

102
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,668
Cyclone scythe jutsu!

103
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:56,908
-Wind slash!

104
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,084
-What kind of wind?

105
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,854
-My twin swords can twist
the wind in counter currents,

106
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,222
increasing its power.

107
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,191
You've only just begun
to see what I can do!

108
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,560
Having second thoughts?

109
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:18,663
With these, I need only
a fraction of my chakra.

110
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,599
You have to use all of yours.

111
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,501
How long can it last?

112
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,503
I guess we'll find out.

113
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,655
-Matsuri.

114
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,948
There they are.

115
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:37,949
-Where am I?

116
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,653
-So, you're awake.

117
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,787
Good.

118
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,824
You'll see the trap unfold
as you lure your teacher

119
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,659
right into it.

120
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,961
-Huh?

121
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:50,595
Gaara-sensei!

122
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,036
-Dragon eye, fang release!

123
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,037
Dark sword!

124
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,043
-What the heck?

125
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,664
-[laughing] What do you think?

126
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,234
Bet you've never seen
a sword like this one.

127
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,502
-He's just a kid!

128
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:34,573
Hmph.

129
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:35,640
I get it.

130
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,176
That sword's made up
of sections connected

131
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,180
by a wire running
through the center of it.

132
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,214
What do you know?

133
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,483
It's like one of
those bamboo snake

134
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,919
puppets I used to scare
people with when I was a kid.

135
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,058
What are you planning to
do with that kids' toy?

136
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:57,796
I hope you got something better
than that up your sleeve.

137
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,632
Because I'm warning you, little
man, when it comes to puppets,

138
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,601
you're playing with the master!

139
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,635
You go on ahead.

140
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,903
-I can leave him to you?

141
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:05,737
-Yeah.

142
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,571
Don't worry.

143
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,939
He's not worth your trouble.

144
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,907
I'll catch up with you.

145
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,209
-You got it.

146
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,145
-OK, sonny, I'll play with you.

147
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,748
-I wouldn't be so
confident if I were you.

148
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,651
It could be the last
mistake you ever make.

149
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,120
-Kid, you're going
to get a spanking.

150
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:26,725
-I'm going to wipe that
makeup right off your face!

151
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:27,492
-Let's play!

152
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,243
-Gotcha!

153
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,612
What, is that it?

154
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:52,183
I wasn't expecting
much, but come on.

155
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,120
Huh?

156
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,655
How did he--

157
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,526
-Now are you starting to get it?

158
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,095
This sword is hardly
a child's toy.

159
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,164
I only have to exert
a tiny bit of chakra,

160
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,166
and it amplifies it
tenfold and channels it

161
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,636
into the form of a dragon.

162
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,637
-Gaara, sorry.

163
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:18,576
This could take
longer than I thought.

164
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,179
-Suiko, this is the spot
to stop and ambush him.

165
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,248
Draw him into the
reverse scale position.

166
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,743
Got it?

167
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,302
-Got it.

168
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,529
[yelling]

169
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:41,800
[laughing] This is as
far as you go, Gaara.

170
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,469
Unless you go through me.

171
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,638
-If you insist, fine.

172
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,494
-Hey, Shikamaru!

173
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,696
How long are we
supposed to wait?

174
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,997
-Use your head.

175
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,766
You can't just throw
an ambush together.

176
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,801
You've got to set
it up, and it means

177
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,837
doing reconnaissance,
which is what Neji, Shino,

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,739
and Hinata are doing
for us right now.

179
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,974
-They're doing what?

180
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,486
-So you found them.

181
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,668
Byakugan!

182
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,366
-I see.

183
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,301
They're just up ahead.

184
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:49,898
Byakugan!

185
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,217
-Understood.

186
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,352
Three separate battle zones.

187
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,600
-This sack carries the
scent of the female.

188
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,202
As long as you keep
it on you, they'll

189
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,871
find you no matter how
far away you may be.

190
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,506
-OK, guys.

191
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,908
We're counting on you.

192
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,843
-We'll be off, then.

193
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,279
-Be careful.

194
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:33,913
-That's it.

195
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,648
The news I was waiting for.

196
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,482
-Good!

197
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,850
I was starting to cramp up.

198
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,617
-OK.

199
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,518
What's the word?

200
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,825
-Well, that's a drag.

201
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,961
Things have already
gotten started.

202
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,931
All right, Kiba and Choji
take to the west forest.

203
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,500
Ino and I will take the
hills to the northeast.

204
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,637
Naruto and Lee, take
the northwest forest.

205
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,607
We'll operate in
backup squads of two.

206
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,675
Ready?

207
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,344
Let's begin Operation
Return The Favor.

208
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,139
-Right!

209
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,846
-[bark]

210
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,882
-Finally some action!

211
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,649
-Move out!

212
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,563
-What is it?

213
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,332
-Let's hold up a minute.

214
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,469
If they're really
trying to get away,

215
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,938
why would they stop and
turn on their pursuers?

216
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,209
Take them one by one,
in separate battles.

217
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,378
Unless it's a trap!

218
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:39,878
-Huh?

219
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,747
-Just to be safe.

220
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,495
-That should do it.

221
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,262
Let's go.

222
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,218
-Right.

223
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,252
-Aww, nowhere left to hide,
and you feel helpless.

224
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,787
Poor thing.

225
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,356
-She can take everything
I throw at her.

226
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,758
I've got no choice.

227
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,326
I have to try it.

228
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:33,499
-Wind style sea dragon!

229
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,572
-I'm waiting.

230
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,941
Isn't something
supposed to happen?

231
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,477
[laughing] It
looks like the wind

232
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,579
has turned its back on you.

233
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,781
-I wouldn't be so sure.

234
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,221
The wind and I are good friends.

235
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,344
-Then let the battle
begin in earnest!

236
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:19,845
Wind reversal!

237
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,489
-[screaming]

238
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,764
-Get off!

239
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,734
Get off, you-- ugh!

240
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,901
-What a shame.

241
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:43,902
The game's over already?

242
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,339
I expected to have
a lot more fun.

243
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,241
-[grunting]

244
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,612
-Hm?

245
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,347
Now that's more like it.

246
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,357
I wonder what kind
of toy this is.

247
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:18,403
-[groaning]

248
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:18,937
-Ha!

249
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,339
You're so pathetic.

250
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,442
Is this silly little puppet
the only trick you have?

251
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:27,446
-Better than that piece
of junk you've got.

252
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,469
-Damn!

253
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,537
The dragon has three heads.

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,474
-You're quick, when
you're running away.

255
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,209
-It's no use.

256
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,578
Crow's playing at
a disadvantage when

257
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,613
he's not teaming up
with the black ant.

258
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,405
-Well done, Gaara of the Desert.

259
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,476
Just how much of your chakra
is that sand infused with?

260
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,445
-You really want to know?

261
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,849
Very well, but it's
gonna cost you your life.

262
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,456
Sand coffin!

263
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,709
-It can't be.

264
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,310
-Thank you.

265
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,879
That was very refreshing.

266
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,347
-But how?

267
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,983
How could you break out?

268
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,517
-It's my armor.

269
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,585
It absorbs chakra.

270
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,420
It feeds on it.

271
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,863
-Aww, are we tired?

272
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,999
Well, don't let me wake you.

273
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,367
You can sleep forever!

274
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,341
How did she--

275
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,314
-[groans]

276
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,490
-I almost came too late for
my shadow possession jutsu.

277
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,299
-Playtime's over!

278
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,635
-Oh no.

279
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,236
-What?

280
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,888
-I-it's you guys!

281
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,357
-And who are you?

282
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,626
-Who are you?

283
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,227
-Allies of the Sand.

284
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:29,995
-We're Shinobi.

285
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,530
-Of the Leaf Village!

286
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,832
-So you better watch out!

287
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,933
They're not here.

288
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,701
-Just up ahead!

289
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,569
-Right!

290
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,603
-Don't worry, guys.

291
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,672
It's a straight up battle.

292
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:46,244
No sign of chakra surges
anywhere in the valley.

293
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,647
There is no trap.

294
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,216
-Good luck, everyone.

295
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,318
-I've got your back, guys.

296
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,265
-Gaara-sensei.

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,344
-Hang on.

298
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,346
We're coming, Gaara.

299
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,349
We owe you one, and
we haven't forgotten!

300
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,425
[theme song]

301
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:03,816
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

302
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,619
So that's what these guys
have been after all this time.

303
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,788
Gotta hand it to
them, they're really

304
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,623
using the terrain
to their advantage.

305
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:14,694
If we don't turn the tables
quick, Gaara's in big trouble.

306
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,462
But they got us pinned down.

307
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,797
What a drag.

308
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,534
Naruto, Lee, I hope you
guys are on the way.

309
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,436
You're the only ones
who can save him!

310
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,604
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time!

311
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:25,471
Sealed Sand!

312
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,340
The Counterattack!
