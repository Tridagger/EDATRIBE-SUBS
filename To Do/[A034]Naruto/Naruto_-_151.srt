[theme music]

2
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:53,669
HINATA: "Blaze Away, Byakugan!

3
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,344
This is My Ninja Way!"

4
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,069
-Kiba.

5
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,669
-Naruto.

6
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:08,369
Well, this is bad.

7
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:09,269
-Ha, ha, ha.

8
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:10,535
What's the matter?

9
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,569
Something wrong?

10
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,402
Don't you want to
become larvae food?

11
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:14,302
-Really bad.

12
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:21,602
[laughing]

13
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,402
-You honestly
expect that to work?

14
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:44,435
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Focus my chakra.

15
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:44,935
Byakugan.

16
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:57,935
It's no good.

17
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,102
I can't break free in time.

18
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,602
Naruto.

19
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:04,769
-Not a chance, pal.

20
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:08,535
There's no way I'm giving up.

21
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,902
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

22
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,902
I know that no matter
what the situation

23
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,902
is, Naruto would never give up.

24
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:14,869
He doesn't quit.

25
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,335
-So did you take care of them?

26
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,869
-What a bunch of idiots,
provoking her like that.

27
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:52,802
JIBACHI: Look at them,
trapped in beeswax.

28
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:54,235
Bees makes sticky wax.

29
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,902
Aren't you supposed to
be an insect handler,

30
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:59,002
and you didn't know that?

31
00:03:59,035 --> 00:03:59,969
-Yeah, what gives?

32
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:03,002
Aren't you some
sort of bug expert?

33
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,869
SUZUMEBACHI: So what
about the bikochu?

34
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,335
KUROBACHI: Nothing so far.

35
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:08,002
We fanned out and
canvassed the area,

36
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,202
but we haven't found it yet.

37
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,269
-Maybe these kids are
carrying it with them.

38
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,235
-Even they wouldn't
be that stupid.

39
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,935
-I guess that means--

40
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:19,135
-We'll have to squeeze
the information out

41
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,635
of one of our new friends.

42
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,969
-None of us would ever tell you.

43
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,602
SHINO: I'll tell you.

44
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,935
-Shino.

45
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,035
-On one condition.

46
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,602
You give us Hinata.

47
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:32,702
SUZUMEBACHI: Ridiculous.

48
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,402
Trying to bargain with us?

49
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:35,769
JIBACHI: [laughs]
Maybe you don't

50
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,469
understand the
position you're in.

51
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:38,969
SHINO: There is no
way you will ever

52
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,769
find the bikochu on your own.

53
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:46,535
And I believe your
pressed for time.

54
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,969
Perhaps, you don't
understand your position.

55
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,102
JIBACHI: What should we do?

56
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,035
SUZUMEBACHI: At this rate
the bikochu will hatch

57
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,969
and then it'll be useless.

58
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,169
KUROBACHI: If that happens,
our mission is a failure.

59
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:07,002
-Yes, but if we can get rid of
even one of the Aburame clan.

60
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,369
-Hinata.

61
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,669
-Are you worried?

62
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:22,235
-Of course, I am.

63
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,602
-She's strong, you know.

64
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:30,502
Hinata, much stronger
than you think.

65
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,002
-All right then, we
agree to your offer.

66
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,869
-We want to see
our friend first.

67
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:00,835
-Huh?

68
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:01,302
-Ah.

69
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,402
SUZUMEBACHI: What happened?

70
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,602
-That brat.

71
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:11,135
She's gone, but the wax
cocoon she was trapped in

72
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,269
isn't there either.

73
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:14,602
The current.

74
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,769
It might have swept her
toward the waterfall.

75
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:17,702
SUZUMEBACHI: Jibachi.

76
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,535
JIBACHI: This isn't my fault.

77
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,669
I warned her.

78
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:23,202
I said not to move one
inch or she would die.

79
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,560
-How could you?

80
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,827
What have you done?

81
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,993
What did you do to Hinata?

82
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:32,327
If she gets hurt, I swear I'll--

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,293
-You little twerp.

84
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,593
Shut up.

85
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:38,060
Your friend's probably at the
bottom of the river by now

86
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,060
anyway.

87
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,027
-How dare you?

88
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,827
-Aw, he's so upset.

89
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,993
The brat must be his girlfriend.

90
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:48,293
-You monster.

91
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:51,460
When I get my hands on
you, you'll be sorry.

92
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,327
-You're joking, right?

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,027
What could you possibly do
to me all wrapped up like?

94
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,193
-You can forget our deal.

95
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:02,993
Without Hinata, we'll never
tell you where the bikochu is.

96
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,293
-The girl's death might not
have been part of our plan,

97
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,227
but it's not a complete loss.

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,360
In fact, it may be a good thing.

99
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:15,393
Because you see now we
get to avenge our clan

100
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:18,893
and take your lives.

101
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,093
Members of the
Hidden Leaf Village

102
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:24,760
have always been the enemies
of our Hidden Stone Village.

103
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:25,960
Killing you would be natural.

104
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,960
What's it going to be?

105
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,660
Do you want us to kill you?

106
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:40,193
Or perhaps, you'd rather
tell me where the bikochu is

107
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,793
and end this game?

108
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,693
If you talk, we may
spare your lives.

109
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,360
-Fine, you win.

110
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,393
NARUTO: Shino, don't you
dare tell them anything.

111
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:56,527
They can't do anything
to us because I'm

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,460
going to tear them
limb from limb.

113
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,693
-Keep your mouth shut, you brat!

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,427
Ah!

115
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,927
-Jibachi.

116
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:19,827
-No!

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,793
-Just shut up.

118
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,327
I'm going to get this kid.

119
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:31,760
-Paper bomb!

120
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,460
JIBACHI: She's--

121
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,508
-Wait, she's alive?

122
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,042
-But how?

123
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:16,575
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
That was really close,

124
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,542
but I didn't give up, did I?

125
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,508
Just like Naruto.

126
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:22,575
-No way.

127
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,375
No one can escape
from the beeswax.

128
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,275
-These are no ordinary genin.

129
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,142
-Ow.

130
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:32,808
-Don't worry.

131
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,308
I can handle it.

132
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:36,775
-Hinata.

133
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:40,242
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I've never
used it in an actual fight.

134
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:44,242
But I'm going to
have to use it here.

135
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,708
-Bee bomb jutsu!

136
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:49,175
-1,000 stingers jutsu.

137
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,808
-Ninja [inaudible] honey jutsu.

138
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:00,175
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

139
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,508
Naruto, watch me.

140
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,508
-Protective eight
trigrams 64 palms!

141
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,275
-No freaking way.

142
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,208
That jutsu.

143
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,275
Hinata can really do that?

144
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:35,475
-The Hinata that you
know is from long ago.

145
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,642
-What are you talking about?

146
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:40,042
-It's been a while
since the Chunin exam.

147
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,975
You've learned many
new jutsu since then.

148
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:46,242
While in that time, Hinata
has been developing as well.

149
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:53,642
She's been training
especially hard.

150
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,608
-Yahoo!

151
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,742
Go for it, Akamaru.

152
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,375
-It's nice.

153
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,775
You three.

154
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:07,142
You all have something special
you enjoy and you're good at.

155
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:10,042
SHINO: You should find
something like that.

156
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,875
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

157
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:15,442
-By the way, what's up?

158
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,508
You wanted to tell
me something, right?

159
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,008
-Yeah.

160
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,875
I wanted you to help me train.

161
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:30,308
SHINO: Hinata was so concerned
about her purpose as a ninja.

162
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,942
She wanted to be able to
offer something unique.

163
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,175
-Hinata!

164
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,442
Hey, maybe we should slow d--

165
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:50,375
-Don't go easy on me.

166
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:53,308
If you really want to help
me get better at this,

167
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:57,275
then come at me full force.

168
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:57,775
-OK.

169
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,242
SHINO: After months
of harsh training,

170
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:15,342
Hinata discovered her own style
and her own special jutsu.

171
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:20,675
What you're seeing is the
result of that training.

172
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,075
[cracking]

173
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,542
-Huh?

174
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,075
Huh?

175
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,975
How'd you--

176
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,508
-I'll let you in
on a little secret.

177
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,408
Angering the queen bee,
getting caught in that wax,

178
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,208
it was all part of my plan.

179
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:36,942
-What?

180
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:40,175
-With my chakra depleted
and my weakened state,

181
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:45,675
it was the only thing I could do
to survive and protect myself.

182
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,242
Besides, what do you
think I was doing

183
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:49,642
while we were all wrapped up?

184
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,942
Just sitting there?

185
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,042
No, I was directing my bugs.

186
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,408
Turns out, this wax is
actually quite weak.

187
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,908
-All right.

188
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:11,275
-Because of her hard training,
Hinata's chakra control

189
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:14,142
has improved dramatically.

190
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:18,042
And you just saw the jutsu
she's created and perfected,

191
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:22,942
protective eight
trigram 64 palms.

192
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,875
Hinata took her
superior flexibility

193
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:29,108
and combined it with
fine-toothed chakra control

194
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:34,575
to fend off attacks from
all directions at once.

195
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:39,542
It's the ultimate defense jutsu.

196
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,808
But it's different
from Neji's technique.

197
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,675
It's Hinata's own jutsu.

198
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:49,342
She pushed herself hard, and
it finally paid off for her.

199
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:54,508
Through it all, she wanted to
win the respect of her father,

200
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:59,308
the respect of her
fellow shinobi,

201
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:02,242
and especially the
respect of you, Naruto.

202
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,675
-None of our jutsus
are having any affect.

203
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,375
-How is she doing that?

204
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,142
-That girl is unreal.

205
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,742
How did they get out?

206
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:23,508
JIBACHI: And when?

207
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,608
-Summoning jutsu.

208
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,275
Get rid of them Queen Bee.

209
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:48,642
-Ah!

210
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:55,008
-No, Hinata.

211
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,008
Shino.

212
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:58,742
SHINO: Wait.

213
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,475
Have faith in her.

214
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,975
HINATA (VOICEOVER): With chakra.

215
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,475
It must be chakra.

216
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:13,442
Stronger.

217
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:14,442
Bigger.

218
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:16,942
More nimble.

219
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:17,442
Focus.

220
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,442
Focus.

221
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,442
Focus.

222
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,442
Focus.

223
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:22,908
Focus.

224
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:23,408
Focus!

225
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:28,908
-No.

226
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:38,375
-Hinata.

227
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,875
I got you.

228
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,375
-Naruto.

229
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:47,808
I--

230
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:48,575
-You're amazing.

231
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:51,142
That was an awesome jutsu.

232
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,175
You did it.

233
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:56,242
You totally saved us.

234
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:56,742
-Naruto.

235
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:01,742
SHINO: Let's move.

236
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:03,908
It'll be dawn soon.

237
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:04,908
NEJI: Right.

238
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:05,408
NARUTO: OK.

239
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,808
-Wow, it's becoming a pupa.

240
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:23,475
-Now, all we got to do is
make it smell Sasuke's scent

241
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:26,142
the moment it hatches, and
then our mission is complete.

242
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:26,642
-Yeah.

243
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:35,008
Sasuke, I'm coming, pal.

244
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,308
-Fool.

245
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:38,975
So it was in the tree.

246
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:40,408
I don't understand.

247
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,742
My bees would have
found it there easily.

248
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,742
-How are you even alive?

249
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:49,442
-We hid it in a cage coated
with a secret Aburame

250
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,042
family insect repellent.

251
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,308
-What?

252
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,675
No.

253
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,708
-The repellent kept your
bees at a safe distance.

254
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,875
As long as you were
using bees to search,

255
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:02,708
you had no chance of finding it.

256
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,175
-I should have known.

257
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,242
Your clan always
stands in our way.

258
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:14,008
As long as your
family exists, mine

259
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,008
will be destined for
failure and ruin.

260
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:20,542
No more.

261
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,508
I must avenge the
people of my clan.

262
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:34,475
I can't let you succeed, even
if it kills me and the bikochu.

263
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:38,408
-Shadow clone jutsu.

264
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,408
The beetle is our last chance.

265
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,375
It's our only hope of
getting our friend back.

266
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,842
That's why you can't stop us.

267
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,842
-Shut up!

268
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:51,275
Rasengan!

269
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,742
-Hey, look.

270
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:12,242
She's hatching.

271
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:13,342
-All right.

272
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,242
Huh?

273
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,808
-You just had the
headband a second ago.

274
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:18,508
-Quick.

275
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:19,308
Search for it, everyone.

276
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:25,808
-Byakugan.

277
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:26,308
Naruto.

278
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:26,842
-Huh?

279
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,775
-Over there.

280
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,375
-Aw, man, you must
have sent it flying

281
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:34,842
when you used your Rasengan.

282
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,642
-Get it.

283
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,408
-What's it look like I'm doing?

284
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,275
Come on.

285
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:41,908
Gotta reach it.

286
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,275
-She's going to hatch.

287
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:52,275
[grunting]

288
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:52,775
-Ah!

289
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,208
-I got it.

290
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:11,275
Hurry, make it sniff
this so I can-- Wah!

291
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:17,975
Hurry, make it sniff
this so I can-- Wah!

292
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,442
Aw, no way.

293
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,942
That smell doesn't count.

294
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:22,942
Come on, sniff
Sasuke's headband.

295
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:23,942
SHINO: It's over.

296
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:33,408
-Hey, get back here.

297
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:34,608
-Ah.

298
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,908
-So you failed the mission
because you did what?

299
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,908
You're gonna pay for this.

300
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:41,375
-I didn't do it on purpose.

301
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:42,208
I swear.

302
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:52,475
-Where did he go?

303
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,942
Hey, isn't that-- it is.

304
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:56,442
That's a bikochu.

305
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,342
Naruto!

306
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:02,842
Hi-ya!

307
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:10,042
-Come on, can't you
forgive me, Sakura?

308
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:10,975
-No.

309
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,142
I'll never forgive you for this.

310
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:13,742
-Don't kill me.

311
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,675
It's not my fault.

312
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,608
I swear it's a natural function.

313
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,975
-Ha, so the mission failed.

314
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:23,042
-It seems they succeeded
at finding the bikochu,

315
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:27,075
but couldn't train it to track
the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.

316
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,308
-I see.

317
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:30,775
Hinata must feel so
terrible right now.

318
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,175
After all, the whole
strategy was her idea

319
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,708
from the beginning.

320
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:38,075
-Actually, I don't think
she's feeling too bad.

321
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,708
-Hm?

322
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:45,408
-Well, Hinata, I heard that
your mission was a failure.

323
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:48,175
-Yes, it was a complete failure.

324
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,375
But that only means I only
train more and work even harder

325
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:52,908
next time.

326
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,542
-Oh, I see.

327
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,442
Well, good luck.

328
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:12,575
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Focus.

329
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,075
Focus.

330
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,142
Focus.

331
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:18,642
Focus.

332
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:40,684
[theme music]

333
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,050
NARUTO: Huh?

334
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,184
Why you sending me on
such an easy mission?

335
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,917
TSUNADE: I don't
want to hear it.

336
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,584
You're the one who picked up
this client in the first place.

337
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:10,950
NARUTO: That's
not a good reason.

338
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,550
Besides, I'm busy
with important stuff.

339
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:14,650
TSUNADE: Enough.

340
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,517
Do it or I'll send you
back to the Academy.

341
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,750
NARUTO: Hey, that's no fair.

342
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,050
TSUNADE: No arguments.

343
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:23,284
Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto,
I'm sending the four of you

344
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,517
on a brand new mission.

345
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,317
NARUTO: Next time, "Funeral
March of the Living."
