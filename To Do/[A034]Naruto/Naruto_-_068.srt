-Huh?

00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:00,102

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Zero Hour!

7
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:05,611
The Destruction of the
Hidden Leaf Village Begins!

8
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:17,930
-Lord Hokage!

9
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:18,698
-Leave it to me!

10
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,274
-Lord Kazekage, what is this?

11
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:28,882
-Lord Hokage.

12
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:33,591
-Gaara!

13
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,900
-Squad one, above.

14
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,403
Squad two, below.

15
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:41,304
Protect the nobles.

16
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,320
You will not interfere!

00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,657
[music playing]

18
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:10,288
-Lord Hokage, you must flee.

19
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:11,089
Escape now.

20
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,561
[music playing]

21
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,731
-Finally, it's my time.

22
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,835
-We've all been
waiting for this.

23
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,774
I was so frustrated
hiding in that disguise.

24
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,777
-You're all sweaty, too.

25
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,411
So gross.

26
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:43,646
-Come on.

27
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,383
We're all friends here, right?

00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,919
THIRD HOKAGE
(VOICEOVER): Some ninja.

29
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,160
-Righto.

30
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:52,296
Let's go.

31
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,999
We have to back up Lord Hokage.

32
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:54,733
Be aware of traps.

33
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,870
-Yes, sir!

34
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,773
-Do it.

35
00:03:58,807 --> 00:03:59,274
-Right.

Ninja art-- four
flames formation.

37
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:15,937
-A barrier.

38
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,008
We have to figure out a way
past this without dying.

39
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:19,509
But how?

40
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,088
-Lord Kazekage.

41
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,526
KAKASHI: That's a
barrier ninjutsu.

42
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,263
They outwitted the
ANBU black ops,

43
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,267
and the ANBU are
supposed to be the best.

44
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,042
-Why are you here?

45
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,211
Lord Hokage's in danger!

46
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:54,967
-What a nuisance.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,041
-An enemy masquerading
as ANBU black ops.

48
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:01,445
So he was using genjutsu.

49
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:02,813
KAKASHI: Yes,
there's no mistake.

50
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,824
-I never.

51
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:12,430
The Sand Village has
betrayed the Leaf Village?

52
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:14,869
-The treaty between
our villages was simply

53
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:17,606
a trick to make you
let down your guard.

54
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,512
This petty little
battle game ends now.

55
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:25,654
From this point on, the
course of history will change.

56
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:27,624
-What are you saying?

57
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:30,696
That you're going
to start a war?

58
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,966
-That's right.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,671
-Armed conflict
resolves nothing.

60
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,445
We should seek a resolution
through negotiation.

61
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,149
There's still time,
Lord Kazekage.

62
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:42,951
You can reconsider.

63
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,197
-Perhaps the fear of death
makes one more cowardly

64
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,536
with age, Sarutobi Sensei.

65
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:58,110
-You.

66
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:12,503
-Just my luck to have lookout
duty on a day like today.

67
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:16,142
What I really want is to
watch the chunin exam.

68
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,378
-Oh, stop.

69
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,983
The chunin exam takes
place twice a year.

70
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,852
You'll have plenty of chances.

71
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,123
-Yeah, but this year that
kid from the Uchiha clan

72
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,693
is taking part, isn't he?

73
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:28,130
I just hate to miss seeing that.

74
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:30,301
Well, my life will
be incomplete now.

75
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,004
[explosion]

76
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:32,538
-What's that?

77
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,136
-Now it's time.

78
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:50,636
Begin!

79
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,321
The summoning has succeeded.

80
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:07,900
-What in the?

81
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,936
-Notify Lord Hokage right away.

82
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:27,301
-You're not getting
into this village.

83
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,559
-Dispatch reinforcements!

84
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:42,493
-Yes, sir!

85
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,718
-The sand ninja.

86
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:03,664
-What's going on here?

87
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:06,903
TEMARI: Stop it, Gaara!

88
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,673
-I must kill him!

89
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,116
-There's no point in
continuing this fight.

90
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:14,884
-That's right.

91
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,420
Don't forget our mission.

92
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,755
-Out of my way.

93
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:22,798
-What are you three doing now?

94
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,802
Can't you see the
operation's already underway?

95
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,030
-What is going on?

96
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:41,797
Tell me!

97
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,174
-Gaara!

98
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:47,875
-What's wrong?

99
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:52,650
-His wound's worse
than I thought.

100
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:56,223
And his chakra's almost
completely drained away.

101
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:56,924
-Wait.

102
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,126
What about using that--

103
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,796
-It's impossible right now.

104
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,198
-You fool.

105
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,169
It's all because you
tried to transform

106
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,272
before the signal was given.

107
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:07,076
-So what do we do now?

108
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:08,711
We need Gaara for this.

109
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:22,969
-Isn't Gaara here yet?

110
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:33,187
-Gaara's the trump card of the
Village Hidden in the Sand.

111
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:36,393
We have to get him to play
his part, no matter what.

112
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,695
All right.

113
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:40,567
For now, you two take Gaara
and tend to his wounds.

114
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,039
As soon as his chakra
has been restored,

115
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,776
the operation will continue.

116
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:46,711
-You got it.

117
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,086
-And you, Sensei?

118
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,759
-I'm going to take
care of these guys.

119
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:59,467
-Do you really think that things
will go according to your plan?

120
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,972
-I'll make sure that they do.

121
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:18,200
Go!

122
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,936
-Yes, right.

123
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,474
[music playing]

124
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:32,058
-And is the host of
this party Orochimaru?

125
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,362
-Don't know.

126
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:35,631
And don't care.

127
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:37,667
Now let's heat things up, huh?

128
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,072
[music playing]

129
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:52,927
-Sasuke, I'm sorry, but the
chunin exam ends here for you.

130
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,398
You've already
achieved chunin level.

131
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:57,936
You're a Leaf Village
shinobi, so put your training

132
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,274
to good use.

133
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:03,079
-In other words, I'm supposed
to take down Gaara, right?

134
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,149
Our match continues?

135
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,751
-Just be careful.

136
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:10,392
It's the real thing
now, not a match.

137
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:14,499
-What I must do is the same.

138
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,767
-Not so fast!

139
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:29,225
-Sasuke.

140
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,001
FOURTH KAZEKAGE:
Well, well, well.

141
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:37,139
We had intended
to capture Sasuke

142
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:39,443
while Gaara was causing trouble.

143
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:45,453
But I suppose not everything
goes as planned, does it?

144
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,089
-I see.

145
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,526
So that was the plan.

146
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,734
Then the Hidden Leaf Village
and Sasuke were your targets.

147
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:54,502
Is that correct?

148
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,871
-Ha.

149
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:59,110
Do you really think that the
Leaf Village is so important?

150
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:02,015
Now, if Gaara returns,
I'll be able to show

151
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,520
you something very interesting.

152
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:07,257
Very interesting indeed.

153
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,164
But anyway, you're
stubborness and incompetence

154
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,468
have allowed me to
outmaneuver you.

155
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:15,071
I've defeated you.

156
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:16,808
-Hmph.

157
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:20,314
Nothing is decided
until the very end.

158
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,785
I taught you that
years ago, didn't I?

159
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,168
Orochimaru.

160
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,251
I knew, or at least
thought, this day

161
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:43,889
would eventually arrive.

162
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:51,001
However, you're not going
to defeat me that easily.

163
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,937
-I told you, didn't I?

164
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:57,145
You should have picked the
Fifth Hokage before now.

165
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,653
Because, Third Hokage,
right here, right now,

166
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:02,755
you are going to die.

167
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,104
IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
Well, I wonder

168
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,943
how the chunin exams are going?

169
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:29,948
I wonder if Naruto's
match is over yet?

170
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,352
The first match was
with Moegi, right?

171
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:37,060
Oh, I hope that Naruto
found some way to win.

172
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:37,828
-No, wait.

173
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:38,663
That's not right.

174
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,466
I mustn't play favorites.

175
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,470
Every student is equally
dear to their teacher

176
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:45,809
and I must root for them all.

177
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,614
Oh.

178
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,083
IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
I can't help it.

179
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:54,023
I still want Naruto to win.

180
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:56,127
-Are you worried about Naruto?

181
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,466
-Yes, of course I am.

182
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,438
-I thought so.

183
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:08,415
-But shouldn't you be-- I told
you to run ten laps, didn't I?

184
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,186
-Yeah, but we finished
that a long time ago.

185
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,993
-While you were
daydreaming, Sensei.

186
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:17,865
-Look, there's no way you
can teach a real class when

187
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,067
you're in this state.

188
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,872
So what do you say we just
call it quits for today.

189
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:22,573
-What?

190
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:23,876
Yeah, well, nice try.

191
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,145
No, the class will continue.

192
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:29,786
-Hey, look.

193
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,687
What's that smoke?

194
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,458
-Hmm?

195
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,429
It's coming from the
direction of the arena.

196
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,831
-Huh?

197
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:40,271
Do you guys see something
over there, too?

198
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:42,275
-I wonder what's going on today?

199
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,821
-Orochimaru.

200
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:50,756
-What should we do?

201
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,094
Should we send in
reinforcements?

202
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,429
-No.

203
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:57,802
It's risky to act when we
don't know the whole situation.

204
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:03,111
And if Orochimaru's behind
all this, even more so.

205
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:07,685
-Is Orochimaru-- I mean, is
he really that dangerous?

206
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:12,027
-Originally, he was the
Third Hokage's student.

207
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,766
-So why in the world did he
become a rogue ninja, then?

208
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,009
-Long ago, back when the
Fourth Hokage was decided,

209
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:25,751
Orochimaru apparently put forth
his own name for consideration.

210
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,789
But his request was denied.

211
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:33,097
Soon after, he severed all ties
with the Hidden Leaf Village.

212
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,501
He most likely holds a
grudge against the Third

213
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,039
Hokage because of that.

214
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,976
-He seeks revenge?

215
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,747
-I believe so.

216
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:48,992
When I was just a child, I saw
him one time, and I-- I had one

217
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:57,507
thought-- that he
didn't seem human to me.

218
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,515
That he was just some creature
that had taken on a human form.

219
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:03,483
It was frightening.

220
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:08,292
Simply frightening.

221
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,801
-Sir, I have a report.

222
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:16,306
Giant boas have appeared near
the eastern gate of the Leaf

223
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,810
Village, and with them,
a hundred sand ninja.

224
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,914
They've infiltrated
our village and are

225
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:23,652
battling our shinobi who
are patrolling there.

226
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:24,320
-The sand?

227
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,965
-Leave behind squads one and two
and head to the gate right now.

228
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:31,933
-Yes, sir!

229
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,404
[music playing]

230
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,156
-This is as far as
you're going to get.

231
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,386
-Quite a lot of them, huh?

232
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,956
-We've been careless.

233
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,262
And now even Lord Hokage-- huh?

234
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:10,200
Kakashi, look there,
inside the barrier.

235
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,236
-Huh?

236
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,538
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What is it?

237
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:19,116
-Orochimaru.

238
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,259
-Orochimaru!

239
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,729
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Why is he here?

240
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:30,703
Don't tell me he's
after Sasuke again.

241
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:34,176
-Hey, Sasuke!

242
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,679
What?

243
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,147
He's-- he's gone.

244
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:53,443
-Sakura, just stay there while
I trim the enemy's numbers

245
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:54,244
down to size.

246
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:59,286
[music playing]

247
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:26,969
-Nicely done.

248
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:29,439
But I'm worried
about Lord Hokage.

249
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,442
-Leave that to the
ANBU black ops.

250
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,313
We have enought to handle here.

251
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:37,720
Besides, Lord Hokage isn't
just some pushover, you know.

252
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,156
-Yeah, but--

253
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,531
-Just remember, Guy,
he is the Hokage.

254
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:44,766
He can handle it.

255
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,925
-Are you actually crying
because you're so happy?

256
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,265
Or is it that inside your
heart there is sorrow?

257
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:05,101
A feeling of
unhappiness you can't

258
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:09,509
shake as you contemplate
killing your old teacher?

259
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,545
-Not at all.

260
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:29,611
I was feeling so sleepy.

261
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:33,719
But now it seems
I'm finally awake.

262
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,190
-Yes, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

263
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:44,004
And I was also thinking that you
aren't the kind of person who

264
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,807
would hold a grudge.

265
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,814
So it seems that you have
neither a goal nor a motive.

266
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,116
-Huh.

267
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:56,058
I guess-- well, I guess that
I do kind of have a goal.

268
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:58,930
Let me see if I can explain it.

269
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:03,003
I find it very interesting
to watch things in motion.

270
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:06,877
I get no pleasure when
the world is still,

271
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,815
like a windmill
that isn't turning.

272
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,086
I suppose some might
find it beautiful,

273
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,555
even if it's immobile.

274
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,929
But to me, such a
thing is truly boring.

275
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:22,237
So now I want to put
things in motion myself.

276
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:25,442
The first step is
crushing the Leaf Village.

277
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:26,945
-Hmph.

278
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,516
I see you haven't
changed at all.

279
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,820
[music playing]

280
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,687
-Sakura, it was
worth teaching you

281
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:54,160
genjutsu during survival
training for the genin exam.

282
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:57,866
You truly do have
a talent for it.

283
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,469
-Huh?

284
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:02,207
-Release the genjutsu and
wake Naruto and Shikamaru.

285
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,757
Naruto will be delighted he'll
be getting a mission after such

286
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,694
a long time.

287
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,131
-What kind of mission?

288
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,070
-You'll have to be
careful on this one.

289
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:22,142
It's the first A-rank assignment
since the Land of the Waves.

290
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:32,512
[music playing]

291
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:14,892
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yeah!

292
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:18,365
I've been waiting for
this for a long time!

293
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,535
Finally, an A-ranked mission!

294
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,875
Listen, Sakura and Shikamaru,
as long as I'm with you guys,

295
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:25,778
this'll be easy.

296
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,649
I'm so good I'm
practically a superhero.

297
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:33,825
Just keep watching me and you'll
see how good a ninja can be.

298
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:37,372
Next time-- Village in
Distress-- A New A-Ranked

299
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:38,872
Mission.

00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,006
Let's get busy!
