00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:10,715
[theme music]

2
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:03,815
-I hope that woke you up.

3
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,582
Now you know I'm
not messing around.

4
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:12,548
We had a bit of an
interruption that day.

5
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,248
But that won't happen this time.

6
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:21,948
So let me show you the true
power of the Sharingan.

7
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:25,648
-OK.

8
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:29,948
I guess that means I can
stop going easy on you.

9
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,048
Come on and fire up
that Sharingan of yours.

10
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,015
I don't want you to
miss a thing when

11
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,815
I hit you with my
Way of the Shinobi.

12
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,282
-Heh.

13
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,782
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

14
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,748
-Heh.

15
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,415
What good will that do you?

16
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,382
Ten times zero is still zero.

17
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:49,582
-Gotcha!

18
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:56,882
[chuckling]

19
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,615
-Thanks to the
Sharingan I knew which

20
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,282
was the real you all the time.

21
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,882
I played along for
old time's sake.

22
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:06,782
[chuckling]

23
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,048
-But now playtime's over.

24
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:16,648
Fire Style!

25
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,082
Fireball Jutsu!

26
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:09,182
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
What did it mean?

27
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,682
That look in my brother's eyes.

28
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:14,148
That was no ordinary Sharingan.

29
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:26,115
And ever since, even though
that was a while ago,

30
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,982
there's been something wrong
between him and father.

31
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:34,015
-Good morning to you, father.

32
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,248
-Ah, yes.

33
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,482
Good morning.

34
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:41,682
Tell me.

35
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:43,282
How's everything
going at the Academy.

36
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,415
-Some of the lessons
are a little bit boring.

37
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:54,448
But I'm always top
of in my class.

38
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:55,882
UCHIHA: Fire Style!

39
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:56,515
Fireball Jutsu!

40
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:08,782
This is the key
jutsu of our clan.

41
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,515
Now I've already shown
you all the handsigns.

42
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,582
The next step is to
build up your chakra

43
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,282
and focus it to a
point in your chest,

44
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:18,815
and then force it up through
the throat and out the mouth.

45
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,148
Now you try it.

46
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:24,115
-Right

47
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,615
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Father's actually

48
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:28,882
teaching me the jutsu himself.

49
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:33,115
He's finally giving me a chance
to show that I matter too.

50
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,782
I can't disappoint him.

51
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:41,474
I can do it!

52
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,441
Fire Style!

53
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:43,408
Fireball Jutsu!

54
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,808
[sigh]

55
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,541
-Why did I think you
would be like Itachi?

56
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:01,441
It's too soon.

57
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:02,674
You're not ready yet.

58
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,941
UCHIHA: A member
of the Uchiha Clan

59
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,141
is not recognized
as full fledged

60
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,774
until they can use
the Fire Style.

61
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,041
[panting]

62
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,808
UCHIHA: the Uchiha
Crest represents

63
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,641
the fan that rouses
the flame of our will.

64
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:28,808
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Fire Style!

65
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:29,508
Fireball Jutsu!

66
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,974
-One more time.

67
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,074
SASUKE: Fire Style!

68
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:37,674
Fireball Jutsu!

69
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,374
Fire Style!

70
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:48,074
Fireball Jutsu!

71
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:57,974
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): OK.

72
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,741
Today for sure.

73
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:01,574
Fire Style!

74
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,674
Fireball Jutsu!

75
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:10,074
Fire Style!

76
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:10,708
Fireball Jutsu!

77
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:23,274
-Sasuke?

78
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:24,241
-Huh?

79
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:25,974
-Hold on a minute.

80
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:26,441
-What is it?

81
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,641
[laughter]

82
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,774
-What's that for?

83
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:36,374
-No, no.

84
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,141
Don't go yet.

85
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:45,608
There.

86
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,408
That should help.

87
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:59,874
-Hey, mom-- Mhm.

88
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:00,441
No.

89
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,341
It's nothing.

90
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,174
-You sure?

91
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:13,541
SASUKE: Fire Style.

92
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,508
Fireball Jutsu!

93
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:27,374
[sigh] Why did I think
you would be like Itachi.

94
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,008
It's too soon.

95
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,608
You're not ready yet.

96
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,941
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'll get it.

97
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,008
I'm just getting started.

98
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,508
OK.

99
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,008
Here we go.

100
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,008
SASUKE: Fire Style!

101
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,974
Fireball Jutsu!

102
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:55,341
Father!

103
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,741
Just once more.

104
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:05,908
Will you come watch
me one more time?

105
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:06,608
-I've told you.

106
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,074
It's too soon for you.

107
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,274
I could teach you every day for
a week and it wouldn't help.

108
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,241
-No.

109
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:13,674
Not teach me.

110
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,141
-Hm?

111
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:17,974
-Watch me, I'm
saying, I think I've

112
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,108
got the hang of it, father.

113
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,974
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Failure is not an option.

114
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:46,941
Fire Style!

115
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:47,941
Fireball Jutsu!

116
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:43,608
-Now then, that's my boy.

117
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,308
You've done well.

118
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,808
Work hard and you're
bound to soar high

119
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,241
and to bring honor to that
crest you wear on your back.

120
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:00,274
-I will!

121
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:04,808
-From now on, walk
your own path.

122
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,341
Not in the footsteps
of your brother.

123
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:24,418
-Hey, mom?

124
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,418
-Hm?

125
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:31,652
-I was wondering
about Itachi and me.

126
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,452
What does father
really think of us?

127
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:39,485
-What on earth
makes you ask that?

128
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:43,452
-It was something he said the
other day down on the dock.

129
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:46,118
Father said to
me, that's my boy.

130
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,685
That's something he's
only ever said to Itachi.

131
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,185
So it made me really
happy to hear it.

132
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,118
-Of course.

133
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,485
And I'm glad it did.

134
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:57,752
-But then I started to wonder.

135
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:03,785
Now that father and Itachi
aren't getting along,

136
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:08,585
am I just someone to
replace my older brother?

137
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,785
-Your older brother's your
older brother and you are you.

138
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:23,352
But your father has always cared
very deeply about both of you.

139
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,052
-He's only thought
of Itachi before now!

140
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,218
-Well, if it's sometimes
seemed that way,

141
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:31,718
it's only because your father
is a leader of the Uchiha Clan.

142
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:34,285
He has to make sure
it's kept safe.

143
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:36,218
-What's that got to do with it?

144
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,552
-Your brother is the firstborn
and he's bigger than you are.

145
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,485
And as the firstborn,
he's going to have

146
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:44,685
to assume his responsibilities
earlier than you will.

147
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:47,718
So since it's your father's
job to look after the clan,

148
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,218
it's only natural
he'd want to be

149
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,485
sure Itachi's ready
to take on his role.

150
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:02,318
But I'll let you in on a secret.

151
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,218
When we're alone
and no one's around,

152
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:06,785
the only one he
talks about is you.

153
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,152
-He has a hard time showing it.

154
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,018
It's how he is.

155
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:35,152
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'll
be as good as he is.

156
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,152
I promise.

157
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:52,418
-Itachi.

158
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:01,252
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No matter
what I do, I can't catch up.

159
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,285
-I'm sorry, Sasuke.

160
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,685
Some other time, OK?

161
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:24,185
-The clan, the clan.

162
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:27,018
You overestimate
your own abilities

163
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,585
with no idea of the
depth of my own.

164
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:33,718
And look at you now--
groveling in the dirt.

165
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,518
I've had enough.

166
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:44,652
There's no hope left
for this pathetic clan.

167
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,518
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
That's when it happened.

168
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:49,618
Ever since that day, it's
like he's not the same.

169
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:03,218
-Big brother, do you think
you could help me out

170
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:06,252
with my Shuriken Jutsu
after school today?

171
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:06,752
-No.

172
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:07,318
I can't.

173
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:08,685
I'm busy.

174
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,352
Why don't you go ask
father to help you?

175
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,763
-Aw, come on.

176
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:17,630
You're way better at the
Shuriken Jutsu than father is.

177
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,397
I mean, even I can see that.

178
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,797
Big brother, why do you always
treat me like such a pest?

179
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,563
-I'm sorry, Sasuke.

180
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,863
Some other time, OK?

181
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:58,897
I don't have time
for this today.

182
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,530
-You're always doing this to me.

183
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:06,963
You jab me in the forehead and
then say I'm sorry, Sasuke.

184
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,630
And you never have time.

185
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:09,830
It's always the same story.

186
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,330
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): That's good.

187
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:17,597
He hasn't changed after all.

188
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:38,363
But still-- his eyes when he
looked at father that time.

189
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:42,763
I'm sure that was no
ordinary Sharingan.

190
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:43,763
I wonder.

191
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:48,130
-Father?

192
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,563
-Hm.

193
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:53,397
-About Sharingan, is there
more than one type of it?

194
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,930
-Hm?

195
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,230
What's this?

196
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:58,830
So you're already thinking
about Sharingan now?

197
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,130
Well, don't.

198
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,230
It's far too soon for you
to be worried about that.

199
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:05,797
It's not the same
as Fire Style Jutsu.

200
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,497
-But I'll have to know
all about it some day.

201
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,397
After all, I am your son.

202
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:16,263
-Well, there is a
visual jutsu that's

203
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,230
a level above the Sharingan.

204
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,163
It's called the
Mangekyo Sharingan.

205
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:24,397
-Mangekyo Sharingan.

206
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,597
-It's an almost legendary jutsu.

207
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,630
In the history of our
clan, only a very few

208
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,897
have been able to master it.

209
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,197
What's more, it said that
it can be called forth only

210
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,863
under very specific
circumstances.

211
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,763
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Specific circumstances.

212
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,130
UCHIHA: From now on,
walk your own path.

213
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:57,230
Not in the footsteps
of your brother.

214
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,797
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What does
he think of Itachi and me?

215
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,097
The way we are with each other.

216
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,163
-Father?

217
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:06,263
-Hm?

218
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,830
-Do you know why Itachi
is always so cold to me?

219
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:16,630
-He's a peculiar
one, your brother.

220
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:18,797
He's never cared about
being liked or making

221
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,330
friends or any of that.

222
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,630
-But why is that?

223
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,630
-I don't know.

224
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:28,297
As his father, you'd
think I would have a clue.

225
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,397
But I don't.

226
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,763
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
All this time

227
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,663
I've been afraid to talk
about Itachi and me.

228
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,563
But it's OK.

229
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,530
He doesn't mind.

230
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:41,197
-Got your lunch ready.

231
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,530
It's time to go.

232
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,297
And after you get
home today, I'll

233
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,063
watch you practice your
Shuriken Jutsu, OK?

234
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,697
-It's not practice.

235
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,830
It's called training.

236
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:55,063
See you later!

237
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:56,630
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
That's a a relief.

238
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,297
I thought father hates
Itachi for some reason.

239
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,130
But it turns out he's
just confused, like me.

240
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,630
My brother was seven when he
graduated top of his classroom

241
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:08,897
from the Academy.

242
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,363
He could use the Sharingan
when he was eight.

243
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:14,697
And he made chunin
when he was only ten.

244
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,697
I've got the same Uchiha
blood in my veins, don't I?

245
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,897
If he can do it, I can do it.

246
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,263
-Is that really all you've got?

247
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:34,230
Come on.

248
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,497
After all that big
talk, that's it?

249
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,863
That was your Way
of the Shinobi?

250
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:47,230
You still think we're on
the same team, don't you?

251
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,963
If you're not
convinced yet, I'll

252
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:55,130
just have to spell
it out for you!

253
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,363
What are you waiting for?

254
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:03,663
I want to see what the number
one, hyperactive, knucklehead

255
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:04,463
ninja has got!

256
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:40,498

257
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:04,331
NARUTO: Neji was right.

258
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:06,331
Something's got a hold
of Sasuke and pulled him

259
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:07,931
into the darkness!

260
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:10,598
He was playing for keeps
when he hit me just now.

261
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:14,964
He could have-- Sasuke, does
this mean I'm nothing to you

262
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,198
anymore?

263
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:19,298
All we've been through, all
the missions we went on,

264
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,631
the friends we've made!

265
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:23,164
That all means nothing to you?

266
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:26,264
Next time-- The Secrets
of the Mangekyo Sharingan!
