00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:09,200

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The Final Rounds- Rush

6
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,045
to the Battle Arena.

7
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:30,599
-So what's up?

8
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,569
It's been awhile
since you've come in.

9
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,239
[chuckles]

10
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,774
-I was kind of in the hospital.

11
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,211
-The hospital?

12
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:37,945
-Don't worry.

13
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,181
I'm fine now.

14
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,920
Never felt better
as a matter of fact.

15
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,792
-Well, that's good.

16
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:46,594
Ayame.

17
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:46,995
-Huh?

18
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:48,932
Oh.

19
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:49,700
Here you go.

20
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:52,939
-Uh?

21
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:58,415
[giggles]

22
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,819
NARUTO: Um, Mr. Chef?

23
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,489
-Just eat it.

24
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:07,031
The final competition
is tomorrow, right?

25
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:11,939
-Uh, [giggles] Oh, all right.

26
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:12,540
Thanks guys!

27
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,787
[laughing]

28
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,623
-Well, at least with
a daughter at home

29
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:23,459
it's not so bad on the wallet.

30
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,900
Most of my money turns into
food and then vanishes.

31
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,202
-Quit complaining.

32
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,506
You're not the only
one who's got problems.

33
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,173
-Hm?

34
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:32,843
-Look, I understand.

35
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,547
Daughters are a real drag.

36
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,515
-Yeah.

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,118
Man, there are
times when I really

38
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,823
have no idea how
to deal with her.

39
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,058
-I know what you mean.

40
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:42,661
We dads have it rough.

41
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:46,234
-Humph and you're telling
me to quit complaining.

42
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,741
Hey, Mister, one
more order here.

43
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:51,944
These two pages,
everything on them.

44
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:52,546
-Welcome.

45
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:56,919
-Aha!

46
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:58,289
Reinforcements are here.

47
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,257
Come on in.

48
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,261
Order something.

49
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:04,432
[sigh]

50
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:08,474
-Hey dad, come on.

51
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,177
Can we go home already?

52
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,211
-What?

53
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,583
Listen, don't be a drag.

54
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,854
You're supposed to be living
it up at this festival.

55
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:17,689
-Yeah right.

56
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,361
Some festival.

57
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,963
It's a total drag.

58
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:23,233
-You idiot.

59
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:29,577
Since ancient--
[enjoying his drink] times

60
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,451
the final competition has
always been like a festival.

61
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,423
-I'm in that final
competition tomorrow.

62
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,695
Oh man, I don't have
time to babysit you.

63
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:40,965
-Huh?

64
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,700
You're in it?

65
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:43,202
What?

66
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:43,702
Seriously?

67
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,511
-Never mind.

68
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,880
Just forget it.

69
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:22,071
-So tomorrow he'll--

70
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:22,671
-Yeah.

71
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,798
-Tomorrow is a full moon.

72
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:49,720
[ticking clock]

73
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,248
[birds chirping]

74
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:29,224
[breathing heavily]

75
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:33,698
-Incredible.

76
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,002
You don't have a scratch on you.

77
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:37,304
It's perfect.

78
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,675
Right Neji?

79
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,650
-Why don't we call it a warm up?

80
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,318
Let's get going all right.

81
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:55,838
[alarm buzzing]

82
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,119
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So much for
getting a good night's sleep.

83
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,153
Stupid nerves.

84
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,365
And right off the bat,
in the first match,

85
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,736
I have to go up against him.

86
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,772
-But these chakra
points, they're

87
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:18,612
undetectable even
to my Sharingan eye.

88
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:21,717
-I have on my team the man who
is probably the strongest genin

89
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,355
ever to come out of the
Hidden Leaf Village.

90
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:26,024
That man.

91
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,227
Neji Hyuga.

92
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,435
[echoes]

93
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:36,377
[drums]

94
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,579
[wind]

95
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:57,982
-At last it begins.

96
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,736
-Neji Hyuga's in the
first match right?

97
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,138
Oh yeah.

98
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,342
That guy's the number one
rookie from last year.

99
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:18,118
There's just no way we
can miss that match.

100
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,319
-Neji Hyuga.

101
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,028
[laughs]

102
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,267
-Yeah, but now I'm
able to summon a toad.

103
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,469
It'll be OK for sure.

104
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,646
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
But all of those guys

105
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,250
looked like nasty competitors.

106
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,105
-Huh?

107
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:53,781
Hinata?

108
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,350
[gasps]

109
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,955
-Oh, Naruto!

110
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,626
So why are you here?

111
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,599
The final competition?

112
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:05,101
-Hm.

113
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:09,074
I just-- It's nothing.

114
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,646
I came to check out
this training field.

115
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,684
This is actually the place
where I became a genin, so--

116
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,963
-Oh, but why are you here?

117
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:22,865
-Uh, nothing.

118
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,035
No real reason.

119
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,738
It doesn't matter anyway.

120
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,572
-Oh.

121
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:27,741
Guess you're right.

122
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:28,343
Sorry.

123
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:38,761
-Say, Hinata, Neji, he's
a cousin of yours right?

124
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,764
-Yeah.

125
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,734
-So is he really strong?

126
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,476
-Mm.

127
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:49,246
[sighs]

128
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,482
-Great.

129
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:54,389
-But, I mean, you still
might be able to win Naruto.

130
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:55,323
[nervous laughing]

131
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,091
-Yeah.

132
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,527
I'm strong too after all.

133
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,365
[nervous laughing]

134
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,336
[sighs]

135
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,586
-I know you can win Naruto.

136
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,888
-Huh?

137
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:16,629
-Remember that time
when you cheered for me.

138
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:20,368
I felt like-- like I was able
to become stronger than ever

139
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:20,902
before.

140
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,071
-Go Hinata!

141
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:23,907
You can do it!

142
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,746
-When the preliminaries
ended I was finally

143
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,985
able to like myself a little.

144
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:33,959
[whimpering]

145
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:45,279
-I never go back on my
word, because that too

146
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,884
is my nindo, my ninja way.

147
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,419
And you can't take it from me.

148
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:52,626
To anybody else it might look
like absolutely nothing's

149
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,365
changed about me,
but I feel different,

150
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,969
like I'm a better person now.

151
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:03,812
And I've been thinking that it
was all thanks to you Naruto.

152
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,388
-Hinata.

153
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:12,560
You really-- Do you really
believe that's true?

154
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:19,573
I may look strong to
you, but all I ever do

155
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,343
is mess things up.

156
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:24,849
I act tough because
I'm so frustrated.

157
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:28,356
But underneath it all I just
feel like I'm a huge failure.

158
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,392
-No, that's not true!

159
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:31,528
-Hm?

160
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:35,234
-Even when you messed up
you were always a-- um,

161
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,505
how can I say this?

162
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:41,012
A proud failure from
my point of view.

163
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,180
-Huh?

164
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,850
-When I look at you,
you just fill me

165
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:47,255
with such-- such admiration.

166
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,027
I'm not saying that
you're perfect.

167
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,599
I mean, no one is.

168
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,703
But when you do
make a mistake you

169
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:58,375
have the guts to pick
yourself up and keep trying.

170
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:02,416
I think that courage,
to keep going no matter,

171
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,087
is what real strength is.

172
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:08,628
I just think you're an
incredibly strong person

173
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,229
Naruto.

174
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,881
-Thanks Hinata.

175
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:20,949
I needed that.

176
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:26,793
Even though I'm completely
used to being the underdog,

177
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:30,166
I get this time I was just
really feeling the strain.

178
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,171
I was really down, which
isn't like me at all.

179
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:36,678
But I feel 100% better now.

180
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,313
-I'm glad you do.

181
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:39,215
-All right.

182
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:40,250
I'm off to the match!

183
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,051
Thanks again.

184
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,996
Hinata.

185
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,564
-Huh?

186
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:52,005
-I kind of thought
you were-- um--

187
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:52,639
-What?

188
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,374
What?

189
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,178
-Gloomy, timid,
always terrified,

190
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,948
and basically completely weird.

191
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,150
[gong]

192
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,886
-Oh.

193
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,022
-But you know what?

194
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:06,831
I actually like people like you.

195
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:21,790
People like you
[echoes] Oh yeah.

196
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:23,494
Don't forget to come
watch me wipe up

197
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:25,898
the floor with Neji in
the final competition.

198
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,804
[fireworks]

199
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:30,239
-Huh?

200
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:31,240
Oh no.

201
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:32,878
I gotta get going, and fast.

202
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,145
Oh man!

203
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,282
I'm going to be late.

204
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,684
See you later Hinata!

205
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:42,760
-Hey, Hinata.

206
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,731
Sorry I'm so late.

207
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:45,767
Aw well.

208
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:49,239
Shino's match isn't
til later anyway.

209
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:52,812
Hey, what's with you?

210
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,720
[footsteps]

211
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:02,630
-Hm?

212
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:03,332
What?

213
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:04,066
What is it?

214
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,468
[fireworks]

215
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:16,970
-Oh, it's starting.

216
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:17,605
NARUTO: Move!

217
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:18,305
Move!

218
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:18,973
Look out!

219
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:19,942
Get out of the way!

220
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:20,977
I'm in a hurry!

221
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,947
Oh man, it's still so far away.

222
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:25,619
There's no way I'll
make it in time.

223
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:26,587
-Hey, Naruto!

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,865
NARUTO: Konohamaru?

225
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,966
-My friend needs help.

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,236
Check it out.

227
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:36,304
See?

228
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,508
-Konohamaru, what are
you talking about?

229
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,543
What are you up to?

230
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,713
-No time to explain.

231
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,880
Just come on.

232
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,417
Well, actually I
guess there is time.

233
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,053
There's a great
shortcut up here that

234
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:47,023
goes straight to the arena!

235
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,226
-There is?

236
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,027
Awesome!

237
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,997
Thank you Konohamaru!

238
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:53,568
-It's said that those who
control the secret path

239
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,970
control time.

240
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:56,173
-Whatever that means.

241
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:59,178
But still, you're
awesome Konohamaru.

242
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,717
-As I recall, there's a hole
in the wall around here.

243
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:06,658
Ah, here it is.

244
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:08,362
Doh!

245
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:08,996
NARUTO: What?

246
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,200
What's the matter?

247
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,806
-The shortcut got a
little longer I guess.

248
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,609
-Gah!

249
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:17,611
That's great.

250
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:18,646
I'm almost out of time now.

251
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,882
-No wait.

252
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,485
There's another way.

253
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:22,319
-No!

254
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:23,153
I can't take anymore chances.

255
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,623
I'm already late.

256
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:26,294
-He-he, he-he.

257
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,595
This is a sure thing.

258
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,499
It's a secret, but
there's an awesome path

259
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,937
that can get you to the
arena in an instant.

260
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,938
I swear!

261
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,408
-What?

262
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:35,075
All right!

263
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,110
Nice one Konohamaru.

264
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,018
Really?

265
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,322
This hole is a shortcut.

266
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:44,191
-Yeah, it's a straight
shot to the arena.

267
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,796
I told you this
one's a sure thing.

268
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,966
-Straight shot huh?

269
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,136
OK.

270
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:52,306
Let's do this.

271
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,109
-Right!

272
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:58,116
[screaming]

273
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,687
-Konohamaru, what's
going on here?

274
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,689
-Don't worry.

275
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:02,992
It's OK.

276
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,495
We're almost to the
final competition arena.

277
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:09,069
See, there's the
exit right there!

278
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,674
[laughing]

279
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:13,077
-Huh?

280
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,681
[mumbling]

281
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,250
[splash]

282
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,661
-Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot!

283
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:25,031
-Now, just hold on.

284
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,633
This isn't my fault.

285
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,470
It's a mistake.

286
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,243
-What have you done Konohamaru?

287
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,717
And why did we
come out of a tree?

288
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,022
And now we're even further
away than we were before.

289
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,325
-Just wait.

290
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,094
I swear that tunnel
used to come out right

291
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,897
at the final competition arena.

292
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,167
There has to be another way.

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,736
Let's see.

294
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,305
Uh, oh!

295
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:51,978
And there it is!

296
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,579
-Huh?

297
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:59,224
-Just ride this guy here,
and you'll get to the arena

298
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,427
before you even know it.

299
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,033
-Seriously?

300
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,102
A bull?

301
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,572
-Not just any bull.

302
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,275
The feudal lords'
bulls aren't just

303
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,077
like ordinary, everyday cows.

304
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,981
They're like super bulls!

305
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,951
Once these bulls
start running even

306
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,721
race horses grow deathly afraid.

307
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:19,360
They know there's no way they
can beat a feudal lord's bull.

308
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:22,733
Yep, that's one awesome animal.

309
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,604
[grumbling]

310
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:27,709
-Naruto, if you leave
everything up to this bull

311
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,416
you're going to be at
the arena in no time.

312
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,486
-I'm counting on you bull.

313
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,021
OK.

314
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's go!

315
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,331

00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:43,871
[grunts and groans]

317
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:47,945
-Ouch.

[moaning]

319
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,783

00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:07,713
-Oh no!

324
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,684
[moo]

325
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:10,685
-Whoa, whoa.

326
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,654
Nice bull.

327
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:12,589
Nice bull.

328
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,626
-Naruto, good luck
in your fight!

329
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,997
[moo]

330
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,565
NARUTO: Whoa, stay back.

331
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,000
Come on.

332
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:19,702
Easy.

333
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,906
[panting]

334
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,962
-Look at this.

335
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:38,235
We're missing quite
a few people here.

336
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,102
-What's going on?

337
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:40,505
Where is everyone?

338
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,176
This is about to get started.

339
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,511
-Yeah, what's going on?

340
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:49,889
Sasuke and even Naruto
are nowhere to be seen.

00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,894
[stampeding bulls]

342
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,263
-Ah!

343
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:57,870
Why does this
always happen to me?

344
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,871
-Huh?

345
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,876
Whoa!

346
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,284
[panting]

347
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:08,855
-This is not good!

348
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:09,356
Wait.

349
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,225
That's it.

350
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:13,063
Shadow Clone jutsu.

351
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:17,270
All right guys, scatter all
these stampeding bulls for me.

352
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:19,874
-Yeah!

353
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,847

-Hey, what happened?

357
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:33,066
Why did you guys come back?

358
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,035
You were supposed to get
rid of all those bulls.

359
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,239
-We tried, but more
of them showed up.

360
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,243
We couldn't escape.

361
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:40,110
-Great.

362
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,247
That was pointless.

363
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,852
All right, just run!

364
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:46,857

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,858
-Hm?

366
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:48,626
What's that?

367
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,231
-Naruto Uzumaki?

368
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,234

[shouting and clamouring]

00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58,142
-Stop.

00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,245
It's too late to enter.

00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,606
-He sure knows how to make
an entrance, the idiot.

376
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,848
-Naruto!

377
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:23,588
-Yeah, but he's totally
late, of course.

378
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,490
[grunting]

379
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,359
-Oh man, what a drag.

380
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,395
[groaning]

381
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,363
-Ah!

382
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:29,566
Guys, run!

383
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,968
You won't believe
this, but there's

384
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,840
a huge herd of stampeding
bulls coming this way?

385
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:34,675
-What?

386
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,543
Yeah, you're right.

387
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:36,578
I don't believe it.

388
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,081
-I'm serious.

389
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,718
There mus be a million of
them coming right this way.

390
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:45,627
Hm?

391
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,395
Hey, wait.

392
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,698
Where's Sasuke?

393
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:50,270
-I'm fighting Dosu,
but he's missing too.

394
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,939
-Hey, knock it off.

395
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:54,009
Quit your fidgeting you two.

396
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,513
Stand up straight and
present yourself proudly

397
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,016
to the spectators.

398
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:58,417
-Huh?

399
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:06,965
[crowd cheers]

400
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:21,257
-You guys are the heroes
of this final competition.

401

402
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,581
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
All right, Hinata.

403
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,317
You want to watch me fight?

404
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,688
Then watch me defeat
this big jerk.

405
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:09,191
He thinks that a
person's destiny

406
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:12,997
can't be changed, that one's
fate is decided at birth.

407
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,300
Give me a break.

408
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:18,474
People can definitely change,
and by defeating this guy

409
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,845
I'm going to prove that.

410
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:24,951
Next time, Byakugan
vs. Shadow Clone Jutsu.

411
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:25,884
Believe it!

412
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,018
I'm going to win,
no matter what!
