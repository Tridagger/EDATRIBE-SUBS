[theme music]

2
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,354
NARUTO: OK, where is Sasuke?

3
00:01:56,387 --> 00:01:58,787
What have you done with him?

4
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:02,921
-Heh, I take it you're Naruto.

5
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:07,054
If I were to tell you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

6
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,221
-That's right.

7
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,154
At least not if you
told me he was dead.

8
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,287
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

9
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,887
-That's right.

10
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:18,321
Sasuke is alive.

11
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,987
-I promised that I'd
bring Sasuke back,

12
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,921
and I'm the kind of guy who
always keeps his promises.

13
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,421
-Naruto.

14
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,654
-You'll have to
get past me first.

15
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,587
If I were still the
weakling I once was,

16
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,921
I would tell you everything
you want to know.

17
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,054
-Arashi, please.

18
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:37,254
-Forget it.

19
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:40,554
The Arashi you used to
know is dead and gone.

20
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:44,121
What you see now is a fusion
of Ninja Art Cadaver Puppets,

21
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:47,921
just a lump of unfeeling flesh.

22
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:51,921

00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,421

[laughing]

25
00:02:58,454 --> 00:02:59,921
-OK, Sakura.

26
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:02,054
You look after her while
I take care of this.

27
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:03,087
-Naruto, no.

28
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:04,321
You're not really
going to fight him.

29
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,521
-Of course.

30
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:08,121
I've got to get it
through your head, Sasame.

31
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,887
That's not the sweet, gentle
cousin you used to know.

32
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,654
-Jigumo, attack.

33
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,887
-No!

34
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:25,354
-Sasame, sorry.

35
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,487
-This way, this way.

36
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:26,987
Hurry.

37
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,454
-No.

38
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,454
-Sakura, don't do it.

39
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:47,921
[laughing]

40
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,421
ARASHI: Now, Kamikiri.

41
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,387
Initiate now!

42
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:00,854
SAKURA: Naruto!

43
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,154
-Now it's your turn.

44
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,168
-Sakura!

45
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:29,487
ARASHI: Hm.

46
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,621
That was actually close.

47
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,787
I got careless,
let down my guard.

48
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:43,154
Too bad, Naruto.

49
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:48,387
You all had your chance for a
sneak attack and you muffed it.

50
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,021
-Naruto?

51
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:54,487
-All to try and rescue
that worthless dead weight.

52
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:58,254
-A worthless dead weight?

53
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,454
Naruto, I'm sorry.

54
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,154
NARUTO: Don't let him
get to you, Sakura.

55
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,154
It'll take more than
this to stop me.

56
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:11,854
This is nothing.

57
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,387
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

58
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,854
Let's see the three of you
take on the five of me.

59
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:33,721
-Kamikiri.

60
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:51,021
-Naruto.

61
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,365
-Are you all right?

62
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:05,365
You're badly hurt.

63
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,265
-Sakura, I keep telling you,
it's only a flesh wound.

64
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,265
ARASHI (MOCKINGLY):
Sakura, I keep telling you,

65
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:15,699
it's only a flesh wound.

66
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,632
[laughing]

67
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:21,832
-Oh yeah?

68
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,632
You won't be laughing for long.

69
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,332
-You know what?

70
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,365
You're right.

71
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,965
Because this farce
is just about over.

72
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:34,199
Kamikiri, Jigumo, fuse
your chakra with mine.

73
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,565
Give it all to me.

74
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,999
[groaning]

75
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:45,432
[arashi chanting]

76
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,265
SASAME: No, how could
Arashi know that?

77
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,232
-Huh?

78
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,199
It's a forbidden
jutsu known only

79
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,299
to the ancient chiefs
of the Fuma Clan.

80
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:03,932
-Forbidden?

81
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,765
Why?

82
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:10,232
-Fuma Ninja Art
Spell of the Mandara.

83
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,632
-Naruto.

84
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:24,099
-OK, what the heck
is this thing?

85
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,599
-It's the end.

86
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,565
-Naruto.

87
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,699
As the chakra cage
shrinks, the person within

88
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:45,032
is crushed smaller
and smaller until both

89
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,865
are the size of a pebble.

90
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,599
What's more, there's
no way to break free.

91
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:54,865
Not while I maintain the jutsu
and keep up the pressure.

92
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:55,365
See?

93
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,332
[screaming]

94
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:00,832
-Naruto!

95
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:07,765
[laughing]

96
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,665
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
There's nothing I can do.

97
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,099
There's nothing I'm
capable of doing.

98
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,032
Nothing's changed.

99
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:29,465
I'm still no use at all.

100
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:33,365
-No, Arashi.

101
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,332
You can't do this.

102
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:34,832
No!

103
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,932
-Sasame?

104
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,865
What have you done?

105
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,332
-Sasame!

106
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,799
-Come back, Arashi.

107
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:57,232
Come back to me.

108
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,665
I know you haven't gone.

109
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,599
You're still in there
somewhere, I know it.

110
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:05,565
-As I told you before, the
Arashi you used to know

111
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:08,965
is dead.

112
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,199
[gasp]

113
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,165
-You're there,
Arashi, aren't you?

114
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:29,332
-Forgive me, Sasame.

115
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:34,899
All I wanted was the power
to help the Fuma Clan find

116
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,199
its place in the sun once again.

117
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,065
-Yes, I know.

118
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,932
I do understand.

119
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,565
But it's over now.

120
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,899
You can come home.

121
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,232
Come back to the village.

122
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:51,532
-Never again.

123
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:52,299
Look at me.

124
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,332
I've become a monster.

125
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,665
-No, that's not true.

126
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,265
-If you knew the agony, Sasame.

127
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,199
End this.

128
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:08,932
I'm begging you, put
me out of my misery--

129
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,299
[groan]

130
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:12,499
-What am I saying?

131
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:15,332
You tried to kill me and
for that you must pay!

132
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,199
-Please, Arashi, stop!

133
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,099
-Pay with your life.

134
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:41,784
-Sakura.

135
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,584
ARASHI (MOCKINGLY): Sakura.

136
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,251
Watch it or you'll go first.

137
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:47,884
Is that what you want?

138
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,184
Huh?

139
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,551
-Death's not something
to be afraid of.

140
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,751
Sasame taught me that.

141
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,251
-Oh.

142
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:04,084
-Worse than death is a
life that helps no one.

143
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,451
I'm not afraid of
giving my life if it

144
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,517
will help someone
who's important to me.

145
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,451
NARUTO: Hold it.

146
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:15,184
Whatever else happens here,
you're not going to die.

147
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,984
You cannot die.

148
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,684
Got it, Sakura?

149
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,484
-Naruto.

150
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,951
-Oh, please.

151
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,884
What do you think
you can do about it?

152
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,751
It's no use.

153
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:34,751
You're helpless.

154
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:42,151
I'll crush you into nothing
like you never existed.

155
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:43,451
SAKURA: Sasame, no.

156
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,551
-Stop it, Arashi.

157
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,851
Don't do it.

158
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,351
-Sasame, I warn you.

159
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,817
[screaming]

160
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:02,751
-Naruto.

161
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:05,684
-Get away from me.

162
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:06,151
-No.

163
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,917
-Arashi, you're hurt.

164
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,851
-I'm sorry, Sasame.

165
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:48,717
I never meant to cause
you so much suffering.

166
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,317
-No, no, Arashi.

167
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:54,684
You're the one that
suffered, not me.

168
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,917
What can I do?

169
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,084
Tell me, tell me, isn't
there anything I can do?

170
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,784
-You've already done it, Sasame.

171
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,084
See?

172
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,351
It's only thanks to you that
I'm finally myself again.

173
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:15,651
-Naruto.

174
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:21,251
-Sakura.

175
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:24,551
Promise me that you won't
ever try that again.

176
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,484
No life should be
thrown away, not

177
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,151
even for the sake
of someone else.

178
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,617
Sakura, watch out!

179
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:44,017
Huh?

180
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,017
Pervy Sage?

181
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,817
-Sorry if I'm late.

182
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,051
I was held up.

183
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:52,017
You aren't the only ones
who had their hands full.

184
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:53,384
-Well, that's typical.

185
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,584
JIRAIYA: Shake a leg, you two.

186
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:57,584
Come on up.

187
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,817
Let's get back above ground.

188
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:00,317
Hm?

189
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,617
Huh?

190
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,617
-Is she all right?

191
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,717
-She's fine.

192
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,284
She just fainted, that's all.

193
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,084
ARASHI: Naruto.

194
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,051
Now I can finally tell you
the truth-- the mission

195
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,251
that Orochimaru gave us.

196
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,384
He wanted to make sure
that no one took Sasuke

197
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,984
back to the Hidden Leaf
Village, no matter what.

198
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,184
-Then Sasuke must be--

199
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,451
-That's right.

200
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,851
He's alive.

201
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:39,117
Sasuke is the vessel
Orochimaru plans to inhabit.

202
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:40,717
But that can't happen
for three years,

203
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:45,151
so he has to keep
him safe until then.

204
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,151
-Arashi?

205
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,284
Are you coming?

206
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:50,651
-Yeah, get up here, hurry.

207
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:54,617
This place is about to cave in.

208
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,584
[groaning]

209
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,917
-I'm only a puppet
like these two.

210
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,384
This is where I belong now.

211
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:07,884
-Arashi.

212
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:13,817
-Let's go.

213
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,284
SASAME: No!

214
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:15,784
No!

215
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:24,651
ARASHI (VOICEOVER):
Good bye, Sasame.

216
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:25,617
And thank you.

217
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,717
HANZAKI: The loss of
Arashi was only part

218
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,351
of the terrible price
that had to be paid.

219
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:53,651
But the Fuma Clan is
finally free of Orochimaru.

220
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,999
-And free to rebuild
your clan anew.

221
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,366
-And we will.

222
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,766
I know how to begin.

223
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,866
With this-- this life
that I wouldn't even

224
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,499
have without Arashi's help.

225
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,799
We are all grateful
for what you've done.

226
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,899
-It was our pleasure.

227
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,366
-Hanzaki, look after these two.

228
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,766
-I will.

229
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,999
Travel safely, sensei.

230
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:28,733
-Thank you.

231
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,499
-Good bye.

232
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,099
-Thank you for everything.

233
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,233
-Good bye.

234
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,466
Good luck to all of you.

235
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,733
Oh well, look on
the bright side.

236
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,566
We may have failed
to find Sasuke,

237
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,199
but at least we learned
that he's still alive.

238
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,333
What's more, we now
know what Orochimaru

239
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,433
has in store for him.

240
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,433
And that means we
have time on our side.

241
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,233
It seems we have
three years before he

242
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,366
takes over Sasuke's
body as a vessel.

243
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,366
-Right.

244
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,999
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasame knew
what she had to do for her clan

245
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,166
and she did it.

246
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,166
Once again, I was incapable
of doing anything,

247
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,033
depending on Naruto to
come through as usual.

248
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:15,833
-Sakura, that was a
great effort back there.

249
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,899
-No, Arashi was right.

250
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,299
I'm just so much dead weight.

251
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm useless on my own.

252
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,499
-Are you kidding me?

253
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,099
Seeing you put your
life on the line

254
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,466
like that was the
only thing that

255
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:32,399
gave me the guts to carry on.

256
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,599
If it hadn't been
for you, I'd have

257
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,266
been crushed to
bits in that thing.

258
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,933
It's only because of you
that we both survived.

259
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,099
-Thanks for that.

260
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,533
-Hey, hey, hey.

261
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,599
Well said.

262
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,599
You've become quite
a sensitive fellow.

263
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,333
-Hey, put me down, Pervy Sage.

264
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,766
What do you think I am?

265
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,733
A sack of garbage?

266
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:53,666
Come on, knock it off.

267
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,233
-Oops, that's right.

268
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,866
I forgot. [laughing]

269
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,299
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
All I was thinking

270
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,933
of at that moment was
protecting someone I care about.

271
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,266
Maybe that's what
I'm capable of.

272
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,633
-You know, I've been thinking.

273
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,599
-About what?

274
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:26,633
-Of course, I realize there's
a lot of variables involved--

275
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,133
the size of the squad and
the nature of the mission.

276
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,666
But I think it would be a
good idea if every squad had

277
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,499
at least one member of the
Medical Corps assigned to it.

278
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,233
-You certainly don't
have to convince me.

279
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:41,166
I wrote a report long ago that
explained how such a move would

280
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,099
greatly increase our rate
of success and survival.

281
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,466
Problem is it takes a long time
to train Medical Corps shinobi.

282
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,633
They need a whole
different set of skills

283
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,533
than fighting shinobi.

284
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,199
Like perfect mastery and
precision of chakra control,

285
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,299
comprehension of a vast amount
of specialized knowledge,

286
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,099
the brains to know how
to apply it, patience.

287
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,666
But of course, the most
important attribute for anyone

288
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:13,966
who wants to call themselves a
Medical Corps shinobi-- later.

289
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,533
I'm just a little
busy at the moment.

290
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,533
-The most important attribute.

291
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:22,466
Huh.

292
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,833
-Look at this.

293
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,033
My hands are all
wrapped up in bandages.

294
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,833
How am I going to
hold chopsticks?

295
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,699
I'm going to starve.

296
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,799
Hey, Sakura.

297
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,566
I've got a great idea.

298
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,633
You can sit beside
my bed and feed me.

299
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,266
I'll go like this, K?

300
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,566
Uh, Sakura?

301
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,166
[door opening]

302
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:40,633
-Huh?

303
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,833
Hey, don't worry, Sakura.

304
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,866
Really, I was only kidding.

305
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,966
SAKURA: Sorry, Naruto.

306
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:48,466
-Huh?

307
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,566
SAKURA: You may have to
wait for me a little bit.

308
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:05,366
But next time, I promise
I won't be dead weight.

309
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:13,799
-Huh?

310
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,766
[knock on door]

311
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,766
TSUNADE: Come in.

312
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,933
-I'm here to make
a request, milady.

313
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,366
-What is it?

314
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,499
-I would like to
be your apprentice.

315
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,099
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Poor thing.

316
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,966
You must really be desperate.

317
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,199
-Sakura Haruno, I'm told
that you have a fine mind,

318
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,799
and that your will is strong.

319
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,166
Very well.

320
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,133
But be warned, I
won't go easy on you.

321
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:10,633
-Understood.

322
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,766
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
That a girl.

323
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,899
Looks like we accomplished
more on this mission

324
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:22,899
than we thought.

325
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:33,211
[theme music]

326
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,444
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That
lazy old Pervy Sage.

327
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:06,644
(MOCKING JIRAIYA) You'll
be my only student, Naruto.

328
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,277
I'll make a full-fledged
shinobi out of you.

329
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,044
Yeah right.

330
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:11,911
So when do we get started?

331
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:15,177
Meanwhile, Grandma Tsunade's
got Sakura on the fast track.

332
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,377
She's in full training, 24-7.

333
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,544
And what am I doing?

334
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,277
Sitting around,
waiting for Pervy Sage

335
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,077
to get back from
some stupid mission.

336
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,011
Ugh.

337
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,011
I mean, where are
his priorities?

338
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:28,311
Next time-- The Three Villains
From the Maximum Security

339
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:29,425
Prison.
