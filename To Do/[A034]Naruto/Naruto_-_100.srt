00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:08,166
[theme music]

2
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:55,474
[school bell]

3
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,441
STUDENT: Bye, sensei.

4
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,374
-Thanks, Iruka-sensei,
see you later.

5
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:00,874
-We'll see you tomorrow.

6
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:01,707
-OK.

7
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,441
Keep working on that jutsu.

8
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:05,374
Transformation takes
a lot of practice.

9
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,441
Oh, and be sure to
remind your parents

10
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,341
about the big inauguration.

11
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,607
We usher in the Fifth
Hokage tomorrow.

12
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,041
BOTH: OK, bye.

13
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,607
-Oh, Konohamaru.

14
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,174
-What is it, Iruka-sensei?

15
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,907
-Mm, oh, nothing.

16
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,874
I'll see you tomorrow.

17
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,341
-I'll catch you
later, Iruka-sensei.

18
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,074
IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
Looks like he's

19
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,274
made a bit of a break-through.

20
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:37,807
-Hey, Lee.

21
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,874
Coming back from rehabilitation?

22
00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:44,107
-Yes, I am.

23
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,007
-I hope you're off
to a speedy recovery.

24
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,041
-Thank you, Iruka-sensei.

25
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,241
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): To activate
all of his cells at once.

26
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,641
If it were just one by one,
it'd be a snap, but all of them

27
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:15,274
together, that'll be tough.

28
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,774
-Come on, Bushy Brow.

29
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,174
We need to hurry and
get a move on already.

30
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:49,707
The Hidden Leaf Village
is in a mess of trouble.

31
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,007
-Don't worry, Lee.

32
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,441
You'll get better in no time
with Lady Tsunade looking

33
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,607
after you.

34
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,907
-It's best if you give
up being a shinobi.

35
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,041
Find a different path.

36
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,674
LEE (VOICEOVER):
Sensei and Student.

37
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:07,741
The Bond of the Shinobi.

38
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:17,574
-Go, jutsu.

39
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,041
Transformation Jutsu.

40
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:32,441
GUY: Hey, kid.

41
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:40,474
The glory of youth is in
its unbridled passion.

42
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,541
You just keep chipping
away at it, son.

43
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,841
You'll make a splendid
shinobi some day.

44
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,141
LEE (VOICEOVER): Who is he?

45
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:52,741
He is so confident.

46
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,241
-Grab hold of life
by both horns.

47
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,474
That's what youth is for.

48
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,407
Good bye.

49
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,907
[laughing]

50
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,207
LEE (VOICEOVER): That was the
first time I met Guy-sensei.

51
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:12,041
And then--

52
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:16,207
GUY: As of today,
you are all Genin.

53
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,074
So now tell me why
have you done it?

54
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:20,541
What are your goals?

55
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,807
Hm?

56
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,141
-I'd rather not say.

57
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,274
-How about me, sensei?

58
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,241
I want to show I can
be a splendid ninja

59
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:34,974
as well, even if I do not
have ninjutsu or genjutsu.

60
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,807
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

61
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,307
GUY (VOICEOVER):
There's that look.

62
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,441
-Hmph.

63
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,274
-What?

64
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,307
What is so funny?

65
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,907
You think I am joking?

66
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,941
I mean it.

67
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,774
I will be a splendid
ninja just by using

68
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,074
taijutsu and nothing else.

69
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,041
-You nitwit.

70
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,341
Without ninjutsu
or genjutsu, you

71
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:54,074
can hardly call yourself
a ninja, can you?

72
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,574
Do you remember when they told
you you were the first person

73
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,041
to graduate who could
only use taijutsu?

74
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,207
They weren't saying that
because it was impressive.

75
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,774
They only meant
that it was unusual.

76
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,007
-Listen up.

77
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,441
If you've got the passion, that
isn't necessarily the case.

78
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:22,707
With the right amount of passion
and some healthy competition

79
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:26,507
to spur each other on,
you'll all be great ninja.

80
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,741
You'll still have to work
your butts off though.

81
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:29,907
LEE (VOICEOVER): Passion.

82
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,441
-Hahaha.

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,474
LEE (VOICEOVER): I-- I was
captivated by Guy-sensei,

84
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,241
by what he said and what he did.

85
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:49,541
-Late again by 17
minutes and 32 seconds.

86
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,541
-How about we skip this today?

87
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:54,007
-We've tied each
other at 48 wins.

88
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,841
Today's face-off will put
one of us in the lead.

89
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:02,907
-You're not going to take
no for an answer, are you?

90
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:06,741
All righty then, it's my turn
to name the challenge, right?

91
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:07,407
-Rah!

92
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,574
So what will it be?

93
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:09,607
A round of taijutsu?

94
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,407
A 100 meter dash?

95
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,507
Holding our breath?

96
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,441
Or an eating contest maybe?

97
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:16,407
-Oh boy.

98
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,641
-OK, I got one.

99
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,341
-Yeah!

100
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,207
Lay it on me.

101
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,274
-Rock paper scissors.

102
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:35,574
-Wha--?

103
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,007
-Are you nuts?

104
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,974
That's what you choose?

105
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,807
-You know, it's not
all about skill.

106
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,807
Sometimes you need
a little luck.

107
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:46,207
It'll be a good way to test
your powers of observation.

108
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,474
-I guess you're right.

109
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:49,541
-I don't know.

110
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,374
I think Kakashi's
just messing with him

111
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,574
so he doesn't have
to break a sweat.

112
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,407
-Yeah, looks like.

113
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,841
-All right, you're on.

114
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:58,541
And I aim to win.

115
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:01,707
If I lose, I'll take 500 laps
around the Leaf Village--

116
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,874
on my hands too.

117
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,774
-There you go again.

118
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,007
-That's a promise.

119
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,174
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Great.

120
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:11,841
Another one of his oddball
self-imposed rules.

121
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,274
-What on earth is he thinking?

122
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,007
He can't do that.

123
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,374
He acts like a seven-year-old.

124
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,407
-You are right.

125
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,874
That is impossible
even for Guy-sensei.

126
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,174
-Reckless is what I'd call it.

127
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:30,641
BOTH: Rock, paper--

128
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,641
-I thought I'd find you here.

129
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:42,007
-Guy-- Guy-sensei, how did
you know where to look for me?

130
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,074
-I know everything
about you, Lee.

131
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:52,041
I hear you've been skipping
out on your physical therapy.

132
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:52,907
You know better.

133
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,674
-Back when I first
made Genin, I swore

134
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:09,074
I would realize my every
dream, right here on the spot.

135
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,307
I swore.

136
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,607
And Neji laughed
at me back then.

137
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,274
But I meant every word of it.

138
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:25,007
I am going to be a splendid
ninja as well, even if I do not

139
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,674
have any ninjutsu or genjutsu.

140
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:31,107
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

141
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:35,107
I remember you told me that
with the right amount of passion

142
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:40,407
and some healthy competition,
we would all be great ninja.

143
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,041
And to make it happen, we
would have to work for it.

144
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,807
I knew I could do it.

145
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,641
STUDENTS: Transform!

146
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,274
LEE: Back in the
academy, there was not

147
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,541
a single person--
sensei or student--

148
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,474
who said that kind
of thing to me.

149
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,607
Your words were a relief.

150
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,741
Just as I was
starting to feel lost,

151
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:15,007
you lifted the fog from my eyes.

152
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,807
I knew all I had to
do was work harder.

153
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,274
And when I said
that hard work was

154
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,674
no match against
true genius, you

155
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:37,107
told me I was a
genius of hard work.

156
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,274
Thanks to you and
your encouragement,

157
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:45,074
I finally learned the importance
of believing in myself.

158
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,507
-The chances of surgery being
successful are 50-50 at best.

159
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,907
And if it fails, he'll die.

160
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,707
[crying]

161
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,841
-But-- but it's not
the same this time.

162
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,807
Even if I believe in myself
and try as hard as I can,

163
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,907
it will not make the
slightest difference.

164
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:16,974
Guy-sensei, please
tell me what to do.

165
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:21,607
Tell me, Guy-sensei.

166
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:25,241
Do you think maybe I can follow
in your footsteps some day?

167
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:29,241
How come I am the only one
being punished like this?

168
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:31,207
I have my own dreams to protect.

169
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,207
I do not care if it means dying.

170
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,674
I follow my nindo--
my ninja way.

171
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:39,274
Tell me, what should I do?

172
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:43,074
The Eight Inner Gates--
a forbidden jutsu one

173
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,974
can die using.

174
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,407
What do I do?

175
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,341
I am prepared for the worst.

176
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,307
Teach me the forbidden jutsu.

177
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,141
Whatever it takes for my dream.

178
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,241
That means everything to me.

179
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,608
GUY (VOICEOVER): You tried to
become a great ninja relying

180
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,875
only on taijutsu.

181
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,308
Until now, that's all you had.

182
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:28,142
It must be painful knowing
all your hopes and dreams

183
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:32,475
are about to be
ripped away from you.

184
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:34,708
-Is this one of
your students, Guy?

185
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:36,742
It's best if you give
up being a shinobi.

186
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:41,275
-Listen, Lee.

187
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:49,242
If you wish to be freed
of this suffering,

188
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:50,608
you need to make a decision.

189
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,542
-Do you mean that I
should be prepared

190
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,808
to give up on my dreams?

191
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,908
-If you lose your dreams,
you'll undergo pain

192
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,175
far worse than
what you feel now.

193
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,642
The two of us have a
lot in common, Lee.

194
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,742
Without our ninja
way to guide us,

195
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,575
you and I would never survive.

196
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:18,642
Get the operation, Lee.

197
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,108
[knock on door]

198
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,975
-Any progress with the
cell activation jutsu?

199
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,575
-At the end of the day,
this is all about chakra.

200
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:49,542
But with so many different
types of cells-- skin, internal,

201
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,975
muscular-- to activate
them all at once,

202
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,142
it's going to be
a bit difficult.

203
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,142
-Really?

204
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:59,008
Well that doesn't
sound too bad then.

205
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,208
-Are you trying to
test my patience?

206
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:03,675
-No.

207
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,708
I have the utmost faith in you.

208
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:07,275
-Hmph.

209
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:26,308
-You know, it is funny,
but I-- I remember

210
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:28,908
when you and Kakashi-sensei
decided to compete

211
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:32,508
against each other with a
game of Rock Paper Scissors.

212
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,008
He was saying that
skill was not enough,

213
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,542
that sometimes you need luck.

214
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:41,642
And this surgery is 50-50 too.

215
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,342
Live or die.

216
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,375
But this is not some kid's game.

217
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,542
-And what happened after that?

218
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,342
You do remember, don't you, Lee?

219
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:07,575
-Hm, 500, as promised.

220
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,475
[villagers laughing]

221
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:26,542
-Shoot.

222
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,608
Come o-- on.

223
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,208
If I lose, I'll take 500 laps
around the Leaf Village--

224
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:47,642
on my hands too.

225
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,508
That's a promise.

226
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,375
-What on earth is he thinking?

227
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,475
He can't do that.

228
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:53,708
He acts like a seven-year-old.

229
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:07,708
This is nothing.

230
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,642
Lee, what are you
doing out here so late?

231
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:22,908
-What about you?

232
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:25,708
It is not like Kakashi-sensei
is out here to see this,

233
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,175
and neither is anyone
else for that matter.

234
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,375
-When a man struts around like
a peacock acting like Mr. Big

235
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,308
Stuff, he should keep his
promises even if it kills him.

236
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:38,775
That's a promise.

237
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:45,108
What is it?

238
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,542
-Why do you do this?

239
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,575
Every time you're about
to start something,

240
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,375
you make up these crazy rules.

241
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:57,342
-Now that's an
excellent question, Lee.

242
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,742
I've got to hand it to you, son.

243
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,742
You always get
right to the point.

244
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,375
OK, I'll tell you.

245
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:05,742
But remember, this is
just between you and me.

246
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,475
-Why?

247
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,842
What is it?

248
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,342
-All right, that truth is a
ninja's self rule is the key--

249
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,542
the key to victory.

250
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,575
-Self-- self rule?

251
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,742
-Listen, Lee.

252
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:21,142
The point of all these
rules is to stack the deck

253
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,208
against yourself each
and every time you

254
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,408
set your sights on
a new objective.

255
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,942
It's about giving
yourself an obstacle.

256
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:31,742
Instead of seeing it as 500
laps of punishment for losing,

257
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:35,842
I see it as the path of
beating Kakashi the next time.

258
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,608
By leaping that hurdle,
it'll be that much easier

259
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,975
to achieve my next goal.

260
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,308
-Oh, I see.

261
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,308
-Take today.

262
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,942
By chaining myself
to those 500 laps,

263
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:48,475
I forced myself to take
something as trivial

264
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:51,442
as a game of Rock Paper
Scissors with an almost

265
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,142
deadly seriousness.

266
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:54,442
That's the first benefit.

267
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:55,475
-Mhm.

268
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,442
-And besides, even
if you lose, I still

269
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,908
have put in several hundred
laps around the village.

270
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:05,242
If you want to toughen up, it's
the ultimate two step program.

271
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,242
-That is brilliant.

272
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,808
-All right, I still
have a little more left.

273
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:10,575
Upsy-daisy.

274
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:11,608
-I am coming too.

275
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:13,642
I have my own rule to follow.

276
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,208
-Hey, be careful.

277
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,508
Don't push yourself, Lee.

278
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,942
-If I cannot keep up
with you, Guy-sensei,

279
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,175
that means I just have to
push myself even harder.

280
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,308
-Hm?

281
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:26,175
-I want to be like you, sensei.

282
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,208
And as long as I
keep at it, I am

283
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,375
sure to be a splendid
ninja someday.

284
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:31,375
That is a promise.

285
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:35,308
-Right.

286
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:38,342
Well in that case, I'm
adding a new rule--

287
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,442
if you aren't able to keep up
with me for the rest of my laps

288
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:45,008
around the village, I'll put
every last ounce of my being

289
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,308
into training you.

290
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,442
If I train you with
all my soul, there's

291
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:52,608
no question you'll
become a splendid ninja.

292
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:53,942
That's a promise.

293
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,008
-Of course.

294
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,175
How could I forget?

295
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,108
It was the day when
you first taught

296
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:09,175
me the principles behind
our self-imposed rules.

297
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,942
-You worked hard, Lee.

298
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,175
There's no doubt in my mind
the surgery will be a success.

299
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,308
You have the power to
shape your own destiny.

300
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:22,108
And on the 1 in 1,000-- no, 1
in 1,000,000 chance something

301
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:27,975
should happen to go wrong, I
will die right along with you.

302
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,575
Since the day I
met you, my nindo

303
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,842
has been to train you
to become the most

304
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,275
splendid ninja possible.

305
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:43,175
That's a promise.

306
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,675
You and I are too alike.

307
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,608
We cannot survive without
our ninja way to guide us.

308
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:03,342
-G-- Guy-sensei!

309
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,308
[crying]

310
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:10,175
[laughing]

311
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,542
GUY: All right, let's go, Lee.

312
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:17,508
LEE: Yes, sir.

313
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:38,342
-Lady Tsunade.

314
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:05,375
-From this day on, I shall
protect the Hidden Leaf Village

315
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,375
as the Fifth Hokage.

316
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:10,342
[crowd cheering]

317
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,789
[theme music]

318
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,910
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ugh,
his defense is flawless.

319
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,010
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Losing
your cool won't help, Naruto.

320
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,011
Just wait for the next mission.

321
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:08,973
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

322
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:09,573
The next mission's
an overnighter.

323
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,240
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Our best
shot will be at the inn.

324
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,207
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Got it.

325
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Once we get there,

326
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:14,673
we just wait 'til he
lets his guard down.

327
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:15,707
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
And that's when--

328
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,940
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
And that's when--

329
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,540
BOTH: The mask comes off.

330
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,707
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time-- Gotta See!

331
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,907
Gotta Know!

332
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,407
Kakashi-sensei's True Face!

333
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,207
Come on, what are you
hiding under there?
