1
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:14,274
[theme song]

2
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:53,635
-Hm.

3
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,506
Breakfast time.

4
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,075
Shadow clone fishing jutsu.

5
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:00,909
Bombs away.

6
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:19,964
Ah.

7
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,302
-Well?

8
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:25,470
Come on, is that it?

9
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:26,771
I only got three.

10
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:29,207
Now, go and do it again.

11
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,441
-What!

12
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:33,244
SASUKE: I could eat
three fish myself.

13
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,648
-Well, if you think it's so
easy, why don't you get wet

14
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:39,185
and I'll stand on the shore.

15
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:39,952
SAKURA: Sasuke.

16
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,788
The fire's ready to light.

17
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,192
I could use one
of your fireballs.

18
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:48,128
-Ugh, I've got to do
everything around here.

19
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,396
-Huh?

20
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:50,330
You do, huh?

21
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:53,234
What have I been doing?

22
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,703
The Scroll's Secret:
No Peeking Allowed.

23
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,911
SASUKE: It's already
been four days

24
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,280
since the second exam began.

25
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:07,983
SAKURA: That's right.

26
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:10,820
-We're sure not going
to break any records.

27
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:14,957
And we only have 24 hours left.

28
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,827
-I wonder how many
of the other teams

29
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,895
have already got their
scrolls and finished.

30
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,396
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I wonder when

31
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,665
this fish is going to be done.

32
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:24,201
I could eat a whale.

33
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,537
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): If we
don't get a break soon,

34
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,271
we are finished.

35
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,842
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Almost ready.

36
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,079
If I move fast, I bet
I can snag the biggest

37
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,181
one before the others get it.

38
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:37,549
MAN: What are we doing?

39
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:38,984
Who are we chasing?

40
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:41,286
There's probably no one
left in this forest anyway.

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,855
MAN: So what do we do?

42
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,296
-You're right.

43
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,031
The other teams must
have all finished by now.

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,034
-Yeah, it's been four days.

45
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,373
Anyway, we've been
going since dawn.

46
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,441
No need to kill ourselves.

47
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,347
I'll go and try to
find something to eat.

48
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,148
You guys rest.

49
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:15,958
-Hey.

50
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,193
-Yeah?

51
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:21,798
-If I remember right, I
think the other scroll,

52
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,166
it had heaven written on it.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,935
And it was different
from this one

54
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,370
because it had white
around the edges, right?

55
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,373
-I don't know.

56
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,641
I guess so.

57
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:31,875
I wasn't really paying
too much attention

58
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:33,811
when they showed them to us.

59
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:34,979
Anyway, why?

60
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,649
What's the big deal
all of a sudden?

61
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,249
-Ha-ha.

62
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:41,920
-Whoa.

63
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:43,055
You're not really thinking--

64
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,068
-We have to face
it, there may not

65
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,572
be anymore heaven scrolls left.

66
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,474
-Well, that's a
cheerful thought.

67
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:02,743
-Maybe so, but it's true.

68
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,678
Look, you said it
yourself, Sasuke.

69
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,914
This is the fourth day
we've been out here.

70
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,917
That means we've already
used up 80% of the time

71
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,420
we've got to complete the exam.

72
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,157
Only 13 teams can pass
because there are only

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,392
13 pairs of heaven
and earth scrolls.

74
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,929
And you've got 26
teams, 78 candidates out

75
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,498
looking for them.

76
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,732
-Huh?

77
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:24,934
-And if those odds
weren't bad enough,

78
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,335
things have gotten even worse.

79
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:32,542
Don't forget that creep
Orochimaru burnt the heaven

80
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,310
scroll we had.

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,248
-Yeah, I remember.

82
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,851
-The number of complete pairs
of scrolls that could be found

83
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,088
was reduced by one right there.

84
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,055
-Hm?

85
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,591
SAKURA: Not to
mention all the ones

86
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:48,193
that had been found and secured
by other teams since then.

87
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,565
-Maybe we gave
ourselves too much time

88
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,203
to rest and recover from our
last fight, I don't know.

89
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:01,441
What I do know is that we've got
to get serious now and make up

90
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,077
for lost time.

91
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:08,782
The next enemy we face
could be our last chance.

92
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:09,950
I'm going to get water.

93
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,002
NARUTO: Hey, Sakura!

94
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:30,206
I know how we can do this
without having to fight anyone.

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,241
-Huh?

96
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,099
-Look.

97
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,513
SAKURA: Look at what?

98
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,715
NARUTO: What do you
mean, look at what?

99
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:39,783
Scrolls.

100
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,652
I've got tons of them.

101
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:45,490
You know, manuals of
ninjutsu and stuff like that.

102
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,625
We could change one of
these to look exactly

103
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,693
like the heaven scroll.

104
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:51,696
-Stop, don't even.

105
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,165
Even if you cold
fake the outside,

106
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,000
how do you fake
what's written inside?

107
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,402
You couldn't know
without reading it,

108
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:59,605
and that's against
the rules, idiot.

109
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,140
-I've got it all figured out.

110
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,643
I think these things have a
secret code written in them

111
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:07,247
that only makes sense if
you put them both together.

112
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,415
Yeah.

113
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,217
And that secret code
is like the password

114
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,086
you need in order to
get into the tower

115
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,553
at the end of the exam.

116
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:14,689
Get it?

117
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,623
-All I get is that
you're a nimrod.

118
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,192
-Huh?

119
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:18,893
-We've never even had a heaven
scroll, so how in the world

120
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,362
are we going to fake
what's inside it?

121
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,364
-Uh.

122
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:24,766
Oh.

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,002
-The next brilliant
idea you get, how

124
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,937
about keeping it to yourself?

125
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,540
We got enough problems.

126
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,042
-But wait.

127
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:36,579
We do have a clue to what's
inside the heaven scroll,

128
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:38,348
the earth scroll.

129
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,017
-You wouldn't.

130
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,020
-It's our only chance.

131
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,523
I'm going to open
and read this scroll.

132
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,490
-Ah!

133
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:47,491
-Naruto!

134
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,393
Can't you get it
through your empty head?

135
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,363
We're expressly forbidden
from opening the scrolls

136
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,566
before arriving at the tower!

137
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,967
-I know.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,137
But if we don't do anything,
we'll never make it.

139
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,676
MAN: Careful.

140
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:34,943
Take it slow.

141
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,012
It might be booby-trapped
or something.

142
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:40,283
-Yeah, I've thought of that.

143
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:28,803
[screaming]

144
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:48,892
-Hey.

145
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:49,525
What's wrong?

146
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,331
Guys?

147
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,439
Hey, what's the
scroll doing there?

148
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,213
What happened?

149
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:09,715
What did you guys do?

150
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,990
-I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

151
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:48,591
-Huh?

152
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): An enemy.

153
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,712
I can't believe you, guys.

154
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:11,316
KABUTO: If I hadn't
come along when I did.

155
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,551
-Sorry, Sasuke.

156
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,286
-I'm [mumbling].

157
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,288
-There have been others
who have broken the rules

158
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,890
and tried to peek
at the scrolls.

159
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,759
I've seen what happens to them.

160
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,627
They're protected by
a powerful hypnosis

161
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,330
jutsu, a kind of
booby-trap for anyone

162
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:27,533
unwise enough to
try to read them.

163
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:28,869
It will knock you senseless.

164
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:33,975
And by the time you wake
up, the exam is over.

165
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,309
-Kabuto, right?

166
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,712
We met at the registration.

167
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,648
What are you doing wandering
around all by yourself?

168
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:44,119
KABUTO: Don't worry, I'm
not after your earth scroll.

169
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:45,721
-I guess not.

170
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,924
I suppose if you were, you would
have just swiped it from Naruto

171
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,793
when you had the chance.

172
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:54,230
So you're looking for a
heaven scroll too, huh?

173
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:55,364
-Not really.

174
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,567
You see, I already
have them both.

175
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,173
I had a run of luck.

176
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,641
I was just on my
way to the tower

177
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,845
to wait for my
teammates to show up.

178
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,480
So if you'll excuse me.

179
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:12,617
-Hold it.

180
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,023
I'll fight you for it.

181
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:26,365
MAN: What a lucky break.

182
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:28,701
-You'll fight me for it?

183
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:29,336
-But Sasuke.

184
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,237
-Hold on a second.

185
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,405
Is this a joke or what?

186
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,307
-Are you serious?

187
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,409
-Perfectly.

188
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,313
Sorry, but I don't
have time to play nice.

189
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,781
-Back off, Sasuke.

190
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:43,551
In case you've forgotten,
this guy saved our butts.

191
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,919
-Naruto has got a point.

192
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:47,021
We don't want to be
ungrateful or anything.

193
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,357
-Shut up.

194
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,793
-But Sasuke.

195
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,162
-It can't be helped.

196
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:54,930
It's either him or us.

197
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:57,367
Out here, it's all about
surviving and winning.

198
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,068
Nothing else matters.

199
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:00,270
-Hm.

200
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,173
You're lying.

201
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,041
-He is?

202
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,577
-Come on, admit it.

203
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,982
For all your tough talk, your
heart really isn't in it.

204
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:14,551
If it was true, if winning
was really the only thing that

205
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:19,291
mattered to you, why openly
challenge me to a fight?

206
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,927
Why announce it and
put me on my guard?

207
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,397
Why not just jump me
when my back is turned?

208
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,503
After all, that's
what a ninja would do.

209
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:33,807
-Hm, that's pretty deep.

210
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,008
KABUTO: It's OK.

211
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,144
Actually, I admire you for it.

212
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,713
So here's what I'll do.

213
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:42,750
I'll show you the path
you should follow.

214
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,387
But let's go, it's best
we get out of here.

215
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,822
The smell of that
cooking fire is

216
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,525
going to draw every wild
beast in the forest.

217
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:53,629
And not only animals,
but the competition, too.

218
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:01,441
Hm.

219
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:08,611
SASUKE: You think
there are still

220
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:10,080
other candidates out here?

221
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,182
KABUTO: Oh, yeah.

222
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:13,951
Just think about it.

223
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,853
What do you think is
the most efficient way

224
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:19,023
of finding the scrolls in
an area as large as this?

225
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,492
To go searching through
the forest for them?

226
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,994
SAKURA: Uh, no.

227
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,397
KABUTO: No.

228
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,632
You wait for them
to come to you.

229
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,469
The tower at the center of
the forest is the goal, right?

230
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,705
So on the last day of
the exam, that area

231
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,707
will be crawling
with teams converging

232
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,776
on the tower with their scrolls.

233
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,543
-Oh, yeah.

234
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,645
I get it, like an ambush.

235
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,849
So we just head for the
tower, find a hiding place,

236
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,552
and when a team comes
along with a heaven scroll,

237
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,853
we jump them and take it.

238
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,789
KABUTO: That's one
third of the problem.

239
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,157
SAKURA: Huh?

240
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,827
-You guys aren't going to be
the only ones thinking of this.

241
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,762
Every other team
that's lacking a scroll

242
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:57,365
will be lying in
wait just like you.

243
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,366
-So what?

244
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,935
The more the merrier, I say.

245
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:03,806
Whoever they are, we'll
take care of them.

246
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,108
Wouldn't want this
to be too easy.

247
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,410
That wouldn't be any fun.

248
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,412
OK, so we grab
someone else's scroll

249
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,580
and keep those losers
from grabbing ours.

250
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:14,618
And bingo, we'd pass
the second exam.

251
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:16,386
KABUTO: That's two
thirds of the problem.

252
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,388
SAKURA: Well, at least
we're getting closer.

253
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:19,790
What else?

254
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:22,359
-Well, there's bound to
be some collectors lurking

255
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,094
around at the finish line.

256
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:25,996
-Collectors?

257
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,665
-Even when you think
you're home free,

258
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:30,902
you can't relax your
guard for an instant.

259
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:34,673
This kind of exam always
brings them out-- collectors.

260
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:36,575
They gather extra
sets of scrolls

261
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,744
to use for various ends.

262
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,280
For example, to bribe their way
out of unexpected situations,

263
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:44,250
or to provide their village
mates with the scroll

264
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,718
they're lacking.

265
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,887
Some steal them to keep
candidates from rival villages

266
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,723
from passing, or
to help out teams

267
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:51,291
from their own
village who couldn't

268
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,060
find the scrolls on their own.

269
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,297
Others steal them for
their own dark purposes.

270
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,100
They'll hang onto them to use
against the stronger teams

271
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,534
farther down the line.

272
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:05,106
They'll be there all right,
and they're bad news.

273
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,842
The closer you get to the
tower, the more likely

274
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:10,980
you'll be to run into them.

275
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,014
-I see.

276
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,949
And I think I'm
starting to understand

277
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,686
why you brought us
along with you, hm?

278
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,422
It's because you're
frightened, aren't you?

279
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,724
-You bet I am.

280
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:32,770
There's the tower, and that
means the end is in sight.

281
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,206
Now comes the hard part.

282
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,973
-Well, it's about time.

283
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,876
Bring it on.

284
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,745
-There's someone back there.

285
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,826
Ha, false alarm.

286
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:55,062
It's just a centipede.

287
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,396
-Just a centipede?

288
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,034
That creepy thing's
as big as a bus.

289
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,201
-Hey, Naruto.

290
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,703
-Hm?

291
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:05,373
-Do us a favor and try to
keep it down to a dull roar,

292
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:06,875
will you?

293
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:08,243
-Hm?

294
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,746
-See, the whole idea is not
to let anyone know we're here.

295
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,981
If you go crashing through
the forest like an elephant,

296
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,451
you're going to draw
collectors like flies.

297
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,120
We want to find them
before they find us.

298
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,122
-Oh, yeah.

299
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,658
I see your point.

300
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,626
KABUTO: Take it slow and quiet.

301
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,129
Let's use all the
time we've got left.

302
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:26,930
-OK.

303
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,397
-Right.

304
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:27,931
-Got it.

305
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,078
-Hm, that's more like it.

306
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,003
OK, we're getting closer.

307
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,929
-A trap, huh?

308
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:26,963
-Yeah.

309
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:29,232
And it only gets
worse from here on in.

310
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,107
-Hey.

311
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:37,965
Ah!

312
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,887
Kabuto!

313
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:58,665
KABUTO: Well, that was close.

314
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:01,368
NARUTO: A substitution jutsu.

315
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:05,305
-Like I told you, it only
gets worse from here on in.

316
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,849
SAKURA: For crying out loud.

317
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:15,850
NARUTO: Sakura.

318
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:18,787
-How far have we walked?

319
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,890
That tower's not
getting any closer.

320
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:26,061
-Now that you mention it,
I was thinking that, too.

321
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,663
It's weird.

322
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:28,931
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Maybe not.

323
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:31,567
It would seem
we've been spotted.

324
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,337
Somebody is playing
games with us.

325
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,839
Look.

326
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:37,207
Ring a bell?

327
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,808
-Huh?

328
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,343
Oh man, no way.

329
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,877
It can't be.

330
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,851
Hey, what's the big idea?

331
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,285
-What's going on?

332
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,521
-Genjutsu.

333
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,556
-That's what it looks like.

334
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,459
And we fell for it completely.

335
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,463
We were so concerned with
not being seen by anyone,

336
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,533
we didn't see we were
walking around in circles.

337
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,969
-What's their game?

338
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,305
-They're probably trying to
wear us down and then strike

339
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:10,110
when we're frustrated
and physically exhausted.

340
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:12,479
SASUKE: You mean like
we are right now?

341
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,781
KABUTO: Right.

342
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,150
They'll be coming soon.

343
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:31,400
[gasps]

344
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:04,403
-Well, Naruto, you
wanted a fight.

345
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:04,970
-Hm.

346
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,372
4 against 40.

347
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,540
I like those odds.

348
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:23,591
[theme song]

349
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,256
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Look at all these guys.

350
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,625
It's like a clone convention.

351
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:55,926
Well, I've got news for them.

352
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,796
They're not the only
ones with a clone jutsu.

353
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,931
You want to see clones?

354
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,432
I'll show you clones.

355
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,034
They think they can
steal our scroll

356
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,636
after all we went
through to get it?

357
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:05,803
Get real.

358
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,205
I don't care if
there's 400 of them.

359
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,540
By the time I'm
through with them,

360
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:11,544
they're going to need
400 hospital beds.

361
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:12,811
Believe it.

362
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:14,881
Next time, clone versus clone.

363
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:18,481
Mine are better than yours.

364
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,114
Ya!
