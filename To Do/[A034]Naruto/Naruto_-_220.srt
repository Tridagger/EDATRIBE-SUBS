1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,951
-So, that's the Shukaku.

2
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,487
It's the first time
I've ever seen it.

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,823
-Go on.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,258
Get out of here, will ya?

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,061
-But-- but Gaara-sensei.

6
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,063
-Get moving.

7
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,866
Gaara's only trying
to keep you safe.

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,036
Now get out while you can!

9
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,938
-All right.

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,873
-Oh, man.

11
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,741
That what I think it is?

12
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,009
-Yeah.

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,879
The transformation's begun.

14
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,881
-This is bad.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,083
-Naruto!

16
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,518
-Naruto!

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,252
-Hinata.

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,087
Sakura.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,689
-Matsuri, you OK?

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,524
-Yeah.

21
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,627
But Gaara-sensei needs help.

22
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,895
-OK, I'll let you
look after her.

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,738
-What do you think
you're doing, Naruto?

24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,106
You're badly hurt.

25
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,075
Stay out of it.

26
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,643
-I can't.

27
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,045
-Come on, you won't
last a minute.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,681
At least let me patch you up.

29
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:25,118
[theme music]

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,723
TEMARI: Things are going
to get really ugly.

31
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,591
Really soon.

32
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,026
-I was afraid of that.

33
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,627
Sakura, will you hurry up?

34
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,896
It's not like we've got all
the time in the world, here.

35
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,497
-Right.

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,131
Got it.

37
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,767
OK, now hold your hands out.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,642
-OK.

39
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,513
-What in the world's
going on there?

40
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,214
-What do you see?

41
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,481
What is it?

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,950
NEJI: Gaara appears
to be transforming

43
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,152
into some sort of half beast.

44
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,722
While his opponent's chakra
is increasing exponentially.

45
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,958
-That one called
himself Seimei, and said

46
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,060
he was the founder of
the Village of Artisans.

47
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,730
He said he'd been reborn
as the ultimate ninja tool.

48
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,565
-A lousy thief is what he is.

49
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,667
He's stealing Gaara's chakra.

50
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,836
-Come to think of it,
the enemy we faced

51
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,472
woere a similar sort of
armor, with the power

52
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,241
to absorb one's chakra.

53
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,041
-Hm.

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,177
Armor that feeds on chakra.

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,045
We must be very careful.

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,747
We can't just rush in.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,551
-Yeah, but we
gotta do something.

58
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,988
-I never imagined I would
be fighting Shukaku himself.

59
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,925
But far from dreading the
battle, I'm delighted.

60
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,494
It will give me the
opportunity to prove that even

61
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,063
his power is no match for
the Village of Artisans'

62
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,531
ultimate ninja tool.

63
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:42,582
GAARA (VOICEOVER): What c
be that makes him so strong?

64
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,785
-I care more about
them than I do myself.

65
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,688
And I won't let
anyone hurt them.

66
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,990
That's why I won't ever give up.

67
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:56,095
I will stop you, even
if I have to kill you.

68
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,901
-But why-- why would you do
this for anyone but yourself?

69
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,038
-Because they saved
me from myself.

70
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,507
They rescued me
from my loneliness.

71
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:12,078
They were the first to
accept me for who I am.

72
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,112
Thy're my.

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,815
Friends.

74
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,851
-Well, love is
the heart's desire

75
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,054
to serve someone who
is precious to you.

76
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:25,091
To watch over them,
like my sister did.

77
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,694
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Love?

78
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,064
Is that the thing that
makes him so strong?

79
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,951
[groan]

80
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,523
-Gaara

81
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,191
-Look!

82
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,927
He's-- he's returning to normal.

83
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,061
-But how?

84
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,629
What happened?

85
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,931
-He stopped it.

86
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,867
He's using all his strength to
fight off the transformation.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,935
-But why?

88
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,470
He'll need every
advantage he can

89
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,105
get if he's going
to beat that guy.

90
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,741
-That may be, but
even so, he's chosen

91
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,644
to depend on his own powers, not
that of the monster within him,

92
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,146
which he knows he can't control.

93
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,468
[laughter]

94
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,137
-So it was too much
for your chakra

95
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,539
to complete the
transformation, eh?

96
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,643
-If I'm to help my friends,
I must do it for myself.

97
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,911
On my own.

98
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,479
-You fool.

99
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,182
You're allowing your
emotions to guide you.

100
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,851
A shinobi must abandon
emotion if he's ever

101
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,187
to obtain ultimate power.

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,892
And power-- power is the
only truth in this world.

103
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,827
As you're about to find out.

104
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,699
It's over.

105
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,245
Your time is done, you
freak of the Sand Village.

106
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,652
Mm?

107
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,986
Why so cocky?

108
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,555
You have no more chakra.

109
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,924
In fact, I'm surprised
you have the strength

110
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
to hold that grin on your face.

111
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,495
-Yes, my chakra's
almost totally depleted.

112
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,198
But all the time I was
trapped in that cage,

113
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,634
do you think I was just sitting
on my hands doing nothing, huh?

114
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,537
-Meaning?

115
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,538
-Sand Tsunami!

116
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,645
-Ha.

117
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,149
It would appear that you've run
out of sand, as well as chakra.

118
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,151
-I'm Gaara of the Desert.

119
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,220
Wherever there's rock,
wherever there's earth,

120
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,688
I can make more sand.

121
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,068
[shout]

122
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,704
-SEIMEI: Kujaku
Hurricane Formation.

123
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,645
You have that much chakra left?

124
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,746
How unexpected.

125
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,481
On the other hand,
that means there's

126
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,049
that much more I can feed on.

127
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,726
-He's draining the
last of Gaara's chakra.

128
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,661
-Huh?

129
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,562
-Gaara-sensei!

130
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,496
-That does it!

131
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,730
NEJI: Just stay out of it!

132
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,698
-Stay out of it?

133
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,832
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,968
-Look, you'll only be
getting in the way.

135
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,870
And Gaara is stronger
than you think.

136
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,708
-Hope so.

137
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,677
[laughter]

138
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,086
GAARA: Extreme Tempered
Ultimate Attack, Shukaku's Pike!

139
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,769
-How?

140
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,771
How did you-- no!

141
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,739
It's impossible.

142
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,741
-You wouldn't understand.

143
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,643
You're only a ninja tool.

144
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,712
You turned your
back on being human.

145
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,962
-Ridiculous.

146
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,517
It can't be.

147
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,518
It can't be!

148
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,159
-Giant Sand Burial!

149
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,740
-All right!

150
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,707
-He did it!

151
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,675
Gaara-sensei beat him!

152
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,643
-He sure did!

153
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,644
Hey, Gaara!

154
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,518
-Gaara!

155
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,679
-Gaara!

156
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,558
-He's all right.

157
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,662
He's just exhausted from having
to use so much of his chakra.

158
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,998
TEMARI: To think, he was able
to suppress Shukaku and do it

159
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,533
all on his own.

160
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,202
-Yeah.

161
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:16,642
-I will work hard, and connect
to the people of this village.

162
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,613
Watching Naruto Uzumaki
has brought me clarity.

163
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,684
Until I met him,
my ties to others

164
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,253
brought only pain and sorrow.

165
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,990
But he was always pushing
me to redefine those ties.

166
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:41,634
I think I finally understand
the suffering and sorrow,

167
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,835
and the joy.

168
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,506
These are feelings I can
share with those around me.

169
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,978
-I guess you finally found
someone who understands you,

170
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,480
didn't you?

171
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,214
-Huh?

172
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,015
What did you say?

173
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,718
-Oh, nothing at all.

174
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,553
-Hm?

175
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,954
-Would you look at that?

176
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,824
We go to all the trouble
of rushing to the rescue,

177
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,492
and it's all over.

178
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,660
-Heh.

179
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,062
It appears that Naruto's
coming along pretty well.

180
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,499
Not that he's not still an
inexperienced knucklehead.

181
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,001
KAKASHI: My, you
are hard to please.

182
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,036
JIRAIYA: You know it.

183
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,664
-Huh?

184
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:47,799
Gah!

185
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:48,700
Pervy Sage?

186
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,968
-Ah.

187
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,769
Long time no see, Naruto.

188
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:54,939
-Don't you give me that long
time no see stuff, old man!

189
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,075
You were supposed to be
supervising my training,

190
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,544
teaching me everything you
know, making me your protege!

191
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,845
What happened to that?

192
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:02,413
Where have you
been all this time?

193
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,916
-Oh, well, I've had a lot to do.

194
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,851
Been busy with my research.

195
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,419
-Yeah, yeah, spying
on pretty women

196
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,555
for those stupid books of yours.

197
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,756
-Stupid, huh?

198
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,792
Anyway, it just so happens
you're way off base.

199
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,828
I was gathering as
much information

200
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,830
as I could on the Akatsuki.

201
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:20,031
-Akatsuki?

202
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:21,099
-Yes.

203
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,034
I have a pretty good
idea what they're up to.

204
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,837
I estimate we have about two
years before they're really

205
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,374
ready to make their move, which
means I have that much time

206
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,776
to try and make a
real ninja out of you.

207
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,320
You ready for some
serious training?

208
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,087
-Heh.

209
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,656
I've been ready for
months, old man.

210
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,969
TEMARI: We owe you one.

211
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,071
SHIKAMARU: Aw, skip it.

212
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:03,374
We're just returning the favor
that you guys did for us.

213
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,009
Next time you'll owe us one.

214
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,578
-Well, at least this time
you didn't get all choked up.

215
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:08,579
That's an improvement.

216
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,014
-Sheesh, women.

217
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,684
You always gotta
get the last dig in.

218
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,918
-What about him?

219
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,386
-Huh?

220
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,388
-Oh, you mean Naruto?

221
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:18,756
He leaves the
village this morning

222
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,625
to begin his training
with Jiraiya.

223
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:21,492
KANKURO: Jiraiya?

224
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,794
One of the Sannin?

225
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:23,795
-Yeah.

226
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,797
It's going to be such a drag.

227
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,565
When he gets back,
he'll be stronger

228
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,468
and more obnoxious than ever.

229
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,502
-Goodbye.

230
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,637
-See ya later.

231
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:33,571
-Yeah.

232
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:34,372
See ya.

233
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,912
-Will you please tell
Naruto something?

234
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:41,979
-Huh?

235
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,515
-Tell him that thanks
to him, I finally

236
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,452
understand what Gaara
was trying to tell me.

237
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,653
-Huh?

238
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,655
-Thank him for making me
see the value of real effort

239
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,389
and dedication.

240
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,664
-Terrific.

241
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,399
Another Naruto fan.

242
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,447
-Well, guess that about does it.

243
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,671
TSUNADE: About the mission
to the Village of Artisans.

244
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:41,606
I've read the report.

245
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,746
Maybe not a perfect 10, but
impressive, nonetheless.

246
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,515
-Thanks, but I need
more experience--

247
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:51,849
-You bet you do.

248
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,918
And that's why I'm going to be
assigning a lot more missions

249
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,887
to you, to build
up your experience.

250
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,889
So get ready to
really apply yourself.

251
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:58,823
-Huh?

252
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:00,525
Forgive me, Lady
Tsunade, but that

253
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:01,926
sounds like a whole lot of work.

254
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,092
-Phew.

255
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,694
-Uh, Sakura?

256
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:37,695
You got a minute?

257
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:38,863
-Huh?

258
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:39,764
Ino?

259
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,098
What's up?

260
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,100
Something wrong?

261
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,769
-See, it's like this.

262
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:47,972
I've been wondering about
something for a while now.

263
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:51,042
It suddenly became clear
to me on our last mission.

264
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,476
I can't do it anymore.

265
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,079
Not like this, anyway.

266
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,014
-Ino.

267
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:00,084
-I saw how important your
job was to the mission.

268
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,720
The way everyone
depended on you.

269
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:06,924
I finally realized, I want
to be a medical ninja.

270
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,027
I know the training will be
tough, but I'm a quick study,

271
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,829
and I'll really buckle
down and work hard.

272
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,364
You know I will.

273
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:16,901
So I'm asking if you'll talk
to Lady Tsunade about it.

274
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:17,802
Sure.

275
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:18,870
-Do you mean it?

276
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,638
-But you know what
this means, don't you?

277
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:22,073
If you really go
through with this,

278
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,508
it means you're my little
protege from now on.

279
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:25,042
-Huh?

280
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,444
Your little what?

281
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:27,712
-It's a fancy word for flunky.

282
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:28,880
Someone you boss around.

283
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,848
Because I'm going
to be your boss.

284
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:31,449
Yeah.

285
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:32,383
Boss.

286
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,519
Can you handle it?

287
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,921
Man, I can't wait.

288
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,390
I've always wanted a
little protege of my own.

289
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,525
But I warn you, I'm
gonna work you hard.

290
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,793
-That's what you think!

291
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,663
Just wait, I'm gonna
leave you in the dust!

292
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,999
-If anything will be in the
dust, it'll be your ugly face!

293
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:48,833
-Yeah, yeah!

294
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:49,867
You and your big forehead!

295
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,673
-Why me?

296
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,508
It's not fair, you know?

297
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,643
-What are you talking about?

298
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,878
-Why was I the
only one who didn't

299
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,713
get to go on that mission?

300
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,615
-But you were otherwise
engaged, Tenten.

301
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,984
You were with another squad.

302
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:09,654
-Everyone went except me!

303
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,056
-She seems a little upset.

304
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,626
-It's hard being the only one
who's not part of the team.

305
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,828
-Yeah, and speaking
of which, Naruto's

306
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:20,464
leaving us to go train.

307
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:21,565
-Yeah, I heard.

308
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,834
And I heard Jiraiya's
going to be his teacher.

309
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,002
-You heard right.

310
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,071
That little jerk's just
going to get stronger.

311
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,639
-Grr.

312
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,042
-Things will be
different around here.

313
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,043
Quieter.

314
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,712
-Don't ask me why,
but I can't help

315
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:37,048
feeling just a little bit sad.

316
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:37,882
ROCK LEE: No!

317
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:40,017
There is no time to be sad.

318
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:44,789
If I am to keep up with Naruto,
I must train harder than ever.

319
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,924
100 times harder, if I must.

320
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:51,629
But I will be ready, when
he comes back to us one day.

321
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,303
-Gotcha!

322
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:58,869
-Lee's right.

323
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,705
We must use this time wisely.

324
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,641
We must use each other,
learn from each other

325
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,376
in order to get stronger.

326
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,044
That's teamwork.

327
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,479
That's friendship.

328
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:09,747
-Hear that?

329
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,649
Sounds like we've got our
work cut out for us, Akamaru.

330
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:12,917
-Arf! Arf!

331
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,652
-I'm ready!

332
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,387
-Lee, are you OK?

333
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,588
-Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,422
Just swell.

335
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:32,370
-Right.

336
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,838
That's enough for today, Hinata.

337
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:34,505
-Huh?

338
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,741
But we didn't--

339
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,910
-It's almost time for
him to be on his way.

340
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,413
We won't be seeing
him again for a while.

341
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,351
IRUKA: Well, well.

342
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,820
You've got quite a
journey ahead of you.

343
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:50,421
NARUTO: Yup.

344
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:54,959
-Hey, listen up.

345
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,093
You keep focused out there.

346
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,029
No goofin' off, all right?

347
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,730
-Focus is my middle
name, Sensei.

348
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:04,668
-All right.

349
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,337
Time to hit the road, Naruto.

350
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,608
-OK!

351
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,512
Thanks for the
ramen, Iruka-sensei.

352
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:15,713
I'll pay you back.

353
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:18,549
In fact, when I'm Hokage,
I'll buy you lunch.

354
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,450
IRUKA: When you're--

355
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,394
IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
Good luck, Naruto.

356
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,743
-Just you watch.

357
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,385
-Sometime this
year would be nice.

358
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:55,352
Let's go!

359
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:55,986
-Huh?

360
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,688
OK, OK, I'm coming!

361
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:58,656
