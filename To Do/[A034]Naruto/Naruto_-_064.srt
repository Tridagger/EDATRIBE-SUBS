[theme song in Japanese]

2
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:55,993
-Aah.

3
00:01:59,165 --> 00:01:59,733
-Uhhh.

4
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,726
-Dammit, Naruto.

00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,468

00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:26,341

[crowd booing]

8
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,096
-They don't care
about this match.

9
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm just the warm up
for the main event.

10
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,005
All they care about
is watching Sasuke.

11
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:48,243
Listen to them, the jerks.

12
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,146
Well, if that's the way
they're going to be,

13
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,217
maybe I won't give
them a match at all.

14
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,056
Why knock myself out for them?

15
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,225
-What is it?

16
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,627
You planning on giving up, too?

17
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,435
-And to top it off, my
opponent's a girl, again.

18
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,914
-Well, he never was
very driven, but this?

19
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,817
-Come on, come on.

20
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:14,619
Get up and fight.

21
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,188
Get it together Shikamaru.

22
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,393
You going to get going
sometime this year?

23
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,303
-Well, if you will move, I will.

24
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,139
-Hey, I didn't
start the match yet.

25
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,209
I forgot.

26
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,243
This girl's a spunky one.

27
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,646
I hate spunky.

28
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:37,555
-Aah.

29
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:46,804
-What?

30
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,006
Huh?

31
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,443
-It really doesn't make
a whole lot of difference

32
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:53,581
to me whether I ever
become a Chuunin or not,

33
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,351
but I guess maybe
I shouldn't let

34
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:59,090
myself get beaten by a female.

35
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:03,163
So let's do it.

36
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:03,731
-Aaagh.

37
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:12,144
Huh?

38
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,121
He's quick when it
comes to running away.

39
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:28,136
-I know it's not very classy
for a guy to clobber a girl,

40
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,909
but whoever said I was classy?

41
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:36,049
-Nice try, but I know
what the game is.

42
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,084
-Shadow Possession Jutsu!

43
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,133
-He's trying to lure me to
the shadow of that tree.

44
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,337
I'm not falling for that.

45
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,507
-So why do I always
have to fight girls?

46
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,243
It sucks, man.

47
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,645
-Go for it, Shikamaru.

48
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:57,483
Use a super, awesome
technique on her,

49
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,185
and take that bitch down.

50
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,861
-Yo, this seat taken?

51
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,633
-I thought you were
in the hospital.

52
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,035
Your stomach's OK now?

53
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:09,636
-Um-hmm.

54
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,810
What's up?

55
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:17,314
I thought Sasuke's match
was supposed to be next.

56
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,751
-Shhhh.

57
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:19,785
-Hmm?

58
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:23,224
-Oh, I'm sure Sasuke's fine.

59
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:26,496
He'll be here any minute now.

60
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,801
Man, you'd think her
puppy died or something.

61
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:30,903
-Hmm.

62
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:34,742
Never expected to see
Shikamaru the final.

63
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:35,477
Weird.

64
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,379
-What do you mean?

65
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,714
Come on.

66
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,550
Shikamaru may not have
as much fighting spirit

67
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,919
as some other people.

68
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,190
And OK, his technique
is pretty lousy,

69
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,059
but he's strong at strategy.

70
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,262
So strong, in fact,
that without him, we

71
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:51,503
might not have gotten through
the preliminary round.

72
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:52,137
-Huh?

73
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,306
Maybe.

74
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,340
-Once more, you
should have seen how

75
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,411
he threw himself into the arena.

76
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,849
I'm telling you, Choji, he
seems unusually aggressive.

77
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:02,687
I think he's going to show
us his passionate side today.

78
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:07,695
Yeah, go Shikamaru.

79
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:14,773
-Ah, sometimes I wish I was
a cloud just floating along,

80
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:17,578
going wherever the
breeze takes me.

81
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,347
That's my style.

82
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,418
I'm just not into putting
effort in this stuff.

83
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,321
The only reason I
became a Ninja was

84
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,925
so I could do whatever I wanted.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,163
Gees, who knew it
would be so much work?

86
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,177
-Get your butt in gear.

87
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,412
Let's go, Shikamaru.

88
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,760
-Oh, well, a guy's gotta
do what a guys' gotta do.

89
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,298
-What's he thinking
behind that stupid grin?

90
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,436
Is he mocking me?

91
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,072
Ninja Art.

92
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,443
[inaudible]

93
00:06:58,476 --> 00:06:59,044
-Aaah.

94
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:10,595
-Remember, this is how
she beat me in our fights.

95
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,199
Nothing I threw at
her could get past it.

96
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:34,233
-Now I get it.

97
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,311
Almost got me.

98
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,950
Aren't you clever with
that Shadow Possession

99
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:47,588
Jutsu of yours,
you can manipulate

100
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,858
any shadow you're in.

101
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,028
The Wall Shadow for instance.

102
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,664
But there's a
limit, isn't there?

103
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:57,737
No matter how thin you stretch
it, it will only reach so far.

104
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,342
Isn't that right?

105
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,245
-You got me.

106
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,016
-And now, I know just
where that limit is.

107
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:09,423
Even using the Wall Shadow, his
Jutsu can only reach to here.

108
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,993
15 meters, 32 centimeters.

109
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,097
That's the range of his attack.

110
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:19,539
If I can just stay outside
this line, he can't touch me.

111
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,643
-She's measured his range.

112
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:22,945
This plays right
to her strength.

113
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,550
She's better at long
range attacks anyway.

114
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,054
This match is as good as over.

115
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:54,428
-Huh?

116
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,162
-What's that?

117
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,934
A hand sign?

118
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,337
-No, he's not
making a hand sign.

119
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,408
It's something
more like a habit.

120
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,710
-A habit?

121
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,647
-That kid, he's like an old man.

122
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,619
He likes to take things slowly.

123
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,588
I mean, really slowly.

124
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,894
That's why he's so good at
games like, Go and Shogi.

125
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,964
He's always challenging
me to a match.

126
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,675
Whenever he gets
stuck in a move,

127
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,678
he does that thing
with his hands.

128
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:35,093
-What does it mean?

129
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:36,428
-He's working on a strategy.

130
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:42,738
-Huh?

131
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:49,950
All the times we've played,
I've never beaten him.

132
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:53,923
-Well, that's fine, but
this is a real fight, not

133
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,425
some game of shogi.

134
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,330
-Strategy on a game board is
no different from strategy

135
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,668
on the field of battle, and
all great generals know that.

136
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,742
Shikamaru has got the mind of a
great general, just you watch.

137
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,478
-You could have fooled me.

138
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:09,548
Don't forget, I
saw the test scores

139
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,150
when we grouped the Genin.

140
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:14,288
His were no better than
Naruto's, maybe worse.

141
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,193
-He says the act of putting
pencil to paper is a drag.

142
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:18,896
It's too much work for him.

143
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,066
He'd rather take a nap
than a written exam.

144
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,468
-He would, huh?

145
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,264
-I didn't say he wasn't lazy.

146
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,267
But he was so good
at strategy games,

147
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,637
I had him take an IQ test.

148
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,774
Of course, I had to
deceive him into thinking

149
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,277
it was just another game.

150
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,923
-Well, what happened?

151
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:02,933
-Hmm, as I suspected, his score
was almost off the charts,

152
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:03,968
beyond genius.

153
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:08,509
The kid has an IQ of over 200.

154
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,110
-200?

155
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,126
-He's done thinking.

156
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,228
Now it begins.

157
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,843
-So you have some
fighting spirit after all.

158
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:41,917
Aaaagh.

159
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,495
No use in hiding.

160
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,479
-Are you sure he's
even got a strategy?

161
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,882
-I hope so.

162
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,663
-Look at that.

163
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,632
He can't get anywhere near her.

164
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,536
Go, Shikamaru, do something.

165
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,772
-Don't waste your breath.

166
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,976
He'll give up soon.

167
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,679
This is way too
much work for him.

168
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:22,815
-What are you talking about?

169
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,818
No way he's going to give up.

170
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,890
At least, I don't think
he's going to give up.

171
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,094
[sound of munching]

172
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,169
-Hmm, it's good.

173
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:47,254
[breathing heavy]

174
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,511
-You can't hide forever.

175
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,081
Come out, coward!

176
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,130
Oh, oh.

177
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:15,532
Forget it.

178
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:19,506
As long as I stay on this side
of the line, he can't touch me.

179
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,243
What the-- It's still coming.

180
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:33,160
-You're pretty
quick on your toes.

181
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,264
-Now I see what
you've been up to.

182
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,034
You weren't just
hiding, you we're

183
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,805
killing time, waiting
for the sun to get lower,

184
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:44,245
and the shadow of that
wall to get longer.

185
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,684
The longer the shadows, the
farther your range is, right?

186
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,496
-Damn, he almost got her.

187
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,234
-How is Shikamaru going
to use his shadow anyway?

188
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,903
I mean, what's he going to do?

189
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,006
He's in the shadow
of the arena already.

190
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,909
-Unbelievable You
really don't know

191
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,413
anything about Shikamaru's
capable of, do you?

192
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:07,715
He can use anything.

193
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,921
He can even make
shadows within shadows.

194
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:13,324
-Shadows within shadows?

195
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,076
-All right.

196
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,979
If I just calculate
the height of the sun

197
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,547
and measuring the
distance he's gained

198
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,786
from his previous attack, I
can still keep out of range.

199
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,722
No problem.

200
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:33,323
Hmph.

201
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,740
-Temari, over your head.

202
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,610
-Hmm.

203
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:46,612
-What is that?

204
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,221
Oh, Oh, no.

205
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,109
-I've got you now.

206
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,652
-He made a parachute
out of his jacket

207
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:13,054
to create another shadow.

208
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,262
Clever move.

209
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,298
Now I not only have to
worry about the shadows

210
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,435
on the ground, I
have to keep an eye

211
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,874
on this thing above my head,
and it extends his range

212
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,276
indefinitely.

213
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,881
Huh, guess I've been
underestimating this slacker

214
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,316
clown.

215
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,019
His Shadow Possessions Jutsu
is a lot more dangerous

216
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,188
than I thought.

217
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,615
-She learns fast.

218
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:52,950
I'll give her that.

219
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:55,988
-Good, but not good enough.

220
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,827
-She thinks in the
same way he does.

221
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,295
She's a strategist, too.

222
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:11,247
The longer this match takes,
the lower the sun gets.

223
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,385
The longer the shadows,
the farther his range.

224
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,595
Time to finish this.

225
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:23,867
If I create a diversion
with the Clone Jutsu--

226
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,578
-Huh?

227
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,282
-Aaaah.

228
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:37,589
Yeah, that'll work.

229
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:42,329
Now Clone Jutsu.

230
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:47,370
What?

231
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:47,971
-Aah.

232
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:48,773
-Oh.

233
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,774
-Huh?

234
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,713
-Hmm?

235
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,549
-My body, it's frozen.

236
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:03,897
It took a while, but my Shadow
Possession finally worked.

237
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:04,498
-No.

238
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,646
-How the hell did he do that?

239
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,781
-Amazing.

240
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,786
He was thinking three
moves ahead all along.

241
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,690
-As I said, that's
Shikamaru's strength.

242
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:21,792
-Impossible.

243
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,830
How could he have caught
me with his shadow?

244
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:28,803
He couldn't reach this far.

245
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,206
-Look behind you.

246
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,441
I'll let you.

247
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:42,425
-Out of the hole.

248
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,228
How?

249
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,565
-Don't you recognize that hole?

250
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,069
It's where Naruto
popped out of the ground

251
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:52,041
and knocked Neji for a loop.

252
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:56,014
The hole in front of you is
where he went into the ground.

253
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,718
The two are connected.

254
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,221
-Now I see.

255
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,357
I never thought of the
shadows underground.

256
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,729
-That was your mistake.

257
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,966
-Like I said, he's
thinking three moves ahead.

258
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,149
First, he gets her
to retreat behind

259
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,688
the line she thinks is the
limit of his shadow attack.

260
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,327
Then just when she's
starting to feel safe,

261
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:28,566
he surprises her by
extending his range,

262
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,469
forcing her to fall back again.

263
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:31,937
All the time making
her think it's

264
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,377
her idea, when actually
he's maneuvering her

265
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,815
closer and closer to
that hole behind her.

266
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,818
And then, she's caught.

267
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,254
Heh.

268
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,326
That's how you play the game.

269
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,363
-I don't believe this.

270
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,200
The whole time I thought
I was keeping out

271
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,237
of range of his
Shadow Jutsu when

272
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,243
I was a really
walking right into it.

273
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,614
Amazing.

274
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:02,553
This slacker clown
outsmarted me.

275
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,022
-The next move is checkmate.

276
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:14,840
-He's got control of my body.

277
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:15,841
I'm helpless.

278
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,731
-Look at everybody.

279
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,268
A minute ago they were
throwing things at him.

280
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,770
-Well, who would
have ever thought

281
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,873
the guy would turn
out to be a ringer.

282
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,043
-Yeah, he did it.

283
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,412
He pulled off an upset.

284
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,947
-You got her.

285
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:41,916
Way to go.

286
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:45,922
-Checkmate.

287
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,108
-The hell with it.

288
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:19,977
I give up.

289
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,847
-Huh?

290
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,783
-Huh?

291
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,183
-Huh?

292
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:30,126
-He what?

293
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,464
You've gotta be kidding me.

294
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,065
-Loser.

295
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,207
-See, I told you he'd give up.

296
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,347
Looks like I know Shikamaru a
little bit better than you do,

297
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:43,982
huh?

298
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:44,616
-What?

299
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,185
What did you say?

300
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,796
-I used up all my chakra on
that Shadow Possession Jutsu.

301
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:57,970
I'm good for about another
10 seconds and that's it.

302
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:01,576
Bummer, and here I'd already
planned out the next 200 moves

303
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,578
in my head.

304
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,114
But my chakra's running low.

305
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,292
Anyway, if I was
doing this thing,

306
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:15,165
it would just mean more work.

307
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:18,303
This guy is something else.

308
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,040
-The winner is Temari.

309
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,859
[theme song in Japanese]

310
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,335
[crowd cheering]

311
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:04,806
-Whoa, just look at this crowd.

312
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,375
They are hot.

313
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,046
-Well, it's the match everyone's
been waiting for, isn't it?

314
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,216
I'm even a little jazzed myself.

315
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,184
-What?

316
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,186
Did you say
something, Shikamaru?

317
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,788
-I said it's the big match.

318
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:15,957
It's Sasuke.

319
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,392
That's why everyone's
going crazy.

320
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:18,328
-I can't hear you.

321
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,865
The crowd's making
too much noise.

322
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,167
-Forget it.

323
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,598
-Next time, "Dancing
Leaf, Squirming Sand."

324
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:30,598
I can't wait to see this
one, even if I'm not in it.
