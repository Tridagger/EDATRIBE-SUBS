[MUSIC - SNOWKEL, "NAMIKAZE
SATELLITE"]

2
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:54,551
-Ah, I haven't chowed down on
Ichiraku Ramen in like forever.

3
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,885
Thanks to all these missions
I haven't been at home much

4
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:57,685
lately.

5
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,818
-Yeah.

6
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,985
A bowl of ramen after
a mission is the best.

7
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,818
Spreading its noodly goodness
throughout your body,

8
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:04,851
revving you up.

9
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:05,885
-No kidding.

10
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,885
Feed me some ramen
and I'm ready to go.

11
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:08,385
Ramen!

12
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,318
Ramen.

13
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,718
Ramen!

14
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,485
Ramen.

15
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:13,985
Ramen!

16
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:24,018
-Sorry, closed for the day?

17
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,785
-No.

18
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,451
It can't be.

19
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,218
I fought my way through all
of those tough assignments

20
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,518
with nothing but dreams
of Ichiraku Ramen

21
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,151
to get me through the night.

22
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:34,985
-Hey.

23
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:38,451
That smells like ramen.

24
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:41,118
-[sniffs] Yeah, you're right.

25
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,518
-No doubt about it.

26
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,951
There's definitely ramen afoot
somewhere in that restaurant.

27
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:49,351
-Yeah, ramen!

28
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,118
-Mix it, stretch it, boil it.

29
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,785
Burn copper pot, burn.

30
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,218
-Feast your nostrils on that.

31
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:02,685
Whatever soup that
is, it's never

32
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:05,251
been served as part of
the Ichiraku menu before.

33
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,651
-Oh.

34
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:09,485
So then he must have closed up
shop to figure out a new item.

35
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:13,985
-Hey, who's up there?

36
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:18,351
[yelling]

37
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:22,285
-All right, one large miso
pork ramen, and toss in an egg.

38
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,918
-Goodness.

39
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,185
You boys sure went through a
lot of trouble to get my ramen.

40
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,751
Sorry about braining
you like that.

41
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:35,585
-It's cool that you want to add
new stuff to the menu and all,

42
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:38,051
but next time do it after
you close for the night.

43
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:43,651
-Here.

44
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:44,685
Give this is a taste.

45
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:46,318
It's the least I can do.

46
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,818
-All right.

47
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:48,918
Get a load of that!

48
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:52,151
-It's Ichiraku's new
item on the menu.

49
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:53,251
-Here goes nothing.

50
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,551
-Hey, show some respect.

51
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,685
You forgot the cardinal
rule of trying out

52
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,551
a new type of ramen
for the first time.

53
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,318
Step one, try the soup.

54
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,951
Get to know the lay of the land.

55
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,885
[slurping]

56
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,351
-Ah, awesome.

57
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:12,251
-Step two, swim the noodles
in the broth, then taste.

58
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,218
[slurping]

59
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,118
-Mm.

60
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,518
-Hold on.

61
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,785
Tastes like it needs
something more.

62
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,651
-The party's over, guys.

63
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,985
The noodles are
outclassed by the soup.

64
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:27,018
The soup is rich and full
of flavor, well heeled.

65
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,818
With this you've
taken Ichiraku's Ramen

66
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,485
to the next level.

67
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:33,251
However, the noodles
are the same, the usual.

68
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,518
And you know they're never
going to see eye to eye.

69
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,218
I cannot give it
a passing score.

70
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,151
-I figured you would say that.

71
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,185
-Huh?

72
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,051
Whoa, don't look so
down in the dumps.

73
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,485
You'll get it right.

74
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,585
Hey, Ayame, I'm out of water.

75
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,485
Wait a second.

76
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,185
Where the heck's Ayame?

77
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:55,118
-With ramen this back
I'll never win Ayame back

78
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,685
from the ryouri-nin.

79
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:57,751
My poor child.

80
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:01,118
-Teuchi!

81
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:08,718
-Turns out it was
just exhaustion.

82
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,418
I gave him some
supplements, so he'll

83
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,251
be better after he
gets a little rest.

84
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:13,351
[sighing]

85
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,085
-That said, I think
he should take a break

86
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,385
from the shop for a little bit.

87
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,818
-He's been overworking
his arms, that's for sure.

88
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,051
I mean, just look
at the swelling.

89
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:25,918
-Hey, I totally
forgot about this,

90
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,818
but before Teuchi
keeled over, he

91
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,985
was mumbling about Ayame
and the ryouri-nin.

92
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:31,251
Think it means anything?

93
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:34,518
-Well, I think Ayame is
his daughter, isn't she?

94
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,051
But what's a ryouri-nin?

95
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,551
-Who knows?

96
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:38,985
-You guys never heard of them?

97
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:41,651
-Ryouri-nin is the term they
use for the ninja chefs.

98
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:42,218
-Huh?

99
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,951
The ninja chefs?

100
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,851
-What do you know
about them, Choji?

101
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:51,285
-Let's just say I've heard
my share of the rumors.

102
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,018
One of the problems shinobi
run into on missions

103
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:55,351
is that of food.

104
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,185
Because you can't kick any
butt if you're hungry, right?

105
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:00,351
They used to just bring
food pill rations with them,

106
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:01,551
but that got old.

107
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,485
They're big on vitamins,
yeah, but short on flavor.

108
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:06,585
What if, though, what
if they could sit down

109
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:08,885
to delicious meals while
they were out on assignment.

110
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,018
The success rates
would skyrocket.

111
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:13,318
Based on that idea,
a new profession

112
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,085
was born, that purveyor
of culinary ninjutsu,

113
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:18,651
the ninja chef.

114
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,518
-Huh?

115
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:22,785
-OK, so they're ninja
chef guys, but I still

116
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,951
get what they have
to do with Ayame.

117
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:25,951
-They kidnapped her.

118
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,918
That's what they did.

119
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,551
-What?

120
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:29,451
What do you mean?

121
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:30,985
Are you saying they took her?

122
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,818
-Please, tell us what happened?

123
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,218
-Looking back, it all
started two weeks ago.

124
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,018
-Welcome.

125
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:43,951
Take a seat.

126
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,318
-And here's your large ramen.

127
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:54,151
-An excellent job, just
like I always, Teuchi?

128
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:55,185
-Hakkaku.

129
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:58,285
It was Hakkaku, a
figure from my past.

130
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,018
Long ago we apprenticed
under the same ramen master,

131
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,851
but we chose different paths.

132
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,585
I became a ramen shop
owner, he a ninja chef.

133
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,818
-I came here to
ask a favor of you.

134
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:10,118
-Go ahead.

135
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,885
If it's anything within my
power, it's as good as done.

136
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:15,318
-This wondrous phantom
recipe that you're said

137
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,585
to have developed.

138
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:19,251
I must possess it.

139
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,251
-My phantom recipe,
you called it?

140
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,618
I'm sorry, but you lost me.

141
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,318
-Recipes are more important
than life itself to ninja chefs.

142
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:28,785
Your feigning ignorance
is understandable.

143
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,551
But please, give it to me.

144
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,318
I beg of you.

145
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,718
-I didn't have the slightest
clue what he was talking about.

146
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,818
But Hakkaku left my
shop convinced as ever

147
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:41,051
that I was just playing dumb.

148
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:45,218
Ayame, let's get this
place ready for businesses.

149
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:46,551
What the?

150
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:48,118
What's that tray doing there?

151
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,685
Ayame!

152
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,718
HAKKAKU: I've taken the liberty
of kidnapping your daughter.

153
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,351
If you want her back, you'll
hand over the phantom recipe

154
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,151
without delay.

155
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:02,251
-Curse that's crazy Hakkaku.

156
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,818
-But why didn't you
contact the Hokage

157
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,118
as soon as you found out?

158
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,151
I'm sure she could
have helped you.

159
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,785
-Sure, I could have
gone running to her.

160
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:11,785
But what might happen
to Ayame if I did?

161
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:15,751
Besides, in the ransom note he
did give me a second option.

162
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:18,751
If I can whip something up that
really knocks Hakkaku's socks

163
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:21,351
off, he'll give up on this
crazy phantom recipe thing

164
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,385
and return my daughter to me.

165
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,618
-Well, is anything good enough
to impress him that way?

166
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:27,918
-I just don't know.

167
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,151
But a chef's thrown down
the culinary gauntlet.

168
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,518
I have to answer the call.

169
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,851
-Oh.

170
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,618
Now I get why you were monkeying
around with the new ramen.

171
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:37,618
-Yeah.

172
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,218
I got the soup exactly
how I wanted it.

173
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,418
Just perfect.

174
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:43,151
But now I can't seem to
get the noodles just right

175
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,885
no matter how many new
batches of them I crank out.

176
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:48,051
A bowl of that
mediocre ramen isn't

177
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,885
going to win Ayame her freedom.

178
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:52,351
And my cooking challenge
is only a day away.

179
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,651
What on earth am I going to do?

180
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,451
-I can't imagine Ichiraku
without Ayame being there.

181
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,418
It'd just feel empty.

182
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:08,351
That settles it.

183
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,151
We're going to help you
win this challenge, Teuchi.

184
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:12,185
We'll give those guys
the best ramen ever.

185
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,451
-Because that's the way we're
going to get Ayame back.

186
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,051
-Yeah, let's do it.

187
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:20,385
[laughing]

188
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,351
-You guys.

189
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:28,985
Here goes your crash
course in noodle craft.

190
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,385
First you want to make sure
you mix the ingredients well.

191
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,551
If you don't, the noodles won't
all have a consistent flavor.

192
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:37,118
Then you have to knead it.

193
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:38,951
Make sure you show
the dough who's boss,

194
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,851
or else the noodles
won't be firm.

195
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,585
-Are you going to be OK?

196
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:47,785
-Hey, don't worry your
pretty little head about me.

197
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,885
Then you give them
a good pulling.

198
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,351
-Whoa.

199
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,185
-It's important for
you to get the noodles

200
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:57,885
so that they're
all equally thick.

201
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,318
You don't want them looking
different after you boil them.

202
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,185
All right, your turn.

203
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,685
Telling someone how
to do it is easy.

204
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,318
But actually making
noodles, that's

205
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,185
a whole other kettle of fish.

206
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:18,685
It takes five years to
become an accomplished chef.

207
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,718
Them getting the hang of it by
tomorrow, that's crazy talk.

208
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,185
Maybe Hakkaku and
the others will

209
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:27,451
let Ayame go free if I
agree to take her place.

210
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,551
-Hey, Teuchi, you're
not asking yourself

211
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,885
how you're going to get her
back after we lose tomorrow,

212
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,818
are you?

213
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,051
-Of course not.

214
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:36,451
-Glad to hear it.

215
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,418
If we didn't plan on heading out
there and winning this thing,

216
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,751
we wouldn't have offered.

217
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:42,385
-If they think they can kidnap
people whenever they want,

218
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:43,751
they've got another
thing coming.

219
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:46,651
-Experience is cool and
all, but real cooking

220
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,585
know how comes straight
from the heart.

221
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,185
-Yeah, that's the spirit.

222
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,785
We'll show those guys what kind
of awesomeness Leaf Village

223
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,218
shinobi can bring to the table.

224
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,339
-Afternoon, Hakkaku.

225
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:08,306
Sorry that we're late.

226
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,539
-Ready to hand over
the phantom recipe?

227
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,672
-If so I wouldn't have my
whole kitchen on my back.

228
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,306
-Going with plan b?

229
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,006
You are a fool.

230
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,872
Fine.

231
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,506
But that humdrum
ramen you served

232
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,772
me before isn't going
to do the trick.

233
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:26,439
-Where's Ayame?

234
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,472
Is she all right?

235
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:30,039
AYAME: Father, help!

236
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,439
-Ayame!

237
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,606
-Save the family reunion
until after lunch.

238
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,006
-Can you do me a
favor and let me

239
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,039
have a few extra
hands in the kitchen.

240
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,206
-This is high stakes
cooking, old man.

241
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,106
Those kids will be more of
a hindrance than a help.

242
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,939
But if it'll make
you happy, all right.

243
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,639
Begin the cooking challenge.

244
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,772
Can you please the
finicky palates of we

245
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:58,739
who make the meals in the
shadows, the ninja chefs?

246
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:01,406
-There are so many of them.

247
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,072
-This ain't the time
to stand and stare.

248
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,972
Let's begin.

249
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,639
The preparation for
the soup is all done.

250
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,239
I'll knock out the other stuff.

251
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:10,772
But I'm leaving the
noodles up to you.

252
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:12,272
-Yeah!

253
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,672
-Listen you two.

254
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:16,006
The whole question of whether
or not Ayame gets to come home

255
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,272
depends entirely on
how we do with noodles.

256
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:19,739
Failure isn't an option.

257
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,872
-It seems like he did a
bang up job on that soup.

258
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,672
The aroma wafting off of it
certainly smells delicious.

259
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,806
It's wetting my appetite, yes.

260
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,206
Ah, but the noodles,
my young friends.

261
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,039
Can you really make
noodles that will live up

262
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,339
to such a regal broth?

263
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:37,039
-First we got to make sure
we mix up the ingredients.

264
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:37,639
-Amateurs.

265
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,039
I thought so.

266
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:41,539
Get a load of the way they're
man handling that dough.

267
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:42,639
It's criminal.

268
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:45,172
-We practiced making
noodles all night long.

269
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:46,739
-Yeah, but they still
weren't anything

270
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,972
to write home about,
even after all that.

271
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:50,372
-No excuses.

272
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:52,839
We got to make sure these are
the best noodles they've ever

273
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,872
tasted.

274
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:56,206
-Naruto!

275
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:56,906
[laughter]

276
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,139
-Come on, children.

277
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:02,606
At the very lest you should
try to make it edible.

278
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,906
-Got to mix it fast.

279
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:04,972
-Got to do it smoothly.

280
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,239
-And mix it evenly.

281
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:09,106
Now we got to knead the dough.

282
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,739
-Hey, look, Sakura.

283
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:11,306
See?

284
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,106
Kakashi Sensei.

285
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,539
-Don't play with the food.

286
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:20,339
-Way to go, Sakura.

287
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:23,072
[laughter]

288
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,406
-Ow!

289
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,739
You're too strong for
your own good, Sakura.

290
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,172
You got to learn
how to control it.

291
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:31,539
-It's your own fault for messing
around at a time like this.

292
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:37,239
-I wonder if--

293
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,172
-Well, that's it.

294
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:42,772
The last of the ingredients.

295
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,006
-No worries. because this
time I know the three of us

296
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,572
are going to get the job done.

297
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:50,039
-Leave the mixing to me.

298
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:51,272
NARUTO: Wait up, Choji.

299
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,172
Mind if I jump in
and give it a whirl?

300
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,472
-Go for it, man.

301
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,639
-Hey, Sakura, tell me.

302
00:13:56,672 --> 00:14:00,172
Last time I checked, the three
of us were shinobi, right?

303
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,806
In that case, I'm thinking
we should show them

304
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,239
how to do those
noodles ninja style.

305
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,739
Step one, shadow clone jutsu.

306
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,639
Rasengan Ichiraku style.

307
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,106
-Ah, what the?

308
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,806
He's using chakra to mix
the ingredients together?

309
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,006
Of course, he's using the
raw power of the chakra

310
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,439
to fold the ingredients together
into a sublimely uniform dough.

311
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,706
It'll be mixed down
to the cellular level.

312
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,039
-Sakura.

313
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:48,839
-What's up?

314
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,839
-It's Pervy Sage.

315
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:51,839
-Naruto!

316
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,339
What did I tell you?

317
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:01,806
-What?

318
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,572
She's pounding it
with so much fury,

319
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,006
now those noodles
are going to have

320
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,739
the most perfect
firmness I've ever seen.

321
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:12,739
-Thanks, Sakura.

322
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:13,839
Choji.

323
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,872
-I also am a shinobi
from the Leaf Village.

324
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:19,106
Partial expansion jutsu!

325
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:19,972
Both hands.

326
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,672
I'm going long on this one.

327
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:22,672
Oh, yeah!

328
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:32,406
--[cries out] Truly a
peerless batch of noodles.

329
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,639
And if those should find
their way into Teuchi's soup,

330
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:36,539
this match is over.

331
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:40,839
No.

332
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,772
We cannot lose today.

333
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:46,539
The very future of the ninja
chefs hangs in the balance.

334
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,739
-OK, now they just
have to be boiled.

335
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:49,572
Go for it.

336
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,572
-All right, you leave it to me.

337
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:52,939
-I wouldn't do that.

338
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:53,706
-What?

339
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:55,572
-Huh?

340
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:58,306
-The ramen may be
exquisite, true enough,

341
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:01,106
but who are you
going to serve first?

342
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,739
-Who gets it first?

343
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:03,772
-He's right.

344
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,406
That's the ninja chef way.

345
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,206
-What's the ninja chef way?

346
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,372
-Among the ninja
chefs, there was

347
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,806
one rule esteemed
above all others.

348
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,439
-The first guest
to arrive is also

349
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,939
the first guest to whom
you serve any food.

350
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,439
-No matter how delicious
that ramen of yours may be,

351
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:21,006
if you flout this honored
tradition you're disqualified.

352
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:25,872
-Seriously though, I
can understand that.

353
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,139
If some guy comes late
and gets to eat before me,

354
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,272
I raise a stink.

355
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:32,106
-There are 100 ninja
chefs assembled here today

356
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,806
and they all arrived within
moments of each other.

357
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,406
That means you
have to find a way

358
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,672
to serve ramen to 100
people at the same time.

359
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,706
You're only four people.

360
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:45,506
How can you even hope to
serve us all simultaneously?

361
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,806
-I did mention before that
we're ninja, didn't I?

362
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,106
Shadow clone Justu!

363
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,972
-What is this?

364
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:05,972
-All right, hoist them up.

365
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:15,872
-Thanks for waiting, you guys.

366
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,706
Dig in.

367
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,872
-The taste is the issue.

368
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,339
If the ramen still fails to
impress us, you still lose.

370
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,672

371

-So good.

372
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:44,306
-I have never encountered
ramen this good.

373
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,739
-So that means?

374
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:48,106
-We win the challenge and
Ayame gets to come home.

375
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:48,972
-All right!

376
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,839
-The truth of it is, we ninja
chefs now find ourselves

377
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,806
in a serious pickle.

378
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,106
-A serious pickle?

379
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,506
-What the heck are
you talking about?

380
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,372
-Creating delicious
meals that ninja

381
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,906
could enjoy doing
their missions.

382
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:06,206
That's all we've ever
wanted to achieve.

383
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,572
Why settle for bland
fare, we thought,

384
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:11,739
when it could be healthy and
portable and tasty as well.

385
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:15,006
But we pursued taste too far.

386
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,639
We flew too high.

387
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:18,806
Oh, it was delicious all right.

388
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,106
Mission accomplished.

389
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,506
But they packed it in.

390
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,139
The ninja grew portly,
chunky even to the point

391
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,906
where they couldn't
complete their assignments.

392
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:35,006
Now people say, great,
our shinobi are fat.

393
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,339
Perhaps we don't need
the ninja chefs anymore.

394
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,206
If we ninja chefs were to
have any hope of enduring,

395
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,772
we had to venture into the
greater world of cooking,

396
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,439
find the phantom recipe
and make it ours.

397
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,372
-Then what?

398
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,906
-If we make the
meal in question,

399
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,506
we can improve a
ninja's performance

400
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,006
as we did before, but
without weighing them down.

401
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,972
-But what kind of
recipe would do that?

402
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:56,839
-The scum recipe.

403
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,206
We heard its legendary.

404
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,772
-The scum recipe?

405
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,106
-We sent out our informants
to canvas the land

406
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,472
in search of it.

407
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,639
We heard that it was to be found
at Ichiraku Ramen Shop, run

408
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,372
by my old associate Teuchi.

409
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,139
-What?

410
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,406
-Uh, don't look at me.

411
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,706
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

412
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,172
-Our contact heard
you mention it.

413
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:21,139
--[laughs] The fools must
never know I have the recipe.

414
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,139
-Uh, hey, Teuchi?

415
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,739
-Oh, that one.

416
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:25,539
-What?

417
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,806
-Are you serious?

418
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,106
-You do have it.

419
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,972
-Yeah, but you're
wrong about the name.

420
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,039
Is called the skim recipe.

[bird cawing]

422
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,106
-The skim recipe?

423
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,139
-The trick do any
good soup or stew

424
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,772
is to skim off the
layer of gunk that

425
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,739
accumulates on
top of the liquid.

426
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:45,006
I experimented for awhile,
really perfecting my skimming

427
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,206
method and made a whole
recipe that centers around it.

428
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,172
Guess I called it the
scum recipe once thinking

429
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,106
about that layer on top.

430
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:55,439
Yep, just your garden
variety slip of the tongue.

431
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,772
-It's a significant
slip of the tongue.

432
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:02,972
-Yeah if it had slipped any
worse it would have fallen out.

433
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:05,006
-Hey, don't forget that
we won the cooking match,

434
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,506
so you have to give
Ayame back to her father.

435

-Oh, that's right.

Well come on.

Where is she?

438

00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:13,239
-Ayame?

440
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:22,506
Ayame?

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:23,672

-What happened?

444
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,072
Ayame always used to look so--

445
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,339
-These ninja chefs
weren't bragging

00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:35,639

up some delicious meals.

that much weight?

-Huh.

So it's that one ramen we
made to get Ayame back?

-Yeah, right.
