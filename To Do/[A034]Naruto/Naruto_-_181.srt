1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,324
[theme music]

2
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,967
-Why did you hit Naruto, too?

3
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,323
[roar]

4
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,153
-It was an accident.

5
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,358
I had to strike when
I had the chance.

6
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,264
Sadly, your friend
got in the way.

7
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,767
A tragic loss.

8
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,342
I've never seen anyone defeat
the Ninja Art Kujaku before.

9
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,081
He will be missed.

10
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,686
You have our thanks,
Leaf Village shinobi.

11
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,925
Your mission here is over now.

12
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,063
-But we haven't
covered the star.

13
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:56,067
-We'll handle that ourselves.

14
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,437
Farewell, my friend.

15
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,396
-Rest easy now.

16
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,130
I'm a friend.

17
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,186
-Now that I think of it, after
I got blown off that cliff,

18
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,255
what happened?

19
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,793
Somebody-- Somebody
must have saved my life.

20
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:10,428
Was it you?

21
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:11,030
-Yes.

22
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:26,330
-Hm.

23
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,802
It's all kind of a
big blank, actually.

24
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,908
But I'm still
alive, so thank you.

25
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,011
My name's Naruto.

26
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,049
I'm a ninja from the
Hidden Leaf village

27
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:38,790
who's here to-- uh,
well, I'm actually

28
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,130
supposed to be
protecting the star

29
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:45,338
from thieves like
you, no offense.

30
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,476
[laughing]

31
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,213
-Hm?

32
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,150
[laughing]

33
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,254
-My name is Natsuhi.

34
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:53,956
-Nasuhi?

35
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,026
Wait a minute.

36
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,598
Haven't I heard that
name somewhere before?

37
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,435
Ah!

38
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,272
Take a look at that red one.

39
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,943
Pretty, isn't it?

40
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:04,345
-Natsuhiboshi.

41
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,054
Never alone, the star
on high watches over me.

42
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,123
-Yeah, Natsuhiboshi.

43
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:11,228
That's what Sumaru called it.

44
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,232
He said it was the
name of the star that

45
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,071
watched over him
and protects him!

46
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:16,839
-Really?

47
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,911
Sumaru told you that?

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,980
-Yeah.

49
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,349
Hey lady, do know
him, something?

50
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,530
-He is my son.

51
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:28,265
-Huh?

52
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,035
Get outta here!

53
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,275
You're telling me
you're Sumaru's mother?

54
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,143
AKAHOSHI: What?

55
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:35,613
Sumaru is gone?

56
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,462
-Forgive me, my lord.

57
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:43,965
I was certain the
sedatives would

58
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:45,402
keep him unconscious for hours.

59
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:46,504
I don't know what happened.

60
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:50,913
-The Leaf ninja.

61
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,285
I have no doubt they
had a hand in this.

62
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,554
-So what now?

63
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,325
They'll find out
what we're doing,

64
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,296
and then, how long
do you think it'll

65
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,967
be before the whole
village knows?

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,338
-We'll just have to find
them and get Sumaru back

67
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:04,041
before it's too late.

68
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,347
-Stop panicking, you two.

69
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,017
Once we have the
star back, we'll

70
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,924
have no trouble silencing
them permanently.

71
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:12,126
-I guess you're right.

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,130
We'll tell the people of
the Hidden Leaf Village

73
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,970
they died while fulfilling
their mission for us.

74
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:20,010
-And if we can convince
Sumaru as well--

75
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:22,182
-I've burned Natsuhi's
chakra in my memory.

76
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,419
Following the remnant
trail of her chakra

77
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,056
will lead us
straight to the star.

78
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,637
-What?

79
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,943
Naruto went off the cliff?

80
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,045
-Yes.

81
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,018
Along with the kunoichi
who stole the star.

82
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:41,356
The only good news is I
didn't see them anywhere

83
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:42,626
in the Valley of Death.

84
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,630
-So you think they might
have escaped the poison

85
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,436
gas in the valley somehow?

86
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,505
-There is a chance.

87
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,343
-Well if that's
the case, it could

88
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,082
be they got out of the valley
safely, and into the forest.

89
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,518
What are we waiting for?

90
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,091
We've got to find them!

91
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:57,959
-Uh--

92
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,328
-Hey, what's wrong?

93
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,365
Come on!

94
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,102
Naruto was helping
us and our village.

95
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,638
Have you forgotten?

96
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:07,647
-No, but we should wait for
orders from Lord Akahoshi.

97
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:08,448
Right?

98
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:10,052
-Yeah.

99
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:12,591
-We don't have time to
be waiting for orders.

100
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,098
I'm going out there now.

101
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,671
-I want to go with you.

102
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:23,982
If it's to help find
Naruto, I have to go.

103
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,054
-Mizura, you can't.

104
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,325
-There has to be some
way I can be of use.

105
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,033
SUMARU: No.

106
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,632
I'll go.

107
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,152
-Sumaru!

108
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,157
-Then you're OK?

109
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:45,261
-We found him in your
Hoshikage's residence,

110
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,433
in a hospital bed,
heavily sedated.

111
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,335
-Huh?

112
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,139
The Hoshikage's residence?

113
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,709
But why?

114
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:55,317
-The shinobi who knocked all of
you out and took Sumaru away,

115
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,689
he wasn't a stranger
from some other village.

116
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:13,757
-No, indeed.

117
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,726
It was not.

118
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,465
In fact, it was your
leader Akahoshi.

119
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,703
Meaning that the
shinobi who attacked you

120
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:24,447
and the one who stole the
star are two different people.

121
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:30,259
-Brilliant, Lee, except
that Neji already said that.

122
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,763
-Why would Lord Akahoshi--

123
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:34,469
-But why would he do that to us?

124
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,072
What does it all mean, Sumaru?

125
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,542
-I only wish I knew, Hokuto.

126
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:40,515
But I'm beginning to suspect
that Lord Akahoshi may

127
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,519
be hiding something from us.

128
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,256
-When will you all
finally realize

129
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,098
that this man,
Akahoshi, is using you?

130
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,448
Mizura won't be the only one.

131
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:59,122
If you keep on with this
training, you'll all be sick.

132
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,491
Or worse.

133
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:01,628
-No way.

134
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,165
-No, it's a lie, no.

135
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:04,333
-You're wrong.

136
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,404
Lord Akahoshi would never
do something like that.

137
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:12,384
-Maybe the other shinobi,
the one who stole the star,

138
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,121
can explain what's going on.

139
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:18,865
-Then our next step is to find
that shinobi no matter what.

140
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,170
-The forest in the
Land of Bears is deep.

141
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,539
You're never going
to find your way

142
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,711
through those woods on your own.

143
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,148
-Very well.

144
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,120
Then show us the way.

145
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,122
-Mizura.

146
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:30,857
-No, it's all right.

147
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:32,561
I'll do it.

148
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:33,663
-But--

149
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,868
-You have to rest and
get your strength back.

150
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,272
Don't worry.

151
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:39,209
The time will come soon
enough when we need your help.

152
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,220
-Hm.

153
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:16,857
-Well then, any luck?

154
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,795
-Were you able to get
a fix on the remnants

155
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:19,864
of Natsuhi's chakra?

156
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:38,805
-Mm!

157
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,874
Delicious!

158
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,546
There's nothing like
a mom's home cooking,

159
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,219
even when it's in a cave.

160
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,657
-There's a little
more, if you want any.

161
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:48,526
-Heh, heh.

162
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,418
Sure!

163
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,982
OK then, there's still
something I don't understand.

164
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,555
Why did you swipe the star?

165
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:05,296
-As a matter of fact, this isn't
the first time I've taken it.

166
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,835
The first was 10 years ago.

167
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,238
-What?

168
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,278
-Even then, it was clear
star training was dangerous.

169
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,748
Our young shinobi
we were falling ill.

170
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,349
Or worse.

171
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,429
My husband Hotarubi and I
were among the lucky ones

172
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,965
who had survived the training.

173
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,876
We decided we would
steal the star

174
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,618
and take it far away, so that
it could no longer claim anymore

175
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,689
of our brothers and
sisters as victims.

176
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,022
An elite unit of tracking
shinobi was quickly dispatched,

177
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,661
and it wasn't long before
they caught up with us.

178
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:08,515
-Stop.

179
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,056
-It's the Third.

180
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,860
Lord Hoshikage.

181
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,898
-Natsuhi and
Hotarubi, your actions

182
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:25,770
have been rash, although
not without reason.

183
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,510
I have shared the same
doubts and concerns.

184
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,652
But, as village leader, I've had
to weigh my decision carefully.

185
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,590
Now, that is over.

186
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,961
I will terminate
the star training,

187
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,766
but there will be
some who disagree

188
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,607
and they may try to reinstate
it at some point in the future.

189
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:45,513
And so I must ask you
both to leave the village

190
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,618
and disappear, perhaps forever.

191
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,389
But keep watch.

192
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,931
And if you ever see that the
star training has been resumed,

193
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,638
you must return and
put a stop to it.

194
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:57,372
-Lord Hoshikage.

195
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,962
-For Sumaru.

196
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,830
-When our son asks
of us, please,

197
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,605
my lord-- Please
tell him we died.

198
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:28,607
-Yes.

199
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,578
I understand.

200
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,585
NATSUHI: No one could ever know
the truth about our leaving.

201
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,455
Shortly thereafter,
the Hoshikage

202
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,629
discontinued the star training.

203
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:42,437
He saw, as we did, the dangers,
that the potential benefits

204
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,942
to our village weren't
worth the damage being

205
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,546
done to our people.

206
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,617
-Neji said the same thing.

207
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,490
Does this training really
do that much damage?

208
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:52,759
-Yes.

209
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,931
It wasn't long after
we left the village

210
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,205
that my husband, Hotarubi,
died from its effects.

211
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,746
The same thing could very
well happen to me at any time.

212
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,652
There's no way of knowing.

213
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:05,620
-That's awful.

214
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,701
We've gotta get
back to the village

215
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:15,542
and tell Akahoshi that this
crazy training has got to stop!

216
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,914
-Akahoshi's dream of
making the village strong

217
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:20,987
is more important to him than
the safety of its people.

218
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,259
To show you how little
he cares about them,

219
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:26,132
he took Sumaru hostage in
order to trade his life to me

220
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,101
for the star.

221
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,537
-Huh?

222
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,709
You mean that shinobi with
the mask and the poison gas

223
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:36,053
was-- Don't even think about it!

224
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,055
-Farewell.

225
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,024
-What is he doing?

226
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:38,626
Huh?

227
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,973
So that guy was Akahoshi, huh?

228
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,199
What? What is it?

229
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,538
Is-- is there anything wrong?

230
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:00,640
-Akahoshi.

231
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,544
He's here with his henchmen.

232
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,811
-So this is it?

233
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,916
-Are you able to sense
where she's hidden the star?

234
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,816
NATSUHI (VOICEOVER):
Hotarubi, protect the star.

235
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,785
Protect Sumaru.

236
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,896
-The star is right there.

237
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:01,038
But the entrance a
sealed by that boulder.

238
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:05,882
-Uh-- so what are we supposed
to do to get rid of that?

239
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,320
-We could try using paper
bombs and blow it up little

240
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,993
by little.

241
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:12,931
NARUTO: Don't you
even think about it!

242
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,753
-What the--

243
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:27,061
-I thought we lost this
brat in the Valley of Death.

244
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:28,097
-Ha!

245
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,399
Takes more than that
to get rid of me.

246
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,936
Or should I say us?

247
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:31,638
-Ha.

248
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,340
Get back, you two.

249
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:35,012
Leave him to me.

250
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:39,155
Now then, I'll just have
to finish what I began.

251
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,392
Ninja Art, Kujaku.

252
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:44,973
Beast!

253
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,911
-Here we go!

254
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:23,216
-Huh?

255
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,820
-I gotcha!

256
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:29,687
Huh?

257
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,477
-I was ready for
that little trick.

258
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,349
It's the last time you'll
get a chance to try it.

259
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,146
What the heck?

260
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,393
So, Natsuhi.

261
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,166
You're still alive
as well, I see.

262
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:04,873
-Akahoshi, I ask you one
more time to reconsider.

263
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:06,978
Stop the star training
once and for all

264
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,916
and let the young
people go, and I

265
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,488
will leave you and the
village in peace forever.

266
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,323
-Ha.

267
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:15,196
Thank you, but no.

268
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,801
You're just as blind as that
stubborn old man, the Third

269
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:18,803
Hoshikage.

270
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:20,942
He wouldn't listen
to reason either.

271
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,481
He refused to understand
that the star training was

272
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,053
essential to keep our village
strong and prosperous.

273
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:31,331
-No.

274
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,868
Never.

275
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,505
It's too dangerous.

276
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,409
As long as I'm
Hoshikage, that training

277
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:39,482
will never be used again.

278
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:41,219
This matter is finished.

279
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:41,888
Leave me now.

280
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:03,334
This is madness, Akahoshi.

281
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:04,938
You've lost your mind.

282
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:08,312
-It's you who have lost
your mind, you old fool.

283
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:11,117
Now go and sleep
with your ancestors.

284
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,456
Your journey is at an end.

285
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,897
Leave it to the next generation
to give this village the power

286
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,201
to rival the Five
Great Hidden Villages

287
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,141
[maniacal laughter]

288
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:31,495
-Are you sure this
was necessary?

289
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,403
-It-- It had to be done for
the sake of the village, right?

290
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:36,940
-Had to be done, yes.

291
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,112
Now we'll resume
the star training,

292
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,349
and it will lead us to glory.

293
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:48,031
[laughter]

294
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,301
-You monster.

295
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,438
You've got this whole
village believing in you,

296
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:53,309
and you don't care
if they live or die!

297
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,480
Mizura's in the
hospital because of you.

298
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,084
He may not survive!

299
00:19:57,117 --> 00:20:01,059
-Greatness cannot be achieved
without some sacrifice.

300
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,329
It's for the village.

301
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:06,203
A true shinobi understands that.

302
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,005
-For the village?

303
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:07,715
No, it isn't.

304
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:08,442
It's for you!

305
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,880
For you and some
crazy dream of glory

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,317
you've got inside your head!

307
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:13,653
-It's not your fight.

308
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:14,923
Stay out of it.

309
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,194
This is our village's affair.

310
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,297
-But I--

311
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,299
-Just stay back!

312
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,220
-Yataka.

313
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,874
Shizo.

314
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:45,489
-Huh?

315
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:48,328
Man, his chakra just
swallowed up both of theirs!

316
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:53,673
-Ha ha ha!

317
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:56,613
My chakra beast has
had a good meal.

318
00:20:56,647 --> 00:21:00,021
Things will go
differently this time.

319
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,125
-Not if I can help it.

320
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,562
-Be careful, Natsuhi.

00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:04,705
NARUTO: Neji, is Sumaru's
mom going to be OK?

323
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:06,008
NEJI: She's stable
at the moment,

324
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,912
but her prognosis is doubtful.

325
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:08,881
LEE: What?

326
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,184
NEJI: Even before
the battle, she

327
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,890
was starting to weaken from the
effects of the star training.

328
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:15,095
TENTEN: Her chakra
network's badly damaged.

329
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,767
NARUTO: But-- but grandma
Tsunade could heal her, right?

330
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,936
NEJI: I'm not sure.

331
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,077
In any case, if she tries
that Kujaku jutsu again,

332
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,981
I doubt she'll survive.

333
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:26,789

The Remaining Time.
