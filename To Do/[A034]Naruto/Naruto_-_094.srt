00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:11,266
[theme music]

2
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:52,556
-Ah?

3
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,156
-Your jutsu's worn off.

4
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,223
Now I am at 100%.

5
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:07,456
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Blood.

6
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:15,123
-Lady Tsunade!

7
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:16,456
-I don't get it.

8
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,856
What's going on?

9
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,689
I'm confused.

10
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,223
Did I miss out on something?

11
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:24,489
How come Kabuto and Grandma
Tsunade are mixing it up?

12
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:27,623
-If you want your answer,
just look at his headband.

13
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:28,889
He serves Orochimaru.

14
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:34,889
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Attack!

15
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:36,089
Fury of the Rasengan!

16
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:52,089
-So that's Orochimaru.

17
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:53,723
-You take four-eyes.

18
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,789
Kay, Shizune?

19
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,789
I can handle our
friend, Orochimaru.

20
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,489
There's just one thing.

21
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,956
I need Tsunade to do
something about my body

22
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,756
before we get started here.

23
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,156
-It may be a while before
the full effects of that drug

24
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,589
completely leave your system.

25
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,556
I'm very sorry, but it can't
be helped, Master Jiraiya.

26
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:14,256
-What?

27
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,556
You gotta be kidding!

28
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:16,423
Oh, well.

29
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,423
What can you do, right?

30
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,889
I'll just have to
face him as I am.

31
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:25,923
Tsunade, use your recovery
ninjitsu and rest.

32
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:26,823
-What about me?

33
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:27,856
What should I do?

34
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,256
-Don't do anything.

35
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,256
You just stand guard over
Tsunade with the pig, OK?

36
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,189
-Oink.

37
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,223
-Come on, I want
to fight this guy.

38
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,023
He's gotta pay for what he did.

39
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,389
-Forget about it!

40
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,489
That jerk with the
glasses is right.

41
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,889
You're in over your head.

42
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,789
Our opponent's
one of the Sannin,

43
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:48,723
like me, and the man who
killed the Third Hokage.

44
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,923
This is an eye for an eye.

45
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,089
I'm the only one who
can fight Orochimaru.

46
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:57,689
And four-eyes over there could
go toe to toe with Kakashi

47
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:00,089
if he had to.

48
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,523
-Don't worry.

49
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:02,756
Not a problem.

50
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,389
Shadow Clone--

51
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:04,889
-Hold on, Naruto.

52
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,956
Your clones won't work here.

53
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:07,889
You needn't bother.

54
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,589
There isn't any point.

55
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:10,823
-What?

56
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:14,056
-It wouldn't even
be a diversion.

57
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,323
You'd be wasting your chakra.

58
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,689
They're a dangerous pair.

59
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,256
Now, then, how about we
get this thing started?

60
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:38,789
-Summoning Jutsu!

61
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:39,623
-Summoning Jutsu!

62
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,323
-What's up?

63
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,289
-What the-- why are you here?

64
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,223
Where the hell's your father?

65
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:03,889
-Hey, hey!

66
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,856
Long time no see.

67
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,356
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Master Jiraiya

68
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,089
can't build up enough
chakra because of the drug.

69
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,223
[laughter]

70
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:16,023
-Well, Jiraiya, still
playing the fool, I see.

71
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,423
You always were ridiculous.

72
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:21,589
But this time you've
outdone yourself.

73
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:25,189
Clearly our Tsunade has
gotten to you somehow.

74
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:28,856
-Your jutsu did
require a sacrifice.

75
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,289
Perhaps she was thinking ahead.

76
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,823
Drugging him somehow
to suppress his power.

77
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:38,023
-To think she would make
a sacrifice of Jiraiya.

78
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:42,056
Well, just as ruthless as
ever, aren't you, Tsunade?

79
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,089
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Well,
how do you like that?

80
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:46,989
He's already
spotted my weakness.

81
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:49,289
[laughter]

82
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,656
-You're as big a disgrace
as the day we met.

83
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,089
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That's it!

84
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:59,556
I'm not going to let that guy
sand there and mock Pervy Sage!

85
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:00,556
Summoning Jutsu!

86
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,456
OROCHIMARU: That's the
Nine-Tails brat from the Chunin

87
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:07,989
exam.

88
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:11,856
I suppose I should have killed
him when I had the opportunity.

89
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,289
For the sake of the
Akatsuki and their goals,

90
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,689
I let the boy slip by.

91
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:21,523
But the only ones ever capable
of breaking a five pronged seal

92
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:24,989
were the Third Hokage and
we of the legendary Sannin.

93
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,756
-That may be, but Jiraiya
is training the boy.

94
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,523
-You could be right.

95
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:34,123
If he's learned to wield
the power of the Nine-Tails,

96
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,423
it's not impossible.

97
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,156
-Wait a minute.

98
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:40,656
It's--

99
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:49,856
-But that doesn't
appear to be the case.

100
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,156
-He never had any skill as
a shinobi to begin with.

101
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,156
-What happened?

102
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,023
[sigh]

103
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:02,589
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): He's
still got a long way to go.

104
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,989
-Where the heck did I go wrong?

105
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,556
-Hi, everybody.

106
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:07,523
Hey, friend.

107
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:08,356
How are ya?

108
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,023
-Hey, Gamatatsu.

109
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,089
Why did you pop out?

110
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:17,456
Where's the old man?

111
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,956
-Ah.

112
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,156
Gamakichi, what's going on?

113
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,423
This is the first time
anyone's ever summoned me.

114
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,756
I'm finally getting
a chance to shine.

115
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,089
-You dummy.

116
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,056
Get some munchies and go find
a place to hide, will ya?

117
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,023
GAMATATSU: Wait,
they got snacks here?

118
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:36,223
Gee whiz, this is the coolest.

119
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:36,856
-Let's begin.

120
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,189
I want you to leave
Jiraiya to me.

121
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,789
The rest are yours to
play with as you will.

122
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:47,089
-Now, that is a shame.

123
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:49,356
I'd been hoping
to test my mettle

124
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,656
against one of the Sannin!

125
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:18,156
-Naruto!

126
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,123
OROCHIMARU: You're dealing
with me, old friend!

127
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,456
-No problem.

128
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,923
Earth Style, Dark Swamp!

129
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,423
Great.

130
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,489
This bog is way too small.

131
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:42,889
It's not deep
enough to sink 'em.

132
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,756
(VOICEOVER) The drug
hasn't run its course yet.

133
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,523
It's not a total loss, though.

134
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:49,589
These snakes aren't going
anywhere in this state.

135
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:03,789
-Ninja Art, Poison Fog!

136
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:06,289
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): One breath
of this, and I'm a dead man.

137
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,189
-My leg tendons--

138
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:30,123
-I am not lettin' you
eat me a second time!

139
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,289
-Get ready.

140
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,589
-Ninja Art, Needle Jizo!

141
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:05,089
Blast-- the jutsu
isn't strong enough.

142
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,023
-Even if we are
both impaired, you

143
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,456
haven't a chance of beating me.

144
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,289
You might as well
give up already.

145
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,289
-What a tragedy.

146
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,589
I had only the utmost
respect for you

147
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,789
as a fellow medical ninja.

148
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:55,456
-Stay back!

149
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,623
Get away from me!

150
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,656
-Please, get a hold of
yourself, Lady Tsunade.

151
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,723
Else the name of
Sannin, of which

152
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:06,289
Lord Orochimaru is
counted, weep for shame.

153
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:11,189
[screaming]

154
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:12,523
-Can't move.

155
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:15,456
My body's too heavy.

156
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:16,523
-Look at you.

157
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:19,223
They used to call
you the town mad man.

158
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:22,556
And now you're plodding along
dutifully for the village,

159
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,256
with this brat in tow.

160
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,589
You've really fallen
off, haven't you?

161
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:32,389
Trust me, I've always
had a good eye for talen.

162
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:37,523
With that one, all I see
is insipid mediocrity.

163
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:43,089
-You hit the nail on my head.

164
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:46,056
What would I want
with the Uchiha kid?

165
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,756
Tell me, where's the fun
in teaching a boy who's

166
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:52,856
already a genius to begin with?

167
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,256
-How touching.

168
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,456
You're drawn to him because he
reminds you of your old self.

169
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,956
Is that it?

170
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,356
That brat of yours
could never beat

171
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,256
Uchiha, born as he was into
the shinobi art of Sharingan.

172
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,089
Without Sharingan,
poor Naruto hasn't

173
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,423
a chance of srpassing him.

174
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,056
A shinobi's strength
rests upon his ability

175
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,223
to obtain and master all
the jutsu of this world.

176
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:20,156
The very reason we
are called ninja

177
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,589
is because of the many
ninjutsu arts that we wield.

178
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,523
-Hmph.

179
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:27,923
You're wrong.

180
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,489
That's not what makes a shinobi.

181
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:34,123
You never did get it.

182
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:37,523
A real ninja is one
who endorse, no matter

183
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,189
what gets thrown at him.

184
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:44,256
-A difference of
opinion, I suppose.

185
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,389
-Let me explain
something to you.

186
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:51,856
There's only one thing that
matters if you're a shinobi,

187
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,556
and it isn't the number
of jutsu you possess.

188
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:03,289
All you do need is the
guts to never give up.

189
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,905
-Back off!

190
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,605
That's enough,
already, you traitor!

191
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:29,205
[shout]

192
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,671
-The guts to never give up.

193
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,971
And the kid has
got that in spades.

194
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,171
-Ah!

195
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,838
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): I don't
know what jutsu you learned,

196
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,705
but you'll need to be
more subtle than that

197
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:10,071
if you want to hit me.

198
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:11,505
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): It's no use.

199
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,738
I'm not gonna be able
to hit a moving target.

200
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:21,038
Darn it.

201
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:25,471
And I still can't hold
in all the chakra yet.

202
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:28,571
-It looks like you fractioned
the thigh bone in your left leg

203
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:32,105
during your little
tussle with the serpent.

204
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,105
If it were only the bone,
you could still move.

205
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,238
But it's beyond that now.

206
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:40,305
I've severed the lateral vastus
muscle in your right leg,

207
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,105
as well.

208
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,471
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What do I do?

209
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,805
This jutsu takes two hands.

210
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,371
If he gets even one
of my arms, it's over!

211
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,371
-What's the matter?

212
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,071
Are you frightened?

213
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,138
Hope you don't feel
like running away.

214
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:07,505
Naruto, as I remember, you
were nothing but big talk

215
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,771
during that first Chunin exam.

216
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:11,971
-Don't underestimate me!

217
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:16,405
I don't quit, and I don't run!

218
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,505
-Don't underestimate me.

219
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,305
I don't run away.

220
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:24,138
I don't care if I'm a
Genin the rest of my life.

221
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,638
You guys aren't going
to scare me off.

222
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:29,838
I'll still be Hokage someday.

223
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:34,938
So, where's all
your big talk now?

224
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:38,205
-It's because I'm like
you, that's my goal.

225
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,005
Just watch.

226
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,338
Someday I'll be Hokage.

227
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,738
To be Hokage.

228
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,771
That's my dream.

229
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,038
-You're not a kid anymore.

230
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:55,271
You don't want to shoot
your mouth off like that.

231
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,405
Admit when you're
in over your head.

232
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,371
Sometimes it's
better to run away.

233
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:06,338
Come, now.

234
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,471
What's the matter?

235
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,105
Why such a look?

236
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:12,505
If I kill you, you can
kiss your dreams goodbye.

237
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,538
-You're always so reckless.

238
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,038
You want to kill yourself?

239
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:20,905
You're still a Genin, so if
there's ever a real battle,

240
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,638
you get out of there, fast.

241
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,571
-Are you crazy?

242
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,071
I'm never gonna run away!

243
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:55,271
KABUTO: Little kids
think life is so easy.

244
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,171
That's why they're always going
on and on about their dreams.

245
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,271
That's why they never give up.

246
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,405
-Jiraiya.

247
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:14,438
What were you thinking?

248
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:16,938
You went and taught
this kid the Rasengan?

249
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,905
What's the point of
teaching it to someone

250
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,438
who can never master it?

251
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,671
Giving him false
hopes like that.

252
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,071
Filling his head
with stupid ideas.

253
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:29,805
Making him think he can
actually be Hokage someday.

254
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,771
[thudding]

255
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:40,471
-They go chasing after some
stupid dream, and they die.

256
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:45,771
-Give me just three days, and
I'll have that jutsu down flat!

257
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,671
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Care to make a bet on it?

258
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:04,005
-That's eno I'm
not gonna run away.

259
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,671
I never go back on my word!

260
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,238
That's my nindo.

261
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:11,371
My ninja way!

262
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,505
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A bet?

263
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,471
TSUANDE (VOICEOVER):
I'll give you one week.

264
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,605
If you can master that jutsu
by then, I'll admit I'm wrong,

265
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,971
and that you're worthy
of becoming Hokage.

266
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,238
I'll even throw in my necklace.

267
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,005
-You should have stayed
out of this, Naruto.

268
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:53,205
Why do you-- What are you doing?

269
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:09,905
-All right, Grandma.

270
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,571
-Still haven't had enough?

271
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:23,138
-Get ready to pay up on our bet.

272
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:25,305
That cursed necklace of
yours is about to be mine.

273
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,638
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

274
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,471
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Shadow
clones can't help him here.

275
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,505
Enough!

276
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:40,138
Naruto, you don't
have to protect me!

277
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,171
Stop, already!

278
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,471
-I warned you not
to be stubborn.

279
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:46,905
Now you die!

280
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,838
You've just thrown it all away!

281
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,771
Dreams don't come
true when you're dead!

282
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,671
-Just get out of
the way, Naruto!

283
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:53,171
No!

284
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:53,671
Look out!

285
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,438
-Don't you worry about me.

286
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,705
Until I become Hokage, I
don't care what happens.

287
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:20,971
I am not going to die!

288
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,271
OK.

289
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,338
Let's see you
dodge me this time.

290
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:37,271
Here goes!

291
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:47,105
-He's channeling chakra
again, like before.

292
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:47,971
No!

293
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,405
This is different!

294
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,505
-Now I see.

295
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:56,371
He made the clone to
gather up his chakra.

296
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:59,305
Ingenious.

297
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,271
-Compress the chakra.

298
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,271
Keep it going.

299
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,205
-That's impossible!

300
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,171
-Rasengan!

301
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,638

forgotten the sacrifices made

304
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,116
to protect the
Hidden Leaf Village,

305
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,083
and keep its people safe.

306
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:10,983
Each and every Hokage
laid down his life

307
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,616
in service of this dream.

308
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:17,383
From this day forward, I
put my life on the line.

309
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:22,183
From this day forward,
I am the Fifth Hokage.

00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:24,616
NARUTO: Next time,
The Fifth Hokage!
