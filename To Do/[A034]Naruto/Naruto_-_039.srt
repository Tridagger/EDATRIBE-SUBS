1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,621
[music playing]

2
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:46,976
-Waves of pain, they're
coming sooner and sooner.

3
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,346
-Sasuke, listen to me.

4
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,949
You have got to quit.

5
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:53,184
-Huh?

6
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,953
-You've been like
this ever since you

7
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,321
tangled with Orochimaru.

8
00:01:56,355 --> 00:02:00,694
And it's getting worse.

9
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,764
-Didn't waste any
time, did they?

10
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,406
-I couldn't ask
for anything more.

11
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,879
-You have been chosen for
the first match, Yoroi Akado

12
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:16,282
and Sasuke Uchiha.

13
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,250
Are there any objections?

14
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,852
-None here.

15
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:21,221
-No.

16
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,158
-The pain won't go away.

17
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:28,097
-That curse mark
giving you trouble?

18
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,469
-Don't use your Sharingan.

19
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,940
-So you know about it?

20
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:38,111
-If that mark on your
neck gets out of control,

21
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:41,048
your life could be in danger.

22
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,384
-I'm aware of that.

23
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:46,322
-Just to let you know,
if it gets to that point,

24
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:48,891
I'll have to step in
and stop the fight.

25
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:51,061
Good luck.

26
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:52,630
-Stop the fight?

27
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:59,740
This thing, it seems to be
responding to my Chakra.

28
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:03,277
I've got to fight him
without using my Sharingan.

29
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,648
And even my own
Jutsu is off limits.

30
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,417
Maybe I can make him
laugh himself to death.

31
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,494
-The thing is, Sasuke,
Yoroi's unique skills

32
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:18,465
are going to be
disastrous for you.

33
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,602
-Then if you're ready,
let the match begin.

34
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:37,290
-[laughs]

35
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:40,961
-What the-- my Chakra,
what are you doing?

36
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,663
-[laughs]

37
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,399
You're just noticing it now?

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,511
-Bushy Brows' jealousy.

39
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:55,647
-Lions barrage unleashed.

40
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,348
-My Chakra!

41
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,417
You're stealing it from me.

42
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,220
-[laughs]

43
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:27,957
You finally caught on, huh?

44
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:34,732
-That's right, Sasuke.

45
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,102
He's draining your Chakra.

46
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:41,108
Yoroi has an extraordinary
ninja art at his fingertips.

47
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:45,280
He can absorb an opponent's
spiritual and physical energy

48
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,650
with the palm of his hand.

49
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:50,253
And once the last
drop of your Chakra

50
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:52,256
has been drained
from you, Sasuke,

51
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,726
you'll have no other
choice but to rely

52
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,497
on the power of the curse mark.

53
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:03,871
Go on.

54
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:07,243
Release that delicious
forbidden power.

55
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,645
Set it free.

56
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:12,216
It's the only chance you
have of saving yourself.

57
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,189
-Get off!

58
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:27,269
-So, you've still got
some strength left, huh?

59
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,707
Impressive-- for a guinea pig.

60
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:31,608
-Woah.

61
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:33,511
That was close.

62
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,347
-Don't worry, little man.

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,283
I'll make it short and sweet.

64
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,308
What's the matter?

65
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,744
Is that really the
best you can do?

66
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,819
-Don't have the speed
to keep away from him,

67
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,423
and don't have a chance
at a close quarters fight.

68
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,593
I need to think
of something fast.

69
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:16,067
-The great Sasuke Uchiha.

70
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,371
Is that all he's got?

71
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:19,606
-Come on, Sasuke!

72
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:28,218
Hey, Sasuke!

73
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,319
Come on, man!

74
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:30,353
What was that?

75
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,657
And you call yourself an Uchiha?

76
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,260
You're going to let this
goon walk all over you!

77
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:39,098
Come on, stop messing
around and get it in gear!

78
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,441
-They're all-- wait!

79
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:47,176
That's it!

80
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,812
-Huh?

81
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,718
-I'll teach you to
turn your back on me.

82
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:56,121
Big mistake, and your last!

83
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:09,906
-Is this as far as it goes?

84
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:16,648
-Huh?

85
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:17,383
Where did he go?

86
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,264
-That's my move.

87
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,232
-What the?

88
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:29,833
-Huh?

89
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:36,675
-OK, I admit it.

90
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,144
I kind of borrowed that move.

91
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,617
But from here on in,
it's all original.

92
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,052
-A Dancing Leaf Shadow!

93
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:47,990
Now take this!

94
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,505
-No, not again!

95
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,208
He keeps getting
stronger and stronger.

96
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,038
-Don't do it!

97
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,847
Stop, please!

98
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:36,789
-Come on!

99
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,792
What was that?

100
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,794
And you call yourself an Uchiha!

101
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,797
-Shut up, loser.

102
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,135
Don't write me off yet.

103
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:49,439
-Is this it?

104
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:51,074
-No!

105
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:54,312
I won't let this
thing take over.

106
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:55,314
No way!

107
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:10,434
-The curse mark receded!

108
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,368
-Here we go.

109
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:19,312
-You're no match for me.

110
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,882
-Who's no match for who?

111
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:32,997
-Come back here!

112
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,603
-I'm not done yet!

113
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:38,604
Lions Barrage!

114
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,077
-Well, this one's had it.

115
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:32,309
I'm declaring this match over.

116
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:37,150
As the winner of this
preliminary round,

117
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,820
Sasuke Uchiha advances
to the finals.

118
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,189
-Way to go!

119
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:59,579
-Hm, not bad.

120
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:04,286
Funny.

121
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,254
Before the Lions
Barrage, your technique

122
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:09,158
was very reminiscent
of Guy's Taijutsu.

123
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,928
You must have used
your Sharingan

124
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,465
to copy it when you fought
with Rock Lee that time.

125
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:20,808
-You OK?

126
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:21,942
[laughs]

127
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:23,344
Hey, Sasuke!

128
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:26,081
You won, but in
such an uncool way.

129
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:28,952
You came out looking like
you're the one who got beat up!

130
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,186
-Idiot.

131
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,893
Give me a break, you
little-- oh, well.

132
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,496
-Sasuke, thank goodness.

133
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,566
-I can't wait
until it's my turn.

134
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,407
-Rock Lee.

135
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,409
If I hadn't seen your
moves up close when

136
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:52,082
we went head to head, this one
would have turned out badly.

137
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,330
Still, I don't think
it's a technique

138
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:06,334
I want to use very often.

139
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:07,270
-Amazing.

140
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:09,138
He only saw me do
it once, and he

141
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,540
was able to copy it perfectly.

142
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:14,345
-Sharingan!

143
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:22,756
-So that is your
special ability?

144
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,993
You really are
something, Sasuke.

145
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,198
You just keep getting
stronger all the time.

146
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:32,236
You make me almost
a little nervous.

147
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,878
-Impressive.

148
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:41,682
But you can't expect to master
high speed Taijutsu and Lotus

149
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,284
movements just like that.

150
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:45,286
It takes more than Sharingan.

151
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,358
It takes blood, and
sweat, and brutal training

152
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,061
that whittles at your flesh.

153
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:56,468
Even so, that last
move of yours-- he

154
00:12:56,501 --> 00:13:00,674
reminds me of you, Kakashi,
when you were young.

155
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:11,255
-Last year, Neji Hyuga
was the rookie to beat.

156
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,859
This year, it's Sasuke Uchiha.

157
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:17,964
I wonder when we'll find
out which one's stronger?

158
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,799
[laughs]

159
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,669
-The kid is something else.

160
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:25,975
To have already developed his
Sharingan to such a level.

161
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:30,547
And to think, we haven't even
seen his full Uchiha ability

162
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,474
yet.

163
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,891
-I still can't believe it.

164
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:40,127
The way the curse
mark receded, as

165
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,296
if he's gained control over it.

166
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:50,641
-Oh, no.

167
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:53,177
Not again!

168
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,312
-Well, well.

169
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,849
So that's how it's done.

170
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:57,883
-[laughs]

171
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,621
I knew all the time he'd be OK.

172
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:03,825
-This could be the end
of the line for us.

173
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,560
Man, I'm hungry.

174
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,228
-Wow.

175
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,197
He was amazing.

176
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,933
-He wasn't anything
that special.

177
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:14,339
-Magnificent!

178
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:24,419
-Sasuke Uchiha, maybe
you should come along

179
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:27,256
to the infirmary, too, and
let us treat your injuries.

180
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,494
-I think you're out of
your league with this one.

181
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:31,228
-Huh?

182
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,765
-I'll look after him.

183
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,300
-OK, up you go.

184
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,703
You're coming with me.

185
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,973
We've got to seal
that curse mark.

186
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:42,342
Before the
preliminaries are over?

187
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,913
I want to see who gets
to go on to the finals.

188
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,047
-Forget it.

189
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,618
And don't even think of arguing.

190
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:50,754
If we leave it any
longer, who knows.

191
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,223
It may be too late.

192
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:56,195
I've already cut you
enough slack as it is.

193
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:56,996
Come on.

194
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,597
Let's go.

195
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:04,932
-Sasuke!

196
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,518
-Huh?

197
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,685
Hey, Sakura.

198
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:41,421
Maybe I'm just
crazy, but did you

199
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:44,660
see any weird marks on
Sasuke's neck during the fight?

200
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:51,369
-You've got to
promise me you won't

201
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,271
tell Naruto about
the curse mark.

202
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,140
-Why?

203
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:57,743
-There's nothing
he can do about it.

204
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,012
And we're a team.

205
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,917
It doesn't do us any good
if he's worried about me.

206
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,452
-What mark?

207
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,154
I didn't see it.

208
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:06,922
-Oh, OK.

209
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,563
-OK then.

210
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,733
Let's move right on
to the second match.

211
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,501
-Which sucker is that?

212
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,015
-Step forward, please.

213
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:58,424
Very good.

214
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,527
Now, if you've both
ready, then we'll begin.

215
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,902
-That's that sound
village Shinobi,

216
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,739
the one who had his
arms broken by Sasuke.

217
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:16,382
-You seem to be very proud
of these arms of yours,

218
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,985
very attached to them.

219
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:19,652
-What?

220
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,522
What are you doing?

221
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:31,869
[screams]

222
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,971
-How's he going to
fight with those arms?

223
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,278
-Do you think Shina
will be all right?

224
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,547
-He's OK.

225
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,149
Don't you worry about him.

226
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,618
-Huh?

227
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:48,625
-He's the last person here
I'd ever want to take on.

228
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,928
-Candidates ready?

229
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:51,895
Begin.

230
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,097
-Well, Zaku.

231
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:56,201
How you pull this one off
will be a sight to see.

232
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:18,297
-If you fight me, you
won't be able to recover.

233
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,267
Forfeit and withdraw.

234
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:27,242
-But what do you know,
I've got a little movement

235
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:28,244
in one of them.

236
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,887
One good arm is more
than enough to beat you!

237
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,629
-You couldn't beat me
using both your arms.

238
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:46,568
-Yeah, well I've
got news for you!

239
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,538
Try this!

240
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,139
[inaudible]

241
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,787
-OK.

242
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,023
It'll be over quickly.

243
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:28,984
You ready?

244
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,309
Curse sealing.

245
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,081
There.

246
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:14,152
Now the next time that
curse mark starts acting up,

247
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:16,889
the seal should
keep it in check.

248
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:22,163
But remember, this curse
sealing Jutsu is only

249
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,798
as strong as you are.

250
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:27,703
It derives its power from
the strength of your will.

251
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:30,006
If that will ever
weakens, if you ever

252
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,977
begin to doubt
yourself, the curse

253
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,247
will be unleashed
in all its fury.

254
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:41,188
Amazing.

255
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,425
Too tired to even argue.

256
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:48,665
-My, how you're grown.

257
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,601
To think you've
become strong enough

258
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:53,271
to perform the
curse sealing Jutsu.

259
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,077
-You.

260
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:10,694
-Long time no see, Kakashi.

261
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,295
-Orochimaru.

262
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:23,044
[music playing]

263
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,599
-Well, this is a nasty surprise.

264
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:59,039
What snake pit in hell did
you crawl out from, and why?

265
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,608
What do you want with Sasuke?

266
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:04,679
I don't care if you are one
of the legendary Sannin.

267
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:07,049
I won't back down, Orochimaru.

268
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,420
If you want him, you'll
have to kill me first!

269
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:15,094
Next time, Kakashi and
Orochimaru face to face.

270
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:19,228
I'm going to stop
you here and now!
