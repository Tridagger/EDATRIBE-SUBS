00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:12,298
[theme music]

2
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:57,398
-Thank you.

3
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,731
You did excellent work.

4
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,598
Kome has already
made his confession.

5
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:05,198
It seems the curses warrior was
all a ploy to stir up unrest

6
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:09,598
with the public, so he could
seize the Feudal Lord's seat.

7
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,831
NARUTO: And Kome told
you all that himself?

8
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,598
-Yes.

9
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,731
I know it's inconceivable.

10
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,198
When that Cursed
Warrior disappeared,

11
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:20,831
it was actually a soldier
pretending to be a ninja.

12
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:24,265
He used powerful hydrochloric
acid to melt his own flesh.

13
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,531
-Anyone else freaking out
that it's empty again?

14
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,965
[chuckling]

15
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:42,565
-You see the Cursed
Warrior incident is over.

16
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:45,665
Now the Land of Birds can return
to the beautiful, quiet place

17
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,465
it was before this mess.

18
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,031
-Wait.

19
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,098
Hold on a sec.

20
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,965
There's another Cursed
Warrior out there!

21
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,098
-Enough, Naruto.

22
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,398
-What gives, Neji.

23
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,331
-I am pleased to say your
work here is complete.

24
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:00,265
I hope you have a safe
journey back to your village.

25
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:04,998
[footsteps]

26
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:05,498
-Aw.

27
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,465
Come on.

28
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:09,165
What the heck was that?

29
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:10,431
You said yourself.

30
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,665
The first one was different
from the one last night.

31
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,898
Remember?

32
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,898
-Yes.

33
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,731
Perhaps multiple
people were disguised

34
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:17,698
as the Cursed Warrior.

35
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,431
But so what?

36
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,498
-But if a person was
inside that thing,

37
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:23,631
how do you explain how
it flew off like that?

38
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,565
-We have already been told
that this mission is complete.

39
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,698
So there's no reason to remain
in this land any longer.

40
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,665
-Besides, you
heard what he said.

41
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:34,065
Kome confessed to it.

42
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,665
-It still seems fishy.

43
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,165
I can't just pack
up and leave when

44
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:39,165
we don't know what
really happened.

45
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:42,065
-These people have their
own way of doing things.

46
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,331
Getting too involved
will only cause trouble.

47
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,165
-Heh.

48
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,165
Fine.

49
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,431
I'll just have to
do this by myself.

50
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,765
-Hold it.

51
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,631
I am still leader of this team.

52
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:55,298
-Yeah.

53
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:56,665
And what does that
have to do with it?

54
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:59,998
-The team is not yet finished
with the Cursed Warrior.

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,965
Tenten and I will study
this from a different angle.

56
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:03,998
-What?

57
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,431
But you just said
the mission's over.

58
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:09,631
-Naruto, you do
have a valid point.

59
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:12,398
The whole matter was
resolved much too quickly.

60
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,365
-All right then.

61
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:16,298
I'm on it.

62
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:16,798
-Oh.

63
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:17,631
Hi.

64
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,165
Where are you off to, Naruto?

65
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:20,265
NARUTO: Ain't it obvious?

66
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,565
To solve the Cursed
Warrior mystery again.

67
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:23,065
-What?

68
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:26,931
-Oh.

69
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,398
Hello, Chishima.

70
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,431
-Excuse me.

71
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:30,965
Naruto just said that--

72
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:31,631
-Oh.

73
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:32,798
Don't listen to him.

74
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,831
It's nothing.

75
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,365
-Is there anything
we can do for you?

76
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:35,898
-Oh.

77
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:36,398
Yes.

78
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,765
You have all been so
incredibly helpful to me,

79
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:45,465
and I feel badly
about how little

80
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,098
you were paid for the job.

81
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:47,765
-Huh?

82
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:48,931
Did you bring more?

83
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,165
-We can accept more payment.

84
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:50,665
Please.

85
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:51,865
-It's not.

86
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:54,731
It's a local delicacy,
bean jam stuffed wings.

87
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:15,865
-Thanks for the tip.

88
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:42,665
[sniffing]

89
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:45,398
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This place
is definitely suspicious.

90
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,298
Kind of makes me nervous
doing this alone.

91
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:52,598
Summoning Jutsu.

92
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,665
-Oh.

93
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,565
Haven't see you in a while.

94
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,531
You have a snack for me?

95
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:02,765
-Are you kidding me?

96
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,098
Why's it you guys?

97
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,998
-Dad's busy, so I guess
you're stuck with us.

98
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,498
-Actually, maybe it's
better that Boss Gama

99
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,465
is staying out of this.

100
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:12,165
Oh well.

101
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,365
Guess it's just us then.

102
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:15,765
Hey.

103
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,231
You guys have a better sense of
smell than humans, don't you?

104
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,165
-What do we look like?

105
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,431
Puppies or something?

106
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:20,598
I'm telling you.

107
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,198
The family reputation
has hit rock bottom.

108
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,065
Gamatatsu, we're out of here.

109
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:27,498
Huh?

110
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,065
Hey, uh-- Gamatatsu.

111
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:29,731
-Huh?

112
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,831
-What're you doing?

113
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,265
-Huh?

114
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:36,931
Why's the toad trying to
jump up to that branch?

115
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,031
-What is that moron up to?

116
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:46,231
-Big Bro Gamakichi, what
do you think this is?

117
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:47,698
Uh-oh.

118
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,198
Who turned out the lights?

119
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,365
Is it night already?

120
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,031
Good night, then.

121
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,398
Rise and shine.

122
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,231
-What is this anyway?

123
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,798
-It's a kite painted
black, genius.

124
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,565
-A kite?

125
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:06,831
-Look up there.

126
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:07,365
See?

127
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:08,231
-Huh?

128
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,231
No way.

129
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,198
That kite is so huge.

130
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,265
-Ooh.

131
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,031
I wonder if they had
a giant kite flying

132
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:15,931
festival or something?

133
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:16,998
-I don't know.

134
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:19,098
It's kind of boring
for a festival kite.

135
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,231
Wouldn't you say?

136
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,098
-Really?

137
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:23,131
Where'd you come up with that?

138
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:23,998
-Whoopsie.

139
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:24,565
-Hey!

140
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:26,665
Where you going?

141
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:27,965
-Whoop.

142
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,065
Wow.

143
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:29,765
What a trip.

144
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:42,365
-Of course.

145
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:45,365
If somebody flew one of
these under cover of night,

146
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,465
a Cursed Warrior
hanging off a black kite

147
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,398
would look like
he's flying And just

148
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:55,565
like that, the mystery of the
levitating warrior is solved.

149
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:56,498
What's next?

150
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,327
Someone was definitely
here that night.

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,427
GAMAKICHI: So what is it?

152
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,193
-The cursed warrior
came out from this door.

153
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,693
-Nothing special here.

154
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,727
Just looks like an old temple
that nobody uses anymore.

155
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,360
-Yeah.

156
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,093
It certainly does.

157
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,560
-Let's move out, Gamatatsu.

158
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,493
-Come on, Big Brother Gamakichi.

159
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:36,093
It's so nice and
cool and relaxing.

160
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,427
-Ah, what are you talking about?

161
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,727
This place should
be hot and humid.

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,227
Ah.

163
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,493
You're right for
once, little bro.

164
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,127
That is a nice, moist breeze.

165
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,193
-See?

166
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,360
Doesn't it make you
want to take a nap?

167
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:53,360
-You mean wind's
blowing from underneath?

168
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,727
Huh?

169
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,060
-What's down there?

170
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:08,493
-It's so big.

171
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:12,060
I wonder if a gigantic
worm built all this.

172
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,927
Or maybe an enormous mole.

173
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,627
-OK.

174
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,827
Let's check it out.

175
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,727
GAMATATSU: Hey, if we
meet a giant mole, how

176
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,427
you think we're
supposed to greet him?

177
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,060
GAMAKICHI: Heh.

178
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:23,993
How should I now?

179
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,027
CHISHIMA: So, Naruto
is still investigating

180
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,927
the cursed warrior.

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
That's very interesting.

182
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,793
I had better inform Lord Moso.

183
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,193
Hm?

184
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:42,827
-We encountered some
trouble along the way.

185
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,293
But at last, we found
what we were looking for.

186
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:08,627
Find him.

187
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,227
-Big brother, where are we now?

188
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,827
-Well, obviously where uh--

189
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,893
-Wait.

190
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,660
Isn't that the Feudal
Lord's residence?

191
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,293
-Wow.

192
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,360
A Lord lives there?

193
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:32,027
-That would explain
why it's so fancy.

194
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,993
-That secret tunnel
we found leads here?

195
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:39,027
[splash]

196
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,460
-What the heck was
that splashing?

197
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:49,293
-Woohoo!

198
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,260
Wow.

199
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,060
You got a pretty
nice view from here!

200
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,227
[muffled talking]

201
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,960
-Hey.

202
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,093
Keep quiet.

203
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:58,927
They're gonna discover us.

204
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,893
-Um-- Gamakichi?

205
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,793
-Oh, great.

206
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,827
GAMAKICHI: You blockhead!

207
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:10,060
-Uh-- hey there.

208
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,660
Good job patrolling men.

209
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:13,527
Just ignore me.

210
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,927
I'm not intruding or-- Listen.

211
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,360
I was hired by
supervising officer Moso.

212
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:23,793
I'm just here investigating
an official crime incident.

213
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:26,227
NARUTO:It'll all make sense
if you let me explain.

214
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:32,393
-Lord Sagi, we have captured
a suspicious person.

215
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:35,293
What shall we do with him?

216
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,693
-Huh?

217
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,160
Hey!

218
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:38,793
Sagi!

219
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,393
This guy knows me.

220
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,793
We met before at the lake.

221
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,660
Don't you remember?

222
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,293
This is great.

223
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,793
Just tell these
guys you know me.

224
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,993
-I've never seen
this person before.

225
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:50,560
-You what?

226
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:53,493
-He's not worth sending to
the magistrate's office.

227
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:55,660
Lock him up in the
dungeon at once.

228
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,193
-Yes, milord.

229
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:57,193
-Wait a sec.

230
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,693
You can't just walk
away like that!

231
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:00,227
NARUTO: Hey!

232
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,660
Come on, Sagi!

233
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:02,660
This is cruel!

234
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:03,660
Don't do this to me!

235
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:04,627
Get back here!

236
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,627
Come back!

237
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,627
[groaning]

238
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,227
[splash]

239
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:04,860
NARUTO: Give me a break.

240
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,760
This is all a misunderstanding!

241
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,160
I was just going after
the Cursed Warrior!

242
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:09,793
Listen.

243
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,093
Just talk to Moso!

244
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,560
He'll clear it all up!

245
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:13,727
I swear!

246
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,360
GAMAKICHI: Hey!

247
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,193
How you doing?

248
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,560
-Huh?

249
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:18,660
-Hi!

250
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:20,727
-I couldn't fight those
guys because they're

251
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,293
soldiers of the
guy who hired me.

252
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,427
And then you guys get caught
like that in some dumb trap.

253
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,893
[whimper]

254
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,660
-Don't worry about it.

255
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:35,393
I can bust out here easy as
long as I can use both hands.

256
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,227
Here.

257
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,927
Do me a favor and untie this.

258
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,660
-Right.

259
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,660
Give me a second here.

260
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,893
[footsteps in water]

261
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,293
[footsteps and closing door]

262
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:09,660
-Huh?

263
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,681
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The cursed warrior?

264
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:01,785
-Man, this stinks!

265
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,885
If I had both hands, this
guy'd have no chance.

266
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,152
aren't we gonna help him?

267
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,419
-If we tried anything, that
big guy'd slice us in two.

268
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,419
-That doesn't sound fun.

269
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,152
NARUTO: Just a little closer.

270
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,352
[NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ugh!

271
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,352
Come on.

272
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:55,319
Just a little more!

273
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:15,152
-Haaa!

274
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:42,352
NARUTO: Sagi!

275
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:48,085
What the heck's going on here?

276
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:50,952
You're telling me you were
the other Cursed Warrior?

277
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:51,952
But why?

278
00:16:56,452 --> 00:17:00,519
-They say that only a ghost
can accomplish true vengeance.

279
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,352
But that is nothing
more than a dirty lie!

280
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:07,685
This watch had been handed
down from generation

281
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:11,185
to generation of Feudal Lords.

282
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:13,585
It was supposed to be passed
on from father to son.

283
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,319
But no more.

284
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:23,485
The moment my father perished,
the watch stopped ticking.

285
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,852
It's as if it too felt
the pain of death!

286
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,819
[sobbing]

287
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:38,452
-The only reason I continued
this shameless life

288
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:41,152
is to my revenge.

289
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,285
The moment I achieve it,
I can perish as well.

290
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,485
-But that's no way to live.

291
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,852
-You have no idea what
it feels like to lose

292
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,452
everything you hold dear!

293
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:51,385
-You're right, OK.

294
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,819
I don't know!

295
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:59,085
But I do know one thing--
living only to seek vengeance

296
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,519
is no life at all.

297
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:07,285
NARUTO: You're a
Feudal Lord, right?

298
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,019
Is revenge the job
of a Feudal Lord?

299
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:13,052
Of course not.

300
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,419
Look.

301
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:16,452
Kome has already been arrested
for the evil he's committed.

302
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:20,419
You could just let Moso
handle it, and walk away.

303
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:20,919
Right?

304
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:31,819
-You have absolutely no
right to interfere in this.

305
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:35,552
And besides, now that you
know everything you do,

306
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:38,619
we cannot let you survive.

307
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,685
You have trespassed on the
land of the Feudal Palace,

308
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:45,852
and the punishment
for that is death!

309
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:46,852
-You're kidding me.

310
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,385
-So creepy.

311
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,285
These are the tombs of all
the past Feudal Lords, right?

312
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,719
-Yes.

313
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,419
This one's the tomb
of Lord Owashi.

314
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:02,652
Byakugan!

315
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,952
What is that?

316
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:19,085
-Wha-- what is it, Neji?

317
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,119
Are you seeing something?

318
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,419
-I sense something poisonous
inside Owashi's body.

319
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,052
Was he assassinated?

320
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,452
They've surrounded us.

321
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,552
-Ninja of the
Hidden Leaf Village,

322
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,019
hear this proclamation.

323
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:01,585
We come bearing a message
from the Feudal Lord.

324
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,752
Your comrade has been arrested
for infiltrating the Royal

325
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:10,319
Residence, and has been
sentenced to death.

326
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:13,619
You are ordered to leave
the Land of Birds at once.

327
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,219
If you don't, you
will be executed

328
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,485
where you stand, for the
same crime as your friend.

329
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,385
Draw your bows,
and fire at will!

330
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:36,485
-Neji, what should we do?

331
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,585
-We'll make our way
to the Feudal Lord.

332
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:39,585
We must save Naruto.

333
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:53,185
You?

334
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,852
-Kakashi-sensei,
Naruto's in big trouble.

335
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,519
-We have to find him quickly,
and mount a rescue mission.

336
00:20:58,552 --> 00:20:59,852
-We can't do that.

337
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,319
-What?

338
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,152
-Sorry.

339
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,752
Your mission's over.

340
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,552
-But, sensei!

341
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,552
-You'll do nothing
beyond your mission.

342
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,885
[chirping]

343
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,685
[theme music]

344
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,718
NEJI: Are we really just
going back to the village?

345
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:05,852
KAKASHI: I told you.

346
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,218
Our mission in the Land
of Birds is finished.

347
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:10,518
TENTEN: But what's
gonna happen to Naruto?

348
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:12,818
KAKASHI: We can't
interfere in their affairs.

349
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:14,652
TENTEN: This can't be happening.

350
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,752
NEJI: I'm sorry.

351
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:19,218
As team leader, this
is my responsibility.

352
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,818
KAKASHI: Let it go.

353
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:23,818
Sacrifice is part
of every mission.

354
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:27,218
Next time-- the Death of Naruto.
