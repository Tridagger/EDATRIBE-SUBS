00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:04,444
[music playing]

2
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:09,689
[theme music]

3
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:54,405
[sighing]

4
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,781
[music playing]

5
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,584
NARUTO: "Viva Dojo Challenge!

6
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,491
Youth is All About Passion!"

7
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,361
-Oh.

8
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,231
Long time, no see, Naruto.

9
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,303
You back from some
kind of solo mission?

10
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,540
-Yep.

11
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,945
I just had to deliver some
letter for Grandma Tsunade.

12
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,315
-Oh yeah?

13
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,453
Then you'd better report
to her office right away.

14
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:18,229
-Where do you think
I'm going Man,

15
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,501
I know I've only
been gone for a week,

16
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,840
but the village seems
an awful lot different.

17
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:23,441
Huh?

18
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,379
[thud]

19
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,651
That sign wasn't here before.

20
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:33,232
"Dojo Challenges?"

21
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:33,918
What?

22
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:38,410
This way, huh?

23
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,515
[grunting]

24
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,821
[groaning]

25
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,926
It's a tight squeeze.

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,898
Is that it?

27
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,604
"Welcome to Hot Blooded Dojo."

28
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:52,845
Who the heck would
build a dojo out here?

29
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,382
Huh?

30
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,718
[screaming]

31
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:56,922
LEE: I have been waiting.

32
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:57,924
NARUTO: (CONFUSED) What?

33
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:01,465
LEE: You have
accepted my challenge?

34
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,501
Good.

35
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:04,840
You may attack me
from any direction.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,943
-Huh?

37
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,714
Uh, Bushy Brows?

38
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,716
-No move.

39
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,411
Then I will come at you.

40
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:10,854
-Huh?

41
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:11,589
What the heck?

42
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:12,525
Hey!

43
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,628
What's the big
idea, Bushy Brows?

44
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,463
It's me!

45
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:17,871
[groaning]

46
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:18,472
-Naruto?

47
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:21,880
[panting]

48
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:23,484
-Man, that was a close one.

49
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,525
-So, my first dojo challenger
will be you, Naruto?

50
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,429
I could not wish for
a better challenge.

51
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:29,532
-Huh?

52
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,637
LEE: I will fight
with all my heart.

53
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,271
-Fight?

54
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:32,740
Hey!

55
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:33,341
Wait just a min--

56
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:33,809
[gasping]

57
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:35,480
-Leaf hurricane!

58
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,716
[screaming]

59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,355
[crashing]

60
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,692
LEE: Have some tea.

61
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,897
So you only came to take a look?

62
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,067
-(GRUNTING) Mhm.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,637
-Well, if you had told
me so in the first place,

64
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,844
you might have avoided
getting kicked.

65
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,384
-Sorry, but it was kind
of hard to talk to you.

66
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:53,088
You were too many slamming
me through a wall!

67
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:54,491
LEE: Oh, yes.

68
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,961
I do apologize for that.

69
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,331
NARUTO: Uh, yeah.

70
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:01,040
So, is this your very
own dojo, Bushy Brows?

71
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,444
LEE: It is.

72
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:04,883
I've been building it piece
by piece for a long time

73
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,790
and finally finished
construction six days ago.

74
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:10,764
So I distributed this flyer--
not only in Hidden Leaf

75
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,336
Village, but across nearby
towns and villages, too.

76
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,007
LEE: NARUTO: You don't say.

77
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,811
I just got back from
a mission today,

78
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,415
so I must have missed it.

79
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:19,518
-Oh, is that so?

80
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,823
-Hey, uh, what's up with
building your own dojo?

81
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:22,926
Ahh!

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,864
-This dojo will help
me further my training!

83
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,632
-What?

84
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,969
Your training?

85
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:29,742
-You see, I have been so
preoccupied with my missions

86
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,580
lately, I have not
been able to devote

87
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:35,054
enough time to
developing my skills.

88
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,831
And even when I did, it was hard
to find experienced practice

89
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:42,105
partners, so I could
not train effectively.

90
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:44,678
-Hmm.

91
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,615
-Just when I was
wondering what to do,

92
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,622
I saw something in another
village on a mission.

93
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,594
[people talking]

94
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,064
MAN (BACKGROUND): I
issue a challenge!

95
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,076
MAN: Yes, sir, this way.

96
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:58,678
-Hm.

97
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:06,563
I have traveled far and wide in
order to perfect my training,

98
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,503
and now you will see my skills.

99
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:12,744
However, if I win this match,
I will claim your marquee

100
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:13,647
as my own.

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,719
-Dojo against dojo?

102
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:16,687
Very well.

103
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,524
I accept the terms
of your challenge.

104
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:22,200
-Ready!

105
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:23,103
We fight!

106
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:29,551
-That is when I realized
that if I open my own dojo,

107
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,455
someone with this
high level of skill

108
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,060
would surely come
to challenge me.

109
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:36,702
I worked hard to build
the dojo so that finally I

110
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,806
could get some real practice.

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,146
But so far, no one
has shown up yet.

112
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:44,186
No one to challenge me.

113
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,596
-Ohh, I think I get it.

114
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,067
Huh?

115
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,170
[gasping]

116
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:52,973
-Since you have wandered
in here, what about you

117
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,544
issuing a challenge?

118
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,847
-Huh?

119
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,954
LEE: And if you win, I will give
you my hand-painted marquee.

120
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,859
-That's great, but
I don't need one.

121
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,198
-Please do not say no, Naruto.

122
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,100
Fight me!

123
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,138
[yelling]

124
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,544
-(NERVOUSLY LAUGHING)
Come to think of it,

125
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,548
I totally forgot to
report to Grandma Tsunade.

126
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,018
I better book it over there.

127
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,021
See you around!

128
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,023
-Uh.

129
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,093
Naruto!

130
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:16,663
(YELLING) Please be
my first challenger!

131
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:20,840
NARUTO: Darn it.

132
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,979
I spent too much time
at that dumb dojo,

133
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:26,253
and now Grandma Tsunade is
going to tear me to shreds.

134
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,523
Oh man.

135
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,160
I better steer clear
of Bushy Brow's dojo

136
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,863
until he calms down.

137
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:31,766
GUY: What?

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,868
Lee's dojo?

139
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:33,637
-Huh?

140
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,275
Bushier Brows Sensei?

141
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,711
-Hm.

142
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:40,754
Naruto, did I hear
what I thought I heard?

143
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:43,294
So, while I was
away on my mission,

144
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,799
Lee was so desperate
for practice

145
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,708
that he decided to open his own
dojo in order to train himself?

146
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,210
[crying]

147
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,078
NARUTO: Huh?

148
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,283
-I have taught my pupil well.

149
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:56,892
I, Might Guy, am both
moved and impressed!

150
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,897
-Hm.

151
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,035
The problem is not
a single challenger

152
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:04,176
from a rival dojo has
shown up to fight him.

153
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,279
-Huh?

154
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,784
How dare the other dojos
treat him like this!

155
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:10,625
Lee's hopes and
dreams unrealized!

156
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,961
I'll hunt down
all those cowards,

157
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:14,000
and I won't go easy on them!

158
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,905
-But, uh, if you
do, wouldn't that

159
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,610
leave even fewer folks
to spare with him?

160
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:19,245
-Huh?

161
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,050
Gosh darn it, you're right!

162
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,887
What do I do?

163
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,592
[slurping]

164
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,193
Huh.

165
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,664
Of course.

166
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,771
If no one from the other schools
will come challenge Lee--

167
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:30,873
-Huh?

168
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,978
-Well then, why don't
I just pay him a visit?

169
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,816
Except I'll be disguised
as a fighter who

170
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,353
comes to spare against him.

171
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:37,890
-Say what?

172
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:42,267
-Yes, I will act out the part
of Lee's first dojo challenger.

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,868
[gulping]

174
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:43,556
-Huh?

175
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,219
[laughing]

176
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,892
-A perfect disguise,
if I do say so.

177
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:56,701
No one would imagine it's
me in this crazy getup.

178
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,372
Here I come, Lee!

179
00:07:58,405 --> 00:07:59,208
[foot steps]

180
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,645
-Guy Sensei!

181
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,916
-Huh?

182
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,852
[panting]

183
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,322
I found you.

184
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:06,959
-If it isn't Sakura.

185
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,197
So, what's going on?

186
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,236
-Guy, forgive me
for bothering you

187
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,776
when you've only just returned.

188
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,881
We just received an
emergency distress

189
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:17,418
call from Shikamaru's
squad, which

190
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,890
was on a transport mission.

191
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,226
We're flying blind.

192
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,298
We don't know how
strong the enemy is,

193
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,870
and that's why if
we make a mistake

194
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:28,009
in our initial
encounter, this might

195
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,014
turn into something major.

196
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:33,289
-Judging from the reports,
they shouldn't be too far away.

197
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,394
-So they're close.

198
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:38,367
-First, do some recon to
confirm the situation.

199
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,208
And if it looks like
they need reinforcements,

200
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,845
you know what to do.

201
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:44,115
-Right.

202
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,720
On my way.

203
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:48,257
[door opening]

204
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,828
[door closing]

205
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,272
-Does anyone have a clue why
he was dressed like that?

206
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,107
-[? i don't know. ?]

207
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,790
-Huh?

208
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,930
NANAFUSHI: What's with
this strange fellow?

209
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,100
Whatever.

210
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,472
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
m e borrowing his form

211
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,343
to infiltrate the
village while he's away.

212
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:14,987
[laughing]

213
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,460
Yes, the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

214
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,902
I, Nanafushi, shall find out
every last detail and weakness.

215
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,971
Huh.

216
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,043
-And this challenger
you met, he really

217
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:25,546
traveled here from another dojo?

218
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,183
NARUTO: Well, that's
what he told me,

219
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,422
so I got no reason
to think otherwise.

220
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:31,493
He said he saw your flyers.

221
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,866
-Well, if that is the
case, where is he?

222
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,902
-(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

223
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,004
Come on, Guy Sensei.

224
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:40,314
How long are you going
to keep the kid waiting?

225
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:42,453
-Naruto, he is not here!

226
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,524
So instead, I would like
to spar against you.

227
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:46,863
-(NERVOUSLY) What?

228
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:47,498
[groaning]

229
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:50,105
(VOICEOVER) No, not again!

230
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,875
Uh, hold on, let me
just go look for him.

231
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:52,563
-Ugh!

232
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:53,312
Naruto!

233
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:55,885
Let us work up a
vigorous sweat in battle!

234
00:09:59,026 --> 00:09:59,560
-Huh.

235
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,134
He's coming back again.

236
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,138
-I knew that outfit
wasn't a good idea.

237
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,141
-(VOICEOVER) What?

238
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:05,876
Outfit?

239
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,950
What's he talking about?

240
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,888
-Huh?

241
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,491
Uh, Sensei?

242
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,260
No way.

243
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,295
That's your disguise?

244
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,403
Everyone can tell it's you!

245
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:19,107
-Uh, yeah, I'm with you.

246
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,145
I didn't think it was
a great idea either.

247
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,382
[laughing]

248
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,453
(VOICEOVER) Oh no, can it be?

249
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,427
Have these people discovered
my true identity already?

250
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,200
NARUTO: Bushier Brows Sensei!

251
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,205
(ANGRILY) Would you hurry it up?

252
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,241
-Wh-- what is it?

253
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:34,343
-Quit messing around!

254
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,050
We gotta get you over
to Lee's dojo ASAP!

255
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,320
-Huh?

256
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,555
-If you don't show up, then
I'm going to have to fight him,

257
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,592
and that ain't happening.

258
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:41,494
Let's go!

259
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:42,596
[laughing]

260
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,267
-See you soon!

261
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,339
-Did he seem weird to you?

262
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,477
-No weirder than usual.

263
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,479
-(VOICEOVER) Excellent.

264
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,951
I'm safe, thanks to this boy.

265
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,589
Perhaps I'll stick
with him for a bit

266
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:54,993
until I get a lay of the land.

267
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:00,272
Where are we?

268
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,107
-Duh.

269
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,512
This is Bushy Brow's dojo.

270
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,019
Seriously, you couldn't come
up with a better disguise

271
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,456
than that ridiculous thing?

272
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,659
-Hm?

273
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,162
-Well, whatever.

274
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:13,303
Lee must be tired of waiting,
so try to do a good acting job,

275
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,238
OK?

276
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,608
-(VOICEOVER) Acting?

277
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,248
What is he talking about?

278
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:19,383
-Hey, Bushy Brows!

279
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:22,525
I found him!

280
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,395
LEE: I have been waiting.

281
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,670
Now, we will fight to see
if you can best my dojo.

282
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:31,479
[gasping]

283
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,219
Come in.

284
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,489
I am ready.

285
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,426
-Uh-- I, uh--

286
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:41,737
-Aren't you supposed to say,
I issue a challenge now?

287
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,110
-Oh, is that right?

288
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:45,512
-I, uh, issue a challenge.

289
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:47,651
-Do I hear a familiar call?

290
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:50,959
So you come to try and
destroy my dojo's reputation.

291
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,696
Well, I accept.

292
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,369
And if you can beat me, then
you can claim my marquee

293
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,274
as your own.

294
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,980
(VOICEOVER) Well-- uh,
he really thinks I'm

295
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:02,553
a challenger from a rival dojo?

296
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,157
Absurd.

297
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,758
[gulping]

298
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,030
And he's just a kid.

299
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,035
Oh well, got no choice.

300
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,241
I'll go easy on him.

301
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,079
OK, here I come.

302
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:13,613
-Ready!

303
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,448
-(VOICEOVER) Huh?

304
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:15,751
Where'd he go?

305
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:18,658
[groaning]

306
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,596
-Huh?

307
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,503
-(VOICEOVER) What just happened?

308
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,410
[grunting]

309
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,445
[groaning]

310
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,217
-(VOICEOVER) That--
that little brat!

311
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:30,620
LEE: Hi-ya!

312
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,224
[grunting]

313
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:33,092
[screaming]

314
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,629
GUY (VOICEOVER): He's strong!

315
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,202
[yelling]

316
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,608
-(VOICEOVER) What the
heck are you doing?

317
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,413
I know you're only
pretending to lose,

318
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:45,388
but you at least have to
make it look interesting.

319
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,792
I get it.

320
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:51,737
He's not fighting because Lee
would recognize his technique.

321
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,344
-(VOICEOVER) Even
if I had nine lives,

322
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:56,649
I'd use every one of
them against this kid.

323
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:57,684
[groaning]

324
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,224
I need to wave the
white flag and get out

325
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:03,465
of here while I can still walk.

326
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:04,601
Wait.

327
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:05,169
-Huh?

328
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,107
-I submit.

329
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,677
-But that means?

330
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:10,181
I did it!

331
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:13,555
I bravely fought out my first
challenger from another dojo!

332
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,725
-That's not what it means!

333
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,327
-Huh?

334
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,396
-Huh?

335
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,136
-What he meant by I
submit was it's time

336
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,307
to submit the official
challenge to you.

337
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:22,143
-Huh?

338
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:23,413
-Huh?

339
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,851
-In other words, he's just been
warming up this whole time.

340
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:28,324
But now he's ready
to really throw down.

341
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,660
Right?

342
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,467
-(VOICEOVER) What's
this kid talking about?

343
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,370
-Of course.

344
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:34,355
Now I understand it.

345
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:34,807
[gulping]

346
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,277
-You do?

347
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,147
Against such a
seasoned veteran, I

348
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,852
thought it was strange
that I could fight off

349
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,854
the challenge so easily.

350
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,458
-(VOICEOVER) It's not strange.

351
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,396
There's nothing
strange about it!

352
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:47,336
-In that case, I will go all
out and not hold anything back!

353
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,305
-(VOICEOVER) No way!

354
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:51,278
You mean he was
holding back before?

355
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:54,487
[groaning]

356
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,655
-(VOICEOVER) Wow.

357
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:58,128
Bushier Brows Sensei is
a pretty darn good actor.

358
00:13:58,162 --> 00:13:59,832
He almost has me fooled.

359
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,570
The way he's getting
pummeled, you'd

360
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:04,677
never think he was a master.

361
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,713
GUY: What?

362
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,288
You were only been
attacked by monkeys?

363
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:11,895
-They managed to grab all the
snacks Choji was carrying.

364
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:13,331
But at least the cargo's safe.

365
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,902
That's something.

366
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:15,637
[sighing]

367
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,942
-All my snacks-- stolen.

368
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:21,484
-Anyway, Ino mistook it
for a real enemy attack,

369
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:23,756
so she panicked and sent
out a distress message.

370
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:25,192
-(ANGRILY) Don't blame me!

371
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:26,396
It happened so fast!

372
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,568
Besides, it's all your fault
for taking so much junk

373
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,837
food in the first place!

374
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,744
-Look, these were only available
for a limited time and only

375
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:33,846
in the Land of Tea.

376
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,787
Green tea pork-flavored
chips are super rare.

377
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,925
When a connoisseur of
snacks finds a limited offer

378
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,264
like this one, it would
be a crime for him

379
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,467
not to take as much as he can.

380
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,937
-(ANGRILY) And how
is that my problem?

381
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,374
-(ANGRILY) What did you say?

382
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,245
-(ANGRILY) You heard me!

383
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,949
[groaning]

384
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:51,823
-Shikamaru, you must
have had a rough time.

385
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,360
-Right back at you.

386
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,696
The way you're looking.

387
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,000
What the heck happened to you?

388
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:56,701
GUY: Huh?

389
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:57,737
What do you mean?

390
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,842
What's wrong with how I look?

391
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,715
INO: Here.

392
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:03,818
-Oh, that's right.

393
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,890
I haven't got time
to sit here and chat!

394
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:08,696
I've got to get
back to Lee's dojo!

395
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:09,999
(YELLING) Wait for me, Lee!

396
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:10,601
-Huh?

397
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:11,469
-Uh huh.

398
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:12,151
-Huh?

399
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,906
[screaming]

400
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,813
-(VOICEOVER) Sensei, you're
overdoing it on the getting

401
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:20,982
beaten up routine.

402
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:23,689
[screaming]

403
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,659
-Huh?

404
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,594
[crashing]

405
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:26,864
-Shall I finish him off?

406
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:27,464
-Hold it!

407
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:28,701
Time out!

408
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,574
-Hm?

409
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:32,811
[groaning]

410
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,746
NARUTO: Come on.

411
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,849
Fight him back a
little, will you?

412
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:35,851
-(VOICEOVER) Believe me.

413
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,923
I would if I could.

414
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:39,961
-If Lee doesn't find
this challenging enough,

415
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,002
he'll want more, and I might get
stuck being his next punching

416
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:43,970
bag.

417
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:45,507
-Well, actually--

418
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,610
NARUTO: Yeah?

419
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,347
-It's been one extreme
mission after another,

420
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,419
and I haven't had any sleep.

421
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,691
-Oh, well, that explains it.

422
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:56,468
-If I got a little rest, I
think I might recover, but--

423
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:57,703
-Uh?

424
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,443
-While I take my rest, won't
you please do me a favor

425
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,482
and act as his
opponent for a while?

426
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:03,885
[screaming]

427
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,892
-Come on!

428
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:07,894
-Huh?

429
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:08,897
Now what?

430
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,472
-I'm almost there, Lee!

431
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,476
-Was that Guy again?

432
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,281
-I could have sworn
he already came back.

433
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,792
-Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

434
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:21,861
-Huh?

435
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,632
To have withstood
such a fierce attack,

436
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,837
yet you are standing
there unharmed.

437
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,742
What a fighter!

438
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:31,049
The world is so vast, but
somehow an amazing challenger

439
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,452
found me.

440
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:34,591
For today's experience alone,
this dojo was worth it.

441
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:35,928
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
There's no way

442
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,534
I'll ever win if I just
use my taijutsu alone.

443
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:41,942
Luckily, I've got my
own style of fighting!

444
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,880
-Here I come!

445
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,751
-Shadow clone jutsu!

446
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,322
LEE (VOICEOVER): Of course!

447
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:50,930
A fighter of his caliber
would know ninjutsu.

448
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,935
Leaf hurricane!

449
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:57,546
The real one is right above me.

450
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,350
[yelling]

451
00:16:59,384 --> 00:16:59,818
Primary lotus!

452
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:04,830
Oh no!

453
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:05,531
Another clone!

454
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,909
-Fooled you!

455
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,579
Let's try this again!

456
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:14,419
-So, you will make more clones?

457
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,989
[laughing]

458
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,562
-Don't hurt me, Lee!

459
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:20,567
LEE: Sakura!

460
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,569
-It's me, Lee!

461
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,539
Be nice to me!

462
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,543
Take it easy!

463
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,083
-So-- so many Sakuras
all in one place!

464
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,853
Lucky day!

465
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:29,790
How moving!

466
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,460
I have never known
such happiness

467
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,632
before in my entire life!

468
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:34,473
-Snap out of it!

469
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,093
-Huh?

470
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:38,100
[yelling]

471
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,671
-We did it!

472
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,876
[groaning]

473
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:43,079
-I guess I forgot.

474
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,451
This is a fight against
a fierce challenger.

475
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:47,623
A clever ruse.

476
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:50,129
But I will not fall for
the same trick again.

477
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:51,833
Even though they may
look like Sakura,

478
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,540
they are really
just phony replicas.

479
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,112
-Lee, that was so mean.

480
00:17:57,112 --> 00:17:57,982
[bell ringing]

481
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,719
-This is ridiculous, Guy Sensei!

482
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,989
Come back!

483
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,594
-(VOICEOVER) For a
couple of spoiled brats,

484
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:06,568
they sure do fight at an
exceptionally high level.

485
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,139
This Hidden Leaf
Village-- I suppose

486
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:11,513
that the rumors that it had lost
its strength were just lies.

487
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:12,783
[lee yelling]

488
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,888
I need to do more snooping
around to get the real story.

489
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:18,029
[lee yelling]

490
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,900
This form has
become a challenge.

491
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:25,447
Unless I change, I fear it will
just cause more trouble for me.

492
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,783
That's much better.

493
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,791
Well then, time to shove off.

494
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,029
-Uh, hold it right there.

495
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:32,798
(VOICEOVER) What?

496
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,435
The real deal!

497
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,606
-I understand that
you are one, Rock Lee,

498
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,910
the master of this dojo.

499
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,716
-(VOICEOVER) Oh great, I guess
I'll have to play along with

500
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,985
this for a moment.

501
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,623
Yes, that is true.

502
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,797
I am indeed Rock Lee, and I
am the master of this dojo.

503
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,534
[laughing]

504
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,206
-Well, then, hello.

505
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,778
I challenge you for
the title of your dojo.

506
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:57,656
Rock Lee, I shall defeat you and
claim your marquee as my own.

507
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:58,458
-Huh?

508
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,463
-We begin.

509
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:05,175
[screaming]

510
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,716
[panting]

511
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,821
-You put up a good fight.

512
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:12,959
-Yeah, you did, too.

513
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:13,896
[crashing]

514
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,799
-Huh?

515
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,671
[groaning]

516
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:18,606
-Help me!

517
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,074
-What?

518
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,943
Bushy Brow?

519
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:20,578
-Me?

520
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:23,150
GUY: [inaudible]

521
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:23,785
[crashing]

522
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:24,988
[screaming]

523
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:25,723
-What?

524
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:27,127
Another dojo challenger?

525
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,630
NARUTO: Guy Sensei?

526
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:32,072
What the heck took you so long?

527
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,277
-Na-- Naruto?

528
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:35,246
I am confused.

529
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,783
What is going on?

530
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:39,121
GUY: If you can't defend
against this basis attack,

531
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,227
there's no use even
talking to you.

532
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,232
Your training is a
complete failure!

533
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:43,833
-Wait!

534
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,136
No!

535
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm not him!

536
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,678
-You don't deserve
your own dojo.

537
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:50,582
It's just way too soon.

538
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:52,119
Such naive thinking.

539
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:56,062
Well, I know how to fix that!

540
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:56,697
[crashing]

541
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:00,038
[screaming]

542
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:02,176
I hope you can forgive me, Lee.

543
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,948
It was tough love.

544
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:07,957
-The challenger's true identity
was actually Guy Sensei?

545
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,759
-What the?

546
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,764
You're the real Lee?

547
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,270
Then who did I just
punch through the wall?

548
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,251
-Never seen him before.

549
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,323
Who is he?

550
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,093
-Why me?

551
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,630
[groaning]

552
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,335
[knocking]

553
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,971
-Come in.

554
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,077
Oh, Guy.

555
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,947
You brought Naruto and Lee.

556
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,819
What perfect timing.

557
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,659
I was just about to call
you all into my office.

558
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:37,294
-Why?

559
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,764
Is something else going on?

560
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:41,336
-We just now received
an intelligence report.

561
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:43,108
-A ninja from the
Land of Valleys

562
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,883
named Nanafushi is rumored to
be spying on the Leaf Village.

563
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,053
-Huh?

564
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:50,158
-I'm concerned that he may
have already infiltrated

565
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:51,628
the village.

566
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:54,769
I want you to go search for
this Nanafushi immediately.

567
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:57,375
Capture him.

568
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,379
[gasping]

569
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:00,816
-That's the fella?

570
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,189
-Do you think you
know where he is?

571
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,124
-It's him!

572
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,969
-Oh.

573
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,241
-I have no idea what's
going on, but you

574
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,179
can call that mission complete.

575
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:14,148
[crashing]

576
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,652
GUY: Well then,
we'll be on our way.

577
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:16,353
TSUNADE: Hey!

578
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:17,422
Don't just leave
him on my floor!

579
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:18,124
SHIZUNE: Wait!

580
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:18,725
Guy!

581
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,929
Hold on!

582
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,766
TSUNADE: I demand
an explanation!

583
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,201
Guy!

584
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,102
Lee!

585
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:23,971
Hey!

586
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:24,657
Naruto!

587
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,359
[theme music]

588
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:02,839
[thunder]

589
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:06,381
TSUNADE: Past midnight
when the trees are asleep,

590
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:08,486
in the small hours
of the morning

591
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,830
when the forest is deathly
calm, a lonely signpost

592
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:15,368
tells of the
destruction of a clan.

593
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:18,910
Suddenly, a strike of
thunder and a heavy rain

594
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,482
begins to fall.

595
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,555
What could be the true
identity of the iron castle

596
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:25,594
that appeared out of nowhere?

597
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:30,204
Next time-- "The Mysterious
Curse of the Haunted Castle."
