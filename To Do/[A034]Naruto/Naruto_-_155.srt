[theme music]

2
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,087
KARASHI (VOICEOVER): Come on.

3
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,553
Come on.

4
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,520
Come on.

5
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,353
-It appears the villagers
have come out to welcome us.

6
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,820
-Everyone down there looks safe.

7
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,753
-Then I guess the
Kurosuke Family just

8
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,887
ran away with their
tails between their legs.

9
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,487
-Oh.

10
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,420
-Hey, guys!

11
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:31,687
[laughter]

12
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,253
-Perfect.

13
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:32,920
They're here.

14
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,320
-Naruto, don't come.

15
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,553
It's a trap.

16
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,920
-If you value your life,
you'll keep your mouth shut.

17
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:41,187
-Karashi, I thought
you had repented.

18
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,987
What are you doing?

19
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,120
-Come on.

20
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,053
Did you really expect
me to shamefully go back

21
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:48,020
to that curry shop?

22
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:48,820
Now's our chance.

23
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:00,620
-Huh?

24
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
[laughter]

25
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:18,853
-You see that?

26
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,220
Even without sir
Raiga's awesome might,

27
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:25,420
the Kurosuke
Family's everlasting.

28
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,187
NARUTO: Hey.

29
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,087
What are you looking for anyway?

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,187
-What do you think
we're looking for?

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,987
Those stinking brats.

32
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,420
-Are you referring to us?

33
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:36,353
-Hee-hee.

34
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,753
You crushed the wrong brats.

35
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:46,853
Those were just our Shadow
Clone and Transformation Jutsu.

36
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:47,520
-Take formation.

37
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,053
-Ninja Art.

38
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:52,720
Black Tornado!

39
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:00,420
-Huh?

40
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,620
Sorry, man.

41
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,320
Those guys were also
made with our jutsu.

42
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,287
-We saw right
through your ambush.

43
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,287
-Now it's my turn!

44
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,220
-Leaf Hurricane!

45
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,187
-Disperse!

46
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:37,153
-Byakugan!

47
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:48,620
Two palms!

48
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,120
Four palms!

49
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,120
Eight palms!

50
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:54,587
Sixteen palms!

51
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,587
Thirty-two palms!

52
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,587
Eight Trigrams Sixty-four Palms!

53
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,053
-Here it comes!

54
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,553
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

55
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,053
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

56
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:22,920
-The fights already over.

57
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:23,920
-Man, that hurt.

58
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:24,487
Huh?

59
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,353
What the heck?

60
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:26,320
That's no fair.

61
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,953
You could have
saved some for me!

62
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,487
And right when I
was finally gonna

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,053
get to try out my new jutsu!

64
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:37,820
What were you
thinking back there?

65
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,987
I mean, haven't you
learned your lesson by now?

66
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,287
-Well, Karashi?

67
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,420
What do you have to
say for yourself?

68
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:44,653
-It was just a joke.

69
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,587
-You think we'll believe
this is just a joke?

70
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,453
You have tormented
this whole village.

71
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:51,920
-But I didn't have
any other choice.

72
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,720
If I didn't do as
they told me, I

73
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:55,953
would have been killed
by the Kurosukes.

74
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,287
-Well, instead of
the Kurosukes, I'll

75
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,587
do the job with a
blow from my hammer!

76
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,153
-That's right.

77
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,153
-Come on!

78
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,153
-Give him here!

79
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,220
-I'm so sorry.

80
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:05,887
-Please, Lee.

81
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,153
Out of our way.

82
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:10,553
-You should strike me instead
until you're satisfied.

83
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:12,153
-Why would we punish you?

84
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:15,387
-At one time, Karashi was a
kind-hearted innocent young

85
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,753
man.

86
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:19,353
And I am partly responsible
for him joining a gang of thugs

87
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:20,520
like he did.

88
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:21,253
-Hm?

89
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,820
You're to blame?

90
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,620
-It was because of
my words he came

91
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,620
to think that power
is everything.

92
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:27,187
-Right.

93
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,387
That's what it.

94
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,987
Was I knew it was wrong,
but I had to do it anyway.

95
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,320
-Keep quiet Karashi.

96
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,520
-It is true.

97
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,720
Karashi was naive.

98
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:38,087
But even so, he
has a rare ability

99
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,020
to make life-saving curry.

100
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:42,353
Please let Karashi
atones for his sins.

101
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:44,287
Let him make curry!

102
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,453
And also, if Karashi
ever go astray again,

103
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,453
there will be consequences.

104
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:55,620
I swear I will punish
him with my two fists!

105
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,320
[gulp]

106
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,653
-Hey, listen up.

107
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,920
What does everybody think
about letting Lee and Grandma

108
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,320
Sancho handle this situation?

109
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:03,920
[murmuring]

110
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:04,620
-I don't know.

111
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,287
This is just so strange.

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,820
-Well, I suppose he was just
an underling of the Kurosuke

113
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:10,987
Family.

114
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,320
It's not like he attacked
our village himself.

115
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:17,020
Maybe it would be best to
have Rock Lee take Karashi

116
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:18,320
under his wing and see.

117
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:19,320
-Well, in that case.

118
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,120
-Thank you all very much.

119
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,087
-Uh-- yeah.

120
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,287
Thank you.

121
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,087
-And with that, our mission
is pretty much complete.

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,620
-No.

123
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:33,753
Not just yet.

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,220
NEJI: You all right?

125
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,953
-What does it matter if I'm
feeling all right or not?

126
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:02,053
I can't go on living
all alone like I am.

127
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:02,820
-Hey, come on.

128
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:03,920
Don't say that.

129
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,987
-Why don't we just leave
this weakling here?

130
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,520
Everyone ought to be able
to live by themselves.

131
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,753
But don't you need some
good friends in your life

132
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:12,387
who you can count on in a pinch?

133
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,820
-I'm talking about
the basics here.

134
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,753
I can't stand weak,
indecisive people.

135
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:21,287
-Since the day I was born,
I've always been frail.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,653
And for most of my
life, a shabby cabin

137
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,120
was my entire world.

138
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:33,587
I have no memory of my parents.

139
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,120
I survived only because the
villagers took pity on me

140
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,687
and brought me small amounts
of food from time to time.

141
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,353
But even as fragile as I
was, I had a special power

142
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,220
no one else did.

143
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,420
-Here you go.

144
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,253
Th-- thanks you.

145
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,387
You cut your leg with a scythe.

146
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,820
Is it better now?

147
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:19,487
-Wait.

148
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,353
How did you know that?

149
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,887
Did I tell you?

150
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
-No.

151
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:24,887
I just knew about it.

152
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,687
-But-- but how?

153
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,753
I'm the only one who's been
here to see you since yesterday.

154
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:33,887
I saw it happen to
you from where I sit.

155
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,687
-No.

156
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,553
He's cursed!

157
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:42,420
RANMARU: as time went
on, everyone feared me.

158
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:44,120
I could see what was
happening outside.

159
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,887
-Did you hear?

160
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,987
That Ranmaru boy can see
everything we're doing.

161
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,020
-You mean to tell me we're
being spied on every day?

162
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:55,987
-Get out of here!

163
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,953
-We don't want your kind here!

164
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:58,920
-Get out of my village!

165
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:01,287
-Monster!

166
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,053
RANMARU: From then on, I had no
more visitors bringing me food.

167
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,387
All I could do is wait to die.

168
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,420
If it weren't for Raiga,
I wouldn't be alive.

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,220
-His past is so tragic.

170
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:20,820
I had no idea.

171
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:21,320
-Yes.

172
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:24,253
I agree.

173
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,120
-Raiga took me out
beyond those walls,

174
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,053
showing me a world I had
never experienced before.

175
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,120
-Ranmaru, open your eyes.

176
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,753
Take a look at the
outside world where

177
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:46,520
we'll be living
from now on, yes?

178
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,020
-Yes.

179
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,887
If Raiga isn't here
to care for me,

180
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,353
it's the same as
losing my own body.

181
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,153
-I think I see.

182
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:01,887
Raiga was able to become one
of the famous Seven Swordsmen,

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,153
because he was able to
borrow power from Ranmaru.

184
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:08,920
-So the two of you helped each
other to survive, didn't you?

185
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:10,087
-Yeah.

186
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,687
-That's not true!

187
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,553
Raiga was using you, so he could
do all those terrible things!

188
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,353
-Yes.

189
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,953
He might have been using me.

190
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,420
It's possible.

191
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:24,520
But whether good or bad, either
way it doesn't matter to me.

192
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:27,620
Because I'm just a tool to
sense things out anyway.

193
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:29,053
-Well, if that's
what you believe,

194
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:32,720
then you're not
really alive, are you?

195
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,687
Look.

196
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,753
If you're gonna
survive on your own,

197
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,487
you're going to have
to give it your all.

198
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,420
And you could start by
eating the curry of life.

199
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,920
That's sure to cheer you up!

200
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:41,487
-Yes.

201
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,287
That is right.

202
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,253
It will surely nourish you.

203
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,320
-Wait a sec.

204
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:48,087
Won't spicy curry hurt his body?

205
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,220
-Naruto, you shouldn't
have any either.

206
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:52,587
-What are you talking about?

207
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,553
As a matter of fact, the
more I eat of that slop,

208
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,620
the more I feel rejuvenated!

209
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,020
-And it was that very
curry that saved my life.

210
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:00,853
It really works!

211
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,587
-Until the day you
can walk on your own,

212
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,787
I'm going to have to
be your body for you.

213
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,187
Well?

214
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,987
-All right.

215
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,987
But I have one favor to ask.

216
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,487
-Huh?

217
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:35,271
-Byakugan.

218
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:48,804
Nothing.

219
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,737
I sense no life in Raiga.

220
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:54,437
-Can you see down
there, Ranmaru?

221
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:54,937
-Yes.

222
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,671
-Is everything OK?

223
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,837
-Yeah.

224
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,637
-Let's go.

225
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:06,471
We're done here.

226
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:18,371
NARUTO: Hey!

227
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:23,871
-What?

228
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,871
-Is that?

229
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:26,837
[laughter]

230
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:30,171
-One and two, one and two.

231
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,737
-Hey, Grandma Sancho!

232
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,904
-Such a racket.

233
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,604
What's gotten into you?

234
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,971
You'll get dust into my curry.

235
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,137
-It's Lee and the others.

236
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,037
They've finally come back.

237
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:40,804
-Yeah.

238
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,704
And Karashi is with them.

239
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,937
-Well, that's no reason to
forget your manners, now is it?

240
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,237
-But, Grandma, you mean--
well, aren't you happy?

241
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:52,971
-One and two, one and two.

242
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:53,737
-Careful.

243
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:55,204
Your snot's gonna fall in!

244
00:14:58,037 --> 00:14:59,104
NARUTO: Grandma, Sancho.

245
00:14:59,137 --> 00:14:59,604
I'm back.

246
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,004
-And Karashi is here as well.

247
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,304
-Oh mother.

248
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,704
I'm so sorry.

249
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:15,671
Please forgive me.

250
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:18,337
-Please, pardon his
behavior, ma'am.

251
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,571
From now on he is a changed man.

252
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,104
He will devote
himself to taking over

253
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,437
the Curry of Life restaurant
if you will let him.

254
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,137
-First things first.

255
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,237
You've got to eat.

256
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,071
-Huh?

257
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:34,571
-Huh?

258
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:36,037
Oh wow!

259
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:37,004
That looks great.

260
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,937
If you're not gonna
eat it, I don't

261
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,604
mind taking it off your hands.

262
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:43,871
-Actually, I've prepared
a plate for everybody.

263
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:44,971
Well, look at him.

264
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:45,771
My.

265
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,937
What a piqued little child.

266
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,971
-Oh, yeah.

267
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:51,104
You mind fixing up
a plate for him too?

268
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,471
-Make it is as mild as possible.

269
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,537
-Actually, I'd like
mine to be mild as well.

270
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:57,437
-As you wish.

271
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,237
-Mother, thanks for the food.

272
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:12,171
-That's my 300% Special
Punishment Curry.

273
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:19,071
-Spicy.

274
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,537
So spicy.

275
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,504
But it's good.

276
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:25,971
So good, mama.

277
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:26,771
GRANDMA: Dig in.

278
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,271
I made enough for everyone.

279
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:33,771
-Phew.

280
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,171
It's OK.

281
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,171
She made it real mild.

282
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,204
Hey, by the way, when you
were traveling with Raiga,

283
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:49,071
you were with the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen, weren't you?

284
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:51,637
Did you ever meet
a guy named Zabuza?

285
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,237
-Uh-- Zabuza?

286
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:53,737
No.

287
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:54,237
I--

288
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,771
-Oh.

289
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,771
I've got it.

290
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,471
There was this one
with a huge sword

291
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:58,971
wrapped in some bandage thing.

292
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,037
And he had these fish eyes.

293
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:01,804
-Oh yeah.

294
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,237
You must mean Kisame.

295
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:03,737
-Yeah.

296
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:04,371
Right.

297
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:05,771
Kisame.

298
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:09,037
So, do you happen to know where
that guy is or what he's up to?

299
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,271
-Uh-uh.

300
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,904
I heard that he slipped
away from the Mist Village.

301
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:16,004
I know his face, but I don't
know anything more than that.

302
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:20,371
[sigh] Oh well.

303
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,937
You still haven't eaten.

304
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,571
You want me to ask our host
to make you something else?

305
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:25,304
-Uh-uh.

306
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,737
I don't need it.

307
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,637
I'm not really in the
mood to eat right now.

308
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,004
-Thanks you so
much for your help.

309
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:37,704
-Yeah.

310
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,404
You solved everything.

311
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:44,071
NARUTO: Go on home and make
your village great again!

312
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,504
For everyone!

313
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:49,404
-Neji, where's Lee?

314
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,404
-His mission still
isn't incomplete yet.

315
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,371
[footsteps]

316
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,837
-Please, wait Lee.

317
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,037
I'm gonna die.

318
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:07,137
-OK we will take a
short pause here.

319
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,571
So we can do 300 push-ups!

320
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:11,304
-What?

321
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:11,804
-One-two.

322
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:12,304
One-two.

323
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:12,971
One-two.

324
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:13,471
One-two.

325
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:14,171
One-two.

326
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:14,704
One-two.

327
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:15,204
One-two.

328
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:15,771
One-two.

329
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,271
One-two.

330
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,104
One-two.

331
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,937
One-two.

332
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,437
One-two.

333
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:18,937
One-two.

334
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:19,437
One-two.

335
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,004
One-two.

336
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:20,537
One-two.

337
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:21,504
One-two.

338
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:24,871
300.

339
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:25,937
This is bad.

340
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,937
There's going to be
a storm very soon.

341
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,771
-We'll be ready even if
a huge storm blows in.

342
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,771
With these logs we'll
form a protective barrier

343
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,904
around the shop.

344
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:39,904
-Thank you all.

345
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:41,537
You didn't have to.

346
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:42,437
-No, ma'am.

347
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,771
We owe you for your curry.

348
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,137
-Mhm!

349
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,237
-Oh my word.

350
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:50,837
Compared to you, my
Karashi is so idle.

351
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:52,137
-Hey, Tenten.

352
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:55,737
I'm worried about Karashi and
Ranmaru alone at the shop.

353
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,004
We're fine here.

354
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,937
Why don't you go back
and check on them.

355
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:03,271
-Karashi?

356
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:15,437
-Do you mean the boss
is really still alive?

357
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,671
-He is.

358
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:20,004
That Neji person didn't
seem to sense it back there.

359
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:21,704
But I could pick
up signs of life.

360
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,998
-Wow.

361
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,204
-Raiga.

362
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:57,471
Raiga, you meant
everything to me.

363
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:59,737
I was just waiting to
die, but you told me

364
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:00,804
we could survive together.

365
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,537
For me, Raiga, being
together with you

366
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:21,937
was the only time I lived.

367
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,304
Don't be gone.

368
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:26,437
No matter what, I can't
hold a funeral for you.

369
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,004
I won't let you
perish like this,

370
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,037
even if I have to
give you my life.

371
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:43,904
-Ranmaru!

372
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,104
Are you still with me, Ranmaru?

373
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:50,671
Come on.

374
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:51,171
Say something.

375
00:20:54,337 --> 00:21:04,371
[groaning]

376
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:09,671
[groaning]

377
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:10,171
-Karashi?

378
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:24,678
[laughter]

379
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:35,647
[theme music]

380
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,214
NARUTO: What?

381
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:04,747
Tenten fell of a cliff?

382
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,447
Oh man.

383
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,580
We gotta go save her!

384
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:07,480
LEE: Please, Naruto.

385
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:08,480
Calm down.

386
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,347
NEJI: Tenten wouldn't
be that clumsy.

387
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,414
NARUTO: Huh?

388
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,014
But that's what Karashi
told us happened.

389
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:14,647
LEE: Unfortunately,
this whole thing

390
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,180
might be some kind of trap.

391
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:16,680
NARUTO: Wha?

392
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:17,614
A trap?

393
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,547
NEJI: Karashi.

394
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,147
NARUTO: Hold on a second.

395
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,514
I thought those guys
were annihilated!

396
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:26,880
Next time-- Raiga's
Counterattack!
