[theme music]

2
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,029
-Blew them to bits.

3
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:17,662
Blew them to bits
and now they're gone.

4
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,162
And I'm not sad in the least.

5
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,462
I can't hold a funeral
feeling like this.

6
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,196
RANMARU: The four of
them are still alive.

7
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,529
-Impossible.

8
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,562
Not after my Lightning
Fang hit them.

9
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,929
Sorry.

10
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:40,962
If you say they're alive, there
can't be any doubt about it.

11
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,462
RANMARU: One of
them is troublesome.

12
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:49,996
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
The enemy was close,

13
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:54,229
but I couldn't see anything.

14
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,862
It's strange.

15
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:58,329
I know this is the
Hidden Mist Jutsu,

16
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:02,829
but my Byakugan should
be able to penetrate it.

17
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,996
-Byakugan.

18
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:08,329
There's no question this time.

19
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:11,896
I can see them, a pair, 52
degrees to the southwest.

20
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,362
12 degrees southeast,
another three.

21
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:24,296
Eight degrees to
the southeast, one.

22
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,129
And 24 degrees to
the northwest, 11.

23
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,896
-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

24
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:40,096
Let's hit it.

25
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,062
-Leaf [inaudible].

26
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:47,562
-Impossible.

27
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:53,562
Why?

28
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:05,029
-Na-- ru-- to-- Uzumaki Barrage!

29
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,796
I never miss with that attack.

30
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,129
ROCK: Somebody help me, please?

31
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,962
-Huh?

32
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,129
Bushy Brow?

33
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,362
-The-- the enemy
has disappeared.

34
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,762
NEJI (VOICEOVER): It can't be.

35
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,062
Chakra networks running
through illusions?

36
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,162
RANMARU: One is
halfway up the cliff.

37
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,096
Another's at the base.

38
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,196
There's one to the right,
and one to the left.

39
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,329
-We can't hold a funeral,
but I'll take care of them

40
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,229
without leaving
any trace at least.

41
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,829
Thunder Funeral.

42
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:54,929
Feast of Lightning.

43
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,129
[screaming]

44
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:13,729
-Warmed over corpses.

45
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:22,296
We're strong, you and I. No,
it's really you, Ranmaru.

46
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,962
You're the strong one,
and when I'm with you,

47
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,262
your strength is mine.

48
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,829
RANMARU: Wait, they
aren't dead yet.

49
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,696
They're just unconscious.

50
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,262
-Stubborn lot, aren't they?

51
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:37,162
All right then, if
grilling them won't work,

52
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,196
I'll just dice them up.

53
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,462
[giggling]

54
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:43,829
-I'll grind their flesh
and bones into dust.

55
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,529
[groaning]

56
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:48,429
-Huh?

57
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:50,062
Ranmaru, are you all right?

58
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:58,362
Hang in there, Ranmaru.

59
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,929
Ranmaru!

60
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,329
RANMARU: I'm OK.

61
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:08,929
Raiga, this one is
still unconscious.

62
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:09,862
-What did you say?

63
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,496
Impressive.

64
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,262
RANMARU: He's fighting
solely by muscle memory.

65
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,629
RAIGA: Not a bad face.

66
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,929
It's burning into my heart.

67
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,829
Maybe I'll give him
a funeral after all.

68
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:28,262
It will bring tears to
my eyes, I'm sure of it.

69
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,229
RANMARU: On your right.

70
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,629
-What's with this guy?

71
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:36,129
RANMARU: It's hard to read his
movements, but for your sake,

72
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,829
I'll do my best.

73
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,462
-We act together.

74
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,929
RANMARU: Left, right,
head on, jump now.

75
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:50,529
-You will die.

76
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:51,562
What?

77
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,396
RANMARU: How can he
posses such skill?

78
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,329
-Bushy Brow's in trouble.

79
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:19,296
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I don't get it.

80
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,296
Is he still unconscious?

81
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,296
-You guys, where are you?

82
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,729
RANMARU: Raiga, shift position.

83
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,729
-That voice, where
is it coming from?

84
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,229
RANMARU: Raiga!

85
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,229
-Ranmaru!

86
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:45,729
-What?

87
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,229
-Neji.

88
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:51,162
-Ranmaru, get off.

89
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,929
-That is so bizarre.

90
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,829
I was just dreaming
that I was in battle.

91
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,796
Ah!

92
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:58,296
-Ranmaru?

93
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,162
You little--

94
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,529
-All right, pal.

95
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:12,796
Now you're dealing with me.

96
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:14,062
-Naruto.

97
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,262
-You filthy little brat.

98
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,396
-Hey, I've got something
I want to ask you.

99
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,996
Word is you're one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen from the Hidden

100
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,496
Mist.

101
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,096
-So what if I was?

102
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,429
-You know Zabuza, right?

103
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,062
And a big guy by
the name of Kisame?

104
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,896
-Look, I have nothing but
loathing for those two.

105
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,462
You'll have to forgive me if
I don't feel like reminiscing.

106
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:47,096
And I'm not too hot on you!

107
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,496
-Well then, I'll just have to
beat the answers out of you!

108
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,596
-A clone?

109
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,662
-What's wrong?

110
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,696
Losing your edge already?

111
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:03,496
-Wh-- what the?

112
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,262
-Lightning Ball!

113
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,129
-You lousy--

114
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:18,396
-Well, you're tougher
than you look.

115
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,862
Lightning Ball!

116
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,862
[screaming]

117
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,412
-Mm.

118
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,979
-Seconds, ple-- hm?

119
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,179
[thunder]

120
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,445
-Grandma Sansho?

121
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,945
-Is anything the matter?

122
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,512
-Look yonder.

123
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,712
That's a nasty bit of lightning.

124
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,579
It was flashing
just as ominously

125
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:05,012
the day Karashi left to find
his fortune in the village.

126
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,545
Oh, gracious me.

127
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,279
That light is like poison.

128
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:14,845
-No, Naruto.

129
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:20,979
-Huh?

130
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,045
-Sorry, buddy.

131
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,779
It's going to take
more than that.

132
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,845
-I'm not even going to
remember that smile.

133
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,812
Now die.

134
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:35,779
[screaming]

135
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:39,679
-Ranmaru?

136
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:42,512
Where are you?

137
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:46,112
-So what do you
think is in this bag?

138
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,212
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Byakugan!

139
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:55,579
-There's someone in there.

140
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,279
Could it be?

141
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,745
So this dust, it was hiding
the chakra network then?

142
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,879
And it's creating
chakra networks as well.

143
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:33,112
NEJI: Naruto, use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

144
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,979
-But my clones were
useless before.

145
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,012
NEJI: Don't worry.

146
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,512
His eyes are over
here at the moment.

147
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:45,745
-Ranmaru, I'll be right over,
soon as I finish up here.

148
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:46,879
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

149
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:54,479
Bring it on, chump.

150
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,645
-Lightning Ball!

151
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,245
-Your aim is terrible.

152
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,379
You just get lucky before?

153
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,279
-Laugh it up, kid.

154
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,012
I'll just take all of you out.

155
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:08,479
-Let's go, pal.

156
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,445
[shouting]

157
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,445
-Oh, please.

158
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:17,879
RAIGA (VOICEOVER): At this
rate, my chakra-- the mist.

159
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,879
The Hidden Mist
Jutsu is fading away.

160
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,312
Better finish this.

161
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,279
-Got it.

162
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:31,512
You're not going anywhere.

163
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,712
You can run--

164
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,179
RAIGA (VOICEOVER): Ninja
Art Boulder Avalanche.

165
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,045
-Naruto.

166
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,979
[gasp]

167
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,445
-I have to help.

168
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,479
-Ha, did you see that?

169
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,312
NARUTO: Yeah, I saw it.

170
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:01,979
-Huh?

171
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,179
-Hope you're ready, pal!

172
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:04,779
RANMARU: Stop!

173
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,679
-Too late now!

174
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:13,645
[screaming]

175
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:23,379
-Yikes, I guess that takes
care of that then, huh?

176
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:26,879
So, Raiga's eyes are
inside that thing?

177
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,279
Hm.

178
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,379
They must be some
pretty big eyeballs.

179
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:31,479
-Huh?

180
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,779
-You idiot, it's a person.

181
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,579
-Huh?

182
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,879
-So wait a moment, when I
was sleepwalking before then,

183
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,379
was it you I fought?

184
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,745
-No, it wasn't.

185
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,212
It was Raiga and I together.

186
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,879
-Together?

187
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,745
-Always, ever since he found me.

188
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,079
[screaming]

189
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,812
[smashing on door]

190
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:30,012
-No use feigning sleep.

191
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:34,279
The hour of your
death has arrived.

192
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,179
Don't move.

193
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:40,479
The Hidden Mist was infiltrated
by spies from this village.

194
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,845
We've come to smoke
them out and kill them.

195
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,179
Problem is we're not having
any luck finding our targets,

196
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:51,112
so I've just been
killing people at random.

197
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,079
[moan]

198
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,045
-What's that?

199
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,579
Speak up.

200
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,945
[cough]

201
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:03,912
-It's all right if you are
the one taking my life.

202
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,312
-Huh?

203
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:06,779
Me?

204
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,045
What do you mean?

205
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:12,062
-I saw you, always crying.

206
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,162
-What?

207
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,528
Me, cry?

208
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:18,795
Deep within your
heart, as you searched

209
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,528
for meaning in your life.

210
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,995
[gasp]

211
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:27,128
RANMARU: You see, I've
been watching you.

212
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:28,462
-What are you?

213
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,295
How could you--

214
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,795
RANMARU: I'm the same as you.

215
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:36,362
Living is painful.

216
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,595
I long to understand
the meaning of my life.

217
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,762
My illness forces me indoors.

218
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:46,295
Shunned by everyone, all I can
do is peer out at the world

219
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,095
from under this blanket.

220
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:52,695
But if in my death, you're
able to glean some meaning

221
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:58,928
behind this thing we
call living, well, then

222
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,428
who am I to stop you?

223
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,362
Go ahead.

224
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,762
RAIGA: You're alone then?

225
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:13,128
-Mm.

226
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,928
-Come.

227
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:23,495
From here on out, you
and I shall be as one.

228
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,895
RANMARU (VOICEOVER):
That was the day

229
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,362
I became Raiga's eyes and ears.

230
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,795
And Raiga became
my hands and feet.

231
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,528
The outside world
that we dashed into

232
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,695
was filled with
things that I saw

233
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:54,795
and heard for the
first time in my life.

234
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:56,628
It was so much fun.

235
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:08,995
Wherever and whenever I was with
Raiga, nothing else mattered.

236
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,995
We were never apart.

237
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:41,662
We were trying to find
the meaning in our lives

238
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,462
by living for each other.

239
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,528
We were convinced we
had found the answer.

240
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:02,562
That's why if Raiga is gone,
I have no reason to live.

241
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,995
Without him, I have no
purpose in this world,

242
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,195
no cause to exist.

243
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:14,495
-Is there someone
who's precious to you?

244
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,962
There is only one person
who matters to me.

245
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,428
And I live to protect
and serve him.

246
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:23,862
That is my purpose.

247
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:28,295
To show mercy to those who
oppose the one you serve,

248
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:32,095
to allow his enemies to live
when you go could strike them

249
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:35,795
down-- this is not compassion.

250
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:39,095
It is a betrayal of your
life's very purpose.

251
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,362
For what reason
do you exist then?

252
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,962
You're of use to no one.

253
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,528
Your life has no meaning.

254
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,962
It is mere existence.

255
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,095
Day after day of pain and
struggle signifying nothing.

256
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:53,862
-Yeah?

257
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,295
Well, speak for yourself.

258
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:57,228
-Are you really that
blind, little one?

259
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,828
I am speaking of myself.

260
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:04,295
This day has shown that I am
no longer of any use to Zabuza.

261
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:07,228
-There's no need for me
to be here any longer.

262
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,228
-Look, don't be ridiculous.

263
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:14,728
You can't talk like that.

264
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,195
-Naruto, kill me.

265
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,195
I'm begging you.

266
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,662
Just put and end to it.

267
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,162
-Huh?

268
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,695
-What are you waiting for?

269
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,228
Go on.

270
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,262
Do it.

271
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,062
Quickly.

272
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:30,995
-Go on.

273
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,195
Why do you hesitate?

274
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,962
My arms and legs are crippled.

275
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,995
I'm powerless to resist you.

276
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:43,795
You have a mission to
carry out, don't you?

277
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,928
Well, hurry up and finish it.

278
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:54,128
-The mission entrusted to us
was to drive the Kurosuke family

279
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:55,328
out of here.

280
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,095
And with Raiga out of
the way now, he no longer

281
00:19:58,128 --> 00:19:59,695
poses a threat to the village.

282
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:00,195
-Mm.

283
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:06,362
-The question at hand is what
to do about the Kurosuke family

284
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,928
now that they have
no leadership.

285
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,995
Take the head off
of a beast, and it's

286
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,662
hard to predict what it will do.

287
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,762
Once that's done, the
mission will be completed.

288
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:27,062
-Hm, but, uh, what are we
supposed to do about him?

289
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,395
-Do you really think he is
dangerous enough to tie up?

290
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,495
-No, I don't believe so.

291
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:45,262
-But dangerous to
myself though, maybe.

292
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:48,728
-Once our mission is over,
we'll come back for you, OK?

293
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,728
-A chakra sealing tag as well?

294
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,562
-Look, we don't
have a choice, Lee.

295
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,562
He's still our enemy, isn't he?

296
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,095
-We have to assume that he
still possesses other jutsu just

297
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,869
to be safe.

298
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,723
[theme music]

299
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,889
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Rokusuke and the others

300
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,123
have their village back.

301
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:05,589
Looks like the
mission's complete.

302
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:07,056
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Tell that to Lee.

303
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,323
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Oh yeah, that's right.

304
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:10,423
Lee said he was going to
beat some sense into Karashi,

305
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,656
didn't he?

306
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,089
TEN TEN (VOICEOVER): I
wonder if it'll be that easy.

307
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,623
LEE (VOICEOVER): This
could be troublesome.

308
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:15,589
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What?

309
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,723
I don't want to
hear that from you.

310
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,523
LEE (VOICEOVER): No, I
did not mean Karashi.

311
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,789
I was speaking of this weather.

312
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:23,656
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time--
The Dark Creeping Clouds.

313
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:24,923
NEJI (VOICEOVER): I see.

314
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:27,523
A storm is coming.
