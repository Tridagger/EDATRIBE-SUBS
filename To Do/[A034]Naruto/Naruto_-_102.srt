[theme music]

2
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,042
-All right.

3
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,008
We're almost at the
Leaf village now.

4
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:01,875
Is everyone here?

5
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,642
-Yes sir.

6
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,308
-Hey, wait a minute.

7
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,942
One of us isn't.

8
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:09,908
-Hm?

9
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,808
-Who's missing?

10
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:13,908
-Who do you think?

11
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:16,175
It's Idate.

12
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,875
-That kid's getting to
be a pain in the neck.

13
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,108
-What now?

14
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,208
Do we wait?

15
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,508
-Don't have much choice, do we?

16
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,675
Huh?

17
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,575
What in the world?

18
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:31,142
-You're from the Wasabi family
of the Land of Tea, right?

19
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,775
-Who the heck wants to know?

20
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:39,308
-One thing you
should know up front.

21
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,375
A bunch of clodhoppers like
you are no match for a ninja.

22
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:00,742
No need to worry.

23
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,875
I'll let you live this time.

24
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,542
But if you're smart, you'll
forget all about the race

25
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,642
at the Great Todoroki Shrine.

26
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:12,742
[groaning]

27
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,708
-He's gone.

28
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,008
Got to get to the village and
at least deliver this message.

29
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,308
-OK, let's do it!

30
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,942
Whatever the mission is,
I'm psyched and ready to go!

31
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,442
-Hmph.

32
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,375
-Hm?

33
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:49,208
-But where's Kakashi-sensei?

34
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,075
-Man, some teacher.

35
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,742
He's always the last one here.

36
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,708
TSUNADE: Kakashi
won't be here at all.

37
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:54,742
-Huh?

38
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,208
-Grandma Tsunade.

39
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,242
What's up?

40
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:00,675
-Stop calling me that, will you?

41
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,608
-Uh, Lady Hokage.

42
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,775
What's this about
Kakashi-sensei not coming?

43
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,175
-You know our forces
are stretched thin.

44
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,742
All of our Jonin are already
busy on other missions,

45
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,875
including Kakashi.

46
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:18,875
You three will just have to
handle this one on your own.

47
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,175
It's a B rank escort mission.

48
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,708
Someone important.

49
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,242
-Important?

50
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,475
Really?

51
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,942
-Of course, it could develop
into an A rank mission

52
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,075
if you run into trouble.

53
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,008
-So, who do we escort?

54
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,242
-I don't know.

55
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,075
-Hold on.

56
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,642
What do you mean you don't know?

57
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,908
-Every four years, our
neighbor, the Land of Tea,

58
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:44,442
holds a dedication ceremony
at the Great Todoroki Shrine,

59
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,675
and each time we're asked
to escort a runner who

60
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,775
will participate in the race
that's part of the ceremonies.

61
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,208
This year, the messengers
who were bringing the request

62
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:57,175
were attacked before
they could get here.

63
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,608
-Who attacked them?

64
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:02,442
-I'm sorry, but I'm still not
following this story very well.

65
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,242
-Well, don't worry
about that now.

66
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,808
When you meet Boss
Jirocho, he'll

67
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,342
fill you in on everything.

68
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,708
-When we meet Boss Jirocho?

69
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,508
Ah!

70
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,708
That gambler guy we met.

71
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,242
-That's everything I know.

72
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,508
Now, no wasting time.

73
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,175
They're expecting you
in the Land of Tea

74
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,608
by the end of the
day, so get moving.

75
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:20,108
-Got it.

76
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:20,675
-Right.

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,675
-Don't worry.

78
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,775
You can count on us!

79
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,042
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):I hope so.

80
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,808
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Misson!

81
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:32,308
Help an Old Friend
in the Land of Tea!

82
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,675
Hey, Sakura.

83
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,342
you hungry at all?

84
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,542
-A little bit, maybe.

85
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,042
-Hey!

86
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:46,975
Good idea!

87
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:47,808
Lunch break!

88
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:48,942
And look, what a coincidence.

89
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:52,475
There just happens to be
a tea house right there.

90
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:53,408
-Wait, Naruto!

91
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,775
-So you're back.

92
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:07,142
-Aoi Rokusho at your service.

93
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,175
-Seems we wasted your
time and trouble.

94
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,142
That fool Jirocho doesn't
know when to give up.

95
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:17,275
-The Wasabi family still intends
to take part in the race?

96
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,842
-Exactly.

97
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,842
What's more, they've even
hired ninja bodyguards

98
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,275
to protect their runner.

99
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,275
-Well then.

100
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,375
If we can't scare
them off, we'll

101
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,575
just have to destroy
them at the race itself.

102
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,308
-What will you be having?

103
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:37,808
-Some sweet bean soup!

104
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:39,808
-I'll have the
dumplings, please.

105
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:41,642
And you, Sasuke?

106
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:43,008
-Just rice.

107
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:43,775
Very good.

108
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:44,742
I'll be back in a moment.

109
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,808
-Leaf village ninja.

110
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:56,175
-I just hope we get
some fighting in!

111
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,208
-Don't you dare go
making trouble, Naruto.

112
00:06:58,242 --> 00:06:59,542
Not this time.

113
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:00,642
NARUTO: I won't.

114
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,975
-Just sitting
around in the shade,

115
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,875
sucking down sweet bean soup.

116
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,875
A ninja's life is pretty cushy.

117
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:09,975
-What'd you say?

118
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:12,942
-I guess you don't get much
action in the Leaf village,

119
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,642
judging by how out
of shape you look.

120
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:17,508
-That does it!

121
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,708
-Hey.

122
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,008
Where'd you come from, sweetie?

123
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,675
I didn't see you sitting here.

124
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,242
I didn't mean you, of course.

125
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,075
-Thank you.

126
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:25,942
-Hello there.

127
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,675
I'm Idate Morino.

128
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,408
So, uh, what do they call you?

129
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,275
-You gonna punch him
in the nose, Sakura,

130
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,175
or do you want me to?

131
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,942
-Sakura, huh?

132
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,908
That's a beautiful name.

133
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:36,875
Well then.

134
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:38,908
Since fate has
brought us together,

135
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:42,608
isn't it time we talked
about our future?

136
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,508
-I'm not sure
that-- What future?

137
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,508
-Oh, you know,
the part where you

138
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:51,375
give up this ridiculous ninja
business and run away with me.

139
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:52,675
-Hey!

140
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,408
Quit hitting on her or I'm
gonna start hitting on you!

141
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,775
-Don't worry.

142
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,875
I was just kidding around.

143
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:01,175
But the rest of
it, that's no joke.

144
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,942
If there's one thing I
can't stand, it's a ninja.

145
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,708
You better go on back
where you came from,

146
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:06,708
or there'll be trouble.

147
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:07,575
I'm warning you.

148
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:08,142
-Yeah?

149
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:09,008
Well why wait?

150
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,275
Bring it on, tough guy!

151
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,508
-Calm down, Naruto.

152
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,842
-She's right.

153
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,042
Just ignore the punk.

154
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,408
We don't have the time.

155
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:21,742
-Get our of here, Sasuke!

156
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,942
After what this guy said,
don't you have any ninja pride?

157
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,308
You can ignore it if you want.

158
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,308
I'm gonna flatten it!

159
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:28,875
Huh?

160
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,542
-He disappeared.

161
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:31,842
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No way.

162
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,708
How did I miss that?

163
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:34,675
-Gah!

164
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,808
I hate that.

165
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:37,408
He gets in his little
dig and then runs away!

166
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,208
-Here you go.

167
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,175
Thank you for waiting.

168
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,408
-Ah phooey.

169
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:45,042
-I'll take these
whenever you're ready.

170
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,342
-Huh?

171
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,108
What's this?

172
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,542
Why two bills?

173
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,908
-Yours and your young
friend that just left.

174
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,242
He said you'd be paying for him.

175
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,542
-I knew it.

176
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,742
I know I should've flattened
him when I had the chance!

177
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:00,008
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): His
footsteps are already faint.

178
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,308
That kid's quick.

179
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,575
-That's it!

180
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,642
He's crossed the line,
making fools of us!

181
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:08,508
I'm gonna catch
that stupid jerk!

182
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,308
-We've gotta go, ma'am, thanks.

183
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,175
I've left the
money on the table!

184
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,242
-Come again.

185
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,775
These young people today.

186
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,942
Always in such a hurry.

187
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,942
-I don't know what this
kid's training has been,

188
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:22,508
but he's incredibly fast.

189
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,875
-Who could he be?

190
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:24,875
-Who cares?

191
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:29,175
He's toast when I
catch up with him.

192
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,242
-Ha.

193
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,808
Before they can
even get started,

194
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,475
I'm gonna be miles away.

195
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:51,342
All the speed in the
world won't help me

196
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,708
if I don't watch
where I'm going.

197
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,642
NARUTO: Ha!

198
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,408
Serves you right.

199
00:09:59,442 --> 00:09:59,908
-Huh?

200
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,542
-You've got a lot of nerve.

201
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,442
Did you think you'd
get away with it?

202
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:10,175
-I'm sorry!

203
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,108
NARUTO: Huh?

204
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,875
-I couldn't pay the bill.

205
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,008
All my money had been stolen.

206
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:16,708
And then you guys came.

207
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:21,408
I shouldn't have done it, but
I didn't know what else to do.

208
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:22,408
-Oh, you're kidding?

209
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,842
All of your money?

210
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,275
-Well, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

211
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,708
Huh?

212
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:29,675
-Huh?

213
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,175
-What's this thing?

214
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,075
-Hands off!

215
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:38,542
This belongs to me.

216
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:41,742
-What are you doing?

217
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,242
-On your mark--

218
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,608
-Huh?

219
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,975
-Get set.

220
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:47,308
Go!

221
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:47,875
-Huh?

222
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,342
Leg weights?

223
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,575
-Give it up, idiots!

224
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,808
You'll never catch me!

225
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:53,608
-There!

226
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:54,742
He's off and running again!

227
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,608
-We'll see about that!

228
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,408
-This kid's asking for it.

229
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:03,742
-Is this guy for real?

230
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,075
-I told you he's fast.

231
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:08,875
-What's goin' on?

232
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,742
He's getting further
away every second.

233
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,542
-There's just no way.

234
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,475
We'll never catch him.

235
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,508
He's out of our league.

236
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,775
-OK.

237
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,508
But if I ever see that
stupid jerk again, watch out.

238
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,549
-Welcome, and thank
you all for coming.

239
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,449
-I bid you greetings and
offer you my services.

240
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,316
I have come from
the Village Hidden

241
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:43,083
in the Leaves, which is
also the place of my birth.

242
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,616
I was raised on
ramen and hard work,

243
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,883
and given the family
name of Uzumaki.

244
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,283
But I'm known to everyone--

245
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:50,316
-As the knucklehead.

246
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:52,649
-As the knucklehead!

247
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:55,516
Very funny!

248
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,549
-You haven't changed
at all, I see.

249
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,049
-Yeah, well you haven't
changed much either, big guy.

250
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,149
-Watch it, Naruto.

251
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,983
[laughter]

252
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,049
-No, it's all right.

253
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,616
The boy has spirit.

254
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,216
I like that.

255
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,083
Now that we're done with
the greetings, maybe

256
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,849
we should get down to it.

257
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:13,483
The Fifth Hokage
told us you would

258
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:17,516
explain what you want us to do.

259
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,049
-All right, then.

260
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,249
You know about the
dedication ceremonies held

261
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:26,783
at the great Todoroki Shrine
every four years, don't you?

262
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,816
-Oh, well, uh-- not really.

263
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,349
-Go on.

264
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:30,783
Have a seat.

265
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,583
It all started long ago.

266
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,683
The legend goes that
in ancient times,

267
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:43,116
there came a terrible storm.

268
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,983
In desperation, the people
dedicated the Ryuko jewels

269
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,616
to the great Todoroki Shrine.

270
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,383
It worked.

271
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,883
The storm subsided,
and now the ceremony's

272
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,616
repeated every four years.

273
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,449
At first it was just a
re-dedication of the jewels.

274
00:12:57,483 --> 00:13:00,483
Then it became a
festival, and a race,

275
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:04,883
with the winner of the race
being hailed as a great hero.

276
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,083
But, in recent years, what
once was a friendly race

277
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:11,183
has taken on a more
troubling aspect.

278
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,216
For generations,
Port Degarashi has

279
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:16,016
been divided between two
families-- the Wasabi

280
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:21,683
and the Wagarashi, two rival
gambling organizations.

281
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:24,016
Both families wanted
control of the town,

282
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,083
which naturally led to disputes.

283
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:28,516
These disputes became
increasingly violent,

284
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,983
sometimes resulting
in all out battles.

285
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,949
The rest of the townspeople
were caught in a crossfire.

286
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:36,149
Many were injured, or worse.

287
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,083
Finally, in an effort to
end the cycle of violence,

288
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:44,083
our district leader
called on both sides

289
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,349
to get together and
come to an agreement.

290
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,449
Henceforth, control
of the town would

291
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:54,516
be decided not by street
brawls, but by a competition.

292
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,183
-What sort of
competition, exactly?

293
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,616
-The race run every four years
at the great Todoroki Shrine

294
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:01,683
dedication ceremony.

295
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:06,749
Four years ago the
Wadarashi beat us soundly

296
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,116
by hiring a ninja,
and we found out

297
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,416
they've done the
same thing this year.

298
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,383
That's why we sent messengers
to you, seeking your help.

299
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,216
It was our way of leveling
the playing field.

300
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,949
But before they could reach the
village, they were attacked.

301
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:21,449
Ambushed.

302
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:35,449
I beg you, please lend
our family your strength.

303
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,483
If we lose again, it
means the Wagarashi

304
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:41,716
will control this town
for four more years.

305
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:42,583
-Not going to happen.

306
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,149
I'm on the job.

307
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,116
-So who are we supposed
to escort, anyway?

308
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:47,916
-Excellent.

309
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,149
That means you'll take the job.

310
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:53,783
-Yes, boss?

311
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,316
You wanted me?

312
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:57,249
Huh?

313
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:58,449
-Huh?

314
00:14:58,483 --> 00:14:59,783
-Huh?

315
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,483
[groan]

316
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,516
-So you already know each other.

317
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:06,749
That makes everything easier.

318
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,116
-I wouldn't be so sure.

319
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:18,183
-Boss Jirocho is a
big man around here.

320
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,083
He shouldn't have
to bow and scrape

321
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,649
to a bunch of shinobi wannabes.

322
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:23,449
-He can bow and
scrape all he wants.

323
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:26,416
There's no way I'm gonna escort
a lousy cheapskate like you

324
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,716
anywhere, anyway.

325
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:28,649
-Fine.

326
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,116
Believe me, if I
wanted an escort,

327
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,983
it certainly wouldn't
be some snot-nosed run

328
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,349
who barely comes
up to my kneecaps.

329
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,416
-Whoa, who you calling a
runt, you ignorant hick?

330
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,816
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

331
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:38,883
I'm a ninja.

332
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,149
Not only that, I'm
gonna be Hokage someday.

333
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:41,649
-Ha.

334
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:42,749
Hokage.

335
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:43,783
Big deal.

336
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:44,983
-It's a lot better
than being the boss

337
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,016
of a bunch of crooked gamblers!

338
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,083
-Hey, squirt, my boss is a great
leader, so watch what you say!

339
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,216
-He's a great leader, huh?

340
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,683
Would he sacrifice his
life for his village

341
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:54,583
like the Hokage would?

342
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,516
That's a leader!

343
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:56,616
-Are you kidding me?

344
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,849
He'd sacrifice his life,
his heart, his soul,

345
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,483
and the souls of his children's
children for all eternity!

346
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:02,616
-That's nothing!

347
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,383
The Hokage would do all
of that stuff and more,

348
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,816
and do it twice a day!

349
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,716
-You'd think this
was a tourist resort.

350
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,883
These prices are outrageous.

351
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,716
-I know what you're thinking.

352
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,983
Too expensive?

353
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,283
-Oh, no--

354
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:30,116
-Believe me, I don't like
having to charge that much.

355
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,283
But the Wagarashi
family sets the price.

356
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,283
[crashing]

357
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:35,083
-I'm sorry.

358
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:35,916
I'm sorry!

359
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:36,983
-What's wrong with you?

360
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,483
When we want
something, we take it.

361
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:39,516
You got it?

362
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,349
You wouldn't even
be in business if it

363
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,416
weren't for the Wagarashi.

364
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,616
-I know, I know!

365
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,449
It's just, to take it
without paying me for it--

366
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,816
-You're really not
getting this, are you?

367
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:49,616
Yo.

368
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:50,783
-Right.

369
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:51,316
-No.

370
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,916
No, please!

371
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:53,883
-OK, then.

372
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,383
Let me make it
easy to understand.

373
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,783
-What the-- who are you?

374
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:04,716
-Why don't you and your
friends take a hike?

375
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:05,949
-Get him out of here!

376
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,016
Those are the Wagarashi's men.

377
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,249
-Don't worry.

378
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:11,349
MAN: You asked for it, punk!

379
00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:15,649
[beating]

380
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:16,749
-Huh?

381
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,949
-Ain't actin' so tough
now, are ya, kid?

382
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:21,483
-That ought to teach ya a thing
or two, you little pipsqueak.

383
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,816
Don't mess with us, or next
time you won't get off so easy.

384
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,049
[screaming]

385
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,816
-Young man.

386
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,916
Thank you, whoever you are.

387
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,783
-Just look at those men run.

388
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:42,283
Now, if only the Wasabi
family can win the race,

389
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:45,749
we'll be through
with them for good.

390
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,183
-Hey, Sasuke?

391
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:47,683
-Yeah.

392
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,616
-It's only-- of
all the people you

393
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,483
could choose, why did
it have to be them?

394
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,949
-Tell me when you're
finished sulking.

395
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,016
-I'm not sulking.

396
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,416
It's just that--

397
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:18,616
-Idate, the Wasabi family
has complete faith in you.

398
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,449
And I have faith in you.

399
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,583
Isn't it time you had a
little faith in yourself?

400
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:37,816
Idate, I'm asking you
to run for the family.

401
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,683
Begging you.

402
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,449
-I will, sir.

403
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,749
Yes.

404
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:47,683
(VOICEOVER) Even if
it costs me my life.

405
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:51,683
[cheering]

406
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:57,849
-Whoa.

407
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:01,083
I had no idea it
was such a big deal.

408
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,783
So what kind of
race is it, anyway?

409
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:05,483
-You know, the kind with
a start and a finish.

410
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,283
Listen carefully,
and I'll explain.

411
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:11,583
The starting point is here
in the harbor of Degarashi.

412
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,116
From here, the runners
head for Modoroki Shrine.

413
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:15,183
That's the midpoint.

414
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:16,983
NARUTO: They run over water?

415
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:18,849
SAKURA: Uh, no, Naruto.

416
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,616
The first leg of the
race is done by boat.

417
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:22,716
See?

418
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:25,116
Anway, the runners pick
up the Ryoko jewels

419
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,083
from the Modoroki
Shrine, and the first one

420
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:30,183
that gets them to the
great Todoroki Shrine wins.

421
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:32,616
That's it as far as the
some basic rules go,

422
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,549
but other than that,
just about anything goes.

423
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,383
Shortcuts, dirty
tricks, anythig.

424
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,883
-That's why hiring ninja
to help you out is OK, too.

425
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,916
-OK, so where are the
ninja the other side hired?

426
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:47,983
-They're keeping a low
profile, but they're around.

427
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,049
So watch your step.

428
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,183
OK, Naruto?

429
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:51,483
-Yeah, yeah.

430
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,116
-I don't care what you guys
do, but whatever happens,

431
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,383
just stay away from me.

432
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,249
-Say what?

433
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,516
-I've got a race to run.

434
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,016
I don't want you in my way.

435
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,183
-In your way?

436
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,016
-Hey, hey, come on!

437
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,383
Can't we all just work together?

438
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,183
-No way.

439
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:05,683
Not with him!

440
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,349
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Off to a good start.

441
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:09,216
This could be a long race.

442
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,583
ANNOUNCER: Attention, attention!

443
00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:13,783
The Great Todoroki Shrine
Race is about to begin!

444
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:17,383
Running for the
Wasabi, Idate Morino!

445
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:22,616
[cheering]

446
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,516
SASUKE: Idate Morino?

447
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,483
ANNOUNCER: Running for the
Wagarashi family, Fukusuke

448
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,183
Hikyakuya!

449
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:30,149
-Yeah!

450
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:34,949
[cheering]

451
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,383
ANNOUNCER: Runners,
take your marks!

452
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:48,183
[heartbeats]

453
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,883
-Go!

454
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,849
-Guess that means we
better get going too!

455
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:06,849
What the--

456
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:09,983
-Heh.

457
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,449
-What's that idiot doing?

458
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,249
-Idate, where are you going?

459
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:14,049
-Hey!

460
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,516
You're going the wrong way!

461
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,383
-What's he doing?

462
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,549
-Have you gone crazy, or what?

463
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,468
[theme music]

464
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,729
NARUTO: Where's this bozo going?

465
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:04,896
Where's he's going?

466
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,696
He's moving at incredible speed.

467
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,763
NARUTO: The race has
barely even started

468
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:11,463
and his opponent is
already on the boat!

469
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:12,496
SAKURA: This is bad.

470
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:13,463
Put it in gear, Naruto.

471
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:15,329
We've gotta catch him!

472
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:16,929
-I don't think I
ever have that great!

473
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,296
Man, if this
weren't our mission,

474
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:19,629
I'd just let the fool go.

475
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:21,763
But OK, let's do it!

476
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:22,696
SAKURA: Right!

477
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,763
NARUTO: Next time,
The Race is On!

478
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:26,963
Trouble on the High Seas!
