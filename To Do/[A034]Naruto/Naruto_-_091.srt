1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,033
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,869
[shout]

3
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,669
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Unbelievable.

4
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:08,302
I never expected the
Fourth Hokage's jutsu.

5
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,869
Still, it's not
like the real thing.

6
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,536
Not coming from
this little Genin.

7
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,202
[grumbling]

8
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,269
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Hm.

9
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:19,036
Tsunade's as strong
as ever, I see.

10
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,202
I remember the time
she gave me a shot that

11
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:24,702
sent me flying 100 meters
in the opposite direction.

12
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:26,869
Ouch.

13
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:30,902
Ah-- he shouldn't even
try to take her own.

14
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,602
-Naruto, are you all right?

15
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:34,936
-Jiraiya!

16
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,202
Are you the one who taught
this little kid the Rasengan?

17
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:39,936
-Rasengan?

18
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,136
-Well, of course I did.

19
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,302
I'm his teacher, aren't I?

20
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,469
What of it?

21
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,536
-You and the Fourth
Hokage are the only ones

22
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,202
who can use that jutsu.

23
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,002
What's the point of
teaching it to someone

24
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,336
who can never master it?

25
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:55,002
You old fool!

26
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:57,236
Giving him false
hopes like that.

27
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,569
Filling his head
with stupid ideas.

28
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:03,602
Making him think he could
actually be Hokage some day.

29
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:05,069
-I'll show you who's stupid!

30
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:05,936
Just wait!

31
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,302
Just wait!

32
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:11,369
Give me just three days, and
I'll have that jutsu down flat!

33
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,202
-Ha.

34
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,036
Watch what you say, kid.

35
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,302
I might just told you to it.

36
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,402
-Heh.

37
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:21,036
-I said it, and I never
go back on my word.

38
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,769
That's my nindo-- my ninja way!

39
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,936
-Oi.

40
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:31,869
-Well then, care to
make a bet on it?

41
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,836
-A bet?

42
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,636
-I'll give you one week.

43
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,669
If you can master that jutsu
by then, I'll admit I'm wrong,

44
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,202
and that you're worthy
of becoming Hokage.

45
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,236
I'll even throw in my necklace.

46
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,469
-Lady Tsunade, no!

47
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,369
No, you don't really mean that.

48
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,569
-Ah, you can keep it.

49
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,169
I'm not really into jewelry.

50
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,202
JIAIYA: You numbskull.

51
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:54,169
That necklace belonged to
the first Hokage himself.

52
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,502
There are only two
like it in the world.

53
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,736
Why, that little thing is
worth three gold mines,

54
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,269
and the mountains on top of 'em.

55
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,902
-Lady, you've got
yourself a bet.

56
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:09,202
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): It's
always money with this kid.

57
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,302
-All right.

58
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:12,669
However, if you don't
master it in a week,

59
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,069
you lose and admit I was right.

60
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,869
And I get the money in froggy.

61
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:18,802
-Not Gama!

62
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,636
Wait a second!

63
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,336
-Lady Tsunade,
what are you doing?

64
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:24,736
How could you gamble
with the necklace?

65
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,869
-He hasn't a chance of winning.

66
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,002
Let's go, Shizune.

67
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,769
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): No
matter how bad things

68
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,102
got, she's never bet
the necklace before.

69
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,469
-Don't decide now, but
we'll expect your answer

70
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,369
within the week.

71
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,832
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Inheritence,
The Necklace of Death!

72
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,665
[knocking]

73
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,199
-What the-- who could that be at
this time of night? [knocking]

74
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,065
OK, OK.

75
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,465
I'm coming, already.

76
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,832
Hold your-

77
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,699
-I know it's awfully late.

78
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:09,732
I'm sorry, but I
must talk to you.

79
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,399
-I want to get a
good night's sleep,

80
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,565
'cause I'm going
to start training

81
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,765
first thing in the morning.

82
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,999
-That's just it.

83
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,399
Before you get
into this, there's

84
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,465
something you must know
about the necklace.

85
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,032
And also about Lady Tsunade.

86
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:23,099
-Ha!

87
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,432
I couldn't care less
about crazy old bat.

88
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:26,565
-Don't say that!

89
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,432
She's not the type of
person you think she is.

90
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:31,165
What right have you-- you
don't know anything about her!

91
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,332
Please forgive me.

92
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:39,299
I didn't mean to shout.

93
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:43,299
Lady Tsunade wasn't
always like that.

94
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:46,932
She used to be so kind,
dedicated to the village,

95
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,965
but she's changed.

96
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,499
But ever since that day--

97
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:57,499
-Huh?

98
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,599
What day's that?

99
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,365
Talk, already.

100
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,732
Since what day?

101
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,399
-The day she lost all she had.

102
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:09,765
Dreams, hopes.

103
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,199
Everything.

104
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:15,999
She had nothing left after
that, except the necklace,

105
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:19,065
and all of its memories.

106
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,799
Please understand,
that necklace is

107
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,532
more precious than life for her.

108
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,265
It's not simply a
piece of jewelry

109
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,732
to be gambled away
on a silly bet.

110
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,399
-Look, a bet's a bet.

111
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,065
Anyway, it was her
idea, not mine.

112
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,999
-You'll be sorry
if you think it's

113
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,399
something you'll be able
to wear like a trophy.

114
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,499
This is not just any necklace.

115
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,032
It won't accept anyone
else wearing it.

116
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:46,232
Only on Lady Tsunade
does it remain safe.

117
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,832
When anyone else
puts it on, they die.

118
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,699
-Nawaki, I can't
believe you're 12.

119
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:17,199
Happy birthday.

120
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,099
-Huh?

121
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,465
Just because you're
my sister, you

122
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,732
don't have to give me presents.

123
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,732
I'm not a little kid
anymore, you know that?

124
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:24,865
-Oh, yeah?

125
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,465
You're still a kid, as
far as I'm concerned.

126
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:30,399
Anyway, whether you or
not, go ahead and open it.

127
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,232
I think you're definitely
going to like it.

128
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,032
-Sister, is this
what I think it is?

129
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,432
-Yep.

130
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:47,299
It belonged to our grandfather,
necklace of the First Hokage.

131
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,865
-I love you!

132
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,232
-I thought it made more
sense for you to have it.

133
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,599
I know you've had your eye
on it for a long time now.

134
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:58,432
Take good care of it.

135
00:07:58,465 --> 00:07:59,199
-Oh, I will.

136
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:01,465
And not just the necklace.

137
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:05,065
This entire village meant
a lot to our grandfather.

138
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,265
And I'm going to be
good care of all of it.

139
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,365
-Nawaki.

140
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,865
-After all, I'm the
grandson of the Hokage

141
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,799
who built the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

142
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,865
-Remember, like you
always say, a man

143
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,532
never goes back on his work.

144
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,899
-Right.

145
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,999
And I give my word, I'll follow
our grandfather's footsteps

146
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:24,999
and be just like him.

147
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,099
To be Hokage.

148
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,099
That is my dream.

149
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:32,865
-Nawaki, take off your headband.

150
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:33,999
Just for a sec.

151
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:34,932
-Huh?

152
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,465
-Go on, take it off.

153
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:40,299
I have one more present
I want to give you.

154
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,232
A magic charm, to make
your dream come true.

155
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:10,765
-No.

156
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,999
It's best if you
don't look, Tsunade.

157
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,232
-What difference can it make?

158
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,965
The condition the body's
in, she won't even

159
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,032
be able to recognize
her little brother.

160
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,232
JIRAIYA: Silence, Orochimaru!

161
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:25,465
-This is what happens in war.

162
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,699
Shinobi are just left on
the battlefield to die.

163
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:32,565
There are no doctors or
healers to help them.

164
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,365
It's too bad the
boy was so reckless.

165
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,365
As if he thought he
were invulnerable.

166
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,765
And the day after receiving
such a lovely gift, too.

167
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,732
NAWAKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, I will,
and not just the necklace.

168
00:09:57,132 --> 00:10:00,065
This entire village meant
a lot to our grandfather,

169
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,499
and I'm going to take
good care of all of it.

170
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:07,765
TSUNADE: Therefore, I'm making
this proposal for any four

171
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,765
ninja squad that we
send into harm's way.

172
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,632
If we make one
member of each squad

173
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:14,899
a trained medical
specialist, it will not only

174
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:16,565
increase their
survival rate, but will

175
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,565
improve the chances of their
mission being a success.

176
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:23,465
I say we need to establish
a teaching facility to train

177
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,965
selected ninja in the healing
arts, and we need to do it now.

178
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,032
At once!

179
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,665
We've lost too many
shinobi already.

180
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:31,865
-Ah.

181
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,165
Yes, there is much sense
in what you say, Tsunade,

182
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,165
but at present we have no
one with enough expertise

183
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:41,599
in such things, and we're
in the midst of a great war.

184
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,832
Such an undertaking would
require time and resources,

185
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:48,265
and our enemies won't
sit back and wait for us.

186
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,832
-So we do nothing?

187
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,299
We go on, throwing
their lives away?

188
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,299
-I agree.

189
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:55,765
I say she's right.

190
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,332
If we can learn to save future
generations of shinobi, then

191
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,565
those who've died,
perhaps this way,

192
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,865
their deaths will have meaning.

193
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,632
-Wait!

194
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:11,432
Thanks for that.

195
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:12,865
-There's no need to thank me.

196
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,832
What you said was right.

197
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:19,232
I was thinking,
it's getting late.

198
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,732
Would you like me
to see you home?

199
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:21,665
-Oh.

200
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:24,032
But don't you--
isn't your house?

201
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:24,799
-Mm-hm.

202
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,532
The other way.

203
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:27,299
-Don't bother.

204
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,299
Really.

205
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,065
-Oh, it's no bother.

206
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,832
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.

207
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:35,732
Besides I love this walk
and all its memories.

208
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,165
It's the way I used to go
to pick my little sister up

209
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,432
at the Academy.

210
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,232
-Used to?

211
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,532
-Yes.

212
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,799
That night a year ago, when
the village was attacked,

213
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:49,032
my sister was killed.

214
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,599
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
So him, too.

215
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:51,565
We're the same.

216
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,397
Tomorrow's another mission
into enemy territory.

217
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,464
-Whoever said it
was a shinobi's duty

218
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:20,530
to watch his comrades
die one by one?

219
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:22,297
-I know.

220
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,464
-We're beset by death.

221
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,430
It's all around us.

222
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:31,330
I'd give my life to bring some
order to this war torn world.

223
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,797
I love this village, and the
people in it with all my heart.

224
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,630
I want to protect them.

225
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:41,564
I want to lead them in building
a better world than this.

226
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:45,797
It's been my dream ever
since my sister died.

227
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,697
It's all that's kept me going.

228
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,964
To be Hokage.

229
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,030
that is my dream.

230
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,197
-Dan.

231
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:08,864
Take this.

232
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,430
I want you to have it.

233
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,597
Hang on, Dan!

234
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,664
You'll be all right.

235
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:24,397
-Tsunade-- I don't
want to die yet.

236
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,830
There are so many
things left to do.

237
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,230
[groan]

238
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:31,997
-Don't try to talk!

239
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,197
-He's all torn up inside.

240
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,630
No one can help him now.

241
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,597
Not even one of the Sannin.

242
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,530
-But it can't be.

243
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,930
I can't die here.

244
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,130
Not this way.

245
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:44,864
Not yet.

246
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:45,630
-Don't worry, Dan.

247
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,030
I've stopped the bleeding.

248
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,964
Just save your strength.

249
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,964
You're going to be all right.

250
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,430
-Thank goodness.

251
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:58,364
That's a relief.

252
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,830
-Wait, Hang on!

253
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,330
No!

254
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:06,330
No!

255
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:08,730
Don't leave me!

256
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,197
Come back, Dan!

257
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,097
Don't go.

258
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,064
Please don't go.

259
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:13,997
Don't leave me.

260
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,964
Don't go.

261
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:15,964
Don't go.

262
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:16,930
Don't go.

263
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:17,897
Don't go!

264
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,864
Don't go!

265
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:19,364
Don't go!

266
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:20,997
Don't go!

267
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,730
-That's enough!

268
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:22,230
He's dead!

269
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:38,930
-No!

270
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,297
[crying]

271
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,697
-So you see, Naruto?

272
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,264
That was the day.

273
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:59,230
It changed her.

274
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,797
She's been in
torment ever since.

275
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,030
Where are you go?

276
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:12,897
-Out.

277
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,164
I need to start training.

278
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,330
MAN: Welcome.

279
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:41,930
Come in!

280
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:44,830
JIRAIYA: Funny finding you here.

281
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:46,564
-What the hell do you want?

282
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,397
-Don't be that way.

283
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,064
You know you're glad to see me.

284
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:53,097
-Master Jiraiya.

285
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,630
-Shizune, would you mind
leaving the two of us

286
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,364
alone for a while?

287
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,030
It's been years since
we've sat down together.

288
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,030
Bring me the house
special over here.

289
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:03,830
And a drink.

290
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,797
MAN: Yes, sir.

291
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,230
Coming up.

292
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,164
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Thank you, Master Jiraiya.

293
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,697
-Here you go.

294
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,697
Ah, perfect.

295
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,497
Just the thing.

296
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:26,097
I have to say, I never
imagined that you'd still

297
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,797
have that necklace
after all these years.

298
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,664
I just assumed you
would've gambled it

299
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:33,697
away long before now.

300
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,964
Guess it's all you have
to remember them by.

301
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,364
Is he on your mind?

302
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:48,564
-What do you mean?

303
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:50,964
-Naruto, of course.

304
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,597
-Not much.

305
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,164
-I don't know.

306
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:58,130
Taking on a young kid
like that as an opponent.

307
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,997
He'll never be able to
master that jutsu in a week,

308
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,430
and you know it.

309
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:03,730
It's not much of a bet.

310
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,230
Why so glum, anyway?

311
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:10,297
-Who's glum?

312
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,364
I don't know what
you're talking about.

313
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:17,730
-When are you meeting
Orochimaru again?

314
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:20,697
I can see it in Shizune's face.

315
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,530
I don't know what sort of
deal he may have offered you,

316
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,264
but think carefully
before accepting it.

317
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,197
Very carefully.

318
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,697
Remember the Hokage
that have come before,

319
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,930
and all they've accomplished
for the Leaf village.

320
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:35,730
It's only thanks to
them that the village

321
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,497
has survived, even prospered,
through troubled times.

322
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,830
This was their dream,
and they were all

323
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:45,064
willing to gamble
everything to achieve it.

324
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,664
Even their lives.

325
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:50,697
Betray that dream, and you
make all their sacrifices

326
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,630
meaningless.

327
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:53,930
Why am I saying this?

328
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:55,330
Could you do such a thing?

329
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:05,230
If I thought you could, I would
stop you right here and now.

330
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,464
-It has nothing to
do with me anymore.

331
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:11,797
-A person who feels nothing at
the death of those close to him

332
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,297
is no different than a butcher.

333
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,030
But you're not like that.

334
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,864
There was no one who
cared more for the village

335
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:23,297
or felt its pain more deeply.

336
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,697
I remember the day.

337
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,197
-OK, that's enough
with the lecture!

338
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,697
That dumb kid.

339
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,697
Why did you have
to bring him here?

340
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,064
-To be Hokage.

341
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,130
That is my dream!

342
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,730
-They're a lot alike.

343
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:44,064
They must be almost
the same age.

344
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:45,564
-It's not just that.

345
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,030
NAWAKI (VOICEOVER):
To be Hokage!

346
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,164
That is my dream.

347
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,964
-You're always so reckless.

348
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:00,464
You want to kill yourself?

349
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,197
You're still just a genin, so
if there's ever a real battle,

350
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,230
you get out of there, fast.

351
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:05,997
-Are you crazy?

352
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,230
I'm never gonna run away!

353
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,530
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): They're
more alike than you know.

354
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,597
-There's no way.

355
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,264
I'm totally out of gas.

356
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:30,830
Just gotta try it
again tomorrow.

357
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:31,664
JIRAIYA: Ugh.

358
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,164
My head.

359
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,297
What a night.

360
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,364
Ugh.

361
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:39,664
That Tsunade always
was a bad influence.

362
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:40,164
Huh?

363
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,464
Naruto never came in.

364
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:47,964
Must've been training all night.

365
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:48,630
Hmph.

366
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:49,397
Little fool.

367
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:13,630
-So.

368
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,730
Do we have a deal?

369
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,330
-I'm offering to bring
your dear little brother

370
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:23,430
and your beloved back to life,
with a forbidden jutsu that I

371
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:26,030
have developed.

372
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,230
Come now.

373
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,564
Don't you want to see
them again, dear Tsunade?

374
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:37,264
TSUNADE: What do
you plan on doing,

375
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:39,430
once you arms have
been restored to you?

376
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:43,464
-This time around, I'm going
to grind the Hidden Leaf

377
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,397
village into dust.

378
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,197
-My lady, think of your brother.

379
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,964
Think of my uncle!

380
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,164
It would be a betrayal of them.

381
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:51,530
A betrayal of yourself.

382
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:54,130
Have you forgotten
all your dreams?

383
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:55,630
-I'll cut to the chase.

384
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,064
Tsunade.

385
00:20:57,097 --> 00:21:00,564
In all its wisdom, the village
has come to the decision

386
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,197
to name you as the Fifth Hokage.

387
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,034
[theme music]

388
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,101
-Oh, no!

389
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:03,768
What have I done?

390
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,801
How could I fall asleep
today of all days?

391
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,068
This is the day that
the bet comes to!

392
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:10,668
I've gotta put up or
shut up, and I'm not

393
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:13,268
even close to nailing the
Fourth Hokage's jutsu!

394
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,368
What's the Pervy
Sage gonna think?

395
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:16,734
Oh well.

396
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:19,568
I'll just have to play it be
ear and hope for a lucky break.

397
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,534
That's what gambling's
all about, isn't it?

398
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:25,401
Next time, A Dubious
Offer, Tsunade's Choice!
