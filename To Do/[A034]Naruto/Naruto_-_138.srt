00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:16,476
-All right, pull him up.

10
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,376
Hurry!

11
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,243
-Not so fast!

12
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:23,743
Nngh.

13
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,676
Another clone!

14
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,143
-Over here!

15
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,109
Now it's my turn!

00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:47,876
-Augh.

23
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,243
-Just be careful, Naruto!

24
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,176
There are two more
of them out there.

25
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,543
-Huh?

26
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,443
-Huh!

27
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,876
Speak of the devil.

28
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,309
-Kagero.

29
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:02,076
Come on, let's get outta here.

30
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:02,576
-Hey!

31
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,376
Hey!

[whoosh]

33
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,076
-Mmph.

34
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,476
Man, they're quick!

35
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,009
Especially when
they're running away.

36
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:23,709
-Naruto, it seems to me
you're forgetting something.

37
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,543
-Huh?

38
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,709
-What about Sakura?

39
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,176
-Dah!

40
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,576
You're right!

41
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,876
Hey, Sakura!

42
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,343
[crack]

43
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,343
-Dah!

44
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,009
-Naruto!

45
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,476
-I was worried!

46
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,443
Thank goodness
you're OK, Sasame.

47
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:40,143
[gong]

48
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,109
-Yeah, she's fine.

49
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,609
We're both fine.

50
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,376
Thanks so much for asking.

51
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,243
-Uh.

52
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:45,943
What's wrong?

53
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,143
You mad about something?

54
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,576
[wind]

55
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:56,209
-Here's a good spot.

56
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:59,576
Let's take a break.

57
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,009
-So, who's this pretty young
friend of yours, Sakura?

58
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,143
-OK, that's close enough!

59
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,443
-What do you mean?

60
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,643
What's going on?

61
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:08,443
-Whoa!

62
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:10,309
Just keep away from her, OK?

63
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,676
-Hmm?

64
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,509
Doh!

65
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,009
Are you serious?

66
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:15,509
You think I'd make
a pass at her?

67
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,076
She's too young for
me, for one thing.

68
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,476
And anyway, you think that's
all I ever think about?

69
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,943
-Just about all.

70
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:24,809
Sounds like Sakura's finally
caught onto you, Pervy Sage.

71
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,143
And it's about time, too.

72
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:29,176
-For the last time, I told
you not to call me Pervy Sage!

73
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,409
-I can think of worse
things to call ya!

74
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,309
-Knock it off, the two of ya!

75
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,343
Come on, the girl's
frightened enough already!

76
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,476
JIRAIYA AND NARUTO: Sorry.

77
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,009
-What a couple of jerks.

78
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:43,809
Anyway, this is Sasume,
a former clan ninja.

79
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,843
Her cousin was taken away
by Orochimaru not long ago

80
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,409
and she's been
searching high and low

81
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,376
trying to find him ever since.

82
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,609
-That's right.

83
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,576
Those goons who attacked
just now were after Sasame

84
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,209
to keep her from finding
Orochimaru's hide-out.

85
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:57,909
-Ah.

86
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,443
The Fuma Clan again, eh?

87
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:00,143
-Huh?

88
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,576
What do you mean, again?

89
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:04,143
-In the last village,
I made contact

90
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:07,376
with some men who said they
were once part of the Fuma Clan.

91
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:08,543
-You're kidding!

92
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,509
You actually picked up
some useful information

93
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,543
instead of just messing around?

94
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:13,243
-Whoa!

95
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,743
I never woulda thought.

96
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,876
-I was a little
hungry and thirsty,

97
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,943
so I wandered into
this nice litlte tavern

98
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:20,643
and it turned out to
be their hide-out.

99
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,343
-Ah!

100
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,643
So you were goofing off!

101
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,343
I bet there were some pretty
girls in there, too, huh?

102
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,709
-Hey, let's have a little
more respect for your teacher,

103
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,076
if you don't mind!

104
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:30,709
What's Sakura going to think
if you keep talking this way?

105
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:33,543
-Oh, I stopped respecting
you a long time ago.

106
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:34,243
-I see..

107
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:37,109
I'm sorry to hear that.

108
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:39,109
-They were from the Fuma Clan?

109
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:40,243
-Yeah.

110
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:42,976
Their leader's name was
Hanzaki or something.

111
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,076
-Hanzaki and his
followers are traitors

112
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,476
who abandoned our clan.

113
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,343
-Are they?

114
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:51,443
-What was it that happened
between you and these men?

115
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,276
-After I taught them a lesson
for trying to steal my money,

116
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,809
I questioned them
about Orochimaru

117
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,976
and his possible whereabouts.

118
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,043
Sadly, they were no help at all.

119
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:05,543
-If you're sure you
wanna find his hide-out,

120
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,143
I can show you the way.

121
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,576
-You can, really?

122
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:09,309
-Yes.

123
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:10,143
-Ha!

124
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:11,843
Well, what're we waitin' for?

125
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:21,943
-Nngh.

126
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,643
-That would of
yours hasn't healed.

127
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:24,743
Don't push yourself.

128
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,809
-I'm all right.

129
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:27,409
There.

130
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,876
-Huh?

131
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,076
SASAME: That's the entrance
to the village hidden

132
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:32,476
in the Sound.

133
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,343
Orochimaru's lair lies deep
within those mountains.

134
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:44,543
SAKURA: So somewhere
behind those mountains,

135
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:45,943
we'll find Sasuke.

136
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:46,909
-Welp!

137
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,276
No use standing
around here then.

138
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,043
Come on, guys, let's get movin'!

139
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:51,609
-Wait!

140
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:52,909
Not so fast!

141
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:53,409
-Ack!

142
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:54,709
[thud]

143
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,076
-What is it now?

144
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,576
-Yeah, we really should hurry.

145
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,776
We don't want to be caught
out there in the mountains

146
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,676
when night falls.

147
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,143
-Yeah, that's right!

148
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,176
Sasuke's just a
stone's throw away

149
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,043
and you want to stand
here thinking about it?

150
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,309
-There's no telling what's
happening to him, even now.

151
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,609
Why in the world do
you want us to wait?

152
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,209
[stomach gowling]

153
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,343
-Huh?

154
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:14,643
-What was that?

155
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:17,076
-[chuckling nervously] Nothing!

156
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:20,443
I'm just a little
hungry, I guess.

157
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:21,843
-You're kidding, right?

158
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,643
You want a snack break?

159
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,276
-No shinobi goes
into battle hungry!

160
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,143
In a few steps, we'll be
entering enemy territory.

161
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,909
There will be little
time for eating then.

162
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:34,543
This is our last chance.

163
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:35,376
So!

164
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,909
I suggest you eat while you can.

165
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,809
[sighing]

166
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:45,043
-Eat up, it's not half bad!

167
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:48,476
-Well, I guess we might as well.

168
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,976
-Actually, one of the ladies in
the tavern took a liking to me.

169
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,543
She was the prettiest of
the whole bunch. [laughing]

170
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,643
She made all this with
her dainty, loving hands,

171
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,809
just for me.

172
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,376
Isn't that great? [laughing]

173
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,243
SASAME: I know, I'll
go make us some tea.

174
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:05,943
-Perfect!

175
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:06,509
Good idea.

176
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,709
[crackling fire]

177
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,643
-Mmm!

178
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:28,676
You're right, Pervy Sage.

179
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,709
This is good!

180
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,076
SASAME: Here you go.

181
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:36,043
The tea is ready.

182
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:36,576
-Mmph.

183
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:37,476
Mmph.

184
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,643
-Here.

185
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:40,976
Here you go.

186
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,809
-Ah, thank you.

187
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:43,609
-Tea?

188
00:08:43,643 --> 00:08:44,576
-Yeah.

189
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,476
Thanks a lot, Sasame.

190
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,809
But you need your
strength too, you know.

191
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:51,743
Come on and have
something to eat.

192
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:52,276
-I will.

193
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,043
[sipping]

194
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:08,943
-Ungh!

195
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,343
[clatter]

196
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,376
[thunk]

197
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,143
NARUTO: Pervy Sage!

198
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:19,876
Dah.

199
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:20,776
-Naruto!

200
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,209
What-- What's-- nehh.

201
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,143
[gasps]

202
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,309
[footsteps]

203
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:59,009
MALE SPEAKER: [laughing]
Sasame's signal.

204
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,209
So she did it.

205
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:03,609
MALE SPEAKER: And that
means the fools are ours.

206
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:05,709
-Nngh.

207
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:09,043
-You haven't recovered from
that beating you took, Kagero.

208
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,076
You wait here.

209
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:15,343
-No mistake, they're definitely
from the Leaf Village.

210
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:18,809
When he finds out we beat
a bunch of Leaf ninja,

211
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,676
Lord Orochimaru
will have to restore

212
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,909
the power of the Fuma Clan.

213
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,376
He'll have to.

214
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,609
-Yeah.

215
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,843
MALE SPEAKER: Come on, let's
bring him the good news.

216
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,043
MALE SPEAKER: Even better,
we'll bring him their heads

217
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,043
as souveniers.

218
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,838
[footsteps]

219
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,079
--[gasping] I must
be getting close.

220
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:26,545
Huh?

221
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,245
[breathing heavily]

222
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,387
-We thought it must be
spies from the Leaf Village.

223
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,320
Never thought we'd
find you, Sasame.

224
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,620
-Kamikiri!

225
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:43,453
Jigumo!

226
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,587
Kagero!

227
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,753
MALE SPEAKER: Strange
place for a reunion .

228
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,087
-Arashi!

229
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,287
Isn't he with you?

230
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,687
Where is he?

231
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:59,453
-Oh, well, uh, Arashi's
with Lord Orochimaru.

232
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:02,820
He's undergoing some
special training.

233
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,353
-Then take me to him.

234
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:05,553
I wanna see him.

235
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:07,853
-The only way to do that
is to join up with us

236
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,587
and serve Lord
Orochimaru as we do.

237
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,853
Then you're sure to see him.

238
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:14,353
[gasps]

239
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,687
-So, how did it go?

240
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,920
-Well, well!

241
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:31,820
Good job.

242
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:32,787
-I've done my part.

243
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,553
Now you'll take me
to Arashi, right?

244
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:36,587
[shing]

245
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,820
-You bet.

246
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,287
Just as soon as we put these
three to sleep for good.

247
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
-[gasping] What do you mean?

248
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,887
You said you only wanted to
capture them and take them

249
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,587
to Lord Orochimaru so
he could examine them!

250
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,553
-He will examine them.

251
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,487
But only from the neck up.

252
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,887
[shing]

253
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,453
-You can't!

254
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,153
No!

255
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,553
I won't let you do it.

256
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,020
They helped me--

257
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,687
-Shut up.

258
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,187
-What?

259
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,820
-Uh!

260
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:05,753
Impossible!

261
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,720
Our paralyzing
powder didn't work?

262
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,287
-Didn't work 'cause
we didn't drink it.

263
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,653
What do you think
we are, idiots?

264
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,587
OK, Sakura!

265
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,887
[thunking]

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,253
[poof]

267
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,020
-Substitution Jutsu.

268
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,420
-You'll keep an
eye on her, right?

269
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,753
-Just leave her to me.

270
00:13:26,553 --> 00:13:27,887
Hang in there, Sasame.

271
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,153
You'll be OK.

272
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:32,887
-Nngh.

273
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,687
-I don't know what you
did to that poor kid

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,687
to make her do this, but
you're gonna pay for it!

275
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,520
-You're wrong.

276
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:40,187
We didn't make her do anything.

277
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,153
She did it herself.

278
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,987
She wanted to do it.

279
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,353
-Gimme a break!

280
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:47,487
-It's true, kid.

281
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,620
SASAME: All right, what do I
have to do to see Arashi again?

282
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:53,353
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it's
nothing very difficult.

283
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,853
We just want you to put
those three spies to sleep,

284
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:58,153
that's all.

285
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,053
-And then kill them?

286
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,353
MALE SPEAKER: Don't worry.

287
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:02,753
We'll just take them to Lord
Orochimaru to be examined.

288
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,153
-They won't be hurt, right?

289
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,187
-If we manage to
pull this off, think

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,153
how grateful Lord
Orochimaru will be.

291
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:14,953
-Hanzaki says that all of you
are being used by Orochimaru,

292
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,820
that he'll throw you away
when he's through with you.

293
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,520
-Hanzaki is a traitor who
abandoned his own village!

294
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:23,753
We're friends of
your cousin Arashi.

295
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,320
Are you going to listen
to us or a traitor?

296
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:28,487
-Lord Orochimaru has
given us his word

297
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
that he'll restore our clan
to its former honor and power.

298
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:39,520
Sasame, you're young, but
you're as much a Fuma as we are.

299
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,887
Help us to make our
clan great once again.

300
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:49,987
-Nngh.

301
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,953
I don't care what you say!

302
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,353
It still sounds like
you tricked her!

303
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:54,687
-That's a small price to pay
for the sake of the clan!

304
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,820
[shing]

305
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,587
[kring]

306
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,953
-You punk!

307
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:01,920
Hngh!

308
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,820
[crash]

309
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,187
[kring]

310
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,987
-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

311
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,587
Here I come!

312
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,587
Hyah!

313
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,553
Mmph!

314
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,053
Nngh!

315
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,520
[popping]

316
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,487
-Uzumaki Barrage!

317
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:23,070
[crash]

318
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:27,003
-Uh oh, this doesn't look good.

319
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,970
-Heh.

320
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:29,470
Ptooh.

321
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:34,903
Rasengan!

322
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,836
[thud]

323
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,336
-Nngh.

324
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,070
-Don't think you're
getting off that easy!

325
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,870
After what you did to that kid--

326
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:50,370
-Naruto!

327
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:50,870
-Huh?

328
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:51,370
Nngh.

329
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,303
Ah, great.

330
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,570
Not him again!

331
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:03,103
Our old friend with
the earth-style jutsu.

332
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,736
But I doubt his ninja art
will prove as effective

333
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,170
in this hard, rocky terrain.

334
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:09,470
-It is time.

335
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:13,036
The ant-lion appears
from beneath the earth

336
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,270
and spreads its
wings in the sunlight

337
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:18,070
for only a brief moment.

338
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:24,736
And with it's birth, the
Kagero you know dies.

339
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,236
[gasps]

340
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,203
-Watch yourself, OK?

341
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,636
[cracking]

342
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,136
[slap]

343
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,136
-Huh?

344
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,603
What is this?

345
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,103
-Naruto, look!

346
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,603
-Huh?

347
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:00,670
-That's incredible!

348
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:03,703
-That guy is really a girl?

349
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,536
-Lord Orochimaru has promised
that our clan will spread

350
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,003
its wings in the sun once again.

351
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:11,470
But for that to happen,
I must sacrifice

352
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,770
all I must use the
ninja art I can

353
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,403
perform but once in a lifetime.

354
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,803
Kagero's Ninja Art, Ephemera!

355
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,270
[zapping]

356
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,770
-What the heck is that?

357
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:28,736
-Quick, Naruto!

358
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,203
Over here!

359
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,736
[blasting]

360
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,136
[rocks crumbling]

361
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,670
-Naruto!

362
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,003
[gasps]

363
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,970
[squishing]

364
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:55,970
-This is familiar.

365
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,503
I get the feeling
I've been here before.

366
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,370
-Yes, the Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.

367
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:03,970
There are few things on Earth
stronger than a mountain toad's

368
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:06,936
stomach, so I summoned
it to protect us.

369
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,870
-Good move, but-- nngh!

370
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:12,836
Guh.

371
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,170
It melted away.

372
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:15,836
-Worse would have
happened to us if we'd

373
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,936
been struck by her chakra.

374
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,403
[poof]

375
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,803
[gasps]

376
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:36,736
-I believed him.

377
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,470
I thought it was for
the good of the clan.

378
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,336
I wanted to believe.

379
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,036
[zap]

380
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,570
-What-- what happened to her?

381
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,736
-She sacrificed herself.

382
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,436
Gave everything she had for
what she'd been led to believe

383
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,136
would be the
salvation of her clan.

384
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,670
-Orochimaru.

385
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,403
The Fuma are no
different than us!

386
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:12,303
They love their clan,
just like we do!

387
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:15,436
To play on people's
feelings like that,

388
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,370
to take their feelings
of love and pride

389
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:21,870
and twist them into a force
for evil-- how low can you get!

390
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:24,170
Get ready, Orochimaru!

391
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,403
Because I'm coming and I'm
going to take you down!

392
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,836
[gasping and groaning]

393
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:47,303
-Where-- where are we?

394
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:51,336
-Kagero, why--
Kagero, why did you

395
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,903
risk your life to
save the two of us?

396
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:00,770
Crazy fool.

397
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:01,336
Nngh.

398
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,736
[organ music]

399
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,103
-Please, my lord.

400
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,103
Our fallen comrade
doesn't have long to live.

401
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,536
Only you, with your
mastery of medical jutsu,

402
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,870
can possibly save her.

403
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:29,770
-I want you both
to bow your heads,

404
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,303
put your hands to your
hearts and contemplate.

405
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:37,370
Contemplate the many ways
in which you have failed me.

406
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,370
-But, my lord!

407
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,636
We've risked our
lives in your cause!

408
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,036
Every order you've
given us, we've obeyed!

409
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,136
You promised you would
restore the Fuma clan!

410
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,836
-You must acknowledge
our service to you!

411
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,636
-There is only one way
left for the two of you

412
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,136
to atone for your failures.

413
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,603
[gasping]

414
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:01,836
-Lord Orochimaru!

415
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,336
[shring]

416
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,836
-Forgive our betrayal!

417
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,336
[slashing]

418
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,836
-Aaugh!

419
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,736
[thudding]

420
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:18,270
[laughs diabolically]

421
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,563
[theme music]

422
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,097
NARUTO: So that's
Orochimaru's hide-out, huh?

423
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,597
JIRAIYA: It's just
like him to build

424
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,963
his lair in a hole
in the ground.

425
00:23:06,997 --> 00:23:09,030
SAKURA: So Sasuke must
be somewhere in there!

426
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,163
What are we waiting for?

427
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:11,530
NARUTO: I'm with you, let's go!

428
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:12,197
SAKURA: Right!

429
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,530
JIRAIYA: Slow down!

430
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:15,730
We don't know what we might find
in there-- demons, serpents.

431
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:16,897
Take it easy.

432
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,597
NARUTO: Ha!

433
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,563
Bring 'em on!

434
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,497
What do I care
about a few snakes?

435
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,330
And there's no
demon alive that's

436
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:25,097
gonna keep me from
rescuing Sasuke and Arashi.

437
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,830
Next time, "Pure Terror,
The House of Orochimaru!"

438
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:33,363
