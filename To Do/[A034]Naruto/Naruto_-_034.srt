00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:55,776
-Akamaru trembles--
Gaara's cruel strength!

[screaming]

00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:00,349
-Huh?

5
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:03,753
-Huh?

6
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,759
-The grass ninja.

7
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:09,660
Everybody hide!

00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:10,161
[music playing]

9
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,862
-Quick!

10
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,096
Get down!

11
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,901
That ninja-- where
could she be hiding?

12
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,436
-Naruto?

13
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,471
-Ugh.

14
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:21,641
It's about time the
lazy fool woke up.

15
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,213
[grunts]

16
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,015
-You really are one of a kind.

17
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,416
That's for sure.

18
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,087
And I mean you're the kind
that gets on my nerves.

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,721
-Mmhmm.

20
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:35,292
[groans]

21
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:39,798
-Oh no!

22
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:40,732
Sakura!

23
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:41,666
Sak-- Sakura!

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,367
Sakura!

25
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,635
Something happened here.

26
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:44,770
I mean something serious
happened to your--

27
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,472
to your hair!

28
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:47,707
-Oh.

29
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,344
That's all.

30
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,480
I just wanted to change my look.

31
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,555
I like it better
long, but when I'm out

32
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:02,926
in the wilderness like this, and
I'm moving around all the time,

33
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,528
it gets in the way too much.

34
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,997
-Hmm.

35
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,299
So what's your story?

36
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,201
Why are you guys here
in the first place?

37
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,171
What's going on around here?

38
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,740
[sighs]

39
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:17,177
-Explaining everything to you
is going to be such a pain.

40
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,813
-Everyone just
showed up to help.

41
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,115
-What?

42
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:25,654
-Sakura's sure putting
on a great face.

43
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,356
-Huh?

44
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,492
-I'll take care of him now, Ino.

45
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,994
-Uh.

46
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,195
OK.

47
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,029
-Come on, Lee!

48
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,065
Pull it together!

49
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,033
Snap out of it already, alright?

50
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,869

52
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,806
-Tenten, is that you?

53
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,341
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,578
-I came to help you
out- what do you think?

55
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:46,146
-Wha?

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,348
Where are those
sound ninja guys?

57
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:49,617
-Sashin took care of them.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,020
Don't worry about it, Lee.

59
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,955
-Really?

60
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,058
-Just what were you
thinking rushing in there

61
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:57,226
all by yourself?

62
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,596
Look at you--
you're a total mess.

63
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:05,303
-Well, Sakura was in trouble,
so I had to do something, right?

64
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,605
-He's gotta be kidding.

65
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:09,108
He had to know he didn't
stand a chance alone

66
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,843
against all those guys.

67
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,047
-That was pretty darn
stupid, don't you think?

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,852
-Well, I guess I cannot
really argue with that.

69
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:18,920
-Ah ha!

70
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,089
I know you, Bushy Brow!

71
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,090
-(ANGRILY) Hey!

72
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:23,359
Knock it off!

73
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,628
You better not say
anything bad about Lee!

74
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,598
[yells]

75
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,402
-What in the world happened
while I was asleep?

76
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,905
Everything's gone crazy.

77
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,973
[groans]

78
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:37,609
-The Naruto is completely
out of the loop.

79
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,512
-So far out of the
loop, he doesn't even

80
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,913
know there is a loop.

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,850
He's not going to be the
hero of this little story.

82
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,354
-Lee,

83
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,021
-Huh?

84
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,457
-Huh?

85
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,926
-Thank you.

86
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,165
Because of you, I was able
to stand up for myself,

87
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,833
and I've become a
little stronger.

88
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,006
[whimpers]

89
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,577
-Thank you, Sakura.

90
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,449
But I guess my efforts
alone were not good enough.

91
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:14,655
-So, Sasuke, you are as
good as your reputation.

92
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,892
Just what you would expect
from the Uchiha clan.

93
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,427
To chase off those
ninja, you must

94
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,030
be very strong-- not like me.

95
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,865
I just got beaten to a pulp.

96
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,933
[music playing]

97
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:27,170
-What's he talking
about, beaten to a pulp?

98
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,339
Is he serious?

99
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:32,211
Are those guys
really that strong?

100
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:37,050
-Sakura, the lotus of the
Leaf Village blooms twice.

101
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,818
-Huh?

102
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,152
[music playing]

103
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:43,290
-When we meet again I will
have become a stronger ninja,

104
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:44,426
I promise.

105
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,195
-Uh.

106
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,432
[giggles]

107
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:50,667
[groans]

108
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,770
-Hey, Sakura, come on over here!

109
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:58,043
I wanna fix your
hair for you, OK?

110
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:58,609
-Yeah.

111
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,410
I'd like that.

112
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:05,618
[cutting sound]

113
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:07,688
-(ANGRILY) Why, you
sneaky little troll.

114
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,457
Hugging him like that.

115
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,059
Billboard Brow.

116
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:13,094
-(ANGRILY) Haven't you heard the
expression all's fair in love

117
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:13,995
and war?

118
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:14,896
Little Ino pig.

119
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,035
-Sasuke Uchiha.

120
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,141
[wind blowing]

121
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,279
-He's a stronger opponent
than I could have imagined.

122
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:35,322
[dog whimpering]

123
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,924
-Hey, Akamaru, you OK?

124
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,462
-Is he still shaking?

125
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:44,300
He's been at it for
half a day already.

126
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,468
-Akamaru.

127
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:49,372
-I don't blame him--
not after what happened.

128
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,874
It's because of what he saw.

129
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,019
-I know we'll be the ones who
survive this, right Akamaru?

130
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,522
-Of course, it's lucky for
us that the people caught

131
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,525
in that trap had
an earth scroll.

132
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,229
And now we're going to be the
first ones to reach the tower.

133
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,764
-Don't get overconfident.

134
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,134
That's a dangerous
mistake to make.

135
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,437
No matter how small
a bug is, it still

136
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,706
has to guard itself
at all times.

137
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,576
We have to make sure that we
don't encounter any enemies.

138
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,646
That's the only way to be safe.

139
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,414
Yeah, I know that, Shino.

140
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:27,019
But as usual, you gotta say
it in a weird, vague way.

141
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,120
Bug nerd.

142
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,356
[grunt]

143
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,923
-Yeah.

144
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:33,961
But Kiba, what Shino said--
he does kind of have a point,

145
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:34,962
you know?

146
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,064
-Yeah, I know.

147
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,632
Just come on.

148
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,734
-I sure hope that
nothing's happened

149
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,103
to [inaudible] out here.

150
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:44,674
-Hold on, guys.

151
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,877
We have to stop.

152
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,212
-Why?

153
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,649
-We're being careful not to
counter any enemies, right?

154
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:54,453
All right, Inara, I
want you to check out

155
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,322
a kilometer ahead
in that direction.

156
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:57,691
[gulps]

157
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,459
-Here goes.

158
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,059
Byakugan!

159
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,102
Yes.

160
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,837
There's somebody
there, all right.

161
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,013
-It sounds like there
are six people there.

162
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,616
-All right, let's check it out.

163
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,751
[gasp]

164
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,254
-Kiba, what are
you talking about?

165
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:23,522
We're not going to do that.

166
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:24,690
-Why not?

167
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,126
The test administrators
said that we

168
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,294
had to get both a heaven
and an earth scroll, right?

169
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:31,298
But she didn't say we
couldn't take more than that.

170
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:35,003
If we get more scrolls, there
will be fewer to go around,

171
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:38,374
and that means other teams will
be cut out of the competition.

172
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,209
[laughs]

173
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,277
-But--

174
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,879
-Look, first we'll
just check it out, OK.

175
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:45,349
If it looks too dangerous,
we won't battle them.

176
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:46,183
Now, come on.

177
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:46,684
Let's go.

178
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,153
[gasps]

179
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,221
-He's the kind of guy that
even the hungriest insects

180
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:50,822
would avoid.

181
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,799
[dog whimpers]

182
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,401
-What's wrong, Akamaru?

183
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,469
-What happened?

184

You just stopped
all of a sudden.

-Yeah.

186
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:09,245
Something just spooked
the little guy.

187
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,315
-What scared him?

188
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:12,483
-I have no idea.

189
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,218
Akamaru has the
ability to sniff out

190
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,055
the level of an enemy's
chakra, but man, I've

191
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,925
never seen him this
scared by it before.

192
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,830
Whoever those ninja up ahead
are, they aren't normal guys.

[eerie music playing]

194
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,939
-Do you believe the nerve
of these Sand Village ninja

195
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,475
Shigure challenging us head-on?

196
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,443
-Yeah.

197
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,111
They're a bunch of fools.

198
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,492
-What's he thinking?

199
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:48,928
That guy's way
too little to take

200
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,863
on an opponent who's that big.

-What did Akamaru say?

204
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,407
-That that big guy--
he is big trouble.

205
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,048
-They all look like
they're bad news to me,

206
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,651
like they're really strong.

207
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:08,986
-Too bad, kids.

208
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,889
You should have picked
your opponents better.

209
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,892
Now you're all going to die.

210
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,295
-I've heard enough out of you.

211
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,764
Let's make this quick.

212
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:21,234
I don't want to waste
time on this guy.

213
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:25,273
-We don't even know which
scroll these guys have.

214
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:29,845
-Hey Gaara, doesn't it make
more sense to follow these punks

215
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,547
and gather information first?

216
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,350
I mean, if they have the
same type of scroll as us,

217
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,620
we're just fighting
an unnecessary battle.

218
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,122

I can get you.

There's no blind
spot in this jutsu,

236
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,444
and it's deadly accurate.

237

Not one wound.

00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,969
Impossible.

243
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,970

make it rain blood instead.

250
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,674
And that sand.

251
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,544
Do you smell that odor?

252
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:19,514
It stinks.

-It smells like blood.

-He's created a wall of sand.

256
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,095
-That's right.

257
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:34,032
It's a defense, and
nothing can get through it.

258
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,501
He carries around all
that sand in the gourd

259
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,739
that he has on his back,
and when he's attacked,

260
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,944
he uses the power of his
chakra to harden the sand.

261
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,448
It's a jutsu that
only Gaara can do,

262
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,716
and somehow it
happens automatically,

263
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,155
independent of his will,
so any attacks against him

264
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,957

to defeat Gaara.

test is no problem for you,

for Temari and me.

is good enough--

to what your big brother says.

you as my big brother, at all.

is Akamaru OK?

so scared for so long.

did Akamaru say before?

been saying that that bigger

there's no other place to go.

waited half a day--

going to make us wait?

00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,572
-This is turning
into a real mess,

365
00:18:57,606 --> 00:19:00,109
but there's no way we
can cancel the test.

366
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:02,145
-What do you mean?

367
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,013
-Sorry to interrupt.

368
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:03,647
-Huh?

369
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,915
What do you want?

370
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:06,483
We're talking about
something important.

371
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,321
-Uh, I'm sorry,
but it's this tape.

372
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,355
You have to see it.

373
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,757
-What is it?

374
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,864
-OK.

375
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:19,967
Now, when you watch this, pay
special attention to the time.

376
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,376
[music playing]

377
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,280
-Wha-- but that means--

378
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:31,849
-That's right, Anko.

379
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:35,119
This was recorded
from inside the tower.

380
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,588
It's unbelievable.

381
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:39,524
Those ninja finished only
an hour and 37 minutes

382
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,893
after the test started.

383
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,562
They completely
destroyed the record

384
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,865
for finishing the second test.

385
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:45,632
-What?

386
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,568
That's impossible.

387
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,805
-It took just 97 minutes.

388
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:54,076
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

389
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,245
No one's even come close.

390
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,415
Those ninja from
the Sand Village

391
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,417
are way above genin level.

392
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,255
They beat the record
by four hours.

393
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:06,424
-I'm afraid it's not just that.

394
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,459
-I don't get it.

395
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:08,760
What do you mean?

396
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:10,763
-It's 10 kilometers
from the test entrance

397
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,332
gates to the tower.

398
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:15,569
And in between are ferocious
animals and poisonous insects,

399
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,571
not to mention the other ninja.

400
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:21,009
Could they really have
avoided all those things?

401
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:23,879
Especially the brown-haired
kid in the front.

402
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,748
-What's so special about him?

403
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,083
-You mean you didn't see?

404
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,491
-Interesting.

405
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,829
That is quite a surprise.

406
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,030
-I still don't get it.

407
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,634
What am I supposed
to be seeing here?

408
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,901
-It's what you're not seeing.

409
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:43,270
Look closely at his body.

410
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,251
-I see it now.

411
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:56,319
-Not one single scratch.

412
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:59,357
And I haven't even been able to
spot one little speck of dirt

413
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,159
on his clothing.

414
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,495
-Not even I. No.

415
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,998
None of the Chunin would be
able to make it to the tower

416
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,336
without at least getting a
scratch-- it's impossible.

417
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,507
-He must have some
special ability.

418
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,076
It's been a long
time since we've

419
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:20,082
had such a promising candidate,
but his eyes are pure evil.

420
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:26,259
[music playing]

421
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,203
[music playing]

422
00:22:57,236 --> 00:23:00,272
-Next time, I'm going to
look inside that scroll.

423
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:01,408
-No, you're not.

424
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,542
-What's the harm?

425
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:03,711
-(ANGRILY) I'll
show you the harm!

426
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:05,178
-Come on, just one little peek.

427
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:07,381
-(ANGRILY) What part of
no don't you understand?

428
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:08,783
No means no!

429
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,620
-Remember what the test
administrator said, loser?

430
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:13,088
You peek, and we all fail.

431
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:16,960
-Yeah, but that just makes
me want to peek more.

432
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:20,022
Next time, The Scroll's
Secret-- No Peeking Allowed.

433
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,055
It's not going to be
easy, but somehow I'm

434
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,822
going to look
inside that scroll.
