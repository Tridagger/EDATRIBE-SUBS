00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:07,978
-Kakashi Sensei, where's Sasuke?

3
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:20,045
-Kakashi, what's Naruto
Uzumaki's condition?

4
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:22,078
KAKASHI: He'll pull through.

5
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,878
-And Sasuke, Sasuke
Uchiha, what about him?

6
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,412
What happened?

7
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,512
-How are the other genin?

8
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:43,845
-All right.

9
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,778
Lady Hokage dispatched the
first and second medical corps

10
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,078
to pick them up.

11
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,812
Emergency treatment was
administered on the scene.

12
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:53,312
Then, they were all immediately
transported to the hospital.

13
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:54,945
-They were all wounded?

14
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,145
-Yes.

15
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:59,845
Shikamaru Nara is doing
fine, only minor injuries.

16
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,145
Kiba Inuzuka's are more serious,
but not life threatening.

17
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,245
-However, Neji Hyuga
and Choji Akimichi

18
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:07,912
are both in critical condition.

19
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:09,845
At this point, they
could go either way.

20
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:24,645

00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:47,445
-It's all here,
thoroughly researched.

24
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,345
The medications, their
effects and ingredients-- this

25
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,212
is excellent.

26
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,978
I'm going to need more
of the deer antler.

27
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:55,912
-Yes, m'lady.

28
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,678
-Well sis, how is he?

29
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:15,178
-Well, no long walks for him
anytime soon, that's for sure.

30
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,178
-Can't you do anything for him?

31
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,178
You're a vet.

32
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:21,012
-Not a magician, it takes time.

33
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:22,912
But relax, his
life's not in danger.

34
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:30,212
No long walks for you
anytime soon, either.

36
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:32,212

37
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,178
Don't worry.

almost three hours.

00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:51,345
Your turn to take over.

42
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,478
-OK.

43
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:54,612
We're using the boy's
own hair as a conductor,

44
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,878
so focus on that.

45
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:59,178
Try to accelerate the growth
rate of the injured cells.

46
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,545
-Right.

47
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:03,512
-As for the chakra control, just
think of threading a needle.

48
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,478

yourself crazy, you know.

Don't you remember your
psychological training?

00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:35,745
With every mission
comes sacrifice.

54
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:44,978
SHIKAMARU: Training and reality
are two different things.

55
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,578
I thought I knew about missions.

56
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:51,678
I thought I knew what it
meant to be a shinobi.

57
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:57,945
Now after this mission, my
first as a squad leader,

58
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:00,578
only one thing's clear.

59
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,412
I'm just not cut
out to be a shinobi.

60
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:11,145
-Honestly, all you men
with such fragile egos.

61
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:14,345
-This mission, I
thought all I had to do

62
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:17,612
was depend on everybody else.

63
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:21,345
Some leader-- I
should have done more,

64
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,878
but I didn't have the strength.

65
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,978
It's all my fault.

66
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,812
-What, are you afraid
you might get hurt?

67
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:47,078
-Shikamaru, a girl
disrespects you like that,

68
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:49,445
and you just walk away?

69
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,478
-You bet I do.

70
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:53,112
Standing around arguing
is not my thing.

71
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,312
That's something
girls like to do.

72
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,945
-And what are you?

73
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,112
Not a man, that's for sure.

74
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,845
As far I can see, you're
nothing but a coward.

75
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:05,278
You think if you quit,
the missions will stop?

76
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,178
Someone's got to do it.

77
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:11,978
Your comrades will be sent
out again, on other missions,

78
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:14,245
with someone else leading them.

79
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,478
They'll face the same
risks, and some of them

80
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,712
might not make
it-- ones you might

81
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,578
have saved if you'd
been there to lead them.

82
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:25,312
How are you going to feel then?

83
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,845
You've got a chance to
reflect on your mistakes

84
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,345
and to learn from them.

85
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,912
Use your failures to make
yourself a better leader.

86
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,145
You won't help your
friends by running away.

87
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:40,045
Instead, you should be trying
to make yourself stronger,

88
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:43,378
for their sake, so that the
next mission goes perfectly

89
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,278
and everyone gets back safe.

90
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:46,712
The choice is simple.

91
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:48,745
You're either a
leader or a coward.

92
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,345
So, which are you?

The antidote worked.

caused by the pill's affects

-I couldn't have done it
without your help, Shikaku.

101
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:30,545
The Nara clan's sacred
medicine guide was invaluable.

102
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:34,478
The work that went into that
manual, the years of research--

103
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,612
well, it's quite impressive,
to say the least.

104
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,545
-Thank you.

105
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,478

-Neji Hyuga is safe.

His condition has stabilized.

110
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:53,345
And there's more.

111
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:56,478
I've just heard that Kakashi
Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki have

112
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,278
returned, and they've
been examined.

113
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:02,378
Naruto's injuries are serious,
but not life threatening.

114
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,678
He's going to be OK.

-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

128
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,945
When are you going
to give me the power?

129
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,245
-A word of advice,
watch what you

130

say if you want to live long.

131
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,945
Don't let his physical
appearance fool you.

132
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:19,578
That's still Lord Orochimaru
you're talking to you.

133
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:23,978
Ah, the-- the intensity
of his chakra.

134
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:26,178
-Yes, he's the one.

135
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:29,178
My future lies in him.

Please bring Sasuke back to me.

-Don't you worry one bit.

141
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,278
I'm going to bring Sasuke back.

142
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,711
I promise that on
my life, Sakura.

you're awake, huh?

-Shikamaru!

146
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:16,411
-I was going to go check in on
Choji and see how he's doing.

147
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:17,678
How about you?

148
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,411
-I just thought I'd look
in on Naruto and Sasuke,

149
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,578
if he's there.

150
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,245
-I see.

151
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:27,378
Well, at least everybody's OK.

152
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,111
That's good.

153
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,711
-So, so Sasuke's--

154
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:39,111
-Yeah, he's gone.

[music playing]

158
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:00,711
-So, they're still not
letting anyone in to see him?

159
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,778
-No, but they say he'll
be regaining consciousness

160
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:04,578
soon enough.

161
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:06,145
He'll be all right.

162
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:09,711
-Ah, thank goodness.

163
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,845
-It was a fortunate day
for this village when

164
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:15,211
Lady Tsunade agreed
to come back.

165
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:19,778
If it weren't for her,
Choji would have--

166
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:22,678
-Lady Tsunade, the fifth Hokage.

167
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,511
-Here for a visit?

168
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,811
-Oh--

169
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:37,278
-News travels fast, I see.

-Naruto--

173
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,245
-I had heard that your
injuries were pretty serious.

174
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,845
You seem to be doing
well, considering.

175
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:06,578
-I'm sorry, Sakura.

176
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,811
-Uh, hm, sorry?

177
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,311
What have you got
to be sorry about?

178
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:19,945
-Let me guess, you got reckless
and went off half-cocked again,

179
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:20,611
huh?

180
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,811
Look at you now.

00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:24,645
You look like a mummy.

182
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,178
-I'm so sorry.

183
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,645
-Hey, why do you have
the curtains closed?

184
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,611
It's a beautiful day outside.

185
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,111
See?

186
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:38,711
-I haven't given up.

187
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:42,411
Listen, I'm still going
to keep my promise.

188
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,878
After all, it was the
promise of a lifetime, right?

189
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,011
I meant It.

190
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,811
-It's OK, Naruto.

191
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,445
Really--

192
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:53,878
-He tried, Sakura.

193
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:58,045
-If I say I'm going to
do it, that means I will.

194
00:13:58,078 --> 00:13:59,611
OK?

195
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,978
Don't forget, my
way of the shinobi

196
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:05,611
means I always stand
behind what I say.

00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,145

204
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,878
-Thanks, Naruto.

205
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:39,211
-I've got to focus on
healing these injuries if I'm

206
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,978
going to bring Sasuke back.

207
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,278
[rumble]

208
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,211
-Huh?

209
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:47,611
What the heck is that?

210
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:51,845
Huh?

211
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:54,278
Pervy Sage?

212
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,178
-Hey there.

213
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,145
[crow squawk]

214
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,545
-What I have to tell
you is important.

215
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:02,678
It can't wait.

216
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,145
From now on, you're
my only student.

217
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,445
I need to make a full-fledged
shinobi out of you

218
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,611
in three years, and I'll do it.

219
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,711
-But why three years?

220
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,245
-We've received some
disturbing information

221
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,378
regarding the Akatsuki.

222
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:19,245
-Akatsuki--

223
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,345
-We've reason to believe
you've been chosen

224
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,845
as their next target,
and we have three or four

225
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:27,811
years before they
come after you.

226
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,978
-No way, that's
not going to work.

227
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,078
-Hm?

228
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:32,511
-I don't have time for that.

229
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,345
Do you think I care about what
might happen three years down

230
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:36,811
the road?

231
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,878
-What are you talking about?

232
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,178
-Orochimaru's already
got his hands on Sasuke,

233
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,845
and his life is in
danger, right now.

234
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:45,011
That's what I'm talking about.

235
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,178
-Even though immortal,
that doesn't mean his body

236
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,745
can maintain itself forever.

237
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,011
So before his flesh
decays, a strong, new body

238
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,445
must be made into a
vessel for his soul.

239
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:01,578
-Huh.

240
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:04,011
I see you know all
the gruesome details

241
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,645
of Orochimaru's little scheme.

242
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:07,711
-Huh?

243
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,545
Wait, you mean you
knew all about it, too?

244
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:11,711
-Well, of course.

245
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:13,111
Don't you think
I've been studying

246
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,311
that immortality jutsu o his.

247
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:18,545
That's also how I know our
good friend Orochimaru won't

248
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,478
be able to reincarnate himself
in another body for at least

249
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:22,911
three more years.

250
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:25,011
Fortunately, he ran
out of time and had

251
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:28,578
to take over another body
before Sasuke could get there.

252
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,711
That means Sasuke is
safe for three years.

253
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,645
So you do have time.

254
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:36,078
-Really are you sure
that, Pervy Sage?

255
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:40,111
Are you absolutely sure?

256
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:41,545
-Yeah.

257
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,911
-Ha.

258
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,311
[sigh]

259
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,278
-Forget Sasuke.

260
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,911
-Huh?

261
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,745
-You can't help him, so
just forget about him.

262
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,545
[gasp]

263
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:59,311
-Sasuke went to Orochimaru
of his own free will.

264
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:02,545
No matter what you do,
he will not change.

265
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,078
[sigh]

266
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,945
-I've seen many shinobi,
so I know the type.

267
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:11,611
Orochimaru and Sasuke are
cut from the same cloth.

268
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,711
[gasp]

269
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:15,678
-Don't delude
yourself into thinking

270
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,178
that you can bring him back.

271
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,045
You can't.

272
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,678
It's hopeless, a fool's errand.

273
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:23,578
-Maybe it's easy for you to
give up on him, Pervy Sage,

274
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,711
but I can't.

275
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,811
He may mean nothing to
you, but he's my friend.

276
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,911
-Idiot!

277
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,611
Just take a look at the
condition you're in,

278
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:31,311
and he's the one
who did it to you.

279
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,945
Was that the work of a friend?

280
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,978
-No, but--

281
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:41,211
[music playing]

282
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:42,678
-Why?

283
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,778
Why are you doing this?

284
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,778
You and I have been
comrades since childhood.

285
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,811
Together we're part of the
three legendary sannin.

00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,111
-What a sentimental
fool you are, Jiraiya.

288
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,811
You always were
blind to reality.

289
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,878
You couldn't see,
couldn't imagine,

290
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:04,745
what I was really
doing all along.

291
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:07,545
-It's too late to
turn back, Orochimaru.

292
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,745
Don't do this.

293
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:11,111
[laugh]

294
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,011
-How'd you get to
be such a fool?

295
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:17,511
- -All my pleading
meant nothing.

296
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,478
He left us and
would never return.

297
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:22,511
After the pain,
all I was left with

298
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:27,011
was a sense of
helplessness and regret.

299
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,945
Above all, I want to
save you from going

300
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,078
through that, Naruto.

301
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:38,311
If you insist on
going after Sasuke,

302
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:40,445
then you'll get no
training from me.

303
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:43,245
I'll have the ANBU Black
Ops assigned to guard you,

304
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:44,811
to prevent you from
leaving the village.

305
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,378
[gasp]

306
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,145
-You're not just
some ordinary kid.

307
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:50,878
You've got something inside
you the Akatsuki want,

308
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,145
the nine-tailed fox.

309
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,511
But if you're going
to behave like a kid,

310
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,345
and not listen to
what I tell you,

311
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:58,011
then I'll do what I have to do.

312
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,211
Eventually you're going
to face enemies far worse

313
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:07,711
than Orochimaru, and it's time
you started preparing for them.

314
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:11,711
The first thing is for
you to give up on Sasuke.

315
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:13,978
What happened was
destined to happen.

316
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:18,811
Dismiss him from your
mind and move on.

317
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:21,211
To be a shinobi, you
need more than strength

318
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,211
and jutsu You must
acquire the judgment

319
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,945
to make the right decisions.

320
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,411
You must become smarter.

321
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:31,078
The longer you remain
a fool, the harder

322
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:35,545
it will be for you to
live in this world.

323
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,278
-Fine, then.

324
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,078
If being smarter means
what you say it does,

325
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,111
I'll remain a fool
my entire life.

326
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,411
I'm going after him.

327
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,478
And I'll do it
alone if I have to.

328
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,278
I'll create my own
incredible jutsu.

329
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,811
And whenever the Akatsuki
show up, I'll smack them down!

[music playing]

331
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,745
-The thought of my
leaving you to come up

332
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:16,145
with jutsu on your own,
like that idiotic sexy jutsu

333
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:19,811
of yours-- no, it's
too depressing.

334
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:20,311
-Hm.

335
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,111
-This is more than foolish.

336
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:29,745
It's so colossally foolish,
it might even work.

We've got a lot of work to do
when you get out the hospital.

the ground running.

See you then.

been since we've all

come together, like this?

since Orochimaru left us.

has the Sharingan.

We'll deal with our old
friend Orochimaru in time, hm.

in which to prepare,

to do to be ready, right?

seek-- everything,

weird ever since Sasuke left.

358
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:08,551
I can't put my finger on
it, but kind of depressed,

359
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,751
fidgety, anyway weird.

360
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:12,918
And now she says she
wants to go solo,

361
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,751
that she'll do
better on her own.

362
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,384
What kind of talk is that?

363
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,451
I don't like the way things
are going, but I'm helpless.

364
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:23,684
Meh-- of all the times to
be stuck in the hospital.

365
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:25,951
VOICEOVER: Next
time, Deep Cover?!

366
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:29,618
A Super S-Ranked Mission!

367
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,151
