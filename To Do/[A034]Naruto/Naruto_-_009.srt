[grunts in pain]

3
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:46,391
-You're nothing.

4
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,394
-Stop right there!

5
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:49,996
Shadow clone jutsu!

6
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:57,773
-Oh, shadow clones.

7
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:59,976
And there's quite a few of them.

8
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,208
-Here we go.

9
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,229
[crashing sound]

10
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:43,000
-[yells]

11
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:46,204
-His skills are too advanced.

12
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,005
He's too powerful.

13
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,840
There' no way to defeat him.

14
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:52,880
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I'm not giving up.

15
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:55,850
I've still got this.

16
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,820
NARUTO: Sasuke!

17
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:03,360
-[yells] So that was your plan.

18
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:06,698
Not bad, Naruto.

19
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,299
-Huh?

20
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:24,655
-Demon wind shuriken,
windmill of shadows.

21
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:27,559
-[gasps]

22
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:32,766
-[gasps]

23
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,536
-A shuriken?

24
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,337
You'll never touch me with that.

25
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,384
-[grunts]

26
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:46,985
-Hmm?

27
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:55,463
So you passed the clone
and aimed for my real body.

28
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,298
Smart.

29
00:03:57,331 --> 00:04:00,136
But not smart enough.

30
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,906
Huh?

31
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,478
A second shuriken in
the shadow of the first.

32
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:09,949
The shadow shuriken jutsu.

33
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,085
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): The
second shuriken's on target.

34
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,288
And he can't catch this one.

35
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,970
-I told you a shuriken
can't touch me.

36
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:30,109
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He dodged it!

37
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,845
-Hmm.

38
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,783

40
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:40,756
-What?

41
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,625
-Eat this!

42
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,429
Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior.

43
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,238
-[grunts] Huh?

44
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:03,519

50
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:17,438
-I'll destroy you.

51
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:18,439

54
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,394
-Kakashi Sensei.

55
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:44,908
KAKASHI: Naruto, that
was an excellent plan.

56
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:47,211
You've really
grown, haven't you?

57
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:51,918
--[laughs] I knew I couldn't
beat him with my shadow clones.

58
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,520
That was just to distract him.

59
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,989
While he fought the clones,
I turned into the demon wind

60
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,957
shuriken.

61
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,992
He didn't know what to do.

62
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:58,792
Believe it.

63
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,682
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
used one of the clones

64
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,151
to transform into the shuriken.

65
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,141
When I threw it to Sasuke, it
looked like a real shuriken.

66
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,678
NARUTO: Sasuke!

67
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,914
-[yells]

68
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,518
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke could
tell it was me in a second.

69
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,654
He spun around so
no one could see

70
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,024
and pulled out his own shurken.

71
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,959
Now there were two shuriken.

72
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,894
One was real.

73
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:50,862
One was me.

74
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,874
-Demon wind shuriken,
windmill of shadows.

75
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:05,180
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I hid in
the shadow of the real shuriken.

76
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,785
And my target was
the real Zabuza.

77
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,388
-Of course, I knew that I
couldn't fight Zabuza myself.

78
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,990
That wasn't in the game plan.

79
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:14,693
I just wanted to get in there
and breakup his water prison.

80
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,932
I didn't know his clone
would be wrecked too.

81
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:18,966
That was a bonus.

82
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,401
Believe it.

83
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,068
-Don't brag.

84
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,337
You just lucked out.

85
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,406
-The whole thing
was just a fluke.

86
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,276
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): You
can call it a fluke,

87
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,178
but their teamwork was flawless.

88
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,514
They knew what to do without
even talking about it.

89
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,152
Most of the time, they act
like they hate each other.

90
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,256
And yet, they're a perfect team.

91
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,961
-I got distracted and lost
my grip on the water prison.

92
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,230
-Don't flatter yourself.

93
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,899
You weren't distracted.

94
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,569
You were forced to let go.

95
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:48,906
-Huh.

96
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,442
-Hmm.

97
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:55,081
-[chuckles]

98
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:57,317
-Your technique
worked on me once.

99
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,387
But it won't work again.

100
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,623
So what's it going to be?

101
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,240
-Sakura, you know what to do.

102
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:22,751
-[grunts]

103
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,722

Water style.

114
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,009
Water dragon jutsu.

-[yells]

116
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,319
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Wow, so many hand signs.

117
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:09,192
And he mirrored them all
perfectly, instantly.

118
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,927
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
What are they doing?

119
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:11,896
Is that a ninjutsu?

120
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,512
-[grunting]

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,889

Something isn't right.

-(TOGETHER) [speaking Japanese]

123
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,833
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
The Sharingan

124
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:43,270
can comprehend and replicate
the enemy's technique.

125
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:45,840
However--

126
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:46,442
-Tori!

127
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:51,981
Water style.

128
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:53,551
Water dragon jutsu.

129
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:57,723
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): --both
jutsu occurred simultaneously.

130
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:58,725
Could he?

131
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:18,231
-[grunting]

132
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:26,642

-Huh.

137
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,100
Huh.

138
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,440
-He's not just following.

139
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:54,179
He moves the same
way at the same time.

140
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,747
-How's he doing that?

141
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,716
How, Sasuke?

142
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,593
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
My movements.

143
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:11,134
It's as if-- it's as
if he knows what I'm--

144
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,738
-Going to do next?

145
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,772
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): What?

146
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:17,676
Is he reading my mind as well?

147
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,485
He looks at me with that eye.

148
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,256
-It makes you
furious, doesn't it?

149
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:33,431
-Huh.

150
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:36,635
All you're doing is
copying me like a monkey.

151
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:39,573
-(TOGETHER) You can't
beat me with cheap tricks.

152
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,141
I'll crush you.

153
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,778
-When I finish with
you, you'll never

154
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,714
open that monkey mouth again.

155
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,889
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
What is that?

156
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,367
It's me.

157
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,134
But how?

158
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,669
Is it his illusion jutsu?

159
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:08,912
-Water style.

160
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:10,446
Giant vortex jutsu.

-What?

162
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,368
Impossible!

[yells]

164
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:35,379
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): I was
just about to create a vortex,

165
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,050
but he created one first.

166
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,854
[yells]

167
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,059
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): He copies my
jutsu before I can even do it.

168
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,661
I can't keep up!

ZABUZA: How?

173
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:02,729
Can you see into the future?

174
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:03,997
-Yes.

175
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,635

-[chuckles] You were right.

182
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,637
It was his last battle.

183
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,662

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,021
-[gasps]

187
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:21,934
-No vital signs.

188
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:28,677
-Thank you.

189
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,415
I've been tracking
Zabuza for a long time,

190
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,788
waiting for this chance
to finally take him down.

191
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,692
-By your mask, I see
that you're a tracker

192
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:44,464
ninja from the Village
Hidden in the Mist.

193
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:45,666
-Impressive.

194
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:49,136
You're well informed.

195
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,405
-A tracker!

196
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,541
-Naruto, you don't
even know what that is.

197
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,744
You missed the lesson
on it, as usual.

198
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,147
Tracker ninja have
a special role.

199
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,749
Try coming to class some time.

200
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,019
SAKURA: When a rogue ninja
breaks away from his village,

201
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,356
he carries all kinds
of secrets with him,

202
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,924
the secrets of his people.

203
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,129
Trackers are specially trained
to hunt down these ninja

204
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,698
and eliminate them.

205
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:14,104
That way, the secrets of
their people remain secrets.

206
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,506
-That's correct.

207
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm a member of
the elite tracking

208
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,444
unit of the Village
Hidden in the Mist.

209
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,916
It was my duty to stop Zabuza.

210
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,851
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
From his size and voice,

211
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:28,488
he must be the
same age as Naruto.

212
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,091
Yet, he's an elite assassin?

213
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:41,240
He's no ordinary
kid, but what is he?

214
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,758
-[growls]

215
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:08,509
-[growls]

216
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,378
-What is this?

217
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,214
Who do you think you are?

218
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,160
Did you hear me?

219
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,063
-Easy, Naruto.

220
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,465
He's not our enemy.

221
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,366
-Huh?

222
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,635
That's not the point.

223
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:30,105
Did you see what he
did, just like that?

224
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:34,543
Zabuza was huge and powerful
like some kind of monster.

225
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:37,381
And this kid, who's
no bigger than me,

226
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:41,520
he brought down Zabuza with
one move like it was nothing.

227
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,756
I mean, what does that make us?

228
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,491
We're just fumbling around.

229
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,194
We don't know anything.

230
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:52,334
How can I accept that?

231
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:55,438
-Well, even if you
don't accept it,

232
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:58,375
still it did happen, Naruto.

233
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:07,620
In this world, there are
kids who are younger than you

234
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:11,059
and yet stronger than me.

235
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,367
-[grumbles]

236
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,256
-Your struggle is over for now.

237
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,126
I must deal with the remains.

238
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,296
There are many
secrets in this body.

239
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:42,300
They must not be allowed to
get into the wrong hands.

240
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,206
Please excuse me.

241
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:47,808
Farewell.

242
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,384
-He disappeared.

243
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:55,985
-Hmm.

244
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,662
He's gone, Naruto.

245
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:04,963
Let it go.

246
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:12,373
--[growls] What
are we doing here?

247
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,642
We're nothing!

248
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,210
I can't believe it!

249
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,049
-Naruto.

250
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,865
-As ninja, the things we
encounter are never easy.

251
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,935
Save you're anger
for the next enemy.

252
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,280
We haven't completed
our mission yet.

253
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:44,816
We still have to get
the bridge builder

254
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:45,850
to his bridge.

255
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:52,159
--[laughs] Sorry I caused
all this trouble for ya.

256
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:56,165
But you can rest at my house
when we get to the village.

257
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:56,899
-All right.

258
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,201
Let's get a move on.

259
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,548
-(TOGETHER) [gasps]

260
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:12,620
-[gasps]

261
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:13,388
-What?

262
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,158
What happened?

263
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,159
-Kakashi Sensei.

264
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,271
Kakashi Sensei!

265
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,954
[Music: Akeboshi, "Wind"]

266
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,576
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What do we do?

267
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,642
What do we do?

268
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,545
Kakashi Sensei is out cold.

269
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:15,393
And Gato's men are sure
to come looking for us.

270
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,360
How are we going to
fight them by ourselves?

271
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,995
We've got to train
to get stronger?

272
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,296
How's climbing trees
going to help us?

273
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:27,232
Well, if Kakashi Sensei
says it will work.

274
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:29,107
Next time, the Forest of Chakra.

275
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,007
I'll be kicking butt again.

276
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,073
Believe it.
