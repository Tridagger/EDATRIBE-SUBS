00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,766
[theme music]

2
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,639
-Sarutobi, let me
remove the blade.

3
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:19,006
A fitting end for
one who had mastered

4
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,673
the way of the shinobi.

5
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,173
-My arms feel as
if they are fire.

6
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:32,973
-No, Orochimaru!

7
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,606
-Our mission has failed.

8
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,573
Release the barrier.

9
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,539
Take me back.

10
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:40,539
-Right!

11
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,039
Release.

12
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,906
-Look, the barrier!

13
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,473
-It's gone.

14
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,506
Where's Lord Hokage?

15
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:57,839
-Let's go.

16
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:58,473
Stop them.

17
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:03,973
-Ninja art, spiderweb net.

18
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:08,639
-Watch out.

19
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:09,406
A chakra web.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,906
And we flew right into it.

21
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,906
-Kakashi, they are pulling out.

22
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:15,973
We should go after them.

23
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:16,906
-Wait, Guy.

24
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,373
I'm not so sure.

25
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,873
-That's right.

26
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,773
Let's not be too hasty.

27
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:25,439
If we rush in, we might
get snared in their traps.

28
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,939
-What are you suggesting,
then, that we simply

29
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,939
stand here and let the swine
escape, after what they've

30
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,539
done to our village?

31
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:35,373
That's not the Leaf shinobi way.

32
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:39,739
-So, you propose that we
do nothing, eh Kabuto?

33
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:47,006
-Well, aren't you
the clever one.

34
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,106
Time to call it a day.

35
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,039
Are you going to run
away from me again?

36
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:54,073
-That would be too obvious.

37
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,806
Why should I show
my hand when it's

38
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,273
so much more fun
keeping you in the dark?

39
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,706
That eye of yours can't
see everything, can it?

40
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,773
Unlike the Uchiha clan, you
haven't mastered it yet.

41
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:14,539
Oh well.

42
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:26,473
-Temari.

43
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,039
-Kankuro!

44
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,106
-I'll leave her with you.

45
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:07,106
-Wait, what do I?

46
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:07,606
Oh.

47
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:23,439
GAARA (VOICEOVER): What could
it be that makes him so strong?

48
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,073
I will not disappear.

49
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,473
I will not cease to exist.

50
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:31,973
I won't!

51
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:55,706
-What are you doing?

52
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,273
I told you not to talk to him.

53
00:05:58,306 --> 00:05:59,406
-Let's get out of here.

54
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,306
-Watch out, it's him again.

55
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,506
Why don't you just go away?

56
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,939
Go away, you, you freak!

57
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,506
-Freak!

58
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,006
-Freak!

59
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:29,573
-Freak!

60
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,239
Why don't you die!

61
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:32,939
-He's a monster.

62
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:37,373
Don't even look at him.

63
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,873
-I told you to
stay away from him.

64
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:44,839
-Go away.

65
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,639
-It's all a distant
memory now. "Why

66
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,106
do I exist," I used
to asked myself.

67
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,673
-But I knew that
something else had

68
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:28,039
been taken from me--
something even more important.

69
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,873
And that is when
I truly despaired.

70
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:36,006
My purpose, in all the world,
there was no one who needed me.

71
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:36,973
I was unnecessary.

72
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,006
-No, stay away!

73
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:52,906
-It's almost
unbearable, isn't it?

74
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:58,339
The feeling of being all alone.

75
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,306
I know that feeling.

76
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:06,706
I've been there, in that
dark and lonely place.

77
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:10,573
But now there are others-- other
people who mean a lot to me.

78
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:17,173
I care more about
them than I do myself.

79
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,639
And I won't let
anyone hurt them.

80
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:22,606
That's why I won't ever give up.

81
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,006
I will stop you, even
if I have to kill you.

82
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,806
-Why?

83
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,239
Why would you do this
for anyone but yourself?

84
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:36,406
-Because they saved
me from myself.

85
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,606
They rescued my
from my loneliness.

86
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,806
There were the first to
accept me for who I am.

87
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,006
They are my friends.

88
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,706
-Well, love is
the heart's desire

89
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:58,339
to serve someone who's precious
to you, to watch over them,

90
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:01,506
like my sister
did for you Gaara.

91
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,706
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
Love, is that the thing

92
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:08,773
that makes him so strong?

93
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,373
-Naruto, that's enough.

94
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,306
Look, Sakura's going
to be all right.

95
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,573
The sand crumbled away.

96
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,706
She's free.

97
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,706
This guy's chakra
is all used up.

98
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:26,539
-That's a relief.

99
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,006
-That's enough.

100
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,506
It's over.

101
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,506
-But Gaara.

102
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,673
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): I
never thought I'd see this.

103
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:46,973
He's had it.

104
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:48,206
All right, Gaara.

105
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,539
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Who
knows, Naruto Uzumaki?

106
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:28,306
Perhaps even I, some day.

107
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,573
Temari.

108
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:38,573
Kankuro, I'm sorry.

109
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,673
-Don't worry about it.

110
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,805
-It's raining.

111
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:50,771
-Even the heavens weep.

112
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:53,771
-We are gathered here
to remember and honor

113
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:57,571
not only the third Hokage,
but all those who sacrificed

114
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:01,805
themselves in this battle so
that our village would survive.

115
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:04,338
(VOICEOVER) So
it's come to pass.

116
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:07,071
In the end, all we
could do was watch.

117
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,371
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Why
did it have to happen?

118
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,538
Why did someone so
good have to die?

119
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:33,038
Why?

120
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,005
-[weeping]

121
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:04,038
-It's hard to believe
it's been a year already.

122
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:06,271
Your instructors tell
me you're among the most

123
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:10,671
playful of their students,
always full of fun.

124
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:11,738
You're very brave.

125
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,005
It's hard to hide
sadness behind laughter.

126
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,671
-What makes you think
I'm sad about anything?

127
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,705
It's a noble thing to die
in the line of duty, right?

128
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:24,371
My parents gave their lives to
protect this place from the fox

129
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,205
demon and the son of heroes.

130
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:30,171
How can I be sad when
they died that way?

131
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:34,438
I'm not even sad because they
went and left me all alone.

132
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,171
If I cry, it's
because I'm proud.

133
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,805
-It's all right, Haruka.

134
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,238
I know that somewhere
inside of you, there's

135
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:47,038
a boy curled up
in a ball of pain.

136
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:49,705
But remember this,
you are not alone.

137
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:56,238
Inside every ninja of
the Hidden Leaf Village

138
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,171
burns the will of fire.

139
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:59,605
-The will of fire?

140
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:03,905
-It's what gives us the
strength to defend our village.

141
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:08,005
It's the unbreakable bond
that ties us all together.

142
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:11,505
It's what makes us a family.

143
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:18,371
I wonder, do you have it
yet, young as you are?

144
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,438
-I think so.

145
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,871
-[weeping]

146
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:43,771
-Are those for Hayate?

147
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:50,671
Better make it quick.

148
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:54,971
The Hokage's funeral
has already begun.

149
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,071
-And you, Kakashi?

150
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,438
Paying respects to Obito?

151
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,805
Instead of constantly inventing
new excuses for being late,

152
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,438
why don't you simply
come here earlier.

153
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:09,538
-I did.

154
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,105
I've been here since dawn.

155
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:19,271
This place makes me think of the
mistakes I've made in the past.

156
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,105
And I've made so many of them.

157
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,871
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
It's a shinobi rule.

158
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,105
Never show your feeling.

159
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:02,838
Keep your mind focused on
your mission, no matter what.

160
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,538
No matter how much
you're hurting inside,

161
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:06,738
you can't shed a tear.

162
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:12,805
Iruka sensei, why do they do it?

163
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:18,138
Why do people risk their
lives for other people?

164
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:24,205
-Well, when someone
passes away, it's the end.

165
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:28,338
His past and future, all
the dreams he once had,

166
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:31,705
they disappear along with him.

167
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:35,905
This is true even if he
died honorably in battle,

168
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:41,838
as so many have, as Hayate did.

169
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,938
All the ties that
bind him to the living

170
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:49,205
are severed-- all but one, the
most important of all, people.

171
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:55,605
Parents, siblings,
friends, lovers,

172
00:18:55,638 --> 00:19:00,005
the people who were
important to him.

173
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,771
And these people,
the ones left behind,

174
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,638
are joined together
in a great circle

175
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:09,071
by their shared memories
of him-- a circle

176
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,738
of friendship, trust,
and sacrifice that

177
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:16,138
grows larger and
stronger as time passes.

178
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,238
It's hard to explain it.

179
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,638
We remain in the
circle together.

180
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,938
We have no choice.

181
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:24,238
It's important to us.

182
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,771
-So we do it because we have to.

183
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,338
I get it.

184
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:30,838
Sort of.

185
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:37,138
Still, I'm sad he's gone.

186
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:40,838
-Think how sad it would be
if he'd died for nothing.

187
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:44,905
But he left us
something priceless.

188
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,138
Don't worry.

189
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,671
You'll understand
one of these days.

190
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,738
-Hey, give me some credit.

191
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,171
That much I get.

192
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:56,938
-The rain.

193
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,805
It's stopped.

194
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:09,271
-By Iruka sensei.

195
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,338
See you later.

196
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:11,738
-All right.

197
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:16,071
(VOICEOVER) Do you see it, Lord
Hokage, the [? will ?] of fire

198
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:18,105
is stronger than ever.

199
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:22,771
The sparks you left behind
have kindled the flame

200
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,571
among the young leaves
of the next generation.

201
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,771
A mighty flame, Lord Hokage.

202
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,771
It will burn brightly.

203
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,705
And it will shine its
light upon our village

204
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:36,538
and keep it warm and safe
for many years to come.

205
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:47,205
And some day, out of that new
flame will come a new Hokage.

206
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,705
-Well, it survived.

207
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:56,438
But barely.

208
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:00,038
The damage is extensive.

209
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,805
-Not long ago, he was at
the height of its glory.

210
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:04,971
Look at him now.

211
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,905
-You sound almost sad.

212
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:15,805
Don't tell me you still have
feelings for your old home?

213
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:18,705
-No, none.

214
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:31,359
[theme music]

215
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:00,426
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
The ritual is over

216
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:03,259
and all is covered
in a somber mist.

217
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,659
And silence.

218
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:07,359
From out of the mist,
a shadow emerges.

219
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:10,759
And from out of the
shadow, a sharpened fang.

220
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:14,392
It rips the years away and
awakens childhood memories

221
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:19,292
of disappointment, anger,
and a fateful decision.

222
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:22,059
The wheel of destiny
begins to turn.

223
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:28,992
Next time, Return
of the Morning Mist.
