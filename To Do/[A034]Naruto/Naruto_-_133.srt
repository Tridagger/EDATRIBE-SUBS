[theme music]

3
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,951
-That's Naruto.

4
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:14,618
What is this power?

5
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,785
And what was that red chakra?

6
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,351
Is he some kind of monster?

7
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:25,651
I've had enough of this.

8
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,585
What the heck are you?

9
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,218
-I'm your friend.

10
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,518
That's why I'm telling you.

11
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,751
I'm not going to let
the likes of Orochimaru

12
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:35,885
get a hold of you.

13
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,851
And if you won't
listen to reason,

14
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:41,485
then I'll break every
bone in your body.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Fire Style.

00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:30,151
Fire Ball Jutsu.

17
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,518
-Now let's go.

18
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,418
Enough is enough.

19
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,718
Snap out of it already.

20
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:21,718
If you don't come
to your senses,

21
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,951
then I'm just going to have
to break all your bones

22
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,818
and drag you back
to the village.

23
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,451
So get up, Sasuke.

24
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:38,151
-Just shut up for once.

25
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,985
What the heck do
you know about it?

26
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:46,251
It's not like you ever had
a family in the first place.

27
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,651
You were on your own
right from the beginning.

28
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:51,351
What makes you think you
know anything about it, huh?

29
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,085
I'm suffering now,
because I had those ties.

30
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:00,951
How on earth could you
possibly understand

31
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,185
what it feels like
to lose all that?

32
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,951
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): It's true.

33
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,518
I have no idea what it's like
having parents or a brother.

34
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,118
IRUKA: It's my treat today.

35
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:41,485
Eat as much as you want.

36
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:43,685
-All right.

37
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,885
Whenever I'm with
Iruka Sensei, I wonder.

38
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,718
-(BOTH) Down the hatch.

39
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,118
-First of all, a ninja's
got to have sustenance.

40
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,318
-Hey, take it easy.

41
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,818
Don't wolf it down so fast.

42
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,818
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I wonder if that's

43
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:07,251
what it feels like
to have a father.

44
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:12,651
And when I'm with you--
whatever, you moron.

45
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:16,485
-What the heck is your
problem, you loser?

46
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:18,951
-There's no way I'm
going to lose to you.

47
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:19,785
-Yeah.

48
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,018
Keep talking.

49
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,018
[laughing] Gotcha.

50
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:24,851
-Just get off me.

51
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,418
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I wonder if this

52
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,585
is what it feels like
to have a brother.

53
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:36,051
-Why, Naruto?

54
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,951
Why would you go so far for me?

55
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:41,285
NARUTO: Because this
is the first time

56
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,918
I've ever had a bond like this.

57
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:07,485
That's why I'll do
anything I can to stop you.

58
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:18,985
-It's too late, Naruto.

59
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:22,651
It's just too late.

60
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:23,951
I can't turn back.

61
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,618
Come, Naruto.

62
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:46,418
If that's how it is, I'll
just have to sever that bond.

63
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:57,418
-Severe it just like that, huh.

64
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:02,685
Then why do you even bother
wearing that headband anymore?

65
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:04,551
-I'll admit it.

66
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,718
You're definitely strong.

67
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:10,285
It's because you know the
pain that solitude brings,

68
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:11,718
just as I do.

69
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,918
It's that very pain that
makes you and I stronger,

70
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:19,218
Naruto, which means if I
can just break that bond.

71
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,918
I'll be able to achieve
even greater strength.

72
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:27,785
It's time you and I
had this out as equals.

73
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:30,218
But you're still not
going to be able to lay

74
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,351
even a single scratch
on my forehead.

75
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,285
I know that hasn't
changed at least.

76
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,585
-Fine.

77
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,885
Guess there's no point
in talking anymore.

78
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,418
Sasuke.

79
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:47,151
-Enough.

80
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,085
No more words.

81
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:52,451
From here on out, we
stick to fighting.

82
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:52,951
Come.

83
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:06,585
I can see.

84
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:30,351
His moves that were too fast for
me before, I can see them now.

85
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:33,551
I can see.

86
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,318
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
His moves, they're

87
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,685
totally different from
just a few moments ago.

88
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,851
Not like it matters.

89
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,551
I don't care what his deal is.

90
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,551
I can't afford to lose here.

91
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,418
-It must be the influence
of the Curse Mark again.

92
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:11,918
With every step, every
subtle shift in his momentum,

93
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,885
the image of his next move
becomes vividly clear.

94
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,885
As long I have
these eyes, I don't

95
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,951
need to expend any chakra.

96
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:36,085
The Curse Mark would
eat up too much of it.

97
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,418
With vision like
this, I can make out

98
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:42,285
the image of Naruto's every
move before it happens

99
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,218
and time my attacks accordingly.

100
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:06,318
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

101
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:09,518
He's totally reading
my movements.

102
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:11,151
What do I do?

103
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,394
-Oh there you are?

104
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,561
Are you sure it's this way?

105
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:32,928
-Yep.

106
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,361
We better pick up the pace.

107
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,561
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

108
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:33,494
NARUTO: Sasuke!

109
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,194
SASUKE: Fire Style!

110
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:47,328
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

111
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:36,728
-(HOARSELY) Sasuke.

112
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:45,828
-It's too late, Naruto.

113
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,361
It's too late now.

114
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:47,828
Naruto!

115
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:28,094
[gagging]

116
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,594
-You runt.

117
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:04,561
You really are weak.

118
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:10,028
[laughing]

119
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:18,242
You better be grateful to me and
to your beloved Fourth Hokage,

120
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,494
who sealed me inside
a twerp like you.

121
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,448
-Wha-- What is--

122
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,961
What was that?

123
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:17,961
I can still read his
movements, but this chakra,

124
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:23,661
it's-- it's almost like
it has a mind of its own.

125
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,761
Even my eyes can't follow it.

126
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:30,228
That red aura, that's
no ordinary chakra.

127
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,261
-I know that he's the
one you're really after.

128
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:37,794
-You're right.

129
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:41,361
Naruto is the prize that
the Akatsuki are after.

130
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,561
And we will have him.

131
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,428
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I see.

132
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:50,594
So you have some kind
of special power then.

133
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,528
I think I understand now.

134
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:05,394
Fire Style.

135
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,894
Fire Ball Jutsu!

136
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,794
That chakra is protecting him.

137
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,361
Calm down.

138
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:36,361
As long as I keep my
distance, I'll be fine.

139
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:36,694
What is he?

140
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:38,394
All I can do is dodge.

141
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:11,294
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Please
just let me make it in time.

142
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:25,728
[laughing]

143
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:30,328
-Oh well, no getting
around it, I guess.

144
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:35,028
Once I go ahead and let
this power take over, I--

145
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,861
I'm not all that sure
what'll happen to me in end,

146
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:43,061
but you're not leaving me a
lot of choice here, Naruto.

147
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,894
There's no question
that you're special.

148
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:08,861
Unfortunately, you're not
quite as special as I am.

149
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,361
[laughing]

150
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:14,861
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

151
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:32,136
[theme music]

152
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:04,837
NARUTO: My whole body
hurts, and on top of that,

153
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,337
I've lost all feeling
in my left arm.

154
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:14,004
It looks like this power isn't
going to last me forever.

155
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:15,971
But it doesn't matter.

156
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,171
I can't give up.

157
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:23,837
This next blow will be the last.

158
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:27,804
Next time, "The End of Tears."
