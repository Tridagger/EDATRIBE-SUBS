00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,582
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I got you.

00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:05,015
[grunt]

00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:08,515
[barking]

5
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,015
-Dang it.

6
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,982
What's going on here?

7
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,648
[barking]

8
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:17,015
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I know I
hit him, but nothing happened.

9
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,248
And where the hell did
that attack come from?

10
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:26,448
-Get ready, Akamaru.

11
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:29,448
We'll hit him from both
sides with Fang Over Fang.

12
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,415
[bark]

13
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,048
Let's do it.

14
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:39,882
Fang Over Fang!

15
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:43,282
-Summoning jutsu!

16
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,748
-That's not good.

17
00:02:55,782 --> 00:02:57,248
Oh well.

18
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:59,682
-I'll play a little
melody of death for you.

19
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,082
[grunting]

20
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,715
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
What's with this guy?

21
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,448
What the?

22
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,248
[chuckling]

23
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,815
-Why this is perfect, Sakon.

24
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,882
There's one of them
for each of us.

25
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,248
-It's hard to believe
the four of them

26
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,415
are taking this much time.

27
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,915
Do you think the
Leaf Village sent

28
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,315
some of their heavy
hitters after them?

29
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,348
Or are they just wasting
time playing around?

30
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,182
[chuckling]

31
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,748
-I can guess who's
slowing them down.

32
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:46,415
It's either Jirobo with
his appetite or Kidomaru

33
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,482
and his penchant for play.

34
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:54,315
-But Sakon's the most dangerous
with that temper of his.

35
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,648
He's never satisfied until his
opponent his dead, even when he

36
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,448
should leave things be.

37
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:02,348
Plus, he thinks he's the
strongest of the four,

38
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,515
so he's always showing off.

39
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,448
[chuckling]

40
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:07,982
-Oh, I don't know.

41
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:12,682
Tayuya's blood boils just
as hot as Sakon's does.

42
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:15,615
But in any case, nothing
will go wrong now

43
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:18,982
that we've sent him after them.

44
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:22,582
Kimimaro, he'll
clean up anything

45
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,915
that would prove
a nuisance to me.

46
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,582
You can be sure of that.

47
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:37,682
-Oh.

48
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:41,482
-You're not taking
Sasuke anywhere!

49
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,515
-There sure is a lot of
garbage scattered around here.

50
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:49,682
But trash is just
trash after all.

51
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:52,882
It simply needs
to be cleaned up.

52
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,248
-Shut your mouth.

53
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,448
-Come then.

54
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,348
-I'm gonna crush you!

55
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:18,748
[shout]

56
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:31,048

58
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:41,982
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): So
this is her melody of death.

59
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:56,848
[flute plays]

60
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,548
[gasp]

61
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:01,948
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): So she
controls him with that flute.

62
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:19,515
Darn it.

63
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:21,515
She keeps getting further away.

64
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,515
What do I do?

65
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,415
What do I do?

66
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:27,882
Aw, man.

67
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,015
This is not good.

68
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,415
-Akamaru!

69
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:44,215
-Ah hah.

70
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:46,348
So you're the real one, huh?

71
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,282
Multiple Fist Barrage!

72
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:53,115
Once more.

73
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,982
[chuckling]

74
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:03,115
My brother and I get
along really well.

75
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:06,115
Usually Ukon just
sleeps inside of me.

76
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:10,982
But when the moment calls
for it, he comes out to play.

77
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,315
KIBA (VOICEOVER): So
this is his ability.

78
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,582
-He can poke his arms,
legs and head out

79
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:19,648
of anywhere in my body, to
either attack or defend.

80
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,115
Just like this.

81
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:25,548
[barking]

82
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,548
-Multiple Legs Barrage!

83
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:35,682
Nothing more painful
than a three-legged kick.

84
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,948
Now try this on for--

85
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:39,982
-Enough, Sakon.

86
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:41,848
We don't have any
time to play around.

87
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,048
Let's wrap this up.

88
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:50,582
We're going to Phase Two.

89
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:54,915
-Oh all right.

90
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:02,348
You're always so
impatient, brother.

91
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:09,715
[whimpering]

92
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:10,948
-I gotcha.

93
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,248
You're thinking those horns
aren't just for display,

94
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,082
aren't you?

95
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:16,348
KIBA (VOICEOVER): You're right.

96
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,382
As soon as that
other guy popped out,

97
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,115
his chakra increased ten-fold.

98
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:24,182
Things seemed hopeless before,
but now we're really screwed.

99
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,582
[laughter]

100
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,915
-What are you in the
mood for, brother?

101
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:33,682
-Ripping him apart.

102
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:44,009
[shouting]

103
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:47,509
[grunting]

104
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:57,576
[punching sounds]

105
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,426
-All right.

106
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,626
I suppose it's time
to get serious.

107
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,726
I'm ending this fight right now.

108
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,492
-You're full of big talk, huh?

109
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:15,559
It's funny.

110
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,926
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

111
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,159
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
These guys are persistent,

112
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,092
but I'm starting to
get the picture here.

113
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,059
Still, this isn't
going to be a cakewalk.

114
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,259
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I
think we're finished.

115
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,426
[barking]

116
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,059
-What are you saying?

117
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,826
You're telling me
you want to try that?

118
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,926
[bark]

119
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,559
-We can't, Akamaru.

120
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,026
There's nobody
here to back us up.

121
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,192
It'd be way too dangerous.

122
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,859
You understand, don't you?

123
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,759
If we whip out that
jutsu, we'll use up

124
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,059
what little chakra we have left.

125
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:07,892
And when it's over we,
won't be able to move.

126
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:11,792
If we miss, we'll
have died for nothing.

127
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:16,359
[biting sound]

128
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:16,859
-Akamaru.

129
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,692
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I
must be a lovely master,

130
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,126
for you to bite me like that.

131
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,592
OK, Akamaru.

132
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,526
It's just like you said.

133
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,992
We're all out of options.

134
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,659
Wolf Fang over Fang it is.

135
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:42,159
[barking]

136
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:48,659
[grunting]

137
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,659
[chuckling]

138
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,659
-Heh.

139
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,826
-Huh?

140
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:54,959
-Now, Akamaru.

141
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:56,326
[barking]

142
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,559
-Huh?

143
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,259
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Do
your thing, Akamaru.

144
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,059
Show 'em what all
that training was for.

145
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,859
-Dynamic Marking!

146
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:13,292
-What kind of cheap
trick is that?

147
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,892
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
OK, we're good to go.

148
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,192
-Inuzuka Style!

149
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,459
Man Beast Transformation Combo!

150
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:30,092
[roar]

151
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:30,826
-Two Headed Wolf!

152
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,526
[chuckling]

153
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,126
-All of that flourish
and it's nothing

154
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,126
but a big, slobbering mongrel.

155
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,159
-What could that
mutt possibly do?

156
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,059
-Take this!

157
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:57,692
-The drool!

158
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:58,592
-Sakon, you idiot!

159
00:11:58,626 --> 00:11:59,692
On your right!

160
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:00,992
-Son of a--

161
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:02,926
-Wolf Fang Over Fang!

162
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:23,092
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Heh.

163
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,892
How'd you like that?

164
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,892
Wolf Fang Over Fang's
revolution speed

165
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:31,026
is so intense we can't see
anything while we're attacking.

166
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,726
But it'll cut you even
without direct contact.

167
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,359
And if it hits you, you'll
be ripped to shreds.

168
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:37,859
-Huh?

169
00:12:47,859 --> 00:13:00,259
[gasp]

170
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:00,826
-Heh.

171
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:01,626
Careful, kid.

172
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,626
Don't get ahead of yourself.

173
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,959
-This is perfect.

174
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,226
We were just thinking it'd
be a good idea to separate.

175
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,559
KIBA (VOICEOVER): What the hell?

176
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,226
He split in two!

177
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,559
-It's true, If we had taken
the full brunt of that attack,

178
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,192
it would have been bad.

179
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:21,392
-But now the real battle begins.

180
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,492
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

181
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:25,259
[whimpering]

182
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,392
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, I know, Akamaru.

183
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,392
Only one more chance
for Wolf Fang Over Fang.

184
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,726
The next shot will be our last.

185
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,059
[bark]

186
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,626
KIBA (VOICEOVER): This
time they're going down.

187
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,592
-Wolf Fang Over Fang.

188
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,392
It's no use hiding.

189
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,292
I told you.

190
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,826
We're not using our eyes.

191
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,992
We marked you earlier on.

192
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,892
So now we can track
you just by scent.

193
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,292
-Summoning jutsu!

194
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:05,792
Rashomon!

195
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,492
-Impressive Rashomon
is our greatest defense

196
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,292
for lord Orochimaru.

197
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:29,326
And for him to
dent it like that--

198
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,259
-But it doesn't matter.

199
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:36,659
[laughter]

200
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:37,592
-This is the end!

201
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,526
[whimper]

202
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,926
-Akamaru!

203
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,059
KIBA (VOICEOVER): No.

204
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:52,726
You were trying to protect me.

205
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,226
-He did it again!

206
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,359
Ugh!

207
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,026
My eyes!

208
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,326
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

209
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,459
-This is worse
than the last time.

210
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,992
It's some sort of acid.

211
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:07,126
My eyeballs feel
like they're burning!

212
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,426
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
Where'd the other one go?

213
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:09,926
-Boo.

214
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:14,492
Looking for someone, kid?

215
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,526
[groaning]

216
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,192
-Go wash your eyes
in that river.

217
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,826
I'll take care of the rest.

218
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,692
A unique ability, I know.

219
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,159
Helps with assassination.

220
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,526
A sharp sense of smell
and a set of claws

221
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,726
aren't going to be
enough to beat me.

222
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,759
Face it.

223
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:39,426
You're in over your
head, little dog.

224
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,326
You know that he
network in our bodies

225
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,292
through which chakra
passes is deeply

226
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,692
interwoven with our
organs, do you not?

227
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,892
It's an intricate maze threaded
through the tissues that

228
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,526
make up our organs.

229
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,926
The cells that
make those tissues.

230
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,926
Even within each
individual protein,

231
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,392
the very building
blocks of our cells.

232
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:05,759
Once in stage two,
I'm able to use chakra

233
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,359
to dismantle and
reconstruct these cells

234
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,159
and proteins at will.

235
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:13,526
Breaking my body down
into tiny particles,

236
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,792
I seep into my opponent, then
return to my original form

237
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,926
inside their body.

238
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,459
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Akamaru.

239
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,592
Sorry, Akamaru.

240
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:28,692
We've always been a team,
together, wherever we went.

241
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,259
[barking]

242
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,526
-Good boy.

243
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,092
Yeah.

244
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:39,926
That'll do it.

245
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,759
Of course, it's lucky for
us that the people caught

246
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,159
in that trap had
an earth scroll.

247
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:49,892
And now we're going to be the
first ones to reach the tower.

248
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,526
[whimpering]

249
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,359
-Yeah.

250
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,259
Something just the little guy.

251
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,626
I have no idea.

252
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,359
Akamaru has the
ability to sniff out

253
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,459
the level of an enemy's chakra.

254
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,559
But, man.

255
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,959
I've never seen him this
scared by it before.

256
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:14,492
Whoever those ninja up ahead
are, they aren't normal guys.

257
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,626
-Now the seventh match.

258
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:20,326
Naruto Uzumaki and Kiba Inzuka.

259
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,992
-Wait a second.

260
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:21,792
Are you kidding me?

261
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:22,792
What's the puppy doing here?

262
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,426
He's just going
to get in the way.

263
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,492
-Deal with it!

264
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,026
I never go into to
battle without Akamaru!

265
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,892
[barking]

266
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:30,926
-All right.

267
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,792
Come on, Akamaru.

268
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,259
[barking]

269
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,759
-Take this!

270
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:42,159
[grunting]

271
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,592
[barking]

272
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:54,059
-He fell for it!

273
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:58,259
Naruto, if I were you,
I'd let Akamaru go.

274
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:07,326
[growling]

275
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,659
[roar]

276
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,359
-What the heck happened?

277
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,192
What was that thing you fed him?

278
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,259
How come all his
fur just turned red?

279
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:22,026
-Are you sure you want to
stick around to find out?

280
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,526
Let's go, Akamaru!

281
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,626
[barking]

282
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:26,426
-Beast Mimicry!

283
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,092
Man Beast Clones!

284
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,092
[growling]

285
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,559
-Let's finish this now.

286
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:43,526
On All Fours jutsu!

287
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,926
Now I gotcha.

288
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,026
Man Beast Ultimate Taijutsu!

289
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,926
Fang Over Fang!

290
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:24,992
[scream]

291
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:31,092
[scream]

292
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:35,159
[whimper]

293
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:37,059
[barking]

294
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,459
-Akamaru.

295
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,326
[bark]

296
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,992
-Have a food pill.

297
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:48,726
[bark]

298
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,592
[roar]

299
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,559
-OK.

300
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,592
Ninja Art.

301
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,126
Human Mimicry.

302
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,626
[bark]

303
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:04,592
[growling]

304
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:14,526
-Fang Over Fang!

305
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:25,726
But, I think this time
we're sunk, old friend.

306
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,292
-My cells are swimming
freely throughout your body.

307
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:32,359
I can even generate parts
that are solely yours.

308
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:36,492
In other words, we're
slowly fusing together.

309
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,592
We'll be sharing a body.

310
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,192
-Sharing a body?

311
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:43,659
-That's right.

312
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:47,226
I'm going to snuff out of
your life as only I can.

313
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,892
By eradicating all the cells in
your body from the inside out.

314
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:52,659
-I see.

315
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,226
In that case--

316
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:03,726
-Huh?

317
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:11,426
[groaning]

318
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,492
-What if I do this?

319
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:14,359
Then what happens?

320
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,292
-Suicide?

321
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:19,992
you're crazy!

322
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,992
-Time for you to die.

323
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:37,008
[theme music]

324
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,096
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Who is this guy?

325
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,063
What's with this Kekkai Genkai?

326
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,463
[grunt] I've never seen or
heard of anything like this.

327
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:16,096
Doesn't even matter how
many of me there are.

328
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,296
I can't even scratch the guy.

329
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,396
I don't know what the deal
is with the five dances,

330
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,163
but there is one
thing I do know.

331
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:26,763
I'll stop every one of 'em!

332
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:30,196
Next time-- to each
his own battle!
