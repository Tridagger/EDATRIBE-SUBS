You've got to protect
it with your life.

This is no ordinary

That thing-- as
you so nicely put

it-- is a famous

It's called the
Beauty of Nature,

00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,580
It is?

22
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,715
-It needs to go to Kale Avenue
where it will be exhibited.

23
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,452
See that it gets there safely.

the enormous safe?

25
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,458

You better let us take it.

187
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,313
We'll look after it for you.

188
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,615
-Thanks a lot, but
it's really not-- I--

189
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,484
I mean don't let
the safe fool ya.

190
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,152
It's nothing valuable.

191
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,053
Right?

192
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,288
-No, absolutely not.

193
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,024
There's nothing inside but
a worthless piece of junk.

194
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,025
Right buddy?

195
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:12,692
Isn't that right?

196
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,027
-Are you guys insane or what?

197
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,695
Don't you realize
that inside here

198
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,199
lies one of the most priceless
work of art ever created

199
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,166
by mortal hands?

200
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,001
Not valuable?

201
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,202
You ignorant clods.

202
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,604
The Beauty of Nature is more
precious than human life

203
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,072
itself.

204
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,340
You don't even deserve to be
on the same planet with it.

205
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,675
-What a piece of work.

206
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,276
Will you tell him to shut up?

207
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,412
-Buddy, ixnay on the eciouspray.

208
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,313
-Buddy?

209
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,748
I'm no buddy of yours.

210
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,649
How dare you call
The Beauty of Nature

211
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,251
a worthless piece of junk?

212
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,088
-So that thing's more
valuable than human life, huh?

213
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,759
-In that case, you'll understand
why we have to take you down.

214
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,194
[gasp]

215
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,629
-Ah, forgive me.

216
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,364
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I really have to be going.

217
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,232
I have a date.

-OK.

223
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,010
Kiba you stay with

224
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,312

draw these clowns away.

225
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,280
-All right.

226
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,014

-Oh no.

232
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,692
There's more of them and
they're trying to cut us off.

233
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,594
-Why are you running
away you coward?

234
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,695
I'm supposed to run.

235
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,164
You're supposed to
stand and fight.

237
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,035

-Yes ma'am.

244
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,154
It sure does sound
like a fight all right.

245
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,557
-(SIGHING) I wish they
wouldn't fight all the time.

246
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,025
-Yes you're right ma'am.

247
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,426

I knew I should have
taken charge of it myself.

What was I thinking?

00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,136
Leave these three
to Kiba and me.

362
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,939
You go after the leader and try
to keep him from getting away.

-All right.

376
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,509
Now for the last one.

377
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,210
-Let go of it.

378
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,144
Give it to me.

379
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,713
-No, never. [grunting]

00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,948
SHIN'EMON: Ugh.

381
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,549
-You ignorant fool.

382
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,185
You'll be lucky if I let you
walk away with your life.

383
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:38,786
Ahh.

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,655
[grunting]

385
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:45,926
-Give it back.

386
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,563
I'm warning you, give it back.

387
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,031

Ahh.

391
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,140
-You don't get it.

392
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,109
No one understands do they?

393
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,879
I'll be luckily to
walk away with my life?

394
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,481
How many times do
I have to say it?

395
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:10,784
No human life is as valuable
as The Beauty of Nature.

396
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,654
Not yours, not
mine, not anyone's.

397
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:15,923
Now do you understand
why I won't give up?

398
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,025
Because it doesn't matter
whether I live or die.

399
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:19,593
And it never did.

What's wrong?

409
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:42,516
Were they too much for you?

410
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,751
-Hardly.

411
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,819

-He's right.

422
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,805
We're finished if
we don't move fast.

-We still got a chance.

430
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,082
I'll toss it to you and
you can take it to safety.

Don't be an idiot.

Just climb over the rock

Forget about me.

436
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,792
Just hurry up and take it

his stinking tea cup,

467
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,750

-Hey, in case you
hadn't noticed,

482
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,228
we could have been killed.

-So what.

484
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,697
I thought you
ninja were supposed

You ignorant clods.

491
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,680
The Beauty of Nature is more
precious than human life

mine, not anyone's.

Now do you understand
why I won't give up?

505
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,677
Because it doesn't matter
whether I live or die

506
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,480

Sorry.

516
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:20,067
But I still think
there's nothing

517
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,835

It's a shame about
your national treasure.

-What are you gonna do?

530
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,515
Sit around and cry about it?

531
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,117
I didn't think you
ninja were supposed

532
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,618
to give up that easily.

533
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,954
-The priceless treasure
was lost forever.

534
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,455
There's no changing that.

535
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,591
-So I'll just have
to make another one.

-Huh?

537
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,693
-What are you talking about?

just make another one?

-Woah.

547
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,844
Wait a minute.

548
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:38,946
-Huh?

549
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:41,014
-So the national
treasure was you?

550
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:43,150
You're the one who
made that thing?

551
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:47,020
-But I thought you were,
you know, just a client.

00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:48,655
-What's wrong?

553
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,691
You never been hired by living
national treasure before?

You got a problem with that?

indomitable ninja spirit?

557
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,766
Cheer up you guys.

558
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,501
You got me here safe and sound.

559
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,470
And as we've all come
to learn, my life

560
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,839
is the greatest treasure of all.

561
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,975
So give yourselves a
big pat on the back.

562
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,643
You did a good job.

563
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,745
For Genin, that is.

564
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,013
Later.

565
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,615
I'm off to make another
priceless irreplaceable

566
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,449
masterpiece.

567
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,017
[laughs]

568
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,687
[music playing]

569
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:34,658
[theme music]

570
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,415
LADY TSUNADE: Your mission is to
help escort a captured renegade

571
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:06,550
to the capital.

572
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,151
NARUTO: What do
you mean, renegade?

573
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,686
LADY TSUNADE: He's from a
gang of rogue Shinobi who

574
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,454
no longer owe allegiance
to any master.

575
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,124
MAN: They have betrayed
their own ninja way.

576
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:15,425
The worst of the worst.

577
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,660
LADY TSUNADE: You all
understand the assignment?

578
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,195
WOMAN: You said a gang.

579
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:20,130
So chances are, his comrades
will try and free him.

580
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:21,164
LADY TSUNADE: Exactly.

581
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,332
And that's why I'm sending you.

582
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,167
To make sure they don't succeed.

583
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,669
GROUP: Right.

584
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,240
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
"The Enemy-- Ninja Drop-outs."

585
