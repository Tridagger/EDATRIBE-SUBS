00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,063
[groaning]

6
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,431
-I think I overdid
it with my Sharingan.

7
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,504
-Waking up, huh?

8
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:55,705
Are you all right?

9
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,608
-I've been better.

10
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:00,445
It'll be a week before
I can move normally.

11
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,918
-See, it's better if you
don't move, so just lie down.

12
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,287
[groaning]

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,988
-Right.

14
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:10,626
[groaning]

15
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,462
-Look, the Sensei's
coming around.

16
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:16,167
-Listen, Sensei, your Sharingan
is amazing and everything,

17
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,538
but if it puts that
much strain on you,

18
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,007
maybe it's not worth it.

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,542
-Sorry.

20
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,044
[grunt]

21
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,581
-Well, you did take down one
of the most powerful ninja

22
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:28,118
assassins, so we'll
be safe for a while.

23
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:32,758
-Right, but you know that boy
with the mask, what about him?

24
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,160
-He's from the
elite tracking unit

25
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,829
of the village
hidden in the mist.

26
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:38,799
Those masks are only worn
by the most elite Shinobi.

27
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,768
[loud squawking]

28
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,203
-What exactly do they do?

29
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:45,376
The Anbu Black Ops, also
known as The Inferno Squad,

30
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,713
destroy all traces of
a rogue ninja's corpse.

31
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:52,786
The Shinobi's body contains
many secrets-- ninjutsu,

32
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,790
chakra, special medicines
used on his body.

33
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,194
These are the secrets
of his village.

34
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:02,066
If his enemies find them, his
people will be in grave danger.

35
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,704
For instance, if I were to
die at the hands of an enemy,

36
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:08,842
he would try to
analyze my Sharingan.

37
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,879
In the worst case,
my entire jutsu

38
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:14,016
could be stolen and used
against our home village.

39
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,387
It is the sacred duty
of the Shinobi trackers

40
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,724
to prevent this, to keep
the village secrets safe.

41
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:22,161
If a ninja betrays his
village, the trackers

42
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:24,899
hunt him down, eliminate
him, and obliterate

43
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,767
every trace of his existence.

44
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,338
That's their specialty.

45
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:34,112
-First, I'll cut the bandage
and drain some of the blood.

46
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:37,382
[gasp]

47
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,618
-That's enough.

48
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,953
I'll do it.

49
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,791
-So, you've already
come back to life.

50
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:48,198
[groaning]

51
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:48,866
-Damn it.

52
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,269
You're brutal, Haku.

53
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:53,906
-You're the one
who's brutal, Zabuza.

54
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,543
If you keep pulling
them out like that,

55
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,246
you really will be finished.

56
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,952
[clinking]

57
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:06,357
-How long are you planning
to wear that phony mask?

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,725
Take it off.

59
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,962
-I have good memories
of this mask.

60
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,867
And it was quite useful
for tricking that ninja.

61
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:20,543
If I hadn't intervened,
you'd be dead now.

62
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,246
That much is certain.

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,549
-Putting me in a temporary
death state is fine,

64
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,854
but not through the
pressure points in my neck.

65
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,690
Cruel as usual.

66
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,994
I think you enjoy it.

67
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:33,896
-It was the only sure way.

68
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:36,800
And I wouldn't want to
mark up your flawless body.

69
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,537
You'd complain about
that even more.

70
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,273
The neck is more vulnerable.

71
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,044
There's no layer of muscle,
so I could go straight

72
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,214
into the pressure points.

73
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:48,283
[groaning]

74
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,852
-There's no point
trying to move.

75
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,822
You'll be numb for a week.

76
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,858
Although, if you're
as stubborn as usual,

77
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:59,065
you'll probably be
moving in half the time.

78
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,068
-You're so innocent.

79
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,471
And you're clever
at the same time.

80
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,274
Rare combination.

81
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,444
That's why I keep you around.

82
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:08,378
[laughing]

83
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,580
-I'm still a kid.

84
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:10,982
What else would you expect?

85
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,655
The mist is cleared.

86
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,025
[grunting]

87
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,063
-Next time, will you all right?

88
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:24,534
-Next time, I'll see right
through his Sharingan.

89
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:31,311
NARUTO: The Forest of Chakra.

90
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,150
-What is this?

91
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,890
If Zabuza is finished,
why do I feel this way?

92
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,091
Something's wrong.

93
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,900
It's like I missed something.

94
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,802
-Hey, are you OK?

95
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:49,904
Sensei.

96
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:50,838
-Hm?

97
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,140
Oh, yeah.

98
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,111
To finish what I was
saying, tracker ninja

99
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:57,981
deal with the body
immediately, on the spot,

100
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,651
so there's no room for error.

101
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:01,921
-Is that really important?

102
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:03,456
-Think about it.

103
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,060
Do you remember what that
tracker did with Zabuza's body?

104
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,867
SAKURA: We don't
know what he did.

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,405
I mean, I guess he
took it away somewhere.

106
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,306
KAKASHI: Exactly.

107
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,442
But why?

108
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,845
He should have worked on
Zabuza right there, as

109
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,081
quickly as possible.

110
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,286
Think of the weapons he
used for the takedown.

111
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,625
Do you remember what they were?

112
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,928
-Throwing needles.

113
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:31,896
No way.

114
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,065
-Exactly.

115
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:35,569
None of it adds up.

116
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:36,503
-Huh.

117
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,238
-What are you all
yammering about?

118
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,842
You demolished that assassin.

119
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:41,978
-Here's the truth.

120
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,780
Zabazu's still alive.

121
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:46,617
[screaming]

122
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,519
[gasp]

123
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,553
-But we saw his body.

124
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:49,655
Believe it.

125
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,224
-Kakashi Sensei, you
checked him yourself.

126
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,160
You said that his heart stopped.

127
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:55,497
-His heart did stop.

128
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,237
But, that was just a temporary
state to simulate death.

129
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,813
The weapons that tracker
used are called senbon.

130
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,082
They can pierce
deeply but rarely

131
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:13,322
kill unless they hit a vital
organ, not in the neck.

132
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,092
They're modified from needles
used for medical treatments,

133
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,661
like acupuncture.

134
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:21,266
Trackers are trained to know
every detail of the human body.

135
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,969
Causing the heart
to stop temporarily

136
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:27,142
while keeping the body alive
is an easy matter for them.

137
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,412
First, he carried
Zabuza's body away,

138
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,150
even though it's much
heavier than he is.

139
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:36,855
Second, he used senbon,
which have a precise effect

140
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,525
but are rarely fatal.

141
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,795
From these two factors,
we can conclude

142
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,000
that the tracker wasn't
trying to destroy Zabuza.

143
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,370
He was trying to save him.

144
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,740
-Come on, you're over-thinking
this, aren't you?

145
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:53,279
-Encountering suspicion,
the ninja prepares quickly.

146
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,882
Hesitation leads to disaster.

147
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:58,085
Every Shinobi knows this saying.

148
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,522
-Ahhh.

149
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,526
[laughing]

150
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,497
-He's actually pleased
to hear Zabuza's alive.

151
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,867
Now Naruto's got
another shot at him.

152
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,272
-Sensei, you said, prepare
quickly, but how can

153
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,742
we do that when you
can barely move?

154
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,012
[laughing]

155
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:17,980
-Huh?

156
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,984
-I can still train you.

157
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,286
-Hold on.

158
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,421
A little last minute
training won't make us

159
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:24,889
strong enough to fight Zabuza.

160
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:28,328
You could barely defeat him
even with your Sharingan.

161
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,665
We have to be
reasonable about this.

162
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:31,499
[clash]

163
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,935
-Yeah, trying to get us killed?

164
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,170
Jah.

165
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:37,541
-Sakura, why was I
able to stop Zabuza?

166
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:40,579
Because, you all helped me.

167
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,181
You've grown.

168
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:42,982
Naruto,

169
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,918
-Huh?

170
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,955
-You've grown the most.

171
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:50,292
[nervous laughter]

172
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,796
-[thinking to herself] He
does seem stronger and more

173
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,066
confident, but--

174
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,402
-So you noticed, Kakashi Sensei.

175
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,972
Now things are
going to get better.

176
00:08:59,005 --> 00:08:59,839
Believe it.

177
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,940
-I don't believe it.

178
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,176
And nothing's going to be good.

179
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:02,777
-Huh?

180
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,653
-Who are you?

181
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:10,454
-Arg.

182
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,190
Inari, where have you been?

183
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,095
-Welcome back, Grandpa.

184
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:16,897
-Inari, that was very rude.

185
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,168
These ninja helped your grandpa
and brought him here safely.

186
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,069
-It's OK.

187
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:21,970
It's OK.

188
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,106
I'm rude to them, too.

189
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,109
[laughing]

190
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:29,481
[drum beating]

191
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,751
-Mom, don't you see, these
people are going to die.

192
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,522
Gato and his men will come back
and find them and wipe them

193
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,223
out.

194
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:37,159
-What did you say, brat?

195
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,193
-Listen up.

196
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,329
You know what a super ninja is?

197
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,265
Well that's me,
only a lot better.

198
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:42,900
I'm going to be Okage.

199
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,438
-This Gato or Blato or
whatever he's called

200
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,808
is no match for a
real hero like me.

201
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:49,643
-Ha.

202
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:51,179
There's no such thing as a hero.

203
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:54,751
You're just full
of stupid ideas.

204
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,219
-What'd you say?

205
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:57,588
-Naruto, calm down.

206
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,457
-If you want to stay
alive, you should go back

207
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,359
where you came from.

208
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,330
[footsteps walking away]

209
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:05,332
-Inari, wait.

210
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,869
Where are you going?

211
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,137
-To look out at the ocean.

212
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,941
I want to be alone.

213
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,779
-Grr, grr, grrr.

214
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,015
-Sorry about that.

215
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,952
-Grr.

216
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,354
Ahh.

217
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,924
-Who does that brat think he is?

218
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,961
I'm going to put him
in his place right now.

219
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:29,333
[seagulls cawing]

220
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,336
[crying]

221
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,938
-Huh?

222
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,809
He's crying?

223
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:47,926
[crying]

224
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,695
-No, Daddy, no.

225
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,410
[crying]

226
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,492
-All right.

227
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,595
Training starts now.

228
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,931
-Right.

229
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,367
First , we will begin
with a review of chakra,

230
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,503
the ninja's basic
source of power.

231
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,440
Understanding
chakra is essential.

232
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:13,376
-We know that.

233
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,544
-He's right.

234
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:17,549
A long time ago we learned
about-- uh, cattra.

235
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:18,850
-Chakra.

236
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,419
-Daa.

237
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,687
-Go ahead, Sakura.

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,323
-All right, Naruto.

239
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:27,796
I'll explain it simply
so you can understand it.

240
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:31,735
Chakra is the elemental life
energy a ninja uses in jutsu.

241
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,671
It's the source
of all his power.

242
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:36,508
Now, this energy has two
forms, physical energy

243
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,345
which exists in all the cells
in the entire body, all working

244
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,086
together and spiritual energy,
the primal source of power

245
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,257
which is intensified through
training and experience.

246
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,193
As you see, these
two types of chakra

247
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,896
must be drawn out
and brought together

248
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,332
in order to perform jutsu.

249
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:57,004
Notice the interplay between
physical and spiritual power.

250
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,640
That's the key.

251
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:02,746
Finally, hand signs focus
and unleash the chakra.

252
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,849
-Right on all points.

253
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:08,454
Iruka Sensei really did have
some excellent students.

254
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:09,856
-Ha.

255
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,827
-What's the big deal with all
these complicated explanations?

256
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,697
The whole point is to
learn the jutsu, isn't it?

257
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:17,499
-Naruto is right for once.

258
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:20,671
We're already using chakra
energy in our jutsu.

259
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,806
-No.

260
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,074
You have not
mastered this power.

261
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,810
You've barely scratched
the surface of it.

262
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,713
-What do you mean?

263
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,182
-Calm down and listen.

264
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,217
It's just like Sakura said.

265
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:33,422
You have to draw on physical
and spiritual energies

266
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,926
and then combine
them within yourself.

267
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,930
But how do you do that?

268
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,133
Each jutsu requires
different types

269
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,336
of chakra in
different proportions.

270
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,742
You must select and combine
them in exactly the right way.

271
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,246
Up to now, you've just
guessed at the proportions,

272
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,082
hoping they'd come out right.

273
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,252
Even if you produce
a lot of chakra,

274
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:58,224
unless you can balance and
control it, it's all worthless.

275
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:04,032
The jutsu won't work at all
or it'll just be a joke.

276
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,269
You waste so much
energy that way.

277
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:09,841
Then you're out of chakra
and you can't fight at all.

278
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,244
You're just a target.

279
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:14,614
-So how do we change that?

280
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,018
-Train so hard that
controlling your chakra

281
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,320
become second nature.

282
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,923
To achieve this goal
you must be ready to put

283
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:24,662
your life on the line.

284
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:28,300
-What do we have to do?

285
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,102
-[chuckling] Climb a tree.

286
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:31,604
-Climb a tree?

287
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:32,973
-That's right.

288
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,810
But there's just one rule.

289
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,647
No hands.

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,181
-What?

291
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:41,118
You're kidding.

292
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,153
-Am I?

293
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,288
Let's see.

294
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:59,678
[gasp]

295
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,180
-He's climbing.

296
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,049
-Straight up.

297
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,022
And he's only using his feet.

298
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,558
-Well, you get the idea.

299
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:12,329
Focus the chakra toward
the soles of your feet

300
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:14,499
and use it to
connect to the tree.

301
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,604
This is one way to apply
the power of chakra.

302
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:18,805
-Wait a minute.

303
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,375
That's a nice trick, but
how does it help us fight

304
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,077
-It's the only way to fight him,

305
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,346
Sakura.

306
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,817
That's the entire
goal of this training.

307
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,154
First, you'll learn to draw
a precise amount of chakra

308
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,357
to a precise point in your body.

309
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,262
This is difficult, even
for advanced ninja.

310
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,532
This type of climbing
requires a subtle mix

311
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:39,801
of physical and
spiritual energy.

312
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,939
And the bottoms of the feet
are the most difficult points

313
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:44,542
to focus chakra.

314
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:46,110
Are you getting the picture?

315
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:51,317
If you can master this, you'll
be able to master any jutsu.

316
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,088
Well, theoretically.

317
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:57,726
The second point is to learn
to maintain your chakra levels.

318
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,663
When a ninja is
focused in battle,

319
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,666
it's even harder to
control and maintain

320
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,470
his chakra levels,
a deadly mistake.

321
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,473
To avoid this,
maintaining chakra

322
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,610
must become second
nature, effortless.

323
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,446
Well, I can talk
about this all day

324
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,916
but that won't advance
your skills, will it?

325
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,756
You need to apply the power
of chakra through training.

326
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,092
[gasp]

327
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,796
Use the Kunai knife
to mark the tree

328
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,769
at the highest point you can
climb without using your hands.

329
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:33,411
Then, try to get past that mark
the next time and the next.

330
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:35,480
At first, you'll need
to run at the tree

331
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:38,584
so your momentum can take
you as highest as possible

332
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:41,188
until you used to it.

333
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:41,789
Ready?

334
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,328
-I'm more than ready.

335
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,163
This is going to be
no sweat all the way.

336
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,699
Believe it.

337
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,701
Remember what you
said, Sensei, I'm

338
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,037
the one who's grown the most.

339
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,374
-You're definitely the
one who talks the most.

340
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,809
Now get focused and do it.

341
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:58,580
-[thinking to himself]
Well, he did say that.

342
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,051
OK, first I need to draw the
chakra to bottom of my feet.

343
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:13,000
I got it.

344
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:15,971
Charge.

345
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:28,222
[grunting]

346
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,592
-[thinking to himself] This
is harder than I thought.

347
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,561
The balance has to be perfect.

348
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,098
If the chakra's too
strong, it smashes the tree

349
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,666
and pushes you off.

350
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,303
-Ahh.

351
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:39,838
-But if it's not
strong enough, you just

352
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:42,174
tumble back down, like Naruto.

353
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,213
[grunting]

354
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:49,284
-That's about what I expected
from Sasuke and Naruto.

355
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:50,887
-Hey, this is fun.

356
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,794
-Sakura.

357
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,564
[laughing]

358
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:01,602
-Well, looks like the
female member of the squad

359
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:04,340
has the most advanced
chakra control.

360
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,275
Well done, Sakura.

361
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,413
[laughing]

362
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,849
-Yeah, way to go, Sakura.

363
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:12,284
I always knew you were awesome.

364
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:13,853
Believe it.

365
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:15,421
-[thinking to himself] It does
sort of tick me off, though.

366
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:16,958
-[thinking to himself] Whatever.

367
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,261
-[thinking to herself] I thought
Sasuke would be impressed.

368
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:20,463
Now he's mad at me.

369
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,531
Why is it always like that?

370
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:25,770
-Well, not only does
Sakura understand chakra,

371
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,839
she can control and
maintain it as well.

372
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:32,079
We spoke about someone becoming
Hokage one day, didn't we?

373
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:34,515
Seems Sakura's got the
best chance of that,

374
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,950
wouldn't you say?

375
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,520
And as for the
great Uchiha clan,

376
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,790
but maybe they're not
so great after all.

377
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:41,492
-[thinking to herself]
Shut up, Sensei.

378
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,827
You talk too much.

379
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,597
Sasuke is going to hate me now.

380
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,205
-All right.

381
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,707
I think they're motivated.

382
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,777
Of course, Naruto and Sasuke
both have far more chakra

383
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:55,913
within.

384
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:58,650
If this training works,
their mastery of chakra

385
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:02,155
will become a valuable asset.

386
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,356
-All right.

387
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:05,459
First, I'll match Sasuke.

388
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,362
Then I'm going all
the way to the top.

389
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:07,963
Believe it.

390
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,541
-What a waste of time.

391
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,110
They don't know what
they're up against.

392
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:18,711
Mmm.

393
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:37,237
[grunting]

394
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,074
[door opening and then closing]

395
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:42,579
<i>Samjonin,</i> the unbeatable
ninja just got beat.

396
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,749
Limping back home like
some pathetic has been.

397
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,620
[chuckling] Demon
of the hidden mist.

398
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:52,025
[laughing] More like
coward of the hidden mist.

399
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:01,271
-Drawing swords?

400
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,974
-Hang on a minute.

401
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,175
All right.

402
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,913
Let's hear what you have
to say about this fiasco.

403
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,448
And don't play possum.

404
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,317
I know you can talk.

405
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,859
-Keep your filthy
hands off of him.

406
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,929
-Ahh, you're going to break it.

407
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,703
[clash of swords]

408
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,540
-That's impossible.

409
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:28,577
No one can move that fast.

410
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,447
-Don't push me.

411
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,550
I'm in a really foul mood.

412
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,786
-Arrg.

413
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,620
[clatter of swords]

414
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:36,521
-One chance.

415
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,790
That's it.

416
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,993
If you fail this time,
I'll cut you off.

417
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:43,431
And there'll be no one
left to cover for you.

418
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,601
Let's go.

419
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:46,569
[footsteps ]

420
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,339
[door opening and closing]

421
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:51,710
-Haku, that wasn't necessary.

422
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:53,079
-Perhaps.

423
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:55,482
But it's too early
to take out Gato.

424
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,585
He's still our best cover.

425
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:58,920
Think about it.

426
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,123
The murders will
draw their attention.

427
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,895
Then they'd be after us again.

428
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,801
We need restraint.

429
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,040
-[sighing] You're right.

430
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:20,183
-Ah.

431
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,552
Uh.

432
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,087
Ahh.

433
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,762
Huh.

434
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:33,702
[heavy breathing]

435
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,905
-[thinking to herself]
I'm totally worn out.

436
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:39,244
How can they just
keep going like that?

437
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:39,678
-Ow.

438
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:40,579
Ow.

439
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:41,180
Ah.

440
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,155
-[thinking to herself] Naruto
isn't making any progress

441
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:48,090
at all.

442
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,659
Knowing him, any
minute now, he'll

443
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,527
give up and throw a tantrum.

444
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,667
There he goes.

445
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,537
He's so predictable,
it's embarrassing.

446
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,740
Hm?

447
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,377
-Hey, you're good at this.

448
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,378
How about some advice?

449
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:04,413
-Uhh.

450
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,549
-But please don't
tell Sasuke I asked.

451
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,553
Please, please.

452
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:11,790
-He's catching on.

453
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:15,762
From now on, he'll get
stronger and stronger.

454
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,999
How strong?

455
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:23,407
After all, Naruto possess
more chakra than Sasuke.

456
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,644
In fact, the amount
of chakra he possesses

457
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,680
is greater than my own.

458
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,065
[music]

459
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,411
Cultivate your hunger
before you idealize.

460
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:53,783
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

461
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:57,388
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

462
00:21:57,421 --> 00:22:01,126
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

463
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,369
My knee is still shaking,
like I was twelve,

464
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:11,374
Sneaking out of the
classroom, by the back door.

465
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:14,279
A man railed at me twice
though, but I didn't care.

466
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:18,017
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

467
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,322
Don't try to live so wise.

468
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:25,294
Don't cry because
you're so right.

469
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,898
Don't dry with fakes or fears

470
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:31,503
Because you will hate
yourself in the end.

471
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:44,454
Don't try to live so wise.

472
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:47,992
Don't cry because
you're so right.

473
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,964
Don't dry with fakes or fears

474
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,902
Because you will hate
yourself in the end.

475
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:58,241
Don't try to live so wise.

476
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:01,779
Don't cry because
you're so right.

477
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:02,747
Don't dry--

478
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,155
-That boy, Inari.

479
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:11,392
He's always off by
himself, crying, always

480
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:15,365
looking out at the ocean,
tears running down his face,

481
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,101
always alone.

482
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,237
What's all that
crying going to do?

483
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:22,241
I mean, how can
that help anything?

484
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,547
And what made him
so sad, anyway?

485
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:30,141
Next time-- The Land
Where A Hero Once Lived.

486
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,608
Watch me get even stronger.

487
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:34,475
Believe it.
