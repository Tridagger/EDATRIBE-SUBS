00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,296
TSUNADE: Your next mission
is for the daughter

4
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,070
of an affluent feudal lord
who's looking for a body double.

5
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,940
I don't know where
she heard about you,

6
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,443
but it turns out you're
her spitting image.

7
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:03,313
She was pretty adamant,
said she wouldn't

8
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,049
work with anyone else but you.

9
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,351
-So a body double, huh?

10
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:10,057
Is this princess being
targeted by someone or what?

11
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,525
-I think it's more
accurate to say

12
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,829
she's the one doing
the targeting.

13
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,864
-OK.

14
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:17,334
-Well, anyway, I'm
sure you'll do fine.

15
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,936
You're one of the
best and brightest

16
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,472
we have in the Leaf Village.

17
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:23,277
Besides you'll have
someone to assist you.

18
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,978
-Assist me?

19
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:24,879
[door opening]

20
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,547
Huh?

21
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,214
-Hey!

22
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:27,517
Grandma Tsunade!

23
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,220
I hear you've got a mission for
me-- helping some feudal lord?

24
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:30,889
[screaming]

25
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:32,090
-Lady Tsunade!

26
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:33,626
-It's the best I could do.

27
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,896
Everyone else in
the village is busy.

28
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,064
[screaming]

29
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:38,500
-(ANGRILY) You mean I
have to be alone with him?

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,601
-Afraid so.

31
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,404
Just try to make
the best of it, OK?

32
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:50,618
NARUTO: The client is the
daughter of a feudal lord.

33
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:53,557
Oh, man, I must really be
coming up in the world for them

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,093
to trust me with a big
mission like this one.

35
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,630
-Yeah, well, I wouldn't whoop
it up too much if I were you.

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,935
You have a gift for
screwing things up.

37
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:01,502
[laughing]

38
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:02,571
-Don't even sweat it.

39
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:03,972
This will be a piece of cake.

40
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,108
You just leave everything to me.

41
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,646
-You really are a piece of work.

42
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,583

Chubby Paradise!"

46
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:24,370
PRINCESS: My thanks to
you for coming from afar.

47
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,139
INO (VOICEOVER):
That's the client?

48
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,545
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Well, they
do sort of look alike, but--

49
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:34,553
INO AND NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
There's one big difference.

50
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,123
[laughing]

51
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:37,991
-I know.

52
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,326
You don't have to say a word.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,196
I see it written
all over your faces.

54
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,032
You're thinking my
physique doesn't exactly

55
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:45,268
match up to that
of my body double.

56
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,004
Right?

57
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,138
It's all right.

58
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,007
You can admit it.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,276
-Oh, uh, not at all-- we, um--

60
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,680
-To be honest, lady, I don't
think you two look anything

61
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,315
alike.

62
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:53,915
-Zip it!

63
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:54,416
-It's all right.

64
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,418
I don't blame you.

65
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,355
I think this will
clear things up.

66
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,658
-Huh?

67
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,960
NARUTO: Oh man!

68
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,996
Ino, it's you!

69
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,400
-That's how I've always
looked until a short time.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,472
But I plumped out like this
when Father hired a matchmaker.

71
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,409
They're brokering an
arranged marriage for me.

72
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,678
NARUTO AND INO: You're kidding!

73
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:16,950
-My prospective husband is
Chikara from the Land of Udon.

74
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:19,488
Ever since I first laid eyes
on his manly photograph,

75
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,925
my feelings for him have
grown deeper and deeper

76
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,164
with every passing day.

77
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:28,401
With our first meeting almost
here, I've been a wreck.

78
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,071
My heart won't stop pounding.

79
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,907
My cheeks are as red as beets.

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,277
It's gotten so I can't
even sleep at night.

81
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:38,284
[hungrily eating]

82
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,387
And with all the stress,
I've been eating just

83
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,457
about anything I
can get my hands on.

84
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,959
-Well, of course you got fat.

85
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,929
What did you think
was going to happen?

86
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,999
-Of course, I've already taken
appropriate counter measures.

87
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,569
I'm taking a special
supplement, which

88
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,371
reduces carbohydrate intake.

89
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,341
Easy Peasy Slim SP.

90
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:59,583
-I'm guessing it
didn't work too well.

91
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,052
-I should have known better.

92
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,322
And now look at me.

93
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,992
How can I ever meet the man of
my dreams looking like this?

94
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,063
So that's where you come in.

95
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,297
Here's the plan.

96
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,434
Tomorrow, you're going to
take my place at our meeting

97
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,170
and do whatever you
have to to make sure

98
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,406
that darling man
wants to marry me!

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,709
[screaming]

100
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,445
-So the whole reason
you hired a body

101
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:21,082
double was just for this
meeting or whatever it is?

102
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:22,117
-What do you mean?

103
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,486
What's the matter with that?

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,257
-Well, you know, when you
hear the words body double,

105
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,028
you're thinking of a situation
where lives are on the line.

106
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,697
-What are you talking about?

107
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,067
The Princess's entire
life is at stake here.

108
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:33,601
This is major.

109
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,404
-Oh, thank goodness.

110
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,209
So you can appreciate
a heart in love.

111
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,310
-Are you kidding me?

112
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:40,612
What woman doesn't?

113
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:43,651
A girl always wants to look
good for the man she yearns for.

114
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:45,419
-Even if she's a fake?

115
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,721
-Oh, get over it, would you?

116
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,257
It's not our fault
you men prefer

117
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,593
girls who are fit and trim.

118
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,627
Huh?

119
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,597
-You know just what
I'm going through.

120
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:53,599
I'm counting on you.

121
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,435
-It will all be fine.

122
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,670
Leave it to me.

123
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,308
-Well, even if this little
meet and greet works out,

124
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,211
he's still going
to see you later.

125
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,212
-Don't worry.

126
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:03,447
By the time the
wedding rolls around,

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,617
I'll have lost all
this extra weight.

128
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,722
I have a plan for
getting my figure back.

129
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,258
Substitution slender!

130
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:14,631
It's the dietary aide I'll be
replacing all three meals with!

131
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:17,603
-I guess exercising is
out of the question.

132
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,171
-Rest easy, Princess.

133
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,141
Once I've worked all
my magic on this guy,

134
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:23,078
he'll only have eyes for you.

135
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:31,624
PRINCESS: I used to
always come and play

136
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,695
in this annex
during my childhood.

137
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,099
If I hide in here, I
can use these pipes

138
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,769
to listen in on any
conversation in the house.

139
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:40,704
-Wow.

140
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:42,607
That must be pretty convenient.

141
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:46,446
-But I would give anything
just to meet him in person.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,114
NARUTO: Why?

143
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:48,116
What's the deal?

144
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,252
Is he really that big of prize?

145
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:50,986
[giggling]

146
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,688
NARUTO AND INO: OK.

147
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,057
-(HAPPILY) Well,
of course he is!

148
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,061
There's nobody else like
him in the whole wide world!

149
00:06:56,094 --> 00:07:00,100
Now, look, just make sure
that he falls for me, OK?

150
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,439
-You're in excellent hands.

151
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,409
I thought you weren't
feeling motivated.

152
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,080
NARUTO: Well, hey, a
mission's a mission, right?

153
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:11,217
All I can do is hold
my nose and plunge in.

154
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:13,989
-Just stick to the
plan, though, OK?

155
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,392
[gasping]

156
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:17,394
Huh?

157
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,362
[music playing]

158
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,231
-What the heck is this?

159
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,767
-The music is getting louder.

160
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,137
[music playing]

161
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:24,771
-Huh?

162
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,409
-It's so bright.

163
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,344
-Uh?

164
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,346
[dinging]

165
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,649
-The world abounds
with handsome men,

166
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,587
and yet there's one
who towers over all.

167
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,526
-His glistening side-long
glances follow the Land of Udon

168
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,529
like the sun!

169
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,533
-Worship at the foot of the
glorious Prince Chikara!

170
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,671
-Bow before his Majesty!

171
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,174
[music playing]

172
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:52,481
-Sorry.

173
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,052
It appears I kept you
waiting, Princess.

174
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:57,322
-This is the man I'm
supposed to win over?

175
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,658
-That guy's an even bigger
loon than Guy Sensei is!

176
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,352
PEOPLE (IN BACKGROUND): Hiza!

177
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,910
Hiza!

178
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,636
NARUTO: Oh boy.

179
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,205
-Huh?

180
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,543
[music playing]

181
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:15,349
-I'm so sorry,
pretty lady, but I

182
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,285
suffer from a little
low blood pressure.

183
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,259
-I don't think low blood
pressure's his problem.

184
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,120
[screaming]

185
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,562
[laughing]

186
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:24,763
-What?

187
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,701
-Do you always scatter flower
pedals wherever you go?

188
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,137
-Flowers are a blessing.

189
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:31,407
So relaxing for
the mind and body.

190
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,310
Wouldn't you agree, Princess?

191
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:35,547
-Yeah, sure, I guess.

192
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,650
-All righty, what's
say we begin?

193
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,055
[snapping]

194
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,758
-(WHISPERING) I don't get it.

195
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,763
This guy's not really living
up to the picture she painted.

196
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:46,831
I mean, he's a nor--

197
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:48,100
-Come again.

198
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,302
-Shut it!

199
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:52,439
These sweets are enormously
delicious, aren't they?

200
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:53,441
[laughing]

201
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:56,378
Excuse us for a moment.

202
00:08:56,412 --> 00:09:00,419
[running]

203
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,254
NARUTO: What the heck was that?

204
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,391
-A woman's intuition.

205
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,161
He seems a bit like Choji.

206
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:09,365
You were about to head
into taboo territory.

207
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:10,834
-I got you.

208
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,303
-Oh, for crying out loud.

209
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,507
She told us he
would be handsome!

210
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,279
That's not exactly how I'd
describe Casanova back there.

211
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,716
-Yeah, but, they're kind
of perfect for each other.

212
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,485
-There's got to be
some mistake here.

213
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,290
No woman in her right mind
would fall for that giant tub.

214
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:26,358
-I don't know.

215
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,727
Maybe she's into that.

216
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:28,695
[groaning]

217
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:29,596
-That's impossible!

218
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,598
Just look at him!

219
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,801
He's a stuck up,
overweight, Lothario!

220
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,136
He's a freak!

221
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,071
A goon!

222
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:36,374
Something isn't
right around here!

223
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,308
Do you read me?

224
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:38,277
Do you?

225
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,183
-Uh, yeah, I think I got it.

226
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,352
PRINCESS: What are you saying?

227
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:45,588
Of course it's Chikara.

228
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,455
Don't be silly.

229
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,524
Who else would it be?

230
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:50,395
That darling man means
everything to me.

231
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,630
-I thought so.

232
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:52,498
[sighing]

233
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,334
-He's the paragon of elegance.

234
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,870
I wish that I could
see him in person

235
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,472
with these two eyes of mine.

236
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,775
-What are you going to do?

237
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,578
We've all got problems, right?

238
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:01,645
-(ANGRILY) Look!

239
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,715
Just do what you have to
do to seal the deal, OK?

240
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,653
Now, quit your complaining
and tell her to get to work.

241
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:07,554
-You got it.

242
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:08,723
I'll go get us back on track.

243
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,337
-Still feeling a tad
nervous, are you?

244
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,473
Well, how about a little
music to lighten the mood?

245
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:23,879
-Uh, no, that's OK.

246
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,349
(WHISPERING) How did it go?

247
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,216
-Not good.

248
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,619
It looks like this is our fella.

249
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:30,357
She said she wants you to plow
on ahead with the meeting.

250
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,192
-(WHISPERING) You've
got to be kidding.

251
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:33,628
-This is the mission
we were given.

252
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:37,868
-(WHISPERING) Yeah, I
know that, knucklehead!

253
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:41,206
-So tell me, you care
for roses at all?

254
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,342
-Yes, very much.

255
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,212
-Wonderful.

256
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,814
I'm rather taken
with them myself.

257
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:49,219
They speak the language love.

258
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:52,423
-Uh, but doesn't
the meaning vary

259
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,761
depending on the
color of the blossom?

260
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:58,432
Yellow, for example, indicates
your wish to break up.

261
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,501
[laughing]

262
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,304
-Aw, now, that's just
a load of nonsense.

263
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:02,239
[snapping]

264
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:04,909
A flower's just a flower.

265
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,212
They don't know nothing.

266
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,149
[groaning]

267
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,887
[music playing]

268
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:26,643
[laughing]

269
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:27,577
-This is for you.

270
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,291
[screaming]

271
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:38,694
-(NERVOUSLY) Oh,
I, uh, uh, sorry.

272
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:39,730
(YELLING) Wait up!

273
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:41,198
[groaning]

274
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:42,600
-Uh huh?

275
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,569
[screaming]

276
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,536
-This is impossible!

277
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,506
I can't do it!

278
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,776
I just can't do it!

279
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,714
She's just going to have to
find herself another lookalike!

280
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:52,382
-Come on, Ino.

281
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,317
Take a breather.

282
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,318
Just do your best.

283
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:55,211
You'll be fine.

284
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,653
-Forget it.

285
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,348
He repulses me.

286
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:57,790
-Oh!

287
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,792
I got it!

288
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,293
Pretend he's a weirder
version of Choji.

289
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:03,432
-Choji's got meat on him for
the sake of his ninjutsu.

290
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:07,171
What this young prince is
packing it on for is beyond me.

291
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:07,806
-Boy.

292
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,776
Tell me how you really feel.

293
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,745
-I need to talk to the princess.

294
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,446
-Huh?

295
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,681
Hold on a minute.

296
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:14,816
Where are you going?

297
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,152
What the?

298
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,722
I just don't get her.

299
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:21,627
Well, it looks like it's on me.

300
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,197
Time for this Shinobi to put
his nose to the old grindstone

301
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,800
and get the job done!

302
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,769
[laughing]

303
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:32,310
[water running]

304
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,246
-So you've got a problem, too?

305
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,216
-Look, I'm not judging
you or anything,

306
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,920
but I think you should take a
pass on the prince of yours.

307
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:42,559
He's not all that bright in the
head, if you catch my meaning.

308
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:45,464
-Oh, nonsense, he's the most
passionate and wonderful man

309
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,631
of the world.

310
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,267
-You sure?

311
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,939
-The reason I hired Leaf ninja
for this mission is you're

312
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,442
supposed skill in substitution!

313
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,645
You're a professional
Shinobi, aren't you?

314
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,684
Now, get back out there
and finish the job already!

315
00:12:58,684 --> 00:12:59,618
[groaning]

316
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,954
I wouldn't say
the atmosphere has

317
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,224
been all that congenial so far.

318
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,627
You need to ramp up your
game and charm that man!

319
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,662
[moaning]

320
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:08,490
INO: Sorry! to have
kept you waiting!

321
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,932
-Oh!

322
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:09,834
That's it!

323
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:10,902
Now you've got the idea.

324
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:11,570
Huh?

325
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,438
-(ANGRILY) Oh!

326
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,364
For the love of--

327
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:13,807
-Hey!

328
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,708
Wait a sec!

329
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,643
[stuttering]

330
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:18,580
-P-- P-- P-- Princess Fortune?

331
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,486
[moaning]

332
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,489
-I'm sorry, Prince
Chikara, but do you

333
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:27,427
think you could help
loosen this sash for me?

334
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,830
-Uh, well, I, uh--

335
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,366
[moaning]

336
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,967
-With sugar on top?

337
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,436
INO (IN BACKGROUND): Oh my gosh!

338
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,573
The ceiling is
swarming with bugs!

339
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:36,909
They're gigantic!

340
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,578
-What?

341
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,512
[screaming]

342
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:41,348
-Mind distraction jutsu!

343
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,684
[screaming]

344
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:43,619
-Swarming with bugs?

345
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,522
Do you see anything?

346
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,957
-Man, I hate bugs.

347
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,559
Whoa!

348
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:48,793
What the?

349
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,563
-(WHISPERING) What the heck
do you think you're doing

350
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,665
in there?

351
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,432
CHIKARA: Huh?

352
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,000
Where's the princess?

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,901
WOMAN: I don't know!

354
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,704
She vanished!

355
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,274
-What's going on around here?

356
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,710
This is getting really annoying.

357
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,745
Ugh!

358
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,915
I need to see what's
happening in there.

359
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,751
-What did you have
to go butting in for?

360
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:07,322
I had him in the
palm of my hand!

361
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,724
-You little idiot!

362
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,961
Why on earth are you dressed
like Princess Fortune?

363
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,330
-Look!

364
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:13,999
I've skimmed through enough
of pervy sage's novels

365
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,502
to know this is the kind of
thing that works on guys, OK?

366
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,841
-I can't believe you would stoop
to such a disgusting level!

368
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,511
Pervert!

369
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,716
No one would ever mistake
you for a comic book hero,

370
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,750
you filthy little toad!

371
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,353
-(NARUTO'S VOICE)
Say what you like,

372
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:30,291
but I was making a lot more
progress than you wer--

373
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,294

374
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:35,531
-Anything more
you'd like to say?

375
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,836
(VOICEOVER) I'd better wrap
this up before anyone else

376
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:40,940

-(NARUTO'S VOICE) That Prince
ain't seen nothing yet.

379
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,615
If we expect to bring
this mission home,

380
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,385
then she's going to
need my help in there!

381
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:50,721

382
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:54,327
CHIKARA: Oh, Princess,
where did you run off to?

383
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,862
[giggling]

384
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,330
-Please forgive me.

385
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,866
I've been so nervous
meeting you today,

386
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,504
I guess I flew off
in a bit of a panic.

387
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,740
-You really seemed like a
different person for a moment

388
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:03,708
there.

389
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:04,877
-I'm so sorry.

390
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,848
But you're such a striking
man, Prince Chikara.

391
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:10,819
It's almost overwhelming
being this close to you.

392
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:11,888
-No!

393
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:13,624
I can't have you
feeling this way.

394
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,027
What say we change
the atmosphere?

395
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:19,266
-Uh, in that case,
uh, let me, uh--

396
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,036

CHIKARA: (NERVOUSLY)
Outside the door!

401
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,689
-Yes, love, is something wrong?

402
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,592
-Out that door just now!

403
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,495
I just saw a whole
other princess!

405
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:41,399
-How could that
be, you silly boy?

406
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,267
(ANGRILY) Naruto!

407
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,373
It's very flattering, though.

408
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:49,812
You feel so deeply, you conjure
visions of me at every turn.

409
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:50,780
CHIKARA: Visions?

410
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,915
(NERVOUSLY) No.

411
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,918
I'm telling you!

412
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,521
-Look no further.

413
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,491

-(VOICEOVER) Aw, nuts,
I wasn't thinking.

417
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,539
You have to forgive
me, my prince.

418
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,342
I couldn't bear the
thought of your eyes

419
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,911
on anything else but me.

420
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,816
-All this passion is
blowing me away, darling.

421
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,611
All right then, your wish
is my command, little lady.

burning up here,

426
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,861
and I'm aiming to fan the flame.

-(VOICEOVER) What do I do?

428
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:24,866
-It's all right.

429

PRINCESS: (SCREAMING)
What are you doing?

435
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,590
You can't kiss him!

00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:41,357

-Let me make this clear, OK?

439

I don't want you kissing
that man, you got it?

440
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,937
-That's the last thing I want.

441
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:51,440
Honestly, you couldn't
have come at a better time.

442
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,976
-Look, I don't want to hear it.

443
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,413
The most you're allowed to
do in there is hand holding,

444
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:56,615
do you read me?

445
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,416
-Quiet!

446
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,618
Stop making such a racket.

I have to get back.

-Don't you try any
funny business in there.

452

-I think I can handle that.

453
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,036
Anyway, we can't keep
standing around out here.

If he sees us together,
then we're busted.

Now, hurry, Princess,
back to your room.

00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,070
[music playing]

540
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:10,645
[laughing]

541
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,181
-Well, how about it, Princess?

542
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,618
How about you and I hook
our wagons together?

543
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,989
-Oh, a thousand times, yes!

544
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,958
PEOPLE: Hail the future wife!

545
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:19,926
Bravo!

546
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,928
[laughing]

547
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,498
[cheering]

548
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:24,032
-Huh.

549
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,868
Who'd have thunk it?

550
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:27,070
-I don't get it.

551
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:29,007
Does this mean the mission
was accomplished or what?

552
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,543
I'm lost.

553
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,512
-So, let me get this straight.

554
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:34,448
I just spent the entire
day throwing myself

555
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:37,754
at a man I wouldn't want to
touch with a ten foot pole,

556
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:40,424
and after suffering
through for what

557
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:43,863
felt like an eternity
was for nothing?

558
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,735
[sizzling]

559
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:50,907
NARUTO: Ah, well, it all worked
out in the end, though, right?

560
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,810
They seem to make a
happy couple at least.

561
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:53,945
-You don't understand.

562
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,214
That's not the problem.

563
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,051
He tread all over a
young girl's heart.

564
00:20:58,084 --> 00:21:01,223
I can't believe a goofball like
that would just cast me aside!

565
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,494
-Didn't even give you a second
look at the end there, did he?

566
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:05,562
-(ANGRILY) Oh, cram it!

567
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,098
You don't have to remind me.

568
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:10,136
-You never know what's going to
do it for somebody, I suppose.

569
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,542
-Oh, please, that's
a load of hogwash!

570
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:14,910
One guy is the same as another.

571
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:17,548
You all like a woman
with a slim figure.

572
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,644
If I expect to compete out
there, I've got to diet!

573
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:21,087
Diet!

574
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,514
You hear me?

575
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:22,956
-Hey!

576
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,457
Hey, wait up!

577
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:23,991
Ino!

578
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:24,759
INO: (YELLING) Diet!

580
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,776
LEE: Naruto!

581
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:05,914
Let us forage the bittersweet
memories of youth together.

582
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:06,681
NARUTO: Huh?

583
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:07,650
LEE: No need to be shy.

584
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,053
I am ready both
in mind and body.

585
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:11,956
NARUTO: What the heck
are you babbling about?

586
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,058
LEE: So long.

587
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,228
So long I have waited
for this moment to come.

588
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,632
NARUTO: I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

589
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,166
LEE: No.

590
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,002
Here I come, Naruto.

591
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,105
I hope you will be my first.

592
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,041
NARUTO: (NERVOUSLY)
Wait a second!

593
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,177
[screaming]

594
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,101
NARUTO: Next time-- "Viva
Dojo Challenge-- Youth

595
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,769
is All About Passion!"
