00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,656
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
A Battle of Bugs!

3
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,389
The Deceivers, and the Deceived!

4
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:58,556
-I don't get it.

5
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:00,656
What the heck is
going on around here?

6
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,156
Who would want to kidnap
Hinata, and why does anyone even

7
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,189
know we're looking for the
bikochu in the first place?

8
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,956
-I don't really know,
but from the moment

9
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,422
we got here they've been
watching us like hawks.

10
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,356
-Huh?

11
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,856
So wait, you knew
they were there?

12
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,856
-You were the only
one who didn't.

13
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,322
-And you don't think maybe
you should have filled me in?

14
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,356
-Oh, please.

15
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,722
If we'd have told
you, you would have

16
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,189
raised a big stink over it.

17
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,889
Every insect in a square mile
would have buzzed out of here,

18
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:27,056
including the bikochu.

19
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:30,322
[bark]

20
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,289
SHINO: If they had tried to
take the bikochu by force,

21
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:36,222
they'd risk harming the insect.

22
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,722
So they decided to capture
Hinata and offer an exchange.

23
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:41,689
It was a smart move.

24
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,456
-Huh?

25
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,989
Does anybody else
smell something sweet?

26
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,322
-Yeah, like honey.

27
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:49,089
-Honeybees.

28
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:49,589
-Bees?

29
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,622
-Well, that's it, you guys.

30
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:55,522
Hinata's scent ends here.

31
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:56,322
-In that case--

32
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:08,089
-So they waited for a moment
when Hinata would be alone,

33
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,722
then attacked her
with a swarm of bees.

34
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,556
-I've heard in
the Land of Earth,

35
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,489
in the Hidden Stone
Village, there's

36
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:18,056
a clan of handlers who
specialize in bees.

37
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:21,156
Word is they're called
the Kamizuru clan.

38
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,356
-Kamizuru?

39
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,422
I've never heard of them.

40
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:27,756
-Apparently they were thought
to be as skilled as the Aburame

41
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,056
clan in the past.

42
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,322
-But they aren't anymore?

43
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:35,456
-It was back in my
grandfather's day.

44
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,389
The Shinobi of the
Hidden Stone Village

45
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,289
attempted to invade
the Hidden Leaf.

46
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,156
The Kamizuru clan were
chosen to map out a strategy.

47
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,056
Their plan was to attack with
an immense swarm of bees,

48
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,856
letting the main forces
strike in the chaos.

49
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,156
But the Aburame caught wind of
it, and met them in the forest

50
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:57,889
to the west.

51
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:10,389
It was an unprecedented battle
between instect handlers.

52
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,456
And the Aburame prevailed.

53
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:21,289
With that victory in hand,
the Aburame clan quickly

54
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:24,256
rose to prominence
in the Leaf Village,

55
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:27,522
while the Kamizuru
fell to ruin back

56
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:30,389
in the Village
Hidden in the Stones.

57
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:34,589
They say that there are
only a few of them left.

58
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,356
-And they're the
ones who came here

59
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,922
looking for the bikochu, huh?

60
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:41,056
So what do you think
they plan to do with it?

61
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,889
You got any idea?

62
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:45,789
-Hopefully when
my insects return,

63
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,589
they can shed a little
light on the matter.

64
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,956
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Of course.

65
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:29,522
I've been captured.

66
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:32,289
MAN: The Leaf Village is up
against the wall right now.

67
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,522
-With the fiasco at
the Chunin exam--

68
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:39,022
-Their Hokage assassinated,
and scores of shinobi lost.

69
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,889
Times are about to
change dramatically.

70
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,156
This is what our clan
has been waiting for.

71
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,889
A chance for us to
show our mettle.

72
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,522
But in order to do that--

73
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,489
-Our Tsuchikage's book.

74
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,889
-Yes.

75
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,189
-A wide array read of forbidden
jutsu useful to insect handlers

76
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,822
are said to be within it.

77
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:03,856
If our clan had had it
when we fought the Aburame,

78
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,322
we wouldn't have
lost that cursed day.

79
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,456
-Maybe, and yet
all of our people

80
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,822
have been searching for it a
great many years to no avail.

81
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,822
You really think we can
find it after all this time?

82
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:16,122
-That's why we need the bikochu.

83
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,589
This belonged to my grandfather.

84
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:24,222
He was the original Tsuchikage.

85
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,589
When the bikochu
emerges, it'll seek out

86
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:29,089
the first scent
it's introduced to.

87
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,589
We should be able to locate the
book of secrets grandfather hid

88
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,356
as he was dying.

89
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,822
This lock of his hair
will lead us right to it.

90
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,522
If we can get our
hands on that book

91
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:44,589
and aren't afraid to use
it, there's no question.

92
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:47,922
The village will acknowledge us.

93
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,989
HINATA (VOICEOVER): They're
no different from me.

94
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:54,422
They just long for recognition.

95
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:54,922
Naruto.

96
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:05,756
[buzzing]

97
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,256
-Huh?

98
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,056
What's the story, Shino?

99
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,956
Where have they got Hinata?

100
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,356
-I don't know.

101
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,556
And they probably took out the
rest of the insects I sent too.

102
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:21,456
-Great.

103
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:22,589
Guess that's it, then.

104
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,622
We don't have a choice
but to do what they say.

105
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,356
-And after all the trouble
we went to get 'em.

106
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,789
-So, you think we
should desert Hinata?

107
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:31,756
-Are you crazy?

108
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,689
There's no way
we're gonna do that!

109
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:34,756
I don't care what happens.

110
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,689
I'm not gonna abandon her!

111
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,622
Anyone who leaves
a comrade is trash!

112
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:40,689
-Hear, hear.

113
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:41,956
[bark]

114
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,489
-The problem is,
we're still gonna

115
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:46,422
need our little friend here
if we wanna find Sasuke.

116
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,789
-Well.

117
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:49,789
We'll just have to come up with
another way of tracking him

118
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:50,422
down.

119
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:51,622
-Yeah, you're right.

120
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:54,722
But for now, the priority
is rescuing Hinata.

121
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:58,556
-Although-- I wonder if
that's what Hinata would want.

122
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,489
-Huh?

123
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,456
-This entire plan,
it was her idea.

124
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,389
-What?

125
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:04,289
But--

126
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:05,622
-It's true.

127
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,922
I told her about the
existence of the bikochu.

128
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,089
However, the odds of finding
one are extremely low.

129
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,656
Kiba and I thought we should
set our sights on missions

130
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,922
that were sure to
help the village.

131
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:22,922
We didn't want to go
chasing some long shot.

132
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:30,656
But Hinata wouldn't give up.

133
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,089
She was adamant.

134
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,956
No matter how remote
our chances of success,

135
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,689
she said we should
move forward with it.

136
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,689
-She-- she really said all that?

137
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,856
-Yeah, I know.

138
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,556
We couldn't believe how
much fight she had in her.

139
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,456
She was so passionate
about it, all Shino

140
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,056
and I could do was agree.

141
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,189
-It's the first time Hinata has
ever volunteered for a mission.

142
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:55,922
For that reason as well,
I want us to succeed here.

143
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:56,856
-Yeah.

144
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,456
-But back to our
original question.

145
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:01,922
How do we rescue her if we
don't even know where she is?

146
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:06,556
-There is one place where we
know she'll make an appearance.

147
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,556
-Of course!

148
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,256
When we make the trade off.

149
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,289
-That's right!

150
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,122
They'll have to bring
her for the bug!

151
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,322
-Correct.

152
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,156
It's our only chance.

153
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,456
-All right, you guys!

154
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,856
So that's the plan!

155
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,189
We save Hinata and protect
the bikoch, no matter what!

156
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:30,589
There, you see?

157
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,089
We brought the bikochu.

158
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,722
Now hand over Hinata!

159
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,722
-Set the insect cage down
on that rock right there.

160
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:42,089
-Hinata!

161
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:43,089
There's your stupid bug.

162
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,722
Now let her go!

163
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,689
-Not until we've had a look.

164
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,889
-What is this?

165
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:03,456
You little brats.

166
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:07,722
You think you can mock
our clan like this?

167
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,189
A goliath beetle?

168
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,456
Are you kidding?

169
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:12,556
-Shino, now!

170
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,756
-What?

171
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:14,556
-Parasitic Insects!

172
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,922
-Recovery successful.

173
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,822
-Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

174
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,493
-Naruto!

175
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:31,960
-OK, I hope you're ready!

176
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,293
-You guys are done here.

177
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,160
Wait a second.

178
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,793
[bark]

179
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:49,626
-You guys!

180
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,360
She doesn't smell like Hinata.

181
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,260
-Huh?

182
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,926
-Just as I thought.

183
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,293
-What the-- It's only beeswax.

184
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,793
[buzzing]

185
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,293
-Incoming!

186
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:08,260
-Aw, great!

187
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,226
They're all over the place!

188
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,226
Hey, watch it!

189
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,726
-Sorry, Naruto.

190
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,226
It's these stupid bees!

191
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,860
-I know!

192
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:15,826
There's too many!

193
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,193
Why are we fighting
these things?

194
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,193
They're just wax!

195
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,160
-You guys!

196
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:24,560
Don't move!

197
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,960
-This one isn't fake.

198
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,226
And it's carrying
a deadly poison.

199
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,960
It appears there are
real ones in the mix.

200
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:33,626
-Yeah, but they all
look exactly the same.

201
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,726
-Watch my back for a second.

202
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,093
Wall of Insects Jutsu!

203
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:47,860
-Wow, that's cool.

204
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,326
WOMAN: Impressive
strength for a Genin.

205
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,293
-Huh?

206
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,293
[laughter]

207
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:03,060
-But I should expect no
less from the Aburame clan.

208
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,526
Isn't that right?

209
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,060
-The Kamizuru clan.

210
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,093
-So, cat's out of the bag.

211
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:12,226
-You give Hinata back!

212
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,126
-We had every intention
of returning her--

213
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,860
if you were good little boys
and handed over the bikochu.

214
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:23,160
Only thing is, it doesn't
look like that was your plan.

215
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:25,326
-So, what do we do?

216
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,926
-You're an insect handler.

217
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,960
You'd never carry a delicate
creature like the bikochu

218
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:31,826
into the danger of battle.

219
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,326
So we'll finish you
off right here and now,

220
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,060
and then take our
time afterwards

221
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:36,993
to search for the bug.

222
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,660
-Wall of Insects Jutsu!

223
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,526
-Heh.

224
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,793
Is that the only
trick she's got?

225
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:45,360
-Huh?

226
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,060
-Shino!

227
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,460
Paper bombs!

228
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,893
-Huh?

229
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,893
[screaming]

230
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,893
-You asked for it, lady

231
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:14,693
-1,000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!

232
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:15,693
-Beetle clones?

233
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,660
-Hmph.

234
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,326
Nothing but two-bit tricks.

235
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,393
-Well?

236
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,060
What's the game plan
gonna be now, Shino?

237
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,393
-Don't you think we should
turn around and head back?

238
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:31,093
We don't want those
guys to find the spot

239
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,560
where we hid the bikochu.

240
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:33,893
-Don't worry.

241
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,493
The location will be
safe for the time being.

242
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:39,093
Right now, all that
matters is finding Hinata.

243
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:54,826
[whine]

244
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:01,760
-No question about it.

245
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,160
-In there, huh?

246
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:03,993
[bark]

247
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:04,593
NARUTO: Hinata!

248
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,526
Where are you?

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,326
-Stay on your toes, everybody.

250
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,326
There's no sign of those guys,
but it could still be a trap.

251
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,326
[barking]

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,293
-Is she there?

253
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:26,626
Hinata-- She's alive!

254
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,560
-Hinata!

255
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:28,293
Hey, are you OK?

256
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:31,993
-Don't worry.

257
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,626
We'll have you out
of this in no time.

258
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:44,693
KIBA: Almost there.

259
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,326
-All right.

260
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,860
That's the last of it.

261
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:54,160
-Naruto?

262
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,626
Oh, thank you.

263
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,526
-Hinata?

264
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,026
-Huh?

265
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:08,426
-I-- I-- ah-- What the
heck ya doin', you nut job?

266
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
-Out with it.

267
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,160
Who are you?

268
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,026
-Um, Shino?

269
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,326
What are you talking about?

270
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,526
That's Hinata, remember?

271
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,826
-No, it's not.

272
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,426
If it were, she'd have
gone red in the face

273
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,893
and passed out
after hugging you.

274
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:23,226
-Huh?

275
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,993
Yeah, but-- Akamaru's nose
never would have missed that.

276
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:27,826
[whine]

277
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,826
-What?

278
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,826
The cent of two
people mixed together?

279
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,526
-If you're not Hinata,
then who are you?

280
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,460
-Naruto, please.

281
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,393
I swear, it's really me.

282
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:40,460
-If that's true,
show us what you've

283
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:42,826
tried to stick on
Naruto's back just now.

284
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:48,860
NARUTO: A paper bomb?

285
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:52,093
-You were gonna
blow his head off!

286
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,460
[giggle]

287
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:58,326
-I don't believe it.

288
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,293
I was sure that would work.

289
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:02,526
-You.

290
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
I see.

291
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:06,093
The one on the hill
was only a clone.

292
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,360
KIBA: She had Hinata's
coat around her.

293
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:10,493
So that's how she hid her scent.

294
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,426
-Out with it.

295
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,960
What have you done
with our friend?

296
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:13,993
-So sorry.

297
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,426
Hard to say, really.

298
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,826
-Good.

299
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,226
Looks like the
rest of their clan

300
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,393
followed Suzumebachi
right into our trap.

301
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:31,793
Your comrades won't
be coming, dear.

302
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:35,726
Guess they feel the bikochu
is more of value than you are,

303
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,393
so you can forget
about being rescued.

304
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,326
MAN: All right, come on.

305
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,060
We'd better start searching
for the bikochu they've hidden.

306
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,860
There's not much
time until sunrise.

307
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,126
-Right.

308
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,926
I wouldn't bother
trying to escape.

309
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,326
You make even the slightest
move out of the ordinary,

310
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,493
and the bees will
sever the rope.

311
00:16:58,526 --> 00:16:59,926
Right up ahead is
the entrance to

312
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,626
a labyrinthine
underground sewer.

313
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:09,226
Plunge in there and you'll
be dead in an instant.

314
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,693
We have no desire
to kill anyone.

315
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:17,260
If you want to live, I
suggest you stay still.

316
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,226
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I feel so awful.

317
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,060
In the end, I was nothing but
a burden, the same as always.

318
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:28,026
-You guys are like
a trio of moths,

319
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,693
flying blindly into the fire.

320
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:37,193
If you're lucky, though,
maybe we'll meet again.

321
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,593
Careful, boys.

322
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,093
This is no ordinary cave.

323
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:53,260
-Hey!

324
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:54,726
Come on, you guys, let go!

325
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,260
SHINO: There's nothing
else to grab onto.

326
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,626
Just be patient.

327
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,793
We need to get our bearings.

328
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:11,760
-There are bee larvae
everywhere you look!

329
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,326
-Bee larvae, huh?

330
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,426
Something's wrong.

331
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,493
They're far too big.

332
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:18,160
-All you have to
do is tell me where

333
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:19,826
you've hidden the bikochu.

334
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,893
I get what I want
and you get to live.

335
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,326
NARUTO: Forget it!

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,993
Our mission was to
bring back the bikochu,

337
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,226
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do!

338
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,393
-Really?

339
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:30,293
Willing to die for it?

340
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,460
-Paper bombs.

341
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:37,326
-Come on, Akamaru!

342
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,793
Fang over Fang!

343
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:42,793
HINATA (VOICEOVER): That sound!

344
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:44,260
I see.

345
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,260
They haven't given up yet.

346
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,726
They're still fighting.

347
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,726
This isn't the time for tears.

348
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,226
I can't give up.

349
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,693
This whole mission was my idea.

350
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,726
Byakugan!

351
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,493
There are 13 bees
around the rope.

352
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:05,893
If I can take them all
down at once, I'll be safe.

353
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,826
But I'm not used to
such small targets.

354
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:14,193
[explosion]

355
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,526
-Impossible.

356
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,960
How could he--

357
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,360
-I told you.

358
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:33,093
I just don't know
when to give up.

359
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,493
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto!

360
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:36,460
Right.

361
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,893
Quitting isn't an option.

362
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,893
I have to concentrate,
control my chakra.

363
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:43,660
-Fang over Fang!

364
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,360
-How many of these
things are there?

365
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,260
-Kiba.

366
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,026
-Sorry.

367
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,093
I'm coming up empty here.

368
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:01,593
For some reason, my
body's giving out.

369
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,093
-It can't be.

370
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:06,760
-The larvae in this hive hunger
for only one kind of food.

371
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:07,693
Chakra.

372
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,093
-What?

373
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,960
-And as long as
you're down there,

374
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,526
they'll drain every ounce
you have through the walls

375
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,026
around you.

376
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,660
Don't pout.

377
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,326
Why don't you just
tell me the location?

378
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,726
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Now!

379
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,193
4, 5, 6.

380
00:20:48,226 --> 00:20:52,193
10, 11, 12, 13.

381
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,160
Oh, no!

382
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,660
-Summoning Jutsu.

383
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,693
What's your preference?

384
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,426
You want the larvae
coming after you,

385
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,426
or would you rather be
food for the big guy here?

386
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,593
It's your choice, gentlemen.

387
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:20,193
What'll it be?

389
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,864
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
What do I do?

390
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,597
My body won't move.

391
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,630
I just wanted to help Naruto.

392
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:10,097
That's the whole reason I
fought for this mission.

393
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,564
I can't end up being
a burden on everyone.

394
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,497
Not again!

395
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,497
No.

396
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,497
I have to calm down,
focus my chakra,

397
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,930
and remember my training.

398
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,564
I don't have any other
choice right now.

399
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:24,930
Next time, Blaze Away, Byakugan!

400
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,730
This Is My Ninja Way.
