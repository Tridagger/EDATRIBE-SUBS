1
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:12,792
[theme music]

2
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:15,559
-Summoning jutsu.

3
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,864
That just had to work.

4
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,631
What the heck is the difference
between a frog and a tadpole

5
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:35,031
anyway?

6
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,578
NARUTO: Live or die.

7
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:45,385
Risk it all to win it all.

8
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,888
-Come on, jump.

9
00:02:46,923 --> 00:02:47,490
-OK.

10
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,769
-Look, Purvy Sage, can't you
act like you believe in me?

11
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,226
-He collapses again.

12
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,330
But I suppose it's no surprise.

13
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:10,303
For three weeks now he's been
getting through his training

14
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,039
on guts and determination alone.

15
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,490
-Lord Hokage?

16
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,258
-What is it Anko?

17
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:50,743
-I'm sorry.

18
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,078
But I'm--

19
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,414
-You're what?

20
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:55,552
Are you feeling guilty
that you returned alive

21
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:56,788
from the Forest of Death?

22
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,631
There's no need for that.

23
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,971
After all, you no longer have
a connection to Orochimaru,

24
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:05,573
right?

25
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,188
There's no ninja alive
today in the Village Hidden

26
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:17,162
in the Leaves who could ever
even hope to defeat him.

27
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:25,947
I, myself, probably
would not be his equal.

28
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,354
-I wish the Fourth
Hokage were still alive.

29
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,758
-You shouldn't say such things.

30
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,932
It's only because he
sacrificed himself and died

31
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,468
that our land was saved.

32
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,140
Besides, that's all in the past.

33
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,079
It's a story from 13 years ago.

34
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,349
He's gone.

35
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,118
And we can't change that.

36
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:49,060
We must do what we
can with what we have.

37
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,163
-Yes, sir.

38
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,404
-Very well.

39
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,208
I'm going out to
get some fresh air.

40
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:06,228
And, Anko, don't blame yourself.

41
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,653
PURVY SAGE: Come on.

42
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,688
Open your eyes already.

43
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:24,999
-Hey.

44
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,502
What was that for?

45
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:27,604
-Oh, that.

46
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:29,876
To knock sense into you
since you have none.

47
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:30,678
-I don't?

48
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:31,713
Look at you.

49
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,884
-You've been training
for three weeks.

50
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,420
And you're still at this level?

51
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,759
If you continue like
this, it's pointless.

52
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:38,927
-Hey, that's not true.

53
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,064
Give me a break.

54
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,733
I'm trying as hard
as I can here.

55
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,635
-Maybe you are.

56
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,771
Maybe you're not.

57
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,577
If you want to succeed
at this summoning jutsu,

58
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,583
then you must do it like
your life depends on it.

59
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,252
-What do you think
I've been doing?

60
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,290
I train every day
like I'm going to die.

61
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,260
If you have time to
complain about it,

62
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,532
teach me a trick to to do it.

63
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,801
-A trick?

64
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,471
Well, I don't know.

65
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,306
-What?

66
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,411
You're not going to teach me?

67
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,949
-You need to put
your life at risk.

68
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,285
-My life?

69
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,053
-That's right.

70
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:09,188
It's no joke.

71
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,992
Even so, are you
willing to do it?

72
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:11,894
-Of course.

73
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:13,431
I always risk my life.

74
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:16,871
There's no point in anything
if you don't go all the way.

75
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:19,644
-I see.

76
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:20,211
All right.

77
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,012
Follow me.

78
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:37,981
-So what the heck are we doing
at a place like this any way?

79
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:42,523
You're not looking for
more girls again, are you?

80
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:45,328
-Say, that's not a bad
idea at all, Naruto.

81
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,531
But, no, I'm not.

82
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:48,034
This is about bathing.

83
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,205
We must purify our bodies.

84
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:50,807
-Huh?

85
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,693
OK.

86
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,334
Something weirder than
normal is going on here.

87
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,206
-What a nice bath.

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,114
Oh, yeah, it's just like heaven.

89
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,784
Truly in heaven.

90
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:19,931
-Hey, Purvy Sage.

91
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,368
-I'm the Toad Sage.

92
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,005
-Yeah, well, whatever
you are, what

93
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,843
does taking a bath have to
do with the summoning jutsu

94
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:26,244
anyway?

95
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:30,319
Hey?

96
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:31,254
Hello?

97
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,125
I'm talking to you.

98
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:33,860
What?

99
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:34,395
What is it?

100
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:35,931
Why'd you stop?

101
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:42,978
-Hey, Naruto, tell me, is there
something you like to eat?

102
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,984
-Huh?

103
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:46,619
NARUTO: All right.

104
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:50,293
I'm going to eat.

105
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,896
This is great.

106
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,137
Why can't the training
be like this every day?

107
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,871
-Good.

108
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:56,773
Now eat up.

109
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,910
It may be your last meal.

110
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,180
-Huh?

111
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,349
-Oh, nothing.

112
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:02,317
Nothing at all.

113
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:03,253
Anyway, eat up.

114
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,522
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,958
Eat like there's no tomorrow.

116
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,601
-I don't know what's so funny.

117
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,204
And I don't care.

118
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:13,239
I got food.

119
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:21,656
Hit me, chef.

120
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,360
Seconds on that ramen.

121
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:23,961
-OK.

122
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:28,971
NARUTO: One more.

123
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:30,007
CHEF: Here you go.

124
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,643
NARUTO: This time
with barbecue pork.

125
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,614
CHEF: You got it.

126
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,582
NARUTO: Ah.

127
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,687
Oh, man, I'm stuffed.

128
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,691
Thanks a bunch, Purvy Sage.

129
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,901
He left?

130
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:44,402
-Thank you.

131
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:55,525
-I've never seen
anything so empty.

132
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,366
PURVY SAGE: So are you full now?

133
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,537
-Quit your messing around.

134
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:04,978
You were supposed to
treat me to that meal.

135
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,812
-You, fool.

136
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,351
I never said I'd treat you.

137
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:09,353
-But you're supposed to.

138
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:10,923
You're the grown-up.

139
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:15,064
-Say, Naruto, do you happen
to have a girl that you like?

140
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,033
-Huh?

141
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,703
-I asked if you
have a special girl.

142
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,573
You know, someone close to you?

143
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,642
-Well, I don't know.

144
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:21,912
I mean, kind of.

145
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:22,814
Sort of.

146
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,018
I guess you could
say I like her.

147
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,254
-So who is it?

148
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:26,988
-No one.

149
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:27,924
Just Sakura.

150
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:28,659
-OK.

151
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:29,961
Let's go see her.

152
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:32,900
Because you're going
to give her a big hug.

153
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,673
-What?

154
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,509
This is part of my training?

155
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,478
-Well, yeah.

156
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,650
I mean, it's close enough.

157
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:41,351
-Yes.

158
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:42,053
All right.

159
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:43,121
Let's go.

160
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:47,797
But, if I do hug her,
Sakura will-- no,

161
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,834
this is part of
my training, too.

162
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:50,736
I have to do it.

163
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,339
I have to be strong.

164
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:55,312
But of course, I'm also
going to be black and blue.

165
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,018
And Sakura won't want to
talk to me for a while.

166
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,989
But still, if I
want to learn how

167
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,028
to do this summoning jutsu
right then this can't be helped.

168
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,270
But Sakura's going to-- no.

169
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:08,707
But then again--

170
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,909
-Just go already.

171
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,793
-OK, what do you want?

172
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,964
-Um, well, you see--

173
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:24,304
-Look, if it's money you
want, you can just forget it.

174
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,406
I'm not giving you any.

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,909
-No, that's not it.

176
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,815
It's just I, uh--

177
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,886
Oh, man how can I say this?

178
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,757
If I tell her it's
for my training,

179
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,694
I'm going to get
wailed on for sure.

180
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,465
-If it's nothing,
I'm going home.

181
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:39,301
-No, no, wait a minute.

182
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,481
This is it.

183
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,716
This is my chance.

184
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:48,119
Here I come, Sakura.

185
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,731
-What do you think you're doing?

186
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:54,900
Back off.

187
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,419
-Ow.

188
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:05,521
Well, so much for that.

189
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:11,399
-Wooh.

190
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,636
What a punch.

191
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,172
Ah, yes, young love.

192
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:21,386
-Hey, if I do this, can
I really summon a frog?

193
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,221
-You bet.

194
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:22,722
Of course.

195
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:23,491
Absolutely.

196
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:24,826
Without a doubt.

197
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,263
-Are you sure?

198
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:28,869
-Is there anything else
you've always wanted to do?

199
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,338
-Huh?

200
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:31,440
Anything?

201
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,008
-What?

202
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,311
What are you--

203
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,468
-To tap into his enormous
chakra and use it.

204
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm certain that it's
extremely difficult

205
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,443
to control that kind of power.

206
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,950
It's also true that Naruto's
body is too small a vessel

207
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:56,257
to contain the
Nine-tailed Fox's chakra.

208
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,764
It's likely that because that
chakra put such a burden on it,

209
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:04,106
Naruto's body normally
suppresses it.

210
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,179
If the key to drawing out
the Nine-tailed Fox's chakra

211
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:10,586
is danger and emotion, he has
to physically experience them

212
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:14,160
until he can learn to summon
the chakra on his own.

213
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,733
Please forgive me for what I
am about to do, Fourth Hokage.

214
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,536
-Where-- where are we?

215
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:36,739
Tell me.

216
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:38,509
-Stand up.

217
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,912
-What?

218
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,215
What's going on?

219
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,018
-Your training ends right here.

220
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:44,054
-Huh?

221
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,590
But I haven't done anything yet.

222
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:49,397
-Naruto, starting now you
must stare death in the face.

223
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,133
-Death?

224
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,201
-That's right.

225
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,838
To stave off the
horror of death,

226
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:55,143
you must release
enormous chakra.

227
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,915
Once you experience
that, you'll understand

228
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,785
how to release the red chakra.

229
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:02,825
If you don't wish to die,
do something about it.

230
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:03,426
Now.

231
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:19,759
All right, Naruto.

232
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:23,400
Now we shall see if the strength
that's been given to you

233
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,703
is a blessing or a curse.

234
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,288
-If I don't grab onto
something, I'll die.

235
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:38,664
Now.

236
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,146
-It is impossible, Naruto.

237
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,216
You have to recognize that.

238
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,920
The rocks are too slippery.

239
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,926
And falling at that speed, with
the limited control of chakra

240
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,735
that you possess, you can't
possibly cling to the rock.

241
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,072
Naruto, you must see it.

242
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,911
You can only depend on the
chakra of the Nine-tailed Fox

243
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,381
now.

244
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:07,021
This time, you have to
turn the key yourself.

245
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,966
-If I go on like this, I
really am going to die.

246
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:16,908
Die.

247
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:21,450
Die.

248
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:36,344
-Today's history
class will be outside.

249
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,483
As you're all aware,
on this rock face

250
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,855
are the sculptures
of the Hokages.

251
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,391
They're in order from the left.

252
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:49,203
There's the First, the Second,
the Third, and the Fourth.

253
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:52,944
You probably could
have figured that out.

254
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,881
-The old man sure
looks different

255
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,184
up there than he does now.

256
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:58,255
I mean, he used to have hair.

257
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:02,997
-Iruka Sensei?

258
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,235
So who's the Fifth Hokage?

259
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,112
-That hasn't been decided yet.

260
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,183
Maybe it'll be your
favorite teacher.

261
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,326
-So working in an
occasional joke

262
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,633
to make for an engaging
history lesson, eh, Iruka?

263
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,535
-Oh, Lord Hokage.

264
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:23,205
-Whoa, it's the Third.

265
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,011
-Hey, old man, what
are you doing here?

266
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:28,616
-I just wanted to look at
the mountainside images,

267
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,052
like you students are doing.

268
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,889
-Well, you've come
at a great time.

269
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:33,292
Would you care to join me?

270
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,348
This is the man
whose likeness is

271
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,619
carved up there
on that mountain.

272
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,158
He's the great Third Hokage.

273
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,663
The Third Hokage was
called the strongest

274
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:53,700
and even considered a genius.

275
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,370
He was also called Professor.

276
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,779
-I am still here.

277
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,416
Talk about me in
the present tense.

278
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:01,917
-Yes.

279
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,551
Of course.

280
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,587
Sorry.

281
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,722
-Come on, are you really strong?

282
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,192
-Yeah, cause you don't look it.

283
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:09,365
-Yeah, that's for sure.

284
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,802
-Hey, stop it.

285
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,571
If you're granted
the title of Hokage,

286
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,241
it means only one thing.

287
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,747
That you're the strongest
in this entire land.

288
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,982
-Yeah?

289
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,151
Than I'm going to
be the Fifth Hokage.

290
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,654
I mean, I'm way strong.

291
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,759
And handsome, too.

292
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,364
-Well you won't make it with
the grades you have now.

293
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,577
-At least you have confidence.

294
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,812
Ah, just look at you.

295
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,417
You're all so young, unlike me.

296
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,756
There might be
someone among you who

297
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,361
will take the name of Hokage.

298
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:42,431
Remember, you have
just one life.

299
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,204
So don't choose a road
that's impossible.

300
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,945
It doesn't matter what you do
if you live and die as you like.

301
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:58,331
However, no matter what
route you end up taking,

302
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:01,771
remember to protect the people
that are precious to you.

303
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,610
-The people precious to us?

304
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:05,946
-That's correct.

305
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:08,752
The ones you appreciate the
very most and trust and love

306
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:10,021
with all your heart.

307
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:12,927
Do you have people
like that in your life?

308
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,895
-Mm-hm.

309
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:14,897
Yeah, I do.

310
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,367
My dad and my mom.

311
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,173
And my big brother, even
though I don't like him much.

312
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,212
Oh, yeah, and my
dog, [? gunta. ?]

313
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,448
-I have some, too.

314
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,385
My friends.

315
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:26,154
-Me, too.

316
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,433
-So do you have
people like that, too?

317
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,735
-Yes, I do.

318
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:34,771
Of course.

319
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,372
-Really?

320
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:35,974
Who?

321
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,377
Who?

322
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,516
-Well, I have my grandson,
Colonel [? hamaru ?].

323
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:49,267
And I also have all the
people in this village.

324
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:05,900
Just as it was for
you, back then.

325
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,801
NARUTO: What?

326
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,147
Huh?

327
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,321
[growling]

328
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:38,666
[growling]

329
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,860
-This feeling.

330
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,633
It's the red chakra again.

331
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,639
[growling]

332
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,022
[roar]

333
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,639
-What is this?

334
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,301
What is this?

335
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,405
It's huge.

336
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:33,978
-Come closer, little boy.

337
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,325
-Um--

338
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,665
-How wonderful it would
be to kill and eat you.

339
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:46,270
But this accursed
gate confines me.

340
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,211
It's that infuriating
sealing spell.

341
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:56,491
-You're-- you're
the-- Nine-tailed Fox.

342
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,634
Of course.

343
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,374
The red chakra is
this guy's chakra.

344
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,611
-Why are you here, foolish boy?

345
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:07,947
What do you want?

346
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,920
Or have you simply come
to offer yourself to me

347
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:13,658
so I might feast
upon your marrow?

348
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,441
-All right, look you stupid
fox, you're in my body

349
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:23,044
and you owe me rent.

350
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,516
So for payment, I'll
take your chakra.

351
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:29,124
You got that?

352
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:32,296
[laughter]

353
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,469
NINE-TAILED FOX: Well, I
suppose I can't kill you, can I?

354
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,443
After all, if you die, I die.

355
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:41,649
Your courage is most
impressive, little boy.

356
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:46,425
Very well.

357
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:50,968
As a reward for making it this
far, I will loan you my chakra.

358
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,316
-This is it.

359
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,326
Summoning jutsu.

360
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,323
-Well done, kid.

361
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,293
-What's this?

362
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:21,896
Where in the world am I?

363
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,806

00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:07,097
NARUTO: Yeah, finally I got
the summoning jutsu to work.

365
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,670
Listen, giant toad, from
today on, I'm your master.

366
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:11,772
Whoa.

367
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:12,474
OK.

368
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,810
Nevermind.

369
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:15,213
You know, what big boss,
you can be in charge..

370
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:19,021
Either way, I'm just glad
I pulled that jutsu off.

371
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:22,648
Next time, he flies,
he jumps, he lurks.

372
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,114
Chief Toad appears.

373
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,848
I got to say, this guy
is seriously scary.

374
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:30,848
I've never seen a
toad like him before.
