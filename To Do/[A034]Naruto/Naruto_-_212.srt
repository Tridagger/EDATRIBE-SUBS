-Hey!

3
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,679
Hold it down in there.

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,348
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

5
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,550
But Naruto Uzumaki
is on the scene.

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,154

not taking Gantetsu.

TODOROKI: That's Gantetsu.

10
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,510
No.

11
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,647
Is that-- It can't be.

12
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,090
-You brat.

13
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,692
So you managed to
get out of my net.

14
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,293
-Your net's not so tough.

15
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,762
I could chew right through it.

16
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,431

this for breakfast.

You can chew on that all day.

I'll get you out of here.

I'll get out of this.

your line, but I

-Akio?

where is he taking them?

00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,580
-Gantetsu, did I hear you right?

62
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,684
Did you call him Akio--
the boy who was taken?

63
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,353
-You heard right.

64
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,321
That is his name.

65
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,759
That boy is your-- he
is your younger brother.

00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,227
-Oh.

-No, that's a lie.

00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,590
-You should know.

77
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,192
It was you who killed him!

78
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,126
-No, you're wrong!

79
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,460
-No way. Not Gantetsu.

80
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,162
He didn't kill anyone.

81
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,096
He saved Akio's life.

82
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,667
Same as he did with all of us.

83
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,038
-Five years ago-- it
was five years ago

84
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,508
that I first woke up to the
evil I'd been a part of.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,177
When I found myself
carrying Akio.

86
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,178
-Akio!

87
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:45,679
Aah!

88

-You mustn't do that.

90
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,086
You'll only inhale the smoke.

91
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,196
I thought by saving
the boy maybe

92
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,667
I could make amends for
what we'd been doing.

93
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,269
But it wasn't enough.

94
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,638
[coughing]

95
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,007
There would always be
more of them to save.

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,743
More young victims like Akio.

97
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,013
That was when I first
came up with my plan

98
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,515
to destroy the Ninja Dropouts.

99
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,984
-Oh!

100
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,151
-You really mean that?

101
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,289
-Gantetsu--

102
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,423
-Gantetsu, are you all right?

103
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,591
-They didn't hurt you, did they?

104
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,694
-(IN UNISON) We were so worried.

105

SAKURA HARUNO: He rescued
them all from villages

106
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,164
that were attacked.

107
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,400
He secretly took care of
them with the treasure

108
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,534
he stole from the gang.

109
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,336
Since Akio was the
oldest, he helped

110
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,338
Gantetsu look after the others.

111
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,007
They're like a family now.

112
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,408
Gantetsu is like their father.

113
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,282
-My little brother-- to
think I found him only

114
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,583
to lose him again.

[sobbing]

116
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,385
-Akio!

[wind blowing]

118
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:52,372
-And just where do you
think you're going?

119
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,076
-I know where they've gone.

120
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,644
I'll find him.

121
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,012
I'll get him back.

122
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,281
-I'll get my brother
back, not you.

123
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,084
Your only job is to
show me where they are.

124
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,652
Then just stay out of my way!

125
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,187
-I understand how you feel.

126
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,422
But don't you think you're
forgetting something?

127
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,324
After all, he saved these kids.

128
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,759
He saved Akio too.

129
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,562
You wouldn't even have a brother
if it hadn't been for him!

130
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,097
-What is it you want?

131
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,767
Do you really expect me
to be grateful to him?

132
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,635
He's a murderer and a thief.

133
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,604
Have you forgotten
he's part of the gang

134
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,274
that killed my
mother and father?

135
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,976
GANTETSU: He's right.

136
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,679
My guilt can't be so
easily washed away.

137
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,550
Do whatever you want with me.

138
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,687
But after we get Akio back.

139
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,392
-All right then,
but I'm coming too!

140
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,062
-As am I. Sakura, you stay
and keep an eye on the kids,

141
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,562
all right?

142
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,697
-Leave them to me.

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,761
-Hey, are you OK?

145
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:28,168
-For years, five long years,
I've lived hating that man.

[muffled screaming]

147
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,643
I can't change the way I feel.

148
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,977
It's too late.

149
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,251
-The important thing right now
is saving your little brother.

150
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,619
-Yes, I know.

151
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,455
And I will save him.

152
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,290
I will not fail this time.

153
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:04,219
[beating and crying sounds]

154
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:08,490
-Ahh!

155
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,225
-Where is it, brat?

156
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,426
Where is the treasure?

157
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,627
AKIO: Ahh!

158
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,130
-Where have you and
Gantetsu hidden it?

159
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,636
Come on, talk.

160
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:25,073
-No matter what you
do, I'll never tell.

161
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:27,142
-Aren't you the
little tough guy.

[crickets]

163
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,317
-(WHISPERING)
That's the hideout?

164
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:37,619
It's the size of a village.

165
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,490
GANTETSU: The big one's
where Shura lives.

166
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,159
He's the leader.

167
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,261
I'm certain that's
where we'll find Akio.

168
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,232
-Akio.

169
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:54,636
[gong]

170
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:57,205
-Hey, don't just go
running in there.

171
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:57,672
Terrific.

[clattering woodblocks]

173
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,351
-Great.

174
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:11,119
Now they know we're here!

175
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,227
-Ahh!

176
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,495
Ha!

177
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,131
-Oof.

178
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,432
-Ugh.

[sounds of fighting]

180
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:33,241
-Go on ahead.

181
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:34,909
Let me handle this.

182
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:38,179
-Got it. they're all yours.

183
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:38,646
-Oof.

184
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,550
TODOROKI: Akio!

185
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:43,585
GANTETSU: This way.

186

The cellar.

187
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,958
That's where Shura would
take him to question him.

188
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,229
-He's a fully trained shinobi.

189
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:59,334
No telling what this
guy's got in store for us!

190
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,268
-Best if I go first.

TODOROKI: Akio!

192
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,253
-Todoroki, wait!

00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,020
TODOROKI: Akio!

194
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,493
-Gantetsu, out of the way!

195
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:26,161
-Stay back!

00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:31,099
NARUTO: Gantetsu!

197
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,233

200
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,609
SHURA: Only one rat was
caught in the trap, eh?

201
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:42,911
NARUTO: Shura!

202
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,480
SHURA: That is
one stubborn brat.

203
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,282
He wouldn't tell me a thing.

204
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:50,885
But I've thought of another
way of finding the treasure.

205
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,223
So I have no use
for any of you now.

-Don't just stand
there, get after him!

210
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,316
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

211
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,117

sure about this.

them in your care.

that's what it was.

He was-- he was
trying to say Akio.

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,118
And I thought, all
this time I thought--

00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:13,681
-Mm.

00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,623
-Brother.

250
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:25,393
I always knew you'd
come for me someday.

00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:28,029
-You're going to
be all right, Akio.

the Ninja Dropouts.

-Yeah.

256
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,369
-Good riddance.

00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:11,105
Hey, whatever
happened to Naruto?

-Huh?

up, don't despair.

are you OK, Akio?

AKIO: Yeah.

SAKURA HARUNO: No, you're not.

270
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,100
You're hurt!

271
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,167
AKIO: Don't worry.

272
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,069
I'm all right, really.

273
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:44,238
-They had a pretty
rough time, Sakura.

274
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:45,606
You better take a look at him.

275
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,243
-Right, I'm on it.

276
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,111

No more interruptions.

278
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,921
Take me to the capital.

00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,497
TODOROKI: In my heart I can't
forgive you for the crimes

you committed.

00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:11,899
But it's true.

282
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,067
You saved my brother.

283
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,508
I'll report there
was a rescue attempt.

284
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,543
All of the Ninja
Dropouts were killed,

285
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,245
and the prisoner
along with them.

-You'll be staying too, right?

292
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,974
You belong here with Gantetsu
and all these other children.

293
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,948
I wasn't much of a big brother.

294
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,284
Here's your chance
to be a better one.

295
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:06,287
Be their big brother.

296
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,221
-I'm going to try.

297
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,161
What is it?

298
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:17,198
-Something I was going to
give you five years ago.

299
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,138
-Thanks brother.

300
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:24,972
That means a lot.

-Good bye.

-Good bye everyone.

NARUTO: Uh, one thing
we forgot about.

308
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:08,416
How do we find our way out
of here without Gantetsu?

309
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,184
-Well we can't go back.

310

-This looks familiar.

311
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,087
Are we going in circles?

eat I cannot go another step.

were you thinking?

-What?

317
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,232
He was hurt, so I took
him to the hospital.

318
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:08,867
-But to bring an outsider
into the village?

319

-Yeah, he's OK.

00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:10,803
Trust me.

321
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:11,703
-How do we know what he is?

322
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,172
He has amnesia.

323
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:15,340
How do we know he's not
an enemy spy, or worse?

324

-What do you say,
Grandma Tsunade?

325

GRANDMA TSUNADE: I'll
allow it this time.

326
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,446
But you're his keeper.

327
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,948
And I'll hold you responsible
for everything he does.

328
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,316
