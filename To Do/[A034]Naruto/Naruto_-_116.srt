00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:55,095
-Gentle Fist Art.

3
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:58,662
Eight Trigrams, 64 Palms!

4
00:01:58,695 --> 00:01:59,228
Augh!

5
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:06,595
Eight Trigrams, Two Palms!

6
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,062
-Ahh!

7
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,528
-Four Palms!

8
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,028
[smacking]

9
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:14,995
-Eight Palms!

10
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,962
16 Palms!

11
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:20,462
32 Palms!

12
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,428
64 Palms!

00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,362
[thud]

15
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,195
NEJI: What's going on?

16
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,428
Huh?

17
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:59,295
[cracking]

18
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,995
NEJI: The surface of his body--

19
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,928
[cracking]

20
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,362
[shattering]

21
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,128
NEJI: It's the same
material as that weapon

22
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,995
he spit from his mouth.

23
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:34,662
--[chuckling] Well,
well, that was close.

24
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:37,462
I know if I take just one
direct hit from that Gentle

25
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:42,195
Fist of yours, my whole chakra
network goes out of whack.

26
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,662
You keep me on my toes, kid.

27
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:49,828
-That material, where does
it come from, you monster?

28
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,562
-Impressive, yes?

29
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:55,295
My sticky spider thread is
actually a type of metal

30
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,962
that hardens the instant
it leaves my body.

31
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,462
It's impervious to chakra.

32
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:04,595
And, what's more, not only can
I secret it from my mouth as

33
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,095
you've seen, but from every
sweat gland in my body.

34
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:19,728
NEJI: That explains it.

35
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,195
No wonder my attacks on his
chakra points have no effect.

36
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,595
MALE SPEAKER: The spider
web net won't work on him,

37
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,295
and close-range
combat is suicide

38
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,462
against that Gentle Fist of is.

39
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,395
I'll just have to
keep my distance

40
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:41,895
and look for a blind spot.

41
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:50,295
-Huh?

42
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,762
[wind rustling trees]

43
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:37,662
MALE SPEAKER: It'll come
in a flash without a sound.

44
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,128
[shing]

45
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,062
MALE SPEAKER: Game over.

46
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,262
[slicing]

47
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,862
NEJI: The knife's just a ploy.

48
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,228
MALE SPEAKER: What?

49
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,228
-Eight Trigrams, Rotation!

50
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:07,728
[clinking]

51
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:09,228
[thunking]

52
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:27,362
MALE SPEAKER He-- he repelled
my attack with his chakra!

53
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:28,628
But how?

54
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,862
How did he see it coming?

55
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:33,362
Does he have eyes in
the back of his head?

56
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,895
[whooshing]

57
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:58,962
-We're going to go one on one
to have any chance for success.

58
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:01,262
Isn't that what you said?

59
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,062
Now get going!

60
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,495
I'll be right behind you.

61
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:14,495
NARUTO: We're gonna
have to go one on one.

62
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:17,162
-Naruto.

63
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,728
Sometimes your eyes are
even better than mine.

64
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,628
NARUTO: Come on, Neji.

65
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:26,795
You hurry and catch
up with us, got it?

66
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,395
[whoosh]

67
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,528
MALE SPEAKER: No way!

68
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:44,228
Can he actually see me?

69
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:48,828
What kind of a
freak is this guy?

70
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:51,562
-I know you're there.

71
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,695
Come out.

72
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,195
MALE SPEAKER: It's those eyes.

73
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:59,728
The chakra flow is not the
only thing they can see.

74
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:04,062
The power of his visual
jutsu is beyond belief!

75
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,728
NEJI: Long distance combat
is not to my advantage.

76
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:10,295
I've got to get
closer to him somehow.

77
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,495
MALE SPEAKER: OK, then!

78
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,662
I give you credit.

79
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,762
You've made this game
more of a challenge

80
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:23,562
than I thought it would be.

81
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:25,828
Time to start playing for real.

82
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,128
NEJI: He's like a totally
different opponent!

83
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,328
His chakra activity's
staggering!

84
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,795
And those markings.

85
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:50,595
MALE SPEAKER: So, this guy's
able to see me in the dark

86
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:53,462
and to dodge an
attack from behind.

87
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:58,128
In other words, he's got
360-degree X-ray vision.

88
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:02,962
On top of that,
there's that jutsu.

89
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:03,495
All right.

90
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:09,662
Summoning Jutsu!

91
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,062
-Nngh.

92
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,562
-I warned you, kid.

93
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,462
However strong
your defenses are,

94
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,695
I can find a way around it.

95
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:34,295
If he can block the
physical attacks

96
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:39,828
by emitting lots of chakra and
rotating, then all I have to do

97
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,295
is to stop that rotation.

98
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:44,428
Scatter!

99
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:50,828
-Nngh.

100
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:56,762
Rotation!

101
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,128
-[chuckling] There.

102
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:10,095
That slowed him down.

103
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:10,595
-Nngh.

104
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:17,962
-Now!

105
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:31,929
Now you die!

106
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:47,363
[growling] He slowed my dagger
with chakra at the last second!

107
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,129
NEJI: Neh.

108
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:53,096
What?

109
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,963
His web stopped my rotation.

110
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,196
Our chakra canceled
each other out!

111
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,129
Hmm.

112
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,496
Enough of this.

113
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,329
If my Rotation Jutsu
won't work, I'll

114
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,063
just have to cut the
threads one by one!

115
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:11,429
MALE SPEAKER: His strength
is close-range taijutsu.

116
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:16,196
So as long as I keep my
distance, I'm all right.

117
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:19,229
Just keep pounding away at him.

118
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,196
I've got all the
time in the world.

119
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:26,129
[chuckling]

120
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,629
[thunking]

121
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,963
-Nngh.

122
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,429
[cringe]

123
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:52,729
-Eight Trigrams, 64 Palms!

124
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,229
[thudding]

125
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:01,596
NEJI: There's no end to them!

126
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,163
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?

127
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,796
He changed his stance.

128
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,329
-Eight Trigrams, 128 Palms!

129
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,796
[thudding]

130
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,463
MALE SPEAKER: What?

131
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,896
The number of blows has doubled!

132
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:50,329
If he gets the chance to use
that on me, I'm finished.

133
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:56,163
Well, if it's a numbers
game, two can play at that!

134
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:59,596
[roars]

135
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,096

[thudding]

137
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,463
NEJI: There's too many of
them, and not enough time!

138
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,429
Just as I thought!

139
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:25,463
The Rotation won't work!

140
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:26,096
[slicing]

141
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,329
-Aaugh!

142
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:31,796
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?

143
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:32,296
-Guh.

144
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,363
MALE SPEAKER: So
that's how it is!

145
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,596
He's been anticipating
my attacks

146
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,796
by combining his X-ray vision
with telescopic long-range

147
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,929
vision, as well as a
360-degree line of sight.

148
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,796
Add to all that his
lightning-fast reflexes

149
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:00,229
and this kid's got an almost
impenetrable defensive barrier.

150
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:03,229
Judging from his reaction
time during that last attack,

151
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,329
he's able to see and
react to the kunai knives

152
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:09,029
once they get within 50
meters of his position,

153
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,463
but not quite all.

154
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,796
Somehow or another, one
of them got through.

155
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,529
And that means
there's a blind spot!

156
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:31,696
-Eight Trigrams, 64-- aaugh!

157
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:37,796
-Yeah.

158
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,129
Just as I thought.

159
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,629
[breathing heavily]

160
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,463

162
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:05,396

two should get through.

164
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:08,363

your defenses!

169
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,929
Actually, right
through your defenses!

170
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:35,596
All those fancy moves of yours,
they're all just an attempt

171
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:39,363
to hide your blind
spot, aren't they?

172
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,229
Those eyes don't quite
see everything, do they?

173
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:53,196
[grunts]

174
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,596
-Am I supposed to be impressed?

175
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,596
Why bother?

176
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,663
The game's over!

177
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:01,129
[labored breathing]

178
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,196
-What is the point?

179
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,229
What the heck do you
hope to accomplish?

180
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,063
Don't make this messier
than it has to be!

181
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:17,296
Just roll over and
die, why don't you!

You can't beat me!

[gasping]

184
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:24,663
[thunk]

185
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,063
LEE: I am not finished yet!

186
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:35,463
--[sighing] Lee, you just don't
know when to give up, do you?

187
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,563
You're never going
to able to beat him

188
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,229
because Neji's
something you're not.

189
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,696
He's a genius.

190
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:42,863
-A genius?

191
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,496
I do not care what he is!

192
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,263
Even without his
talent, I can still

193
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,563
take him if I just
work hard enough.

194
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,429
-It's no use, Lee.

195
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:51,829
-Huh?

196
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:56,996
-It doesn't matter how hard you
work, you will never beat me.

197
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,229
The outcome has been decided.

198
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,563
Hinata, you are the
pampered offspring

199
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,463
of the Hyuga's main branch.

200
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:06,029
People can't change, no
matter how hard they try.

201
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,529
This match is the same.

202
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,629
Your destiny was
decided the moment

203
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:17,929
I was chosen as your opponent.

204
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:19,163
-Oh yeah?

205
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,629
Well, we won't know that
until you beat me, will we?

206
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:25,129
[heavy breathing]

207
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:27,763
MALE SPEAKER: Time
to wrap this up.

208
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,429
[shing]

209
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:30,929
[roars]

210
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:42,863
[crashing]

211
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:51,329
[roars]

212
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:55,796
-[chuckling] Huh?

213
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,296
[thud]

214
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:58,796
NEJI: Gentle Fist!

215
00:17:58,829 --> 00:17:59,229
-Aaugh!

216
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:06,263
-Eeyah!

217
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,763
[thud]

218
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,763
-Perfect.

219
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,196
That's one pest
down, three to go.

220
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:15,196
-Nngh.

221
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,696
[slicing]

222
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,996
MALE SPEAKER: I
actually enjoyed myself,

223
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,996
even though the ending
was predictable.

224
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:42,796
Hmm?

225
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,229
-Nngh.

226
00:18:53,263 --> 00:19:03,296
[gasping]

227
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:24,129
[gasping]

228
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,929
MALE SPEAKER: [chuckling] That
many hits from that distance

229
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,229
and he's still standing?

230
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,663
I'll have to work on my aim.

231
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:37,196
This kid is something else.

232
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:41,196
He's turning out to be a lot
more entertaining than I ever

233
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,396
dreamed!

234
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,729
I'll have to demonstrate
my appreciation.

235
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,729
[cracking]

236
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,296
-I don't expect much
from that slob, Jirobo,

237
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,863
but what the heck
is keeping Kidomaru?

238
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,929
He shoulda caught up by now.

239
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:10,429
-You know how we always plays
about with his opponents.

240
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:13,329
He likes to keep things fun.

241
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,663
-Gives me the creeps
when he does that.

242
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:20,629
Too much fun and he goes off his
head and reaches Second State.

243
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:23,863
-[chuckling] Oh, indeed.

244
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,163
And when Kidomaru
reaches Second State,

245
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,829
watch out if you're
the other guy.

246
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,696
[labored breathing]

247
00:20:56,396 --> 00:21:06,729
--[growling] Striking Accuracy,
100% Destructive Power Maximum!

248
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,029
Die!

249
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,529
[whoosh]

250
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:05,018
NEJI: There's no
wasted effort with him!

251
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,618
He learns something
from every attack,

252
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,151
and then uses what
he learns against me!

253
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:13,185
Even my Byakugan is
no secret to him.

254
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:16,485
This is the strongest
opponent I've ever faced.

255
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:17,418
I've hit the wall.

256
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,718
His next attack
could be the last.

257
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:23,118
I haven't the strength to
elude it, but I will not run!

258
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,251
I will not hide!

259
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:30,751
NARUTO: Next time.
"Losing Is Not an Option!"

260
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,285
