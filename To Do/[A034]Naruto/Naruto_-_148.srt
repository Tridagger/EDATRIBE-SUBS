00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,377
[theme music]

2
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,277
-Hey, look.

3
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,244
It's Lady Tsunade.

4
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,444
-Oh, hey you three.

5
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,577
-You all visiting somebody
at the hospital, too?

6
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,577
-Yes.

7
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,477
-And you, Lady Tsunade?

8
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:16,977
-Mmm.

9
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,277
Oh, well--

10
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,211
-She just doesn't want
to stay in the office.

11
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:21,911
-Ah, zip it!

12
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,777
-Hmm?

13
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:23,911
-Hey, Hinata!

14
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,211
Try not to faint when
you see Kurenai-sensei.

15
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:29,177
-Come on, don't bring
that up right now!

16
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,177
-Something happen I
should know about?

17
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,711
-When Naruto was
in the hospital--

18
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,211
-Shino, don't!

19
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:37,011
-She took one look at Naruto
all wrapped up in bandages

20
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:37,711
and keeled over.

21
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:38,477
-Kiba!

22
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,977
This-- this is different!

23
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,744
I'll be fine this
time! [gasping]

24
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,544
-I finally found you!

25
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:47,377
Grandma Tsunade, there's
something I want to say to you!

26
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:53,844
Oh, hey.

27
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:54,811
Hinata.

28
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:55,911
-Naruto!

29
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,711
-Hinata, Hinata, what's
the matter with you?

30
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,111
HINATA: He's only inches away!

31
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,177
-Huh?

32
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:02,644
Your face is looking
a little red there.

33
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:03,511
You OK?

34
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:04,177
You got a fever?

35
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,511
Let me feel your head.

36
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:06,844
[smack]

37
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,244
[squeals]

38
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:09,711
[gong]

39
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:10,677
[yells]

40
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:14,777
-Augh!

41
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,877
Hey, Hinata!

42
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,944
You got to be kidding!

43
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,211
Are you OK?

44
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:22,144
Get a hold of yourself, will ya?

45
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:23,911
-Ahh, Naruto!

46
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,077
I don't know what to say.

47
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:31,511
NARUTO: "The Search for
the Rare Bikochu Beetle!"

48
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,244
-Mmph.

49
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,111
-Arf, arf!

50
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:35,611
-Ahh!

51
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:41,177
-Hey, you finally woke up!

52
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,911
-So you're saying Mizuki
didn't know anything?

53
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:47,144
-Lady Tsunade even
interrogated him herself.

54
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,811
He didn't have any
information that

55
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,877
would lead to Orochimaru's
current whereabouts.

56
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,911
-So after all that trouble,
he was nothing more than one

57
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,977
of Orochimaru's pawns.

58
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,877
-So it would seem, yes.

59
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,411
-And we still don't
know where Sasuke is.

60
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,911
-Not a lot to show for the
knock-down, drag-out fight

61
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,477
with Mizuki.

62
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,844
-That's got to be
killing Naruto right now.

63
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,144
NARUTO (OUTSIDE): Grandma
Tsunade, this isn't fair!

64
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,211
You gotta let me!

65
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:16,577
TSUNADE (OUTSIDE): When
I say no, I mean it!

66
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:17,911
-You're right.

67
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:21,477
And thanks to him, Tsunade
can't focus on any of her work.

68
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,377
Naruto's been breathing
down our neck,

69
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,211
asking for permission to
go off in search of Sasuke.

70
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:29,344
She couldn't take it anymore and
snuck out of her office, but--

71
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:33,711
-Yeah, he was lying
here in wait for her.

72
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,511
HINATA: Naruto.

73
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:36,577
-Come on, already!

74
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,211
How many times are
you gonna make me ask?

75
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,344
Let me go out there
and look for Sasuke!

76
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:41,644
-Look, enough is enough!

77
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,777
Quit Pestering me.

78
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:43,844
It's not going to happen!

79
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,011
-Gimme one good reason!

80
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,177
-Oh, I don't know.

81
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,711
Don't you have some
training to do?

82
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,477
--[growling] The Pervy
Sage is gone, OK?

83
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:54,444
--[growling] We have zero leads
on either Orochimaru or Sasuke,

84
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,511
all right?

85
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,911
How do you think you're
going to find him?

86
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:59,077
-Look, I'll figure it out, OK?

87
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,744
If we're out of leads, I'll
just have to go dig some up.

88
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,544
I'm begging you to let me go.

89
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:04,944
-You're as stubborn as a mule!

90
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:05,611
NARUTO: Yeah?

91
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:06,644
Look who's talkin'!

92
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,311
Now can I go or not?

93
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,444
TSUNADE: Forget it!

94
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,211
NARUTO: When I put my
mind to something--

95
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,644
TSUNADE: Ah, shut up!

96
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:13,677
A thousand times no!

97
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:14,177
[smacking]

98
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:14,677
-Huangh!

99
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,411
Byakugan!

100
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,777
[shing]

101
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,944
MALE SPEAKER:
Excellent work, Neji.

102
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,744
Give it another
half-step on that one.

103
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:40,044
NEJI: Right! [breathing heavily]

104
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:44,477
HINATA: Sorry to
keep you waiting!

105
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,444
-Hmm.

106
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:49,011
[heavy breathing]

107
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,177
-Why don't we take a
little break, Neji?

108
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:51,677
-OK.

109
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:59,702
-Have something
to drink as well.

110
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,369
-Thank you.

111
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,235
I will.

112
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,135
-It's a shame Hinata
wasn't able to stay.

113
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,502
It would have been good
for her to observe you.

114
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,435
-Then Hinata prepared this?

115
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,335
-It would be a help to the girl.

116
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,469
Watching you would likely
improve her own training.

117
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,235
[labored breathing]

118
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,169
[shing]

119
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,169
-Byakugan!

120
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,669
[kring]

121
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,669
[sighs]

122
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,635
-Let's take a break.

123
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,335
-K.

124
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,102
-Great, time to eat!

125
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:57,069
KIBA: That was pretty well done!

126
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:59,869
I'd say you're getting closer
to perfecting the technique.

127
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,635
HINATA: I owe it
all to you guys.

128
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,169
It's so kind of you to help
me train like this every day.

129
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,902
-SHINO: We're a team.

130
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:10,635
When your comrade is in a
fix, you offer a helping hand.

131
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,635
It's only natural.

132
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,502
-Comrade, huh?

133
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,335
[sighing] I imagine if
one of your comrades

134
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:24,269
is gone all of a sudden,
it must be awfully hard.

135
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,369
KIBA: Naruto, huh?

136
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:26,869
-Mmhmm.

137
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,035
Isn't there some
way we can help him?

138
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,069
-Yeah, I know.

139
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:36,069
I'd like to help him
out some way, too.

140
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:36,969
But--

141
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,469
[dog whining]

142
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,602
-You guys both heard what Lady
Tsunade told him yesterday.

143
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,169
Sasuke's trail's gone cold.

144
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,735
SHINO: Well, there is
one thing we can try.

145
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,235
-Yeah?

146
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,735
Like what?

147
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,335
The bikochu beetle.

148
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,569
-The bikochu beetle?

149
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,735
You're referring to the rare
breed of insect, correct?

150
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,669
From what I'm told,
they die off ages ago.

151
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:07,269
SHINO: When it became clear that
they were close to extinction

152
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,402
The Aburame Clan immediately
stopped using them

153
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,569
so that the remaining
few might survive.

154
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,269
-Lady Tsunade, what are
these beetles, exactly?

155
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,602
-To be honest, it's
no big surprise

156
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:20,535
that you haven't heard of them.

157
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,769
The bikochu haven't
been put into use

158
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,702
since before the last
of the great wars.

159
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,402
They're a species of beetle
used by insect handlers.

160
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,469
Once their larvae are
hatched, they quickly

161
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:37,135
move into the chrysalis phase
and emerge as full grown Imago.

162
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,935
They're then familiarized
with a specific scent

163
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,969
so that they can later track it.

164
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:44,302
No matter how faint
that scent has become,

165
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,669
their olfactory perception
is several times greater than

166
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,335
a ninja hound's.

167
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,902
Their usefulness in
espionage is hard to dismiss.

168
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:58,802
However, the bikochu only lay
eggs once every several years.

169
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,935
-It just so happens
that this is that year.

170
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,369
And this is the season
when they hatch.

171
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,702
-Well, whaddya know.

172
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,935
-And I'm betting Sasuke left
most of this stuff behind,

173
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,135
didn't he?

174
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,802
-If we expose one of these
beetles to his scent--

175
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,335
-Then it'll hopefully
lead us straight

176
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,769
to Sasuke's current location.

177
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:18,169
-Mmm.

178
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:21,569
-What's the probability
of finding one now?

179
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,335
-Frankly speaking,
not very high.

180
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,502
Maybe around 10%.

181
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,069
-A whopping 10%, huh?

182
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,535
[footsteps]

183
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:39,569
--[sighing] As you all know,
the situation in the village is

184
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,535
fairly grave at the moment.

185
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,169
I don't have the luxury of
letting my genin lounge around

186
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,802
and play.

187
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:50,002
However, fortunately or
unfortunately, Kurenai

188
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,335
has been hospitalized,
which leaves

189
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,569
Squad Eight without a mission.

190

[gasps]

191
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,702
-But what'll sitting
around get us?

192
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:01,669
I'd rather put my money
down on that 10% chance.

193
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,802
-Huh?

194
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,969
You mean--

195
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:09,702
-Shino Aburame, Kiba Inuzuka,
and Hinata Hyuga, your orders

196
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,769
are to go seek out to a bikochu.

197
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:13,102
EVERYONE: Got it!

198
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,535
-I'm designating
Shino as leader.

199
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,769
And as for you, you
lousy little sneak!

-Ow!

HINATA: Naruto!

204
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:30,002
-You'll go no matter
what I do, right?

205
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,235
-You got it!

206
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:33,102
--[sighing] I guess there's
no point trying to stand

207
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,969
in your way.

208
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,769
All right, this is your
last chance, you got me?

209
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:41,535
If you don't come back here
with that beetle in tow,

210
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,702
you're to give up on
Sasuke once and for all.

211
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:45,935
Are we clear?

212
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,335
-Not a problem!

213
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,369
I'll find you that
but without fail!

214
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:50,169
-Good!

215
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:51,869
I'm holding you to that, OK?

216
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:52,435
-Yah!

217
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:53,735
No sweat, lady!

218
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,569
I got this one in the bag!

219
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:56,602
-Cool it, hot shot.

-Hinata.

00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:32,133
HINATA: Good morning.

227
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,767
-Neji will be here
soon for his training.

228
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,767
Have the tea ready
as usual, please.

229
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,967
-Oh, well--

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,567
-Hmm?

231
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,567
What's the matter?

232
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,833
-Actually, I have a mission.

233
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,300
-A mission, huh?

234
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,567
Well, that's all
there is to it, then.

235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,900
-I'm heading out now.

236
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,167
-Try not to be a burden
to those around you

237
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
if you're able to help it.

238
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:55,633
-[gasping] I will.

-Um, sorry about that!

242
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:12,367
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

243
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,700
-Her response was so quick!

244
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:16,167
Hinata.

245
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,500
NARUTO: Hinata!

246
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,967
What too you so long?

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,700
HINATA: I'm sorry!

248
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:26,667
-All right, then.

249
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,767
I'd say it's time we got movin'.

250
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,633
Let's go!

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,833
-Heh?

253
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,200
What's wrong with you guys?

254
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,700
What're you dragging
your heels for?

255
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,800
SHINO: It'll take
a shinobi two days

256
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,300
to reach the beetles'
habitat by foot.

257
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,067
No need to rush right
out of the gate.

258
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,900
[galloping horses]

259
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,833
[screeching halt]

00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,033
-We don't have time to waste!

261
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,300
What happens if the eggs
hatch before we get there?

262
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,667
SHINO: The eggs of the
bikochu beetle only hatch

263
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,433
on a day after it's rained.

264
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,300
I don't see any clouds
in the sky, do you?

265
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,767
-Well, yeah, OK, but what
if this one time they--

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,433
SHINO: Naruto!

267
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,400
-What's the matter?

268
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,633
SHINO: I am the
leader of this team.

269
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:07,133
While we're on this mission,
you will follow my orders.

270
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:16,900
--[growling] Kiba, how the heck
you put up with this weirdo is

271
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,600
beyond me.

272
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,833
-Yeah, you get used to it.

273
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,667
-I'm sure that things will
great once you get to know him.

274
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,767
-[chuckling] That'll be the day.

275
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:34,133
SAKURA: Hup!

276
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,467
TSUNADE: Naruto and others
set out a little while ago.

277
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,933
SAKURA: I see.

278
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:43,067
TSUNADE: You didn't
want to go with them?

279
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,367
SAKURA (TO HERSELF): With
them searching for insects,

280
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,500
the couldn't do
better than Shino.

281
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:50,600
Hinata's got her Byakugan
and Kiba and Akamaru

282
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,100
have their noses.

283
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,067
I'm not really sure
what I could add.

284
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,867
All I need to focus on now
is become a medical ninja

285
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,667
as fast as I possibly can!

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,433
-Shino, what's the matter?

287
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,467
SHINO: Sun's going down.

288
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,200
We'll camp here.

289
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:14,733
-K.

290
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,267
-K.

291
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,333
-You got it.

292
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:16,900
-Huh?

293
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:17,833
What?

294
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,700
Why are we setting
up camp already?

295
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,733
This is crazy!

296
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm not even close
to being tired yet.

297
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:23,300
Come on!

298
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,167
Let's cover more ground!

299
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,033
SHINO: Naruto!

300
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,167
I am the leader of this team.

301
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,667
-Eek.

302
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,233
Right!

303
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,433
You're the boss.

304
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,433
I hear ya.

305
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,133
SHINO: OK, let's turn in.

306
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:36,933
-Huh?

307
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,067
We're going to bed already?

308
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,433
SHINO: Many animals
and plants rise

309
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:44,033
with the sun and
slumber when it sets.

310
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,933
If we're searching
for insects, we

311
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,767
must understand the
rhythm of living creatures

312
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,033
with our own bodies.

313
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,967
NARUTO: Yeah, but the sun
just set a few minutes ago!

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,067
SHINO: Naruto!

315
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,033
I am leading this team!

316
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,167
NARUTO: OK!

317
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,167
I get it, already.

318
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,067
Blargh.

319
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,467
This is stupid!

320
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,133
There's no way I can fall asleep
so early. [yawning] [snoring]

Shoots his mouth off
about not being tired

323
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,600
and he's the first one out!

324
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,100
Typical.

330
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,257
Huh.

331
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,257
What's that?

Huh?

00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,690

-[inaudible] Sorry about that.

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,890
I didn't scare you, did I?

343
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,590
Huh?

344
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,124
What the-- Where'd they go?

345
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,390
NARUTO: Achoo!

346
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,624
Ugh.

347
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:02,390
-What's wrong, Naruto?

348
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,424
Did you catch a cold?

349
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,157
-Yeah, I guess so.

351
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:10,357
SHINO: Still tired
after all that sleep?

352
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,724
NARUTO: Well, the
thing, is I went out

353
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:15,090
to take a whiz last night
and saw something amazing.

354
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,324
HINATA: Achoo!

355
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,124
-You catching a cold, too?

-Oh, no.

357
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,990
I'm OK.

358
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,824
-So, uh, what was so amazing?

359
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,257
-A waterfall!

With a beautiful woman
standing in the middle of it!

00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,590
-Get out!

362
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,757
-And every time
she moved her arms,

363
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,124
the water moved along with them.

364
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,690
I tell ya, it was awesome.

365
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:33,957
-What'd you do?

366
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,590
-Well, I tried to speak to
her, but she disappeared!

367
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,790
-I don't know, Naruto.

368
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,824
You sure you weren't
dreaming or something?

369
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,524
-Aaugh.

370
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,257
I'm not sure what it was.

371
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,657
KIBA: Yeah, I knew it.

372
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,290
NARUTO: Hey, Hinata.

373
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,824
Your face is all red.

374
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:51,457
You must be coming
down with something.

375
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,157
HINATA: Uh, I'm fine, really.

376
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,524
SHINO: These are edible.

377
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,524
This will be our meal for today.

378
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,657
-OK, sounds good.

379
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,490
-This'll help our food
supply last longer.

380
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:09,824
[barks]

381
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:12,324
SHINO: A word of caution--
on rare occasions, this fruit

382
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,824
can grow to the size
of a human being.

383
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,657
Those ones aren't safe to eat.

384
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,090
Avoid them at all costs.

385
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:20,290
KIBA: Come on,
nobody'd be dumb enough

386
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:21,357
to eat something that big.

387
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,224
NARUTO: Om nom nom.

388
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:23,490
HINATA: Naruto!

389
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:25,024
NARUTO: Huh?

390
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,724
KIBA: He's eating it.

391
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,024
NARUTO: Hmm?

392
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:31,324
[stomach rumbling] Aaugh!

393
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,990
Ugh!

394
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,724
KIBA: Naruto!

395
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,390
We're going on ahead.

396
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:40,057
NARUTO: [moaning] I'm--
I'm right behind ya.

397
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,124
Sorry to keep you waiting.
[stomach rumbling]

[gasps]

399
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,824
NARUTO: Oh, uh, just a second.

400
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:48,990
I'll be right there.

401
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,690
[crickets chirping]

402
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:00,590
[labored breathing]

403
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,424
[footsteps]

404
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:15,357
NARUTO: Hey, how we doin'?

405
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,557
We almost there yet?

406
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,624
SHINO: Yes.

407
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,990
This is it.

408
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,590
-Hmm?

409
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:27,157
Wha!

410
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,757
Oh, wow!

411
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,290
I've never seen anything
like this before.

412
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:37,657
KIBA: Doesn't look very
hospitable for people

413
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,357
around here.

414
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,657
SHINO: You're right.

415
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,290
That's why it's a
paradise for insects.

416
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:43,224
[gong]

417
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,324
-No way.

418
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:45,324
You don't mean--

419
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,857
HINATA: So you
think, down there--

420
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,557
KIBA: That's where
our creepy crawler is?

421
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,624
SHINO: Yep.

422
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,890
This will be easier
than the chunin exam.

423
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:57,224
[gasping]

424
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,157
-Ack!

425
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,590
Aw man.

426
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,124
This cliff's falling apart.

427
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:02,090
Can't get a grip!

428
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:02,757
SHINO: Naruto!

429
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,624
-Eh?

430
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:04,690
Huh?

431
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,424
SHINO: As your leader,
I'm warning you--

432
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,490
-At a time like
this, what is it?

433
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:10,557
SHINO: Don't fall.

434
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,224
-Thanks for the words
of wisdom, genius!

435
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:14,390
I don't need you
to tell me that!

436
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:15,124
Eh?

437
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:16,357
-Naruto!

438
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,924
[insects rushing]

439
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:18,890
-Nngh!

440
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:22,324
Aw, man!

441
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,290
[thunk]

442
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:28,857
-[gasping] That was close.

443
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,557
Huh?

444
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,724
Oh, those were insects.

445
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,824
SHINO: I warned you, didn't I?

446
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,624
[ding ding]

447
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:34,957
-Dahh!

448
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,190
When this is all over, I'm
going to kick that guy's butt

449
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:38,090
all over the village!

450
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,257
SHINO: This is it.

451
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,090
The forest of the bikochu.

452
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:53,724
Let's go.

453
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,557
EVERYONE: Mmm.

454
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,024
[footsteps]

455
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,557
MALE SPEAKER:
There's no mistake.

456
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,957
Those are Leaf shinobi.

457
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,024
MALE SPEAKER: They're not
passing through, though.

458
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,557
There's only one reason
why they would come here.

459
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,324
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, the
same reason we are here.

460
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,457
The bikochu.

461
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,524
MALE SPEAKER: They're
not taking a single one.

462
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,290
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because
all of the bikochu

463
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:23,724
belong to the Kamizuru Clan.

464
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,215
[theme music]

465
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,482
NARUTO: What!

466
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,348
You mean it's the
one in this photo?

467
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:06,915
I know that bug!

468
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:07,482
-Really?

469
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:08,848
NARUTO: Aw, man.

470
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:10,548
Don't tell me it was a bikochu!

471
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,715
KIBA: Wait, are you serious?

472
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:13,915
Where did you see it?

473
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:15,482
NARUTO: I heard it scuttling
in the kitchen one night

474
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:16,848
and wailed a slipper at it.

475
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:18,415
SHINO: Wait a second.

476
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,415
HINATA: Naruto--

477
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:20,848
SHINO: I think you're
actually talking

478
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,015
about the common cockroach.

479
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,482
NARUTO: Next time,
"What's the Difference?

Don't All Insects Look Alike?"
