What kind of mission is that?

00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:56,756
-As I'm sure you know
by now, our village

5
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,663
was infiltrated by an enemy
ninja while you and the others

6

were away.

Kiba and his team found the guy

cool mission like that,

revealed he was

village that specializes

23

in a unique-- and
uniquely unpleasant--

00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,954
-Did you really do what
they're saying you did?

186
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,460
You had Akamaru detained?

187
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:48,367
-He's the one who attacked
the shinobi last night,

188
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,305
all the evidence points to it.

189
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:51,341
There was no choice.

190
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,613
It had to be done.

191
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,016
The medical corps
is doing everything

192
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,955
they can to find an antidote.

193
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,694
Don't despair-- yet.

194
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:00,830
-Yet?

195
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,467
And what if they're not
able to find one, huh?

196
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,709
What's going to happen
to Akamaru then?

197
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:09,551
-In that case, Akamaru
will have to be put down.

198
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,150
-Don't worry.

199
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,054
I'm sure the medical corps
will find an answer soon.

200
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,057
He'll be fine.

201
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,059
-Yeah, right.

202
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,431
-Try looking in on
him again later.

203
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:24,434
-OK, thanks.

204
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,116
Quiet, boy.

205
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,589
Nobody's going to
take you away from me.

206
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:41,675
-We just got word that Kiba took
Akamaru out of the hospital.

207
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,613
Lady Tsunade, what
do you want us to do?

208
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,518
-We have to prepare
for the worst.

209
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,625
Have the Special Pursuit Corps
report to me immediately.

210
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,964
-The Special Pursuit Corps?

211
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,669
Hey, don't tell
me you're thinking

212
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:56,611
about doing something drastic.

213
00:11:56,644 --> 00:12:00,754
Don't just sit there, answer me!

214
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,358
-This is hard for me, too.

215
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:09,308
-I'm out of here.

216
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,680
[door slams]

217
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,685
-Hey, any sign of them?

218
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,690
-No.

219
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,662
-Kiba!

220
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,230
Kiba!

221
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,356
-Whatever this thing
is, it's getting worse.

222
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,500
Akamaru?

223
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,502
-Where are they?

224
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,307
-They have to be
somewhere nearby.

225
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:49,438
-I promised I'd protect
you, no matter what.

226
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,376
I promised that you'd
never have to go

227
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,181
through anything
like that ever again.

228
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,105
SHIZUNE: M'lady, the leader
of the Special Pursuit

229
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,276
Corps is here.

230
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,168
-Enter.

231
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,097
-OK.

232
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,167
Come on, come on, Kiba.

233
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,869
Where are you hiding?

234
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,747
-There.

235
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,718
Follow that, I dare you.

236
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:42,132
[Akamaru growls]

237
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,571
-This vial contains
a serum for Akamaru

238
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,609
that the Medical
Corps came up with,

239
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,914
but it's far from
being a sure thing.

240
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:52,556
In fact, there's a 50%
chance it'll prove fatal.

241
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,361
There's also a risk
that the side effects

242
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:58,838
could make Akamaru's condition
even worse than it is now.

243
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,676
And if that should happen, well.

244
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,845
You know what you have to do.

245
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,529
-Lady Tsunade, we
just received word

246
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:09,797
from the first team of trackers.

247
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,672
They report that they've lost
Kiba and Akamaru's trail.

248
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:13,273
-M'lady?

249
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:29,913
[howling]

250
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,851
-What was that?

251
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,522
-Akamaru?

252
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,860
-Kiba, hey!

253
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,431
You OK?

254
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:40,338
Gah!

255
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,611
[Akamaru growls]

256
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:44,548
-Whoa, what is that?

257
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,985
What is it?

258
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,556
-It's Akamaru.

259
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,894
Now go.

260
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:53,370
You think I'm going to let
you take him from me, huh?

261
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,940
-What the heck do you
think you're doing?

262
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:55,675
I

263
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,677
-Know why you're here.

264
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,546
But you're not
going to touch him!

265
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,649
-You're wrong.

266
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,754
I just came because I
was worried about you.

267
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:01,823
-You lie!

268
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,496
The Hokage's given you
orders, hasn't she?

269
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,434
-Akamaru will have
to be put down.

270
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,582
-Never going to happen.

271
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,389
I won't let you do
it, you understand?

272
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,795
No one takes Akamaru away!

273
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,800
-Kiba, you're wasting
time fighting with me!

274
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,041
There's some kind of Special
Pursuit Corps on your trail.

275
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,878
That's what you ought
to be worried about.

276
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:25,480
-What?

277
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,931
-Whoever these special
pursuit hotshots are,

278
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,802
they're going to
be here any second.

279
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:37,409
And I've got a feeling Akamaru's
going to be in real trouble

280
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,611
when that happens.

281
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:41,051
So you and I have go to
think of something fast.

282
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,423
Come on, this is no time
for you to be fighting

283
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,693
with the only friend you've got!

284
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:57,390
[Akamaru roars]

285
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:57,992
-Stop it, Kiba.

286
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,595
Don't be an idiot!

287
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,600
-Just shut up!

288
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,335
-There.

289
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:05,744
Akamaru's just up ahead.

FEMALE VOICE: Kiba, Naruto.

292
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,999
Just stay out the way.

293
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:15,901
-No.

294
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,605
That's the Special
Pursuit Corps?

295
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,486
-Sis?

296
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,923
No.

297
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:25,992
No way.

298
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,997
Hana, come on.

299
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,436
Is this is a joke?

300
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:31,739
What's that thing?

301
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,878
Are you going to
use that on Akamaru?

302
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:37,787
-This is a serum that the
Hokage thinks could work.

303
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,926
And yes, I'm going
to use it on him.

304
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,028
-Really?

305
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:42,799
Do you think that stuff
is going to cure him?

306
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,534
-Perhaps.

307
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:44,503
Perhaps not.

308
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,682
There's a very
strong possibility

309
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:52,389
the side effects will
only make him worse.

310
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:56,832
But it's the only chance
we've got, all right?

311
00:16:56,867 --> 00:17:00,442
But if it doesn't cure
him, we'll have no choice.

312
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:01,879
Understand?

313
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,549
-No, I can't.

314
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:04,651
-Snap out of it.

315
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:05,721
What's wrong with you?

316
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,124
At least we've got a
chance to save him.

317
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,965
That's a lot more
than we had before.

318
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,067
OK, I'm ready to help.

help, do me a favor.

-Forget him, Naruto.

-We'll save you, Akamaru.

-Do not let him move.

331

to pin him down.

-Right.

We've always been
together, haven't we?

We grew up together.

Can you?

I know that I've brought you
nothing but pain and suffering.

a better master.

HANA: I don't know if
he would have made it

366
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,334
if the Medical Corps
hadn't arrived so quickly.

367
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,406
TSUNADE: He was fortunate
that Akamaru's attack

368
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,478
missed any vital organs.

369
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,853
By all rights, Kiba
should have been-- well.

370
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,891
It's remarkable, really.

371
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,865
He's a very lucky guy.

372
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:52,868
-You're wrong.

373
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,406
-Hey, you're awake.

374
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,915
-It was more than luck that
saved me from that attack.

375
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,485
It was him.

376
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,922
Akamaru missed on purpose.

377
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,534
It was him.

378
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,474
He used the last of his strength
to shift the attack just

379
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:10,977
enough.

380
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,918
He fought the monster within
him as hard as he could.

381
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,156
And he won.

382
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,861
-Pretty brave, Akamaru.

383
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,471
-He sure is.

384
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:23,441
Thanks, boy.

385
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:35,837
[theme music]

386
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:06,221
-There are many dark legends
in the world, tales of demons

387
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:09,496
and mysterious monsters
passed down from generation

388
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:12,636
to generation, the
stuff of nightmares.

389
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:15,643
What happens when these monsters
become real and step out

390
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:18,183
of the legends and
into our village?

391
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:20,121
How well will the
Leaf Ninja do when

392
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:24,599
they have to face these demons
and confront their own fears?

393
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:29,354
-Next time, A Legend from
Hidden Leaf: The Onbaa!
