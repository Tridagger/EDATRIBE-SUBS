00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,792
Uh, excuse me?

00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,759
-Return of the morning mist.

[music playing]

00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:48,359
[crying]

11
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,092
-Father and mother
shouldn't have died.

12
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,192
It didn't have to happen.

13
00:02:56,225 --> 00:03:00,125
If only I'd been strong
enough, all of them

14
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,959
would still be alive.

15
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:06,225
My clan is destroyed.

16
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,192
[crying]

17
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,025
Damn it all.

[heavy breathing]

19
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:24,559
-That's enough for now.

20
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,492
Once I got a little
breakfast, I'm

21
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,225
going to get right
back to the grindstone.

22
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,225
Huh?

23
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,725
[music playing]

24
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,125
-Old man.

25
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,625
-Konohamaru.

26
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,459
What's up Konohamaru?

27
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,925
-Uh, not much, Naruto.

28
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,225
-I guess classes have started up
again over at the Academy, huh?

29
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,459
-Nah, not yet.

30
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,625
A bunch of the school
buildings got pretty messed up,

31
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,659
so all of the students are
helping to repair them.

32
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:17,359
-Ah, I've got you.

33
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,125
-What about you, Naruto?

34
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,092
You're still training, right?

35
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,625
-Yeah, sort of.

36
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:23,592
[music playing]

37
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:29,659
-What's up with you?

38
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:30,325
-Nothing.

39
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,325
What's up with you?

40
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,825
-Nothing.

41
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:35,525
[in unison]

42
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,659
-So, um, huh?

43
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:38,992
-Hey, come on already.

44
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,825
What's the matter?

45
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,859
-Nothing's the matter.

46
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,225
What's wrong with you?

47
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,525
-Uh, never mind.

48
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,292
-I don't feel lonely or nothing.

49
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,159
-Huh?

50
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:52,992
-Lonely.

51
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,859
There's time for
stuff like that.

52
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,792
Everybody is working really
hard to rebuild the village.

53
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,859
-Konohamaru.

54
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:07,759
-Right now, I just want to do
whatever I can to help out.

55
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,259
So you'll have to
do enough training

56
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,492
for both of us, OK Naruto?

57
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:15,159
'Cause if you slack off, I'll
make it to Hokage before you.

58
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,025
-Ha!

59
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,259
You puny runt!

60
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,459
The next Hokage is standing
right in front of you.

61
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,759
Besides.

62
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,159
You've still got to make it
through the Academy first,

63
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,625
don't you?

64
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,192
Oh, that's right.

65
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:26,959
-Huh?

66
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,625
-Ah, there it is.

67
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,192
Here.

68
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:31,092
This is for you.

69
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,492
-A free meal at Ichiraku?

70
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,859
I can really have it?

71
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,325
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

72
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,525
I've got another one, anyway.

73
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,625
That little coupon is all yours.

74
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,259
-Oh wow.

75
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,859
Thank you, Naruto!

76
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:43,259
-Oh, hello there Konohamaru!

77
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,725
-Hey, good morning, guys!

78
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,659
-OK, I'm taking off.

79
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,525
Come on, lets' get to work!

80
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,025
-Mhm.

81
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,425
-Today we'll get to
work on the blackboards.

82
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,392
-I brought along some paint.

83
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,359
-Right!

84
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,492
Once I've had my
ramen from Ichiraku

85
00:05:56,525 --> 00:06:00,125
I'll be ready for another
round of training.

86
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,092
[eagle cawing]

87
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:14,159
-Look at this.

88
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,759
[gasping]

89
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,325
-No!

90
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:19,825
Lord Kazekage.

91
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,425
They've been dead for awhile.

92
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,259
My guess?

93
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,225
Since before the Chunin Exams.

94
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,392
-I see now.

95
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:34,192
So that's what his game was.

96
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:36,225
Curse you, Orochimaru.

97
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:45,392
After the Kazekage was killed,
Orochimaru, or Kabuto, maybe,

98
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:48,392
assumed his identity.

99
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,292
We were careless.

100
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,759
[music playing]

101
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,992
-Sarutobi.

102
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,659
-You didn't think it
would be easy, did you?

103
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:06,225
Look who you were playing with,
one of the most renowned ninja

104
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,492
in all the five great
Shinobi nations.

105
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,392
You did very well, though.

106
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,625
Two of the five are
now out of the way.

107
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,625
-Shut your mouth.

108
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,425
I won't be patronized,
do you understand me?

109
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,559
I'll kill you.

110
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,192
-Forgive me.

111
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:31,259
I didn't wish to--
I'll grant you,

112
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,559
we didn't bring
down the village.

113
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:39,625
But let us not forget our
other objective, Sasuke.

114
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,192
You've done it.

115
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:45,225
Your leash is around his neck.

116
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,525
-And all that it
cost me were my arms,

117
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,459
and the entirety of my jutsu.

118
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,625
If I'd only gotten
hold of Itachi Uchiha

119
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,559
from the beginning, we
wouldn't be in this mess.

120
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,925
But it's too late now.

121
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,892
That dream has died.

122
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,892
Itachi is stronger than I am.

123
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,925
That is why I pulled myself
out of that organization.

124
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,859
-Kakashi.

125
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:36,025
The heck does he want?

126
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,059
-Breakfast, breakfast, oh boy!

127
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,359
Ready or not,
ramen, here I come!

128
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,159
[bell ringing]

129
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,925
-You know where he is?

130
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,592
-Yeah.

131
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,525
-Should be easy, then.

132
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,725
-Let's go.

133
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,659
-Oh, yes, that's it, that's it.

134
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,059
Oh baby, I'm telling you.

135
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,392
You've got to love
the Leaf Village.

136
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:10,659
The girls here are
off the charts.

137
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:15,092
-You're still playing
the buffoon, I see.

138
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,492
-Just doing a little research.

139
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:21,892
So, old man Homura,
and Koharu sensei.

140
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:25,759
What could you two scholarly
advisors want with me?

141
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,792
-Don't waste our time.

142
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:30,125
You know perfectly well
what this is all about.

143
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,225
-Come on, why the
long faces, guys?

144
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,292
From what I hear, talks
with the Sand Village

145
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,992
went off without a hitch.

146
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,159
-The Sand Village
has stated publicly

147
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,859
that Orochimaru was
responsible for all of this.

148
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,759
At any rate, they've offered
their complete surrender

149
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,192
to the Leaf Village.

150
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,692
So at the moment, their
betrayal is a moot point.

151
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,925
-For now we have no choice
but to accept their surrender

152
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,025
in order to shore up
our power in the region.

153
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,792
-That's correct.

154
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,792
However, the strength
of the Leaf Village

155
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,492
has just suffered
an enormous blow.

156
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,592
As things now stand,
our top priority

157
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,192
is preparing for the onslaught
we believe will come.

158
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:22,125
-We have no way of knowing when
one of the surrounding nations

159
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,025
might try to make a play.

160
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,259
Therefore, until the village
has regained its strength,

161
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,692
we've decided to gather the
top Shinobi from each squad.

162
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,459
And assemble an emergency
executive committee

163
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:37,159
to handle the situation.

164
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:37,659
But first.

165
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:45,192
We need a strong and
trustworthy leader.

166
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,759
It is more than just Orochimaru.

167
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,859
It is the seed of a
far greater struggle.

168
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,192
-Look, guys.

169
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,759
I don't know why you're going
to the trouble of explaining

170
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,792
all this to me.

171
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,292
But if you'll excuse me,
I've got to get back to work.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,092
-I think you'll be interested
in what our plans are.

173
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,292
This village needs the
Fifth Hokage immediately.

174
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,525
-And yesterday, at
an emergency meeting

175
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,825
with the Lord of the Land
of Fire, it was decided.

176
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:14,859
We chose you, Jiraiya.

177
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,459
-Oh, I don't know.

178
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,425
It's not really up my alley.

179
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,325
-It has been decided.

180
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,492
Besides, if one of the renowned
Sannin is not suited, then

181
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,425
who else is?

182
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,859
-If you're so set on a
Sannin, there is another.

183
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,859
You're forgetting Tsunade.

184
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:41,725
-There's little doubt that
the child has the capability.

185
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,992
But it hardly matters.

186
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,925
No one even knows where she is.

187
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,525
-I'm sure I can dig her up.

188
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,559
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

189
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,159
-But--

190
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,125
-Tsunade's got
the brains for it.

191
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,792
More than a loafer like me does.

192
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,559
What do you say?

193
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,592
-Very well, then.

194
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,025
We'll give it some thought.

195
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,325
But we'll send along three
members of the ANBU Black Ops

196
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,225
to accompany you on your search.

197
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,359
-You don't have to worry.

198
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,025
I'm not going to
make a run for it.

199
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,359
Besides, your men will
just get in the way.

200
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:21,725
Although, there is
one guy I wouldn't

201
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,492
mind having along for the ride.

202
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:27,159
I've stumbled across a very
interesting little egg.

203
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,613
-What?

204
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,180
This is so weird.

205
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,113
Sorry, kid.

206
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:38,380
No ticket, no ramen.

207
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,880
Those are the rules.

208
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:40,513
-No, no, no, no.

209
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:41,213
Wait a minute.

210
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,146
I just had one, I swear.

211
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,713
Where'd it go?

212
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:49,180
Man, don't tell me I gave
Konohamaru my last one.

-Ah.

216
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,746
I want ramen!

217
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:06,480
-Hey guys.

218
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,580
You two seem to
be getting along.

219
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:09,080
-Ah.

220
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,413
Idiot.

221
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:12,880
Anko just asked me to pick up
some rice dumplings for her.

222
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:15,046
-What are you doing here,
aside from catching up

223
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,646

224
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,580
-I need to buy something
to put on a grave.

225
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,380
Plus I'm meeting somebody here.

226
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm just waiting on Sasuke.

227
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,480
-Heh.

228
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,813
It's not like you to
be waiting on somebody.

229
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:30,646
Is it for Obito?

230
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,080

231
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:31,478

It's not like you
to show up early.

236
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,613

00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:49,846

I don't have much
of a sweet tooth.

241

-Hm.

00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:01,746
Is that so?

This is totally bizarre.

What are you doing
in this village?

249
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,746
-It's been a long
time, Asuma, Kurenai.

250
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,613
-The fact that
you know our names

251
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:45,713
must mean that you're a Shinobi,
formerly of the this village.

Well, what do you know?

255
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,113
Itachi.

Well then.

260
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,713
I suppose I should
introduce myself.

261

Hope we can get
acquainted later.

262
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:34,013
The name's Kisame Hoshigake.

-Why should we wait til later?

264
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,813
When I can just wipe the
floor with you both now.

265
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,246
-Wow Itachi.

266
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,513
It looks like they hate
you as much in this village

267
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,146
as they do in mine.

268
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,213
-We know who you are, Kisame.

269
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,646
We've heard all about you.

270
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,946
You hail from the
Village of the Mist.

271
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,313
Suspected of espionage and
the murder of a feudal lord,

272
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,280
you're a rogue ninja
from the Land of Water,

273
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,813
wanted in every nation.

in the Bingo book.

276
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:12,713
Itachi, I gotta hand it to
you, the fact that you'd even

277
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,280
show your face in this
village, after what you did,

278
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:17,380
it takes some guts.

279
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,780
-I'm warning you two.

280
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,180
You don't want to
interfere with me.

281
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:25,080
It isn't my desire to kill you.

282
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,213
-You know, that's
pretty hilarious,

283
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:31,246
coming from a guy who
murdered his own people.

284
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,480
Now come on, out with it.

285
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,746
I know you didn't come
skulking in here, dressed

286
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,880
like that for no good reason.

Can I kill him?

291
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:53,013
-Well I guess we're not going
anywhere without a fight.

292
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,513
Just try not to overdo it.

293
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,280

we'll be letting
