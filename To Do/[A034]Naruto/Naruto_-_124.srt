-Sasuke!

00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,934
Come on!

6
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:19,501
Why do you keep
running away from me?

7
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:20,134
NARUTO: Sasuke!

Wha.

12
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,501
What is wrong with you?

13
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,334
You know how impolite
it is to stare?

00:02:50,367 --> 00:03:00,034

He's faster than before.

-Hiya!

KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
That medicine he took.

18
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,934
Could there have been some
special ingredient in it?

19
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,101
-Not too shabby.

20
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,467
Boy.

21
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,967
All this jumping around is
totally messing with my head

22
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,967
here.

23
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,601
I'm OK though.

00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:32,601

KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
What just happened?

27
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,601
Did he really fall asleep?

28
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:56,267

00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:56,834

00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,101
You fell for it.

32
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,401
-It looked like I was
sleeping, but in reality I

33
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,167
was wide awake.

00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,667
Guy-sensei, I did it.

All your training
has not been in vain!

37
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:24,067
Guy-sensei, I did it.

38
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:26,234
I-- ugh.

39
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:30,701
[snoring]

40
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:44,334
-Looks like you fell
for it again, sucker.

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,201
If you honestly think I
would fall asleep spread

you are certainly mistaken!

43
00:04:55,467 --> 00:05:00,701
I-- hey wait.

44
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,601
Hold on a second.

45
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:04,601
Where am I?

46
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:07,334
What am I doing here?

47
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,334
What the?

48
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,934
What's going on?

49
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:16,734
What is this?

50
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,001
-Huh.

00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:32,267
-Sake?

00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:35,167
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Is he just drunk?

54
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,034
Well, if you are,
I don't think it

55
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,734
will hurt too much when I
send you into the afterlife.

00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,034
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

58
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,867
I don't have enough chakra.

59
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:17,834
At this rate--

60
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,134
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I can't stay
in the water with this wound,

61
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,601
or I'm really gonna
be in trouble.

62

KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Why can't I hit him?

66
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,101
-Can't you see I'm
trying to take a nap.

67
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,734

00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,967
-Hey.

70
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,134
Bring it on already.

71
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:09,634
Hey.

72
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,467
Come on.

73
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,967
What's the hold up, tough guy?

74
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:16,867
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): These
movements-- what are they?

75
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,634
GUY: I'm sure there's no
need to tell you this,

76
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,034
but that Kenpo brand is no joke.

77
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,734
The more of it you throw
back, the stronger it gets!

78
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,201
-Yes, I know.

79
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:31,501
One time in this
restaurant, Lee thought

80
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,667
he was reaching for some
water and he ended up

81
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,267
downing a small
cup of Dragon Fire.

82
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,767
LEE: Hey!

83
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,101
What's the idea?

84
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:39,734
GUY: Easy, Lee.

85
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,167
LEE: I said hey!

86
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,167
[laughing]

87
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:42,667
GUY: Whoa.

88
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:43,667
Whoa.

89
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,634
Lee.

90
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,601
Lee, please sit down.

91
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:47,601
LEE: Woo-cha!

92
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,067
NEJI: Look at your behavior!

93
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:49,634
GUY: Quick!

94
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,567
Get his legs.

95
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:54,001
Thank goodness I
had Neji with me..

96
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,767
It took the two of us combined
to finally restrain him.

97
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,101
-You mean you couldn't
overpower him on your own?

98
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,067
-Well, if he had
actually been my enemy,

99
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,201
I could've taken
him down no problem.

100
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,567
But Lee's special to me.

101
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:12,234
I could never hurt
a hair on his head.

102
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,001
-Of course.

103
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,501
-That's how bad it got
after he had one sip.

104
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:22,001
If he were to treat an
entire bottle of that sake--

105
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,634
-He might be
virtually invincible.

106
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,434
But he's just out
of the hospital.

107
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,101
How long will his body hold out?

108
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:41,267
-Hey, come on.

109
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,967
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): He's
using the Drunken Fist.

110
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,867
I've never seen it before.

111
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,301
-If you will not
make the first move,

112
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,567
then I will just have to
bring the fight to you!

113
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,434
[shout]

114
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:58,434
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): His style
of attack is fairly direct.

115
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,434
-Agh!

116
00:09:59,467 --> 00:09:59,934
Ugh.

117
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,067
Ow.

118
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,134
What'd you do that for?

119
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:27,101
I am enjoying the
springtime of my youth!

120
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,901
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): His
moves are so unorthodox.

121
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,634
But more than
anything he's fast!

122
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:41,101
-I am in the prime of my youth
and making the most of it.

123
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,567
-Camellia Dance!

124
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:57,967
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): There.

125
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:10,901
-Yaa!

126
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,334
[hiccup]

127
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:22,834
-Gwah-yah!

128
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,267
[groaning]

129
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:45,083
[mumbling]

130
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,818
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): I
can't read his movements.

131
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,418
For him to land an attack on me?

132
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:51,584
That's quite the taijutsu.

133
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:55,818
No other choice.

134
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:11,584
-My true abilities
lie within my bones.

135
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,351
I'm sure the little
clone brat must

136
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,218
have told you before he left.

137
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,118
-Huh?

138
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,118
-I think it's time
we sobered you up.

139
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,451
-Sober who up?

140
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:25,318
Do I look drunk to you?

141
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:30,251
-Well, whatever you are,
I'll snap you out it.

142
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,218
-I said I'm not drunk.

143
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,751
In the first place,
I'm not even of age.

144
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,718
Underage ninjas should not
partake in drinking sake!

145
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:43,184
-Gah!

146
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,251
-Unorthodox is it not?

147
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,618
This is my kekkei genkai.

148
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,318
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Calm down, Shikamaru.

149
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,284
Figure out a strategy.

150
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,851
There's got to be
some way out of this.

151
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,518
[chuckling] He wasn't
able to scamper off

152
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,484
too far with that wound of his.

153
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,184
KIBA (VOICEOVER): That' it.

154
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:01,718
I can't go any further.

155
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,751
Are you kidding me?

156
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,618
He's already caught up?

157
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,318
[sniff]

158
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,218
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Wait.

159
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,984
-My head is pounding
like a drum.

160
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,951
And why is my face bleeding?

161
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:47,184
It seems I really was
drunk after all then.

162
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:50,184
Uh-- what has happened to you?

163
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:53,684
-So, your medicine
has finally worn off.

164
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,251
You're looking at
my kekkei genkai.

165
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,051
LEE: Kekkei genkai.

166
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:05,351
-My kekkei genkai freely
controls my osteoblasts

167
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,318
and osteoclasts.

168
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,951
It allows me to alter the
concentration of calcium

169
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,651
and form new bones altogether.

170
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:18,684
Normally, the human
body contains 206 bones.

171
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,884
But in my case, that number
is somewhat more negotiable.

172
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:32,951
-But bone is bone after all.

173
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,384
Once broken, there
is no mending it!

174
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:43,918
LEE (VOICEOVER): Such density.

175
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:46,818
Are those really human bones?

176
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,318
Hyah!

177
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:53,584
Very well.

178
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,518
-Behold, my Larch Dance.

179
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:02,418
-Gyah!

180
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:21,684
[groaning]

181
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,784
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
I've had it.

182
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:28,218
-Just a little bit further,
you piece of garbage.

183
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,784
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): This is
just like that time with Asuma.

184
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,884
-Asuma.

185
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,918
-The chances of
someone stepping into

186
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:55,018
help me here are
probably close to zero.

187
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,584
Stop wasting brainpower on
something that'll never happen.

188
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,684
Just calm down.

189
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:53,884
[sniffing]

190
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,851
KIBA (VOICEOVER): His
scent-- he's moving away.

191
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:00,918
-That was close.

192
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:01,584
SAKON: What was?

193
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:07,984
-But how did you?

194
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:10,084
-I knew that it would work.

195
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:12,418
[chuckling]

196
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,284
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): My jacket.

197
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,584
-You're so used
to your own smell

198
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:19,818
you didn't even
notice it on the wind.

199
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:22,251
-So you were skulking
around in my jacket

200
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,351
to cover up your scent.

201
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,784
You seem to know a
lot about tracking.

202
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,884
No wonder I couldn't smell you.

203
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,684
Guess I shouldn't
be surprised, right?

204
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,084
Seriously.

205
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,451
How in the world am I supposed
to keep track of somebody who

206
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,184
can split in half?

207
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,651
Well, come on then.

208
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:54,084
-Please, wait.

209
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:55,951
From now on.

210
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,051
We play for keeps.

211
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,984
LEE (VOICEOVER): My
role now is to stall

212
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,084
this person as long as possible.

213
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:08,151
I would rather not resort
to more powerful attacks.

214
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,484
They will only leave me
vulnerable to defeat.

215
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:13,218
But my enemy is
a formidable one.

216
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,651
I will have to reveal my
secret technique to best him!

217
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,084
-Here I come.

218
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,518
I just had surgery, so
I am not at my best.

219
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:28,218
But if I only open the First
Gate, the Gate of Opening,

220
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,618
I should be all right.

221
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,418
-The First Gate, Gate
of Opening, open!

222
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:41,784
Primary Lotus!

223
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:52,118
LEE (VOICEOVER): The bone
absorbed the impact of my kick!

224
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,284
-Your speed is impressive.

225
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,084
But this is over now.

226
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,484
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

227
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:03,818
I'm wracking my brain here, Why
can't I come up with anything?

228
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:05,318
I'm at the end of my rope.

229
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,351
I can't hold on any home longer.

230
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,551
-You're staring
death in the face.

231
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:15,451
Shouldn't you be screaming
for mercy or something?

232
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,951
Eh?

233
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,451
[chuckling]

234
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,851
-Now die!

235
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,184
-You're mine!

236
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,851
-You're gonna die, kid.

237
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:28,818
Wipe that grin off your face!

238
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:37,484
[scream]

239
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,351
-What the hell?

240
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:47,451
-Who are you?

241
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,284
-Huh?

242
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,784
-Heh.

243
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,784
Well, what do you know?

244
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,184
Looks like we're
on the same side.

245
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,784
-Who are you?

246
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,551
-Allies of the Leaf Village.

247
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,484
-We're shinobi of the Sand.

248
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,996
[theme music]

249
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:04,838
SHKAMARU: I had heard that
the Sand and Leaf had made up,

250
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:06,038
but--

251
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,438
TEMARI: It's not like we
attacked the Leaf Village

252
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,438
for the heck of it.

253
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,704
It was a mission,
just like this is.

254
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:12,238
SHIKAMARU: Whatever
you say well.

255
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,238
KIBA: Hey, by the way,
weren't there three of you

256
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,938
Sand ninja heading
this way before?

257
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:19,438
KANKURO: We had no choice but
to split up for you weaklings.

258
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,138
KIBA: You idiot.

259
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,838
Don't take them lightly.

260
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:24,338
These guys are
anything but ordinary.

261
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,471
NARUTO: Next time--
the Sand Shinobi!

262
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,371
Allies of the Leaf!

263
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:32,904
