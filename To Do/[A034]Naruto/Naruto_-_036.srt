00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,930
[theme music]

2
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:49,008
-For crying out loud.

3
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,278
-Sakura?

4
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,914
-How far have we walked?

5
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,352
That tower is not
getting any closer.

6
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,656
-Now that you mention it,
I was thinking that too.

7
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,924
It's weird.

8
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:02,892
-Maybe not.

9
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:05,695
It would seem
we've been spotted.

10
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,465
Somebody's playing
games with us.

11
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,201
Look.

12
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:11,235
Ring a bell?

13
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,370
-Huh?

14
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:13,204
Oh, man.

15
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:14,105
No way!

16
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:15,440
It can't be!

17
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:21,147
Hey, what's the big idea?

18
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,649
-What's going on?

19
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,185
-Kenjitsu.

20
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:28,456
That's what it looks like,
and we feel for it completely.

21
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,960
We were so concerned with
not being seen by anyone,

22
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,531
we didn't see we were
walking around in circles.

23
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,133
-What's their game?

24
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,638
-They're probably trying to
wear us down and then strike

25
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:44,375
when we're frustrated
and physically exhausted.

26
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:47,212
-You mean like we are right now?

27
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,148
-Right.

28
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,316
They'll be coming soon.

29
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,227
-Well, Naruto.

30
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,166
You wanted a fight.

31
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,771
-Four against 40, just
the way I like it.

32
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,373
Clone versus clone.

33
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,008
Mine are better than yours.

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,653
-What are they?

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,956
-Clones, from the look of it.

36
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,292
And a whole lot of them.

37
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:55,929
-Like cornered rats.

38
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:00,501
-Oh yeah?

39
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,069
Cornered rats, are we?

40
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:13,550
-Well, whatever they are,
they sure can't take a punch.

41
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,152
That's showing them!

42
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:16,554
Way to go!

43
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:17,155
-Hm?

44
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,078
-What are they?

45
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:50,428
-I just touched him
and he turned to mush.

46
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,572
-What's really going on here?

47
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,173
Sharingan!

48
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:07,182
-Naruto, watch out!

49
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,134
-Sasuke!

50
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,579
-Down!

51
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:33,180
-Sasuke!

52
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:41,891
-What's going on?

53
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,292
Can't move my body.

54
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,500
-Are you all right?

55
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:55,607
-It's obvious this
thing is real enough.

56
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,511
No illusion here.

57
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,380
-Surrender your scroll!

58
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:01,514
Surrender your scroll!

59
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,323
-The fact that Kabuto
is wounded and bleeding

60
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:11,894
means that these things
are real shadow clones!

61
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,896
But man, shadow
clones are supposed

62
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,899
to vanish when you
give them a good shot.

63
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:18,802
These things don't!

64
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,772
So what the heck
are we dealing with?

65
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,173
Some kind of Kenjitsu?

66
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:23,976
-Surrender your scrolls.

67
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,017
-Come and get it!

68
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,186
-It's no use!

69
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,187
Save it!

70
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:39,094
You'll only be
fighting illusions.

71
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,630
It's Genjutsu, all right.

72
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,264
-Illusions?

73
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:43,966
But how?

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,470
That gash on Kabuto's
arm is real enough.

75
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:48,238
-That's true.

76
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:51,175
But still, Sasuke is right.

77
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,314
Could be the real enemy is in
hiding somewhere in the woods

78
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,450
nearby, launching real attacks
from behind a smokescreen

79
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,554
of illusions and coordinating
their movements with them

80
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,090
so that we're fooled into
thinking these Genjutsu

81
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,193
Shinobi are the
ones attacking us.

82
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:13,001
-Lucky guess.

83
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,471
-Well, wherever they are,
what are we going to do,

84
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,106
just stand here?

85
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,143
Let's go find these clowns
and take care of them!

86
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,377
-Hold on, Naruto.

87
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,179
They'd like nothing
better than for us

88
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:25,917
to go searching blindly through
the forest while they sit back

89
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,520
and take us out one by one.

90
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:32,625
We'd be making their
job easy for them.

91
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,327
I know this kind of attack.

92
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,229
The kind who use it
do so because they're

93
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:40,034
weak in Taijutsu and afraid
of close, hand-to-hand combat,

94
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,235
according to my data.

95
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:49,680
We have no choice.

96
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:53,217
All we can do is hold our ground
and fend off their attacks.

97
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:57,990
-OK, fine.

98
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:58,824
Whatever.

99
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,494
Let's just do it.

100
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,631
-How long do you think
they can hold out?

101
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,800
-The night is young.

102
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,977
[laughs]

103
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,594
-Man, how long is
this going to go on?

104
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:30,695
-OK.

105
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,432
This isn't going to work.

106
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:32,998
-No.

107
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:34,034
It's pointless.

108
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,936
You'll only waste your Chakra.

109
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,774
By trying to fight these, you'll
be doing just what they want.

110
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,976
-If we were to eliminate all
of the illusions, whoever

111
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,480
is casting them wouldn't be able
to hurl kunai at us without us

112
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:47,182
being able to see
where they're hiding.

113
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,318
I'll show them two
can play at this game.

114
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,920
Shadow clone Jutsu!

115
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:58,463
-Shadow clones!

116
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,353
-Back for more, huh?

117
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,335
OK!

118
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,895
-Sasuke, shouldn't we help him?

119
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:25,796
-Jerk.

120
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:26,898
He's given us no choice.

121
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,866
We've got to now.

122
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,235
-Well then?

123
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,136
-You're right.

124
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,237
He's going to need us.

125
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,439
So that's that.

126
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,207
We fight.

127
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,809
-Come on, Sakura.

128
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,409
-Right!

129
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:04,376
-I'm just warming up.

130
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,454
-Sun's coming up.

131
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,424
Time to move in for the kill.

132
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,692
-I think you're right.

133
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,065
We've crushed their spirits.

134
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,934
Now all that's left
is their bodies.

135
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:28,906
Lucky us.

136
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,011
You!

137
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,346
I know you.

138
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,983
You're the one who cut
me on the shoulder!

139
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:40,220
That really messed
me up, you know.

140
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,654
Oh, well.

141
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,560
Now I can finally pay
you back-- with interest.

142
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:55,357
[laughs]

143
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,382
-Well, well.

144
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,051
Now who's the cornered rat?

145
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:12,025
-Works like a charm, Naruto.

146
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:24,841
-What?

147
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,142
It can't be.

148
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,912
If they're over there,
then who are they?

149
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,147
-Confused?

150
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,682
Sorry, but it was
the only way to get

151
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,517
you guys to come out of hiding.

152
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,459
-How?

153
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,095
Don't tell me that, little brat.

154
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,497
It's not possible.

155
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,235
-The shadow clones were
only the first part of it.

156
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:50,238
My real trick was
coming up with clones

157
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:53,241
for the rest of my squad.

158
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:56,445
-While our doubles did all the
fighting and took the beating,

159
00:11:56,479 --> 00:12:00,517
we were safe and sound waiting
for you to show yourself.

160
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,687
What do you think, guys?

161
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,655
I think our little plan worked.

162
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,802
Naruto, take a break.

163
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,838
You've used up too
much of your Chakra.

164
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,207
Don't worry.

165
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,775
I've got them.

166
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,256
-After all the work
I've done, there's

167
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,158
no way I'm going to
stand back and let you

168
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:35,493
guys have all the fun.

169
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,872
-Woah.

170
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,875
Is this the same Naruto?

171
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,479
What happened?

172
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:53,615
When did he get this good?

173
00:12:56,152 --> 00:13:00,823
-This kid shouldn't even be
able to move, let alone this.

174
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,327
-Naruto?

175
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:06,597
-His Chakra is
incredibly resilient.

176
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:14,607
To be able to pull off a
multiple shadow clone Jutsu,

177
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,977
and then to transform
three of them

178
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,248
into clones of his companions,
and to still come out fighting.

179
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,084
And all this on the 5th day.

180
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:30,159
If he ever truly
masters his Chakra,

181
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,761
this kid will be unstoppable.

182
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,600
-Not bad.

183
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,335
But that doesn't mean it's over.

184
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,171
We're still feeling lucky.

185
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:45,077
And besides, time is
running out for all of us.

186
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:48,215
So we'll just have to take
the gloves off and show you

187
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:51,452
our Ninjutsu.

188
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:53,021
Ninja heart!

189
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,623
Falcon jutsu!

190
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,564
-Shadow clones?

191
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,366
-Those are real clones.

192
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,169
Don't waste your
strength, bone head.

193
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:06,971
Let them make the first move.

194
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,507
-If these are clones,
then the real ones

195
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,808
are in there with them.

196
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,310
All I've got to do is
smash my way through

197
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,380
until I find the
ones that squeal!

198
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:15,214
-No!

199
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,015
Don't be an idiot.

200
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:16,816
Listen to me.

201
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,084
-Get off my back, will you?

202
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,319
Just stay out of it.

203
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:20,921
I can handle this.

204
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,894
-No, Naruto!

205
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:27,295
Come back!

206
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:28,297
-Not again.

207
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,107
-Just like before.

208
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,045
The stabbing pain in my neck
when I try my Sharingan.

209
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,486
Maybe I've used too
much of my Chakra.

210
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,688
-So that one's a clone.

211
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,494
Two!

212
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,430
That one, too.

213
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:56,564
-Naruto, stop!

214
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:57,900
-Could it be they're all fake?

215
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:01,304
Or could it be Ganjutsu again?

216
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:03,206
-I've got to try.

217
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,876
Use the last of my Chakra.

218
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,899
Sharingan!

219
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:22,129
-Sasuke!

220
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:23,731
The mark again.

221
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,471
Sasuke, please, stop
using your Sharingan.

222
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,240
Don't do it.

223
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:34,043
-You should never give
your enemy an opening.

224
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,323
-Hey, are you OK?

225
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:52,098
Now you're going to get it.

226
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,833
-Forget it, Naruto.

227
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:54,869
-Huh?

228
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,037
-You can swing at
those guys all day.

229
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,607
You're just wasting
your time on them.

230
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,677
The real ones aren't there.

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,979
-What are you talking about?

232
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,448
That last attack didn't
come from any clone.

233
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:06,749
Of course the real
ones are here.

234
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,051
They've gotta be here.

235
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,020
If they're not, then
where the heck are they?

236
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,389
-Use your head.

237
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:15,293
If I knew the answer to that,
we wouldn't be in this fix.

238
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,595
-I'm exhausted.

239
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,331
Can't do the Shadow
Clone Jutusu anymore.

240
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:21,601
-Looks like they've reached
the end of their rope.

241
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:22,602
Oh, well.

242
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:23,970
It was fun while it lasted.

243
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,551
-That's it.

244
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,554
They hide using Earth
Style and attack

245
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:39,155
while we're focused
on their clones.

246
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,828
-Kabuto!

247
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,209
-Like you said, never give
your enemy an opening.

248
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,379
Good advice.

249
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,147
-Thank you, Naruto.

250
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,082
You saved my neck.

251
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,655
-Way to go, Naruto.

252
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:34,823
-It was nothing.

253
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,572
-That mark on your
neck, what is it?

254
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:48,306
A bruise?

255
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:51,977
-It's nothing.

256
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,618
-Hey, guys!

257
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:58,785
Here it is!

258
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,623
Just what we needed,
a heaven scroll.

259
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:04,659
-Good for you.

260
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,563
-There's something
about this guy.

261
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:09,198
Something I don't like.

262
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,615
-There you are, Kabuto.

263
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,417
You're late.

264
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,853
-Sorry about that.

265
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:29,489
I got a little sidetracked.

266
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,024
-Yeah, and are we glad you did.

267
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,726
After all, it was
only thank to you

268
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,629
that we got both the scrolls.

269
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:35,664
-Not really.

270
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,799
You did most of it on your own.

271
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,535
Especially you, Naruto.

272
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:40,503
Very impressive.

273
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,680
Well, this is the door
that we go through.

274
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,083
So long, and good
luck to us both.

275
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:52,004
-Right.

276
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,200
-A good harvest?

277
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,134
-Yes.

278
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,570
Even better than expected.

279
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:11,674
I learned a lot about him
during the second exam.

280
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,212
And I recorded all
the data on this.

281
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,346
You want it?

282
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:17,481
-Of course.

283
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,518
So tell me, what did you think?

284
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,323
-Your curiosity is truly
insatiable, Lord Orochimaru.

285
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:28,661
-As a sound village spy,
you see things others don't.

286
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:31,432
Your opinion is
of interest to me.

287
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:34,201
-Oh, it doesn't really
matter, does it?

288
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:37,139
Whatever I think, you're
the one who decides.

289
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:40,075
Isn't that always the way?

290
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:43,379
-You're a cagey one,
aren't you, Kabuto?

291
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,750
I like that.

292
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:49,587
Good work.

293
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,621
-What's the deal?

294
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,958
There's nobody here.

295
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:53,792
-It's OK, Sakura.

296
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,561
I can manage.

297
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,997
-Sure.

298
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,666
-What a drag.

299
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,234
I was enjoying that.

300
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,502
-Huh?

301
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,436
I don't get it.

302
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,605
What happens now?

303
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,539
-Hold on a second.

304
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:06,808
Just look at that.

305
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,776
-Great.

306
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,977
What is it?

307
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,213
-If qualities of
heaven are your desire,

308
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,383
acquire wisdom to
take your mind higher.

309
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,552
If earthly qualities are what
you lack, train your body

310
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:17,954
and prepare to attack.

311
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,623
When heaven and earth
are open together,

312
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:22,527
the perilous path will
become righteous forever.

313
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,431
This something is the secret way
that guides us from this place

314
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:27,666
today.

315
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,801
-This what?

316
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,770
Or is that a secret, too?

317
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:34,174
-It's like there's
a word missing here.

318
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,844
Anyway, it's about the scrolls.

319
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:40,481
I think we're supposed to open
and read the heaven and earth

320
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:41,450
scrolls now.

321
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:02,909
-OK.

322
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,344
Here goes nothing.

323
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:12,167
[music playing]

324
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,276
-Hey, what's the big idea?

325
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,212
What are all these
guys still doing here?

326
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:49,052
Hinata and her team of goof
balls, Rock Lee and his squad,

327
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:52,156
and even those other weirdos.

328
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:53,557
Oh, well.

329
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:55,760
Just means they'll be that much
more bummed when I leave them

330
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:56,895
all in the dust.

331
00:22:56,928 --> 00:23:00,532
Because I am going
to beat Hokage.

332
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,501
Next time, surviving the cut.

333
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:05,768
The rookie nine together again.
