die in battle?

00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,370
It is the way of the Shinobi.

NARUTO: You'll pay for this.

00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,775

Now.

21
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:32,600
Impossible.

22
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:40,309

The seal has been broken.

No.

27
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,456
It's been loosened,
and a glimmer

28
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,160
of the nine-tailed fox's
chakra has slipped through.

29
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:58,733
But the seal still holds.

00:03:58,766 --> 00:03:59,701
Good.

31
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,736
Then maybe we still
have a chance.

32
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,911
Just maybe.

33
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:10,948
Zabuza, I don't mean
to spoil your fun.

34
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,784
I know how you like to
stretch these things out.

35
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,121
But how about we put
an end to this now?

36
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,929
Come on, what do you say?

37
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,064
We're both busy people.

38
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,765
ZABUZA: Hm.

39
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,800
Tempting.

40
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,602
I'm curious to
see how you intend

41
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,205
to back up such brave words.

42
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,206

I am no match for this boy.

53
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:39,927
Master.

54
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:46,468
I have failed.

HAKU: Why do you not strike?

59
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,315
-Huh?

60
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,152
-Did you not just vow to
avenge your comrade's death

61
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,287
by killing me?

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,590
Or was that vow
just empty words?

-And now-- that won't do.

68
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,217
You're still holding back.

69
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,553
If that is all the strength
you can put into it,

70
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,324
you will never keep your vow.

71
00:06:57,357 --> 00:07:01,495
Perhaps he didn't mean as
much to you as you pretend.

[grunting]

73
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:06,468
Is there anyone who's
important to you?

74
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,605
There is only one person
who matters to me,

75
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,476
and I live to protect
and serve him.

76
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,581
That is my purpose--
to show mercy

77
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,818
to those who oppose
the one you serve--

78
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:23,456
to allow his enemies to live
when you could strike them

79
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:26,994
down-- this is not compassion.

80
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:30,598
It is a betrayal of your
life's very purpose.

81
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:33,502
For what reason
do you exist then?

82
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,638
You're of use to no one.

83
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,207
Your life has no meaning.

84
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,347
It is mere existence-- day
after day of pain and struggle--

85
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,683
signifying nothing.

86
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,886
-Yeah, well, speak for yourself.

87
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,888
-Are you really that
blind, little one?

88
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,291
I am speaking of myself.

89
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:55,497
This day has shown that I am
no longer of any use to Zabuza.

90
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,531
-Zabuza.

91
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:59,502
[angrily]Why that guy anyway?

92
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:00,969
To devote your life
to a rotten skunk

93
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:03,139
who doesn't know the
meaning of the word honor.

94
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,941
If he's really the
one person that

95
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:08,813
matters to you-- man, that's the
sorriest thing I've ever heard.

96
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:12,884
-There were once others who
mattered to me long ago.

97
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:18,792
My father and my mother.

98
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:25,067
I was born in the Land of
Water in a small village where

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,169
the snow lies deep
in the winter.

100
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,673
My parents were
farmers and very poor.

101
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,376
Our life was hard,
but we were content.

102
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,250
My parents were good to
each other and kind to me.

103
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,587
Yes, we were happy once.

104
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,156
But then everything changed.

105
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,765
Because of something that
happened long before I

106
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:53,302
was even born,
everything changed.

107
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:54,336
-What do you mean?

108
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,405
What was it?

109
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,240
What happened?

110
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,442
-It wasn't my doing.

111
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,383
It is in the blood.

112
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:04,984
-Blood?

113
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:08,989
So what was it?

114
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:13,628
You said something happened
that changed everything!

115
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:16,699
-It was my father who changed.

116
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,168
He killed my mother,
and he almost killed me.

117
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,770
[gasping]

118
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,941
After years of suffering
the horrors of civil war,

119
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,477
the people of my land
had come to fear and hate

120
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:30,349
anyone who carried the
Kekkei Genkai in their blood.

121
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:32,218
NARUTO: Kekkei Genkai?

122
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,921
HAKU: The advanced
bloodline trait of a clan.

123
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:38,659
It's jutsu and abilities
passed down from generation

124
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,061
to generation.

125
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,130
Because of their
unique abilities,

126
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,233
the clans were used
as mercenaries.

127
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:47,203
They fought in many battles
and were much feared.

128
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,940
But when the war was
over, they were despised

129
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:53,010
and shunned by the people who
feared their presence would

130
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:55,280
only bring more
war and misfortune.

131
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:02,289
So it was that after
the wars, these clans

132
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:05,526
went into hiding-- denying
the bloodline trait that

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,396
flowed in their
veins, concealing

134
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:11,868
their unique abilities--
knowing that to be discovered

135
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,703
meant certain death.

136
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,173
If you had searched
that boy's memories,

137
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:19,010
I'm sure you would have
found it there, too.

138
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,846
The cruelty of people--
their fear of things

139
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,982
they don't understand.

140
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:27,854
For years, my mother
was successful in hiding

141
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,790
her bloodline trait.

142
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:32,660
She met and fell in love
with a simple farmer.

143
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,062
And they were married.

144
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,664
And after that,
my mother thought

145
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,800
she would lead a
peaceful, ordinary life

146
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,502
to the end of her days.

See what I made?

152
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,480
See?

153
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,449
Isn't it beautiful?

154
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,250
HAKU'S MOTHER: No!

155
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,552
You must never!

156
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,386
Do you hear?

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,154
Never!

158
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,388
You wicked, wicked child!

159
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,125
-Mama, what is it?

160
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,092
Stop!

161
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:58,592
Mama!

I'm sorry, my darling!

HAKU: My father had
seen-- and so he

169
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,415
knew our secret-- my
mother's and mine.

176
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:24,467
HAKU: When at last I was myself
again, I was no longer myself.

177
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,271
My father and mother
were gone, but I

178
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,006
knew that something
else had been

179
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,011
taken from me-- something
even more important.

180
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,580
And that is when
I truly despaired.

181
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:40,220
-More important than
your mother and father?

182
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:41,522
What?

183
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,090
-My purpose.

184
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:46,161
In all the world, there
was no one who needed me.

185
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:48,230
I was unnecessary.

186
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,902
-(VOICEOVER) Just like me!

187
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:55,473
-Why is it you're so
determined to be Hokage?

188
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,176
Because you want all eyes in
your village to look on you

189
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,046
and recognize you
as a great ninja.

190
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,982
You see, it is only
through the eyes of others

191
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,652
that our little lives
have any significance.

192
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,355
When there is no one who sees
you or will even look at you,

193
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,194
it's as if you do not exist.

194
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,996
Then Zabuza came along
and looked at me,

195
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,100
and his eyes were not
full of hate or fear.

196
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,837
He did not shun me
for my strangeness.

197
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,308
Indeed, my special powers
were just what he wanted.

198
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:27,079
He made me necessary again.

199
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:28,480
ZABUZA: Huh.

200
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:32,185
Little kid like you with
no one to look after you--

201
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,155
you'll die a beggar's death.

202
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,862
-Hey, you know what?

203
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,364
Your eyes remind me of mine.

204
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,343
ZABUZA: Well, little one,
will you stay here and die?

205
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:54,613
Or come with me
and be of some use?

206
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:58,819
Will you serve me and submit
to my will in all things?

207
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,194
[music playing]

208
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:15,339
Then your special abilities
belong to me from this day

209
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:17,709
forward.

210
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,245
[music playing]

211
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:31,660
Let us go then.

212
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,938
-I was happy.

213
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:44,142
ZABUZA: My time
here is done, Haku.

214
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,714
Tonight, I cast aside
the Land of Water.

215
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:51,284
One day I will return
and seize this land

216
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,154
and hold it in my hands.

217
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,225
Many things must be done
before that day comes,

218
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,827
and you will help me to do them.

219
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,365
But I warn you-- friendship,
comfort, encouragement--

220
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,303
I do not need these things, nor
should you expect them from me.

221
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,105
-I understand.

222
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,707
I am yours, Zabuza.

223
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,345
I am only an instrument
of your will.

224
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,714
Think of me as a weapon
to be kept at your side

225
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:19,086
and used as you see fit.

226
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,656
-Well said, child.

227
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,457
[wind blowing]

228
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,194
-I have failed you, Zabuza.

229
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,797
I am like a weapon that
has been broken and is

230
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,266
of no further use.

231
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:36,508
[gasping]

232
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:44,618
Naruto.

233
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,419
Kill me.

234
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,702
-Ninja art summoning!

235
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,837
Earth style-- fanged
pursuit jutsu!

236
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,381
ZABUZA: I don't
know why you bother.

237
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:11,852
Of what use is your jutsu
if you can't even find me?

238
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,688
But I can find you.

239
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,963
Blindly falling into my trap.

240
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,766
You disappoint me, Kakashi.

241
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,734
I think you're right.

242
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,072
It is time to put
an end to this.

243
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,073
[rattling]

244
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:28,674
Huh?

245
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,581
[growling]

246
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:35,115
[biting]

247
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,350
[screaming]

248
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:37,351
[barking]

249
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:41,222
[screaming]

250
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:42,123
-That dreadful noise!

251
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,659
What could it be?

252
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,363
-I don't know, and I'm not
sure that I want to find out!

253
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:50,067
[growling]

254
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,274
-I realized that I couldn't see
you, I'd have to smell you out.

255
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,443
That was a summoning jutsu.

256
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,180
I was calling forth
my ninja hounds.

257
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:01,915
They can track a scent anywhere.

258
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:08,423
When you attacked me, I
let you get past my guard.

259
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,493
I wanted you to cut me.

260
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:13,363
You see, it's the smell
of my blood on your blade

261
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,199
that led them to you.

262
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:16,534
Surprised?

263
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,671
Looks like I wasn't the
only one who was blind.

264
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,371
Huh.

265
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,141
Falling into my trap.

266
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,676
You disappoint me, Zabuza.

267
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,081
Ah.

268
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,118
The mist is finally clearing.

269
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:31,452
And you know what I see?

270
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,154
Your death.

271
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:33,788
ZABUZA: Talk.

272
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:34,623
Talk.

273
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:37,059
Do you mean to talk me to death?

274
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,895
KAKASHI: In a way, yes.

275
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,865
Right now, my hounds are
just playing with you.

276
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:46,704
But one word from me, and
they'll tear you apart.

277
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,441
Poor Zabuza.

278
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,810
See where your
ambitions got you?

279
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:53,547
You were always
pushing things too far.

280
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:01,991
[crashing]

281
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,694
It was the failed
Mizukage assassination

282
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:07,097
and your attempted coup d'etat.

283
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,634
You were forced to flee with
the few followers you had--

284
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,138
your country's tracker
ninja hot on your heels.

285
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:18,278
You became a rogue ninja whose
name was quickly known even

286
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:19,880
in the village
hidden in the leaves.

287
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:24,118
Now, you're crazy enough to want
to go back and try it again.

288
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,320
But for that, you need money.

289
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,690
And to get it,
you stooped so low

290
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:32,562
as to be the hired thug
of a swine like Gato.

291
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:35,299
All right, Zabuza, enough talk.

292
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:36,834
Time to finish it.

293
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,405
But it won't be with
Sharingan-- imitations

294
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:41,607
of some other ninja's tricks.

295
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,013
No, it's time I introduced
you to my own jutsu.

296
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,294
[sizzling]

297
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:01,699
-[yelling] Lightning blade!

298
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,702
-Chakra's so strong,
it's visible!

299
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,872
He holds it in his hands!

300
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:12,712
-I won't allow you
to kill Tazuna.

301
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:15,650
He's a brave man
with a noble dream.

302
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:17,619
The bridge he's
building is the hope

303
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,522
of this land and all its people.

304
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,724
You're like a disease.

305
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:24,627
By attacking one,
you infect all.

306
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,531
And you don't care.

307
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,469
That is not the
way of the Shinobi.

308
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,470
-You're right.

309
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,939
I don't care!

310
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,510
These useless little people
and their petty little dreams.

311
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,815
Why should they matter to me?

312
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,152
I have a dream of my own.

313
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,554
[sizzling]

314
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,457
-But to have a dream, you
need to have a future.

315
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:49,425
-Huh?

316
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,594
-You don't.

317
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:55,867
Your future's all
used up, Zabuza.

318
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,272
HAKU: Go on.

319
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:01,941
Strike.

320
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,043
Kill me.

321
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,446
Why do you hesitate?

322
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,015
[groaning]

323
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,249
[yelling]

324
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,952
-That's the most ridiculous
story I've ever heard!

325
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:13,823
I mean, he treats
you like a slave.

326
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,860
You're a human being,
not a weapon or a tool.

327
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,798
How can you care about
someone like that?

328
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:22,500
-For that very reason.

329
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,069
-Huh?

330
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:27,040
-Does that seem
so strange to you?

331
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,474
-Well, yeah.

332
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:30,076
A little.

333
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:35,616
When he found me, I was without
a purpose or reason for living.

334
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,719
Zabuza gave me both.

335
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:41,558
[music playing]

336
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:43,761
[laughing]

[gasping]

338
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,895
-But now, my usefulness is over.

339
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:15,300
The only thing that gave my
life meaning-- it's gone.

340
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,739
I am a broken tool-- a blunted
weapon of no use to anyone.

341
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,112
Go on, Naruto, do it.

342
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:30,886
For both of our sakes,
do it-- quickly.

343
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,104
[theme music]

344
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,209
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Look.

345
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:11,212
It's not as if I like
Haku-- not after what

346
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:16,285
he did to Sasuke, but to
kill him in cold blood?

347
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:17,419
What do I do?

348
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,923
What would a Hokage do?

349
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,892
If only I could have
had a straight-up fight

350
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:24,662
like Kakashi-Sensei and Zabuza.

351
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,398
I mean, hey, I'm just a kid.

352
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:29,001
How come I always have to
make the tough decisions?

353
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,404
What would the other guys do?

354
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:35,887
Next time-- The Weapons
Known as Shinobi.
