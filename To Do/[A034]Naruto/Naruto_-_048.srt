00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,592
-Hm?

6
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:49,029
-I have two pieces
of advice for you.

7
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:52,634
First of all, if you intend
to call yourself a shinobi,

8
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,670
stop that stupid
cheering of yours.

9
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:56,272
It's disgraceful.

10
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,377
And second, once a
failure, always a failure.

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,081
You can't change that.

12
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:04,115
-Hmph.

13
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,155
We'll just see about that.

where you are coming from,

believe me.

21
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,940

must be done officially

beating the gifted genius

And Rock Lee's got to be
tough if he took on Sasuke.

that Sand Village guy.

35

about that Neji guy.

-So tell me something
about this guy Neji.

the full extent of his powers

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,591

I knew if I said I wanted
to be last, I would be next.

106
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,596
I simply applied
the principle which

107
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,966
states that sometimes the
surest way to hit something

108
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,169
is to stop trying to hit it.

109
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,705
It is a form of
reverse psychology.

was not going

What are you thinking?

00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:20,313
After all, you're not
going to have time

128
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,148
to read any notes during
the match, are you?

00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:24,318
More good advice!

just figured that out

what kind of moves

dumb haircut has got,

140

but he'll never take Gaara
down, not in this lifetime.

fast on his feet, all right,

00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:07,043
but his kick isn't that great.

143

You have no idea.

00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,538
-Why are you in such a hurry?

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,382
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Be careful.

00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,855

Stay on your toes, Lee.

151
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,165
-All right, then.

00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,839
If you are both ready-- begin.

Aaaah!

00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:10,496
Hunh!

158
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,273
-What is that?

159
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,241
-It's sand.

160
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:21,578
-That's an unusual jutsu.

161
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,348
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So that's
what he's got in that gourd!

162
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,583
SHINO (VOICEOVER): That--

163
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,327
-Is that all you can do?

164
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:36,365

GAARA: Sand Burial.

167
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,418
SHINO (VOICEOVER):
That nightmare.

168
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,621
Not again!

169
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,991
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): A
sand-manipulating jutsu, hm?

170
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,295
It will not be easy
getting through that.

171
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,263
But nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

172
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,643
Rrraahh!

173
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,414
Hunh!

174
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:12,981
Hah!

175
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:18,522
Aaaah!

176
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,117
-Whoa!

177
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,241
-Even as fast as he is, Lee
can't get anywhere close

178
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:33,075
to him.

179
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,043
-The sand!

180
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,478
He's using it as a shield.

181
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,813
-He's not doing it.

182
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,383
The sand is protecting
him of its own accord.

183
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,518
-Huh?

184
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,187
-It's almost like
a living thing.

185
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,726
It'll come to Gaara's defense
without his doing anything.

186
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:49,197
That's why Gaara's
never been injured.

187
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,367
No one can get at him.

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,137
No one's ever even
been able to touch him.

189
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,210
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): Aah!

190
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,512
How is he doing it?

191
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,648
He's not moving a muscle!

192
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,286
GAARA: Well, is that all?

193
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,654
-Huh?

194
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:11,260
-I hope you haven't
finished entertaining me.

195
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:15,933
We haven't had enough blood.

196
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,939
-Huaaah!

197
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,836
Aaaaahhh!

198
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,722
SAKURA: I don't get it!

199
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,791
He's only using taijutsu.

200
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,661
Can't he see that's
never going to work?

201
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:41,000
Why doesn't he get some
distance and use ninjutsu?

202
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,574
-Yes, that might be a good
idea-- that is, if we had any.

203
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:46,908
-Huh?

204
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:51,414
-Lee has no ninjutsu or
genjutsu skills at all.

205
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,216
-You're kidding!

206
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,816
-Yah!

207
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,517
Ah!

208
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,753
-Oh, that's nothing.

209
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,255
You should have
seen how hopeless

210
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,158
he was when I first met him.

211
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,894
No talent whatsoever.

212
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:01,562
-Really?

213
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,566
I can't believe it.

214
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,167
-Yaah!

215
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,513
[cries out]

216
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,483
-Aaah!

217
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,484
-Mm!

218
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,485
-Oh!

219
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,453
-It's over.

220
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,055
[chuckles quietly]

221
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,007
-Uh?

222
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,905
MIGHT GUY: A ninja who can do
neither ninjutsu or genjutsu

223
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:36,676
is certainly a rarity.

224
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,880
Lee has only his
taijutsu to rely on.

225
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:42,184
Some might consider
that a disadvantage.

226
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,359
But that's what
makes him a winner.

227
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,327
-Huh?

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,295
MIGHT GUY: All right, Lee.

229
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,231
Take 'em off.

230
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:56,203
-Uh, but Guy-sensei, you said
that was only as a last resort,

231
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:59,207
when the lives of very
important people were at stake.

232
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,576
-That's right, I did.

233
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:04,381
But this is an exception.

234
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,282
-Really?

235
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:05,883
Really?

236
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,292
-Huh?

237
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:12,925
Are those--

238
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,061
-How old-fashioned.

239
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,396
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Leg weights?

240
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,765
Basic training equipment.

241
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,533
-Totally cool!

242
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,234
-Totally dumb.

243
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,006
-Ah, that is better.

244
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,876
Now I will be able
to move freely.

245
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,778
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Come
on, you really think

246
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,947
you'll be able to get
through Gaara's defenses

247
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,385
just by dropping a couple
of pounds of weight?

248
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,688
[smash]

249
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,223
[gasp]

250
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,191
[gasp]

251
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,293
[gasp]

252
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,195
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Guy, you are too much.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,669
-All right, now go!

254
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:45,837
-Yes, sir!

255
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,015
-Rrrraaahhh!

256
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,792
Aaaahhhh!

257
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,762
SAKURA: So close!

258
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,996
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): So fast.

259
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,332
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Amazing!

260
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:06,933
-Huh?

261
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,674
MIGHT GUY: I could
see that Lee had

262
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,045
no aptitude for
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

263
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,850
So he skipped that and focused
all of his time and energy

264
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,120
into developing his taijutsu.

265
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,758
That way we turned his
disadvantage into a blessing.

266
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,628
Now he doesn't need those
other things to win,

267
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:32,601
because he's transformed himself
into the world's greatest

268
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:35,472
taijutsu specialist.

269
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,073
-Haaah!

270
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,047
[all gasp]

271
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,451
[grunts]

272
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,822
-Hm.

273
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,824
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
I don't believe it.

274
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,827
Gaara's been hurt!

275
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,797
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Impossible!

276
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,164
-Whoa, that's scary.

277
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,002
And I thought he was
quick on his feet before!

278
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,839
He's been that fast
This this time?

279
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,109
-Yes, Lee!

280
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:07,215
Let the power of youth explode!

281
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:08,153
-Rrrright!

282
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,927
[squeaking skid]

283
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,894
ROCK LEE: Over here.

284
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,096
No, here!

285
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,838
-Good!

286
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,808
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
A direct hit.

287
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,178
-He's just too quick!

288
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,349
That sandstorm can't
keep up with him.

289
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,117
Lee, you nailed him!

290
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,286
-That's incredible!

291
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,957
-I've never seen
anyone that fast!

292
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,593
-Makes me dizzy just trying
to keep track of him!

293
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,977
KANKURO: Uh-oh.

294
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,880
-Yeah, uh-oh is right.

295
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,782
Your friend with
the eye makeup is

296
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,585
getting the stuffing
beaten out of him!

297
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:01,188
-That isn't what I was
talking about, kid.

298
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,478
-Huh?

299
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,872
What?

300
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,845
[jagged wheezing]

301
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,214
-What the heck?

302
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,950
What's going on with this guy?

303
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,685
His face is falling off!

304
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,822
-It's like a shell made of sand.

305
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,058
-Look, there's not
a mark on the guy.

306
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,094
-That is so weird!

307
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,103
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): He
encased himself in sand, huh?

308
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,473
Things must be bad.

309
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:44,080
I haven't seen that look on
his face for a long time.

310
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,381
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

311
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,117
I sensed him getting
more and more unstable

312
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,487
as the Chunin Exams progressed.

313
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,058
[jagged wheezing]

314
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,026
BAKI (VOICEOVER): As I
thought, his inner demon

315
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,495
has been awakened.

316
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:00,970
-I don't get it.

317
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,271
Is he made of sand, or what?

318
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,775
All those blows and
kicks Lee hit him with.

319
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,677
Did any of them get through?

320
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,879
-No.

321
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:09,815
It's like he's wearing
a suit of armor.

322
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:11,317
-A what?

323
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,920
KANKURO: Ordinarily, those
shifting clouds of sand

324
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,489
are enough to shield him.

325
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:18,426
But in the event the
shield is penetrated,

326
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,263
Gaara can also wear
the sand like armor

327
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,600
as a last line of defense.

328
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,002
-This guy's too much!

329
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,370
He's got armor now?

330
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,874
Does he have any weak spots?

331
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:29,909
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Huh.

332
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,212
If you only knew, kid.

333
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:37,185
Actually, that armor
is one big weak spot.

334
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,557
Unlike the sand shield,
the armor can be broken.

335
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,492
And then there's the
enormous amount of chakra

336
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:45,630
that Gaara has to use
to keep it in place.

337
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,499
That takes its toll.

338
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,335
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
That's proof that Gaara

339
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,171
is feeling the pressure.

340
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,976
He would never have resorted
to the armor otherwise.

341
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,412
This Lee is good,
no doubt about it.

342
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,282
But that's not the
same as winning.

343
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,319
It may not be as
easy as we thought,

344
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:04,055
but the outcome's a given.

345
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:07,026
Gaara can't lose.

346
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,828
-Well, is that all?

347
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:09,896
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): Aah!

348
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,398
My speed will not be enough.

349
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:15,737
He is impossible to get at
behind those sand defenses.

350
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,942
But maybe if I can get
him up off the ground

351
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,844
and away from the
sand, then hit him

352
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,482
hard from above with the Lotus--

353
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,658
-Hm!

354
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,259
-Hm.

355
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:44,443
Get ready.

356
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,722
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
That's right, Lee.

357
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:53,856
Good work.

358
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,458
That flimsy shield of
sand won't protect him

359
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:59,231
from your high-speed Lotus.

360
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,233
-What are you waiting for?

361
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,436
-OK, you asked for it.

362
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:04,375
Hyyyahh!

363
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,209
-He's not floating!

364
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,377
-Try this!

365
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:20,259
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): What an
incredible series of kicks!

366
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,827
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
Even an ordinary

367
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,299
Lotus puts an enormous strain
on the body, let alone this.

368
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,737
You've got to
finish him off, now!

369
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,139
-Yyaahhh!

370
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,140
-Hm?

371
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:31,741
-Aaahh!

372
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:41,088
-Unnh!

373
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,690
-Now take this!

374
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:46,661
Primary Lotus!

375
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,133
[thud]

376
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:50,734
[thud]

377
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:51,635
[thud]

378
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,636
[thud]

379
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:06,989
[panting]

380
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,035
It is over.

381
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:18,772
I got him!

382
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,674
-Right on!

383
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:21,342
-Amazing!

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,910
He really did it.

385
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:25,181
-No, I don't believe it.

386
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,649
-You did it!

387
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,252
Way to go, Lee!

388
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:31,356
-Is he-- that guy
isn't dead, is he?

389
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,301
[crack]

390
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,870
[gasp]

391
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:45,708
[hard sand crumbling]

392
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,409
-Huh?

393
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,881
[hard sand crumbling]

394
00:20:58,793 --> 00:20:59,538
-What?

395
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:08,187
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

396
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,209
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What now?

397
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:40,678
Lee's hit the wall, and things
are just getting started!

398
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:43,683
That's what happens when you
go crazy on the appetizers

399
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,220
and don't leave room
for the main course.

400
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,156
Better get it in
gear, Bushy Brow.

401
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,859
Otherwise, this guy's liable
to eat you for dessert!

402
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:56,255
Next time-- Lee's
Hidden Strength:

403
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:58,888
Forbidden Secret Jutsu.

404
00:22:58,921 --> 00:22:59,888
Uh-oh!

405
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,555
Things are not looking good!
