[theme music]

2
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,252
-Naruto.

3
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,791
-Hm?

4
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:59,196
LEE: There was a distress
call from the training room.

5
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,400
What in the world
happened out here?

6
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,369
-Bad news, guys.

7
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:04,274
The star was stolen.

8
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,782
It was a ninja, and he flew
off using chakra somehow.

9
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,685
-You actually saw this?

10
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:11,824
-Yeah, but shinobi can't fly.

11
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:14,463
Not that I've ever heard.

12
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:14,954
-Byakugan.

13
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,453
He's too far out.

14
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,723
I lost him.

15
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,694
But Naruto was correct.

16
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,899
-Using chakra to
take to the air?

17
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,803
That is a formidable shinobi.

18
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:48,438
-Wow.

19
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:49,640
So it was true.

20
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:50,810
-Of course, it was true.

21
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:51,678
What are you saying?

22
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:52,780
You didn't believe me?

23
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:53,849
-Pretty much.

24
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,687
-Wha?

25
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,723
Geez.

26
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:57,958
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Tenten.

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,493
-So the star that their
village was founded on,

28
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,930
this says it's
actually a meteorite?

29
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:18,737
-That's right.

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,490
TSUNADE: It dates back
to the first Hoshikage

31
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,896
who established the village.

32
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:34,605
He discovered that by training
in close proximity to the star,

33
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,909
his chakra was strengthened.

34
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,625
Ever since then, they've
held a unique position

35
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,566
amongst the hidden villages.

36
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,906
-Yes, but our records show that
particular form of training

37
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,812
has been suspended
for 10 years now.

38
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,284
-After the Third
Hoshikage came to power,

39
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,456
he chose to put an end to it.

40
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,864
But then a year ago,
he passed away, sadly,

41
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,601
and the village lifted the ban.

42
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,572
-It's curious, isn't it?

43
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,610
I wonder what moved
him to forbid it.

44
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:08,280
-Hard To say.

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,721
Only the Village Hidden in
the Stars is privy to that.

46
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:15,696
Although, there have been
a few rumors on the wind.

47
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,634
-What do you mean?

48
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,705
-Well, details are
spotty, but most

49
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,881
of the ninja who underwent
the training died from it.

50
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,985
Whatever this thing
is, we do know

51
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,458
it forcibly strengthens chakra.

52
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,598
It's likely that gift comes with
adverse effects to the body.

53
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,003
-What?

54
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,675
Someone made off with the star?

55
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,845
-Yes.

56
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,582
There were people training
there when it happened,

57
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:58,525
but the enemy knocked them
out with some sort of jutsu.

58
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,829
-That's pathetic!

59
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,867
-You wouldn't say that
if you'd seen the chakra

60
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,738
this guy was throwing around!

61
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,443
-Was he truly that
impressive a foe then?

62
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:08,547
-Yeah.

63
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,484
He was forming wings and
beasts out of chakra.

64
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,054
I'd never seen anything like it.

65
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,700
-Is this true, Sumaru?

66
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,969
-Yes.

67
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,573
Ninja Art Kujaku.

68
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:21,675
No question about it.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,659
-That's a jutsu unique to the
Village Hidden in the Stars,

70
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,135
right?

71
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,430
-Yeah.

72
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,468
and only those who master
the full star training--

73
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,037
-Sumaru!

74
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:39,414
-Tenten, this village has a
right to their own secrets.

75
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,985
You should know better.

76
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:45,761
Especially in regards to a jutsu
that is part of their heritage.

77
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:46,764
-I beg your pardon.

78
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,040
-Please, my lord.

79
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:52,677
Just give me the order.

80
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,951
Responsibility for the theft of
the star rests with me alone.

81
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,086
-No.

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,957
Our mission was to
protect it for you,

83
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,761
and we let it slip
through our fingers.

84
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,699
We are to share in the blame.

85
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,569
We will retrieve the star.

86
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,006
You may rest assured.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,476
-Very well.

88
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,616
We shall leave the search to
shinobi of the Hidden Leaf.

89
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,923
Sumaru, you keep an eye on
all of your injured brethren.

90
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,858
-But they're outsiders.

91
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,763
What do they know of our ways?

92
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:17,565
-That's an order.

93
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,059
-Hey.

94
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,596
Are those friends
of yours who got

95
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,767
knocked out going
to be all right?

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,473
-Don't worry about it, OK?

97
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:37,576
You're outsiders.

98
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,146
It's none of your concern.

99
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:42,219
Now quit acting
like we're friends.

100
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,691
-That guy's a real
piece of work.

101
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:47,931
-Neji, I know you're trying
to go by the books and all,

102
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,668
but we weren't even there.

103
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,905
-She's right.

104
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,909
And we do not have any leads.

105
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,881
-Actually, we do.

106
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,783
-Huh?

107
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,953
-Then none of you
picked up on it?

108
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:01,762
Their leader, Akahoshi, is
clearly hiding something.

109
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,597
-Hiding?

110
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,866
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,773
-Come to think of it, when
Sumaru said the word Kujaku,

112
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,510
Akahoshi got pretty uppity.

113
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,651
-Well, where there is
smoke, there is fire.

114
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:12,786
An inside job then?

115
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,490
-You're moving too
fast for me, guys.

116
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,726
What's going on?

117
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,162
-I'm going to look
around the village,

118
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:20,036
and see if I can't find
us a trail to follow.

119
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,541
Tenten, I want you
and Lee on Akahoshi.

120
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,978
Keep an eye on him.

121
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:24,645
-Right.

122
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,582
Very well, then.

123
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:26,750
-Just leave it to us.

124
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:27,819
-Wait a second!

125
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,659
What the heck does that
leave for me to do?

126
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,761
-Oh.

127
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,702
Well, uh-- why don't you
tail Sumaru for awhile?

128
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:35,737
-You got it!

129
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,076
I'll be on Sumaru
like fleas on a dog!

130
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:39,980
I'll meet up with you later!

131
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,617
-Same as ever, huh?

132
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,721
-Patience has never
been his strong suit.

133
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,237
No question.

134
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:08,275
Natsuhiboshi, why
are you so red?

135
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:14,288
Because I had a sad
dream last night.

136
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:22,975
My eyes are red from the tears
I shed, swollen as I cry.

137
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:31,760
Natsuhiboshi, why've
you lost your way?

138
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:37,741
I'm searching for a
child who's gone afar.

139
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:43,887
He can't be found
though I search all day.

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,194
My sad dreams come once more.

141
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,048
NARUTO: Hey!

142
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,018
Sumaru!

143
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,624
What're you doing way out here?

144
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,731
-Just passing some time waiting
for the stars to come out.

145
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:05,668
-Star?

146
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:07,172
Yeah kidding, huh?

147
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,911
The night sky sure
is clear around here.

148
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,816
Take a look at that red one.

149
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,318
Pretty isn't it?

150
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:14,922
-Natsuhiboshi.

151
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:18,096
Never alone, the star
on high watches over me.

152
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,899
-What's that?

153
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,303
Hey, hold on a second.

154
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,205
Wait up.

155
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,207
Where you going?

156
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,810
I want to go pay
your friends a visit.

157
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:25,278
Here.

158
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,380
Check it out.

159
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,084
I brought along some of
the Hidden Leaf's world

160
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,788
famous chestnut bean jelly.

161
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:30,271
-Look.

162
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,191
Whatever.

163
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,828
You'll find them at
the training hall.

164
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:36,971
-Man.

165
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,708
That guy's about as
warm as an iceberg.

166
00:09:58,017 --> 00:09:58,985
What gives?

167
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:02,326
You telling me
there's no one here?

168
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,896
Hope this isn't a bad time.

169
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:10,344
Where is everybody?

170
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,213
Hey.

171
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:13,251
You awake over there?

172
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,255
What the?

173
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,827
[groaning]

174
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,112
-Hokuto, knock it off.

175
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,049
Trust me. it's all right.

176
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,052
I can tell.

177
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,023
He's not an enemy.

178
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,025
-Mizura.

179
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,027
-You little!

180
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:38,213
-Ow.

181
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:39,275
My butt.

182
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,847
-You're a girl?

183
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,016
-That's right.

184
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,152
Who're you?

185
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,526
-I'm Naruto Uzumaki, a
ninja of the Hidden Leaf.

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,399
And I'm here to keep an eye on
this precious star of yours,

187
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,036
OK?

188
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,511
-Wait.

189
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,842
You mean?

190
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,078
I'm so sorry.

191
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,846
Forgive me.

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,915
-Ah, don't sweat it.

193
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,820
I just dropped by for a visit.

194
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:02,124
Uh-- where'd that jelly go?

195
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:03,061
Do you see it?

196
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,135
Hey!

197
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,907
There it is right there!

198
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,913
-Oh no.

199
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:14,352
-There's no doubt about it.

200
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,890
-So the shinobi who made
off with the star, are

201
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,394
you're saying it was really?

202
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,933
-How could they even be alive?

203
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,970
-We don't stand a chance.

204
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,908
-They were the last
to ever complete

205
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,946
the full training of the star.

206
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,082
Which means that--

207
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:31,556
-We're no matter which
with our level of jutsu.

208
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,527
-I wouldn't worry.

209
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,832
If they really are
the culprit, don't

210
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:40,108
forget we already possess
their Achilles Heel.

211
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,478
-I suppose so.

212
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,347
-That's right.

213
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,984
What are we waiting for it.

214
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,319
Let's go round 'em up.

215
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:45,921
-Hold on.

216
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,834
First things first.

217
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,841
We need to distract these
annoying little flies.

218
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,154
-I'm Hokuto.

219
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,426
Please, forgive me
for being so rash,

220
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,400
but I didn't
recognize your chakra.

221
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,001
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,117
-Now that's good.

223
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,592
Go on.

224
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:15,386
Dig in.

225
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,957
The food's not gonna eat itself.

226
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,439
-OK.

227
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:22,635
Wow.

228
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,105
That is good.

229
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,076
You weren't kidding.

230
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,914
-I know, right?

231
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,185
Hey. uh-- what gives?

232
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:32,423
Where did all the
others run off to?

233
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:33,292
-It's OK.

234
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,297
The thief just put us to sleep.

235
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,568
We didn't really get
hurt or anything.

236
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,671
-No fooling.

237
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:43,114
[coughing]

238
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,186
-You OK?

239
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,456
I really owe you for
saving my butt back there.

240
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,227
[coughing]

241
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,065
-Are you gonna be all right?

242
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,167
-I'm fine.

243
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,238
I just need a little rest.

244
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,210
-Mizura's health has
been worsening ever

245
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,280
since he began his training.

246
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,586
-Hokuto, you shouldn't
talk about the star

247
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,089
in front of outsiders!

248
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:03,926
[coughing]

249
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,532
-Mizura, hold on.

250
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,135
I'm really sorry.

251
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:08,937
I wasn't thinking.

252
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,939
That's all.

253
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,576
-Outsider?

254
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,380
You guys are pretty
cold around here.

255
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,652
Especially that Sumaru kid.

256
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:20,429
-I'm sorry, but there's a reason
Sumaru acts the way he does.

257
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:22,133
-Really?

258
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,970
-It happened.

259
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,507
It happened about 10 years ago.

260
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,631
Sumaru's parents were
guarding over the star

261
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:40,140
when they were killed by ninja
from another village seeking

262
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:41,977
to steal it.

263
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:45,117
That's why he's so--

264
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:45,641
-Right.

265
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,553
I get it.

266
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,458
That explains an awful lot.

267
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,006
So, where is Sumaru?

268
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:55,774
And there were others.

269
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:57,712
How come it's you two here?

270
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:58,980
-They're gone.

271
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,556
They said they we're
going after the star.

272
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:03,524
[door slams]

273
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,462
-Huh?

274
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,063
All right.

275
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,199
Well, bye.

276
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,100
-All right.

277
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,270
Here they come.

278
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,606
Let us go.

279
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,176
We should just
face them head on.

280
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:27,677
-You ding-dong.

281
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:28,679
-Tenten.

282
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,116
-We're on a surveillance
mission here.

283
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,422
-I have never been one for
skulking around in the shadows.

284
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,190
-Shh!

285
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,259
Will you shut your trap?

286
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,528
You're gonna blow our cover.

287
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:43,412
Leave the Shadowing
Ninjutsu to me.

288
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:44,748
You just trying to keep quiet.

289
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,151
-But Tenten--

290
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,590
-That's the mission.

291
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:50,260
-I understand.

292
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,464
-Let's go.

293
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:52,365
-Creeping, creeping.

294
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,628
-We're cool.

295
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,599
They haven't noticed us.

296
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:09,670
-Tenten, are you
sure this does not

297
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,441
go against the way of the ninja?

298
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,278
-Quit your
complaining, will you?

299
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,580
LEE: Creeping, creeping.

300
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,452
TENTEN: Will you
stop saying that?

301
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:19,091
LEE: This is not like any
ninjutsu I have ever seen.

302
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:25,772
-Have they spotted us?

303
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:26,774
-Not sure.

304
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,246
[heartbeating]

305
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,883
-It would appear that we
have escaped their attention.

306
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:46,651
-OK.

307
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:47,853
Let's stay on 'em then.

308
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:52,331
Great.

309
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,234
They turned to the right.

310
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:55,136
-Roger that.

311
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,849
-They vanished.

312
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,421
-So they gave us the slip.

313
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,323
-I don't get it.

314
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:05,460
Did they see us?

315
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,348
Hold on.

316
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,319
We're not your enemy.

317
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,554
-That is right.

318
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:21,161
We are here on a mission
from the Hidden Leaf Village.

319
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:24,167
-Well, a couple of
Leaf shinobi, huh?

320
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,771
-What're you trailing us for?

321
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,309
Don't you people have a
thief to catch somewhere?

322
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:31,717
LEE: That may be so, but there's
always the distinct possibility

323
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,724
that the two of you are
enemies in disguise.

324
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:35,526
-Heh.

325
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,196
You've got a lot of nerve.

326
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,933
-We didn't mean to be rude.

327
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,904
It's just that we
don't have any leads.

328
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:43,610
And we wanna see the star
back where it belonged so--

329
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:46,216
-So you thought you'd
tag after us for a while.

330
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:47,753
Is that the idea?

331
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:48,588
-Pfeh.

332
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,559
Sounds like a waste of time.

333
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,194
-Yeah.

334
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,329
Thanks anyway.

335
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,601
But we can get to
star back ourselves.

336
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,205
If you really wanna
do us a favor,

337
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:59,612
then stay the heck
out of our way.

338
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,449
-Don't have to be
so mean about it.

339
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,521
-I fear Neji may
have been right.

340
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,759
They do seem to be hiding
something in this village.

341
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,360
-Sure do.

342
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:14,912
-Everyone, join hands.

343
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:19,456
All right now.

344
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,328
Start looking for the same
star chakra that we all carry.

345
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:49,990
There you are.

346
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,432
These threads are
made of chakra.

347
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:10,368
They can't be severed.

348
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,777
Give us the star.

349
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,849
You may as well have
robbed us our life's blood.

350
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:23,363
-Hm?

351
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,470
-Neji.

352
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:27,306
Thank goodness.

353
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,374
Have you seen Sumaru?

354
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,045
-I thought I told you
to keep an eye on him.

355
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:30,646
-Yeah.

356
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,314
I know.

357
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,583
You did.

358
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,987
But the thing is, he took off
with a bunch of the others

359
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,824
to go out looking for the star!

360
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,661
-Is that so?

361
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,430
-Hey.

362
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,598
Are you listening to me?

363
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:51,759
What's up?

364
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,029
Something wrong?

365
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:55,400
-There's a massive amount of
chakra at the Valley of Death.

366
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,572
-Looks like he's back, huh?

367
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:58,088
-Hurry.

368
00:18:58,088 --> 00:18:58,574
-You got it.

369
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,691
-Give-- give it back.

370
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:39,631
The star, it's ours.

371
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,134
You've no right to it.

372
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,673
[chuckling]

373
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,898
NARUTO: Hold it!

374
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:57,838
Chew on this!

375
00:19:57,872 --> 00:19:58,974
-Ninja Art Kujaku.

376
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:02,883
NARUTO: Whoa!

377
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,450
Whoa!

378
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:09,464
You're not going anywhere!

379
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,109
Don't even think about it!

380
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,712
-Farewell.

381
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:17,681
-What is he doing?

382
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,929
That is it!

383
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:25,164
-Wait.

384
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:25,933
-Hey.

385
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:27,871
Let go of me, will you?

386
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:28,873
-Calm yourself.

387
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,677
That canyon is full
of poisonous gas.

388
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:37,458
-OK.

389
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,494
Maybe you've got a point.

390
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,741
-Without that mask, he would
have been dead in seconds.

391
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,243
-Darn it.

392
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,781
We almost had him.

393
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,719
-So that's our thief, huh?

394
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:50,520
-You got it.

395
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,826
100%.

396
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,732
NEJI: But why go so far as
to take Sumaru with him?

397
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:59,674
He already had the star,

398
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:02,013
-Someone tried to
steal it ten years ago.

399
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:05,052
This might be connected somehow.

400
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,790
Sumaru's parents
were guarding it,

401
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,562
and managed to fend
off the attack.

402
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:10,865
Only, they didn't make it.

403
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:11,389
-What?

NEJI: We need to search the
outskirts of the village again.

410
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,785
LEE: Leave it to me.

411
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,024
I have a new strategy
I have been working on.

412
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,159
TENTEN: Strategy?

413
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:12,166
LEE: Your Shadowing Ninjutsu
was not that reliable.

414
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,068
TENTEN: Excuse me?

415
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,237
NEJI: That's enough, you two.

416
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,872
Get going.

417
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:15,974
LEE: Right.

418
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:17,678
TENTEN: So, what's this
plan of yours anyway?

419
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:18,146
NARUTO: Yeah.

420
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,448
Let's hear it.

421
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,818
NEJI: Naruto, wait.

422
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:21,498
NARUTO: What is it?

423
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:23,567
Next time-- Hidden Jutsu.

424
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,402
The Price of the
Ninja Art Kujaku.
