00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,267
-This is a festival,
right ladies?

3
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,967
So let's get festive!

4
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,567
-Whoa there, fella.

5
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:06,767
You don't think you're
celebrating a little early?

6
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,634
-You handled it, didn't you?

7
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,234
-I did.

8
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:15,267
All the same, now that
the rain's letting up,

9
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,001
might as well cross
the finish line

10
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,034
and bring this farce to an end.

11
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,001
-Ha.

12
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:21,367
All right, all right.

13
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,867
Guess I'll go out
for a little run.

14
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,234
-All the way up there?

15
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,434
-Yep.

16
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,867
-That's pretty high.

17
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,834
How many steps are there anyway?

18
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,267
-I'm not really sure.

19
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,601
That's why they call these
stairs the Spirit Breaker.

20
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:58,501
-Heh.

21
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,467
They do, do they?

22
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,267
Piece of cake!

23
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,801
Just hang on!

24
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,767
Here we go!

25
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,001
-You're kidding.

26
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,701
How does he do it?

27
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,367
-Well, no one ever accused
that kid of not having energy.

28
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,567
MAN: Boss.

29
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:29,167
It seems that Idate's
headed this way after all.

30
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,001
-So he didn't run away.

31
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,534
You were right, boss.

32
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:37,001
-Of course I was.

33
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:41,367
I knew he had it in
him all the time.

34
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,334
Atta boy, Idate.

35
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,801
Keep coming.

36
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,001
You're almost there.

37
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,434
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A Fierce
Battle of Rolling Thunder!

38
00:03:59,034 --> 00:03:59,801
-Hey.

39
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,601
Just one thing.

40
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:02,601
-Huh?

41
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,867
I appreciate the
help, but don't think

42
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,867
this is gonna make me
trust you or anything.

43
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,134
-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

44
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,867
As if I cared.

45
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,634
-Hmph.

46
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,367
-You idiot!

47
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,601
You just said it yourself!

48
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,634
You still got one person
who believes in you, right?

49
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,334
-When you took the
Chunin exam, did they--

50
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,701
-Huh?

51
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:28,601
-What I mean is, was there a
tenth and final question that

52
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,134
came out of nowhere?

53
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,434
-Yeah.

54
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,434
It was weird, because the
whole point of the question

55
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:37,401
was whether you wanted
to answer it or not.

56
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,901
-Yeah.

57
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:44,234
Three years ago, I got
the same sort of question.

58
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,334
-All right.

59
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,601
Now for the 10th
and final question.

60
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:51,001
IDATE (VOICEOVER):
What could it be?

61
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:55,201
What could my big brother
have up his sleeve this time?

62
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,034
-This time, you're
not only competing

63
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,834
against all the
other Genin here,

64
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,934
but against the
rest of your squad.

65
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,801
[surprised whispering]

66
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,901
-That's right.

67
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,401
You're competing against
your own squadmates.

68
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:12,401
Whoever scores the lowest
in your squad will fail.

69
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,334
And the one who fails can never
again take the Chunin exams.

70
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,267
He or she remains
a Genin for life.

71
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:19,767
-What?

72
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:20,934
No way!

73
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,667
-To make us compete
against our own squad?

74
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,301
That goes against
every rule of--

75
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,567
-In here, I am the rules.

76
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,334
End of discussion.

77
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:34,001
If anyone wants to
withdraw, now's the time.

78
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:40,901
If you choose to withdraw, you
can try again later, right?

79
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:44,234
Of course, if one quits,
then all three squad members

80
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,001
will be disqualified.

81
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:50,201
However, you'll all still be
eligible to take the test again

82
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,167
in six months' time.

83
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,301
So then, what'll it be?

84
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,967
IDATE (VOICEOVER): A
one in three chance

85
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:00,501
of being thrown out for good.

86
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,101
I should be able
to beat those odds.

87
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,534
But still.

88
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,201
It means one of us is stuck
being a Genin for life.

89
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,401
MAN: Your comrades'
future versus your own.

90
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:20,601
A very tough decision
to have to make.

91
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,834
If it's too tough, quit now.

92
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:26,934
That's it?

93
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,367
Nobody else wants to leave?

94
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,234
All right then.

95
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,301
To you who've chosen to remain,
I have one thing to say.

96
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,901
You failed!

97
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,101
-What?

98
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:45,834
We've what?

99
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:46,467
-Failed?

100
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:47,801
What do you mean?

101
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,667
-You're penalizing us for
being confident enough to stay?

102
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,501
-So confident that
you'd sacrifice

103
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:55,167
the future of one
of your own squad.

104
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:58,534
None of you deserve
to become Chunin!

105
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,734
You're dismissed.

106
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,167
-Yeah, I see what you mean.

107
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,134
-So, what was the question
that he hit you guys with?

108
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,101
-Mm.

109
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,734
It's kinda hard to explain.

110
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:12,767
-Huh?

111
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,101
-It was complicated.

112
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,867
He explained it at the time,
but I didn't really get it.

113
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:20,434
-All I know is, I trusted
my brother and he failed me.

114
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,667
I trusted him, and it
ruined my life forever.

115
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,201
-Huh?

116
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,001
-I wasn't just gonna take it.

117
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:30,367
The least I could do was
make him explain himself.

118
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,534
-Ibiki, what was that all about?

119
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,401
-It was a classic double bluff.

120
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:39,967
A true shinobi would have seen
that and made the right choice.

121
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,901
-That was a dirty
trick, and you know it!

122
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,601
You taught us we're
supposed to accept

123
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,234
any challenge, no
matter the cost!

124
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:46,734
-Idate.

125
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,501
Is it really that hard
for you to accept?

126
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,401
-But the test, it--
it wasn't fair.

127
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,934
-I don't mean the test.

128
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,867
I mean that you'll
never be a ninja.

129
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:05,367
-If you're telling me I
have to quit, then I will.

130
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,134
But tell me why.

131
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,734
Why am I not good enough?

132
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,434
-Idate.

133
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,034
That is something you'll have
to figure out on your own.

134
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:20,501
-All this time, I still haven't
been able to figure it out.

135
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,534
-And that's when Aoi came
along and tricked you, right?

136
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,034
-That's right.

137
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:25,934
That's what he did.

138
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,167
-Unbelievable.

139
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,601
We made it.

140
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:35,501
-Right.

141
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:36,834
I'll take it the
rest of the way.

142
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,967
You can take a
break if you want.

143
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:39,901
-Huh?

144
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,434
Oh, now you don't
need me anymore?

145
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,701
-I have to do this.

146
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,767
I can't have you guys running
the whole race for me.

147
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,167
What's the point?

148
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:49,234
I have to win on my own two
feet, or else I haven't won.

149
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,034
-Hey, wait, Idate!

150
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,401
IDATE (VOICEOVER):
I can do this.

151
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:54,267
That medicine Sakura
gave me is working.

152
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,534
No.

153
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,801
No pain.

154
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:00,701
There's no pain.

155
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,367
Here we go.

156
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,034
I'm back in the race!

157
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,934
-I just have to cross this
bridge and I'm on O'uzu Island.

158
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,701
-Well then, get moving.

159
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,234
Idate's made it to the
Modoroki Shrine already.

160
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,067
-He what?

161
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,034
-Yes.

162
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,534
Looks like I may
have underestimated

163
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,101
that Genin a little bit.

164
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,301
-You incompetent--
didn't you tell me

165
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,401
you'd taken care of him?

166
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,601
-I thought I had.

167
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,934
But now's not the
time to discuss it.

168
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,834
Hurry up and cross the bridge.

169
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,067
-Some ninja.

170
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:45,734
You're worthless.

171
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,034
-Listen, you.

172
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,834
I'm here helping you
because I have to.

173
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,334
It's my duty.

174
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:58,034
But one more little crack like
that, I'll break you in half.

175
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:58,967
-OK.

176
00:09:59,001 --> 00:09:59,834
Sorry.

177
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,734
Sorry.

178
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,967
-That's better.

179
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:02,734
Now get moving.

180
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:03,234
-Right!

181
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,267
-There he is.

182
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,401
I've almost caught him.

183
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,201
-Well, well.

184
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,434
What a surprise.

185
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:23,034
I have to admit, I never
thought you'd make it this far.

186
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,434
IDATE (VOICEOVER): That's the
Blade of the Thunder Spirit.

187
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:37,767
What are you doing?

188
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:40,901
No!

189
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:41,467
Stop it!

190
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,001
Stop it!

191
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:47,101
-Why bother even trying?

192
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:49,901
No one on Earth is a match
for the Blade of the Thunder

193
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:53,401
Spirit, the sword wielded by
the Second Hokage himself.

194
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,667
But then, you know all
about it, don't you, idate?

195
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,801
After all, you're the one who
stole it and brought it to me.

196
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:05,467
-You snake.

197
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,334
-Mud balls, huh?

198
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,567
What is this, a
playground fight?

199
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,701
-Sorry, but I didn't have
any kunai knives on me.

200
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,067
-Naruto?

201
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:23,801
-You're gonna need
more than an umbrella

202
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,867
to catch the next
ball I throw at ya.

203
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:27,767
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

204
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:38,301
-He's focusing all his chakra
into the palm of his hand.

205
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,234
-Here I go!

206
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:46,621
Get ready!

207
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,591
One more time!

208
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,491
[laughter]

209
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,724
-This couldn't be all there
is to it, now could it?

210
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:12,591
-Ninja Art, Senbon Shower!

211
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,624
I should have told you.

212
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,857
The Blade of Thunder
Spirit can cut anything.

213
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,091
It even cuts through
chakra as it it were water.

214
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:25,624
-Run, Naruto!

215
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,257
-I don't want to
underestimate you again.

216
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,824
This time I'll make
absolutely certain.

217
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:36,057
-Come on, what are you doing
wasting your time on him?

218
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,657
Your fight's with me, remember?

219
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,057
-Still at it, eh?

220
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,524
How touching.

221
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:44,957
Defending each other,
looking out for each other.

222
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:45,857
Pathetic nonsense.

223
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:52,791
Only a weakling needs
to depend on others.

224
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,791
Trusting other people
to give him the strength

225
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,591
he hasn't got for himself.

226
00:12:56,624 --> 00:13:01,924
For a man like that, it's
always easiest to just run away.

227
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,824
Isn't that right, Idate?

228
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,691
I mean, isn't that what
you did after you stole

229
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,357
the Blade of the Thunder Spirit?

230
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:16,391
-There.

231
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:17,424
I can see it.

232
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:18,857
The Village Hidden in the Rain.

233
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:21,924
It's just up ahead.

234
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:22,424
-Aoi-sensei!

235
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:28,357
Aoi-sensei!

236
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,924
-Idate.

237
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,224
-Ibiki?

238
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:37,357
-Have you gone insane?

239
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,324
On your feet.

240
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,791
I'm taking you back
to the village.

241
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,557
-No!

242
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,091
-You little fool.

243
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,324
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

244
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:54,257
-You're always so strict, Ibiki.

245
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,957
Even towards your
poor little brother.

246
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,657
Actually, I'm glad
you showed up,

247
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,724
because you're just
the person I need.

248
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,357
-How?

249
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,657
What do you mean?

250
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:07,224
-The forbidden scroll can
only be decided by a Jonin.

251
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,491
So you see, both
brothers have a part

252
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,557
to play in betraying
the Leaf Village.

253
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,424
[groan]

254
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:22,824
[scream]

255
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:32,991
-Stop playing the hero, and just
tell me what the scroll says.

256
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,724
-Never.

257
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,891
-So you prefer death?

258
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:40,757
How about your brother?

259
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,757
-Whatever else he may
be, he's a shinobi.

260
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,624
He accepts death without fear.

261
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:51,757
-Oh, I have to disagree
with you, Ibiki.

262
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,024
Look at that face.

263
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,391
He's frightened half
out of his wits.

264
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:57,324
-No, don't kill me!

265
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,391
I've given up trying
to be a ninja!

266
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:00,057
I quit!

267
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:01,691
I don't want to die!

268
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,957
-Just decipher the scroll.

269
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,591
You don't really want to make
me kill your poor little brother

270
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:09,691
right before your eyes?

271
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,591
-What brother?

272
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,991
That coward?

273
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,491
-Ibiki--

274
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:18,324
-Doesn't matter to me
what you do to him.

275
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:19,057
Do what you want.

276
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:28,124
-So, loyalty to the village
above all things, eh?

277
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,757
You think you're
this great hero,

278
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,757
but in reality you're nothing
but a stupid pawn to them.

279
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,257
-Really?

280
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,457
Better a dead pawn
than a living traitor.

281
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,224
You're a sorry excuse for a man.

282
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,524
-I'll show you sorry!

283
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:51,224
[scream]

284
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:56,891
-Idate!

285
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:57,724
Get out of here.

286
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,591
Go on.

287
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,224
-What about you?

288
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,424
-I'll be along once
I've finished up here.

289
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,357
-Neither of you
is going anywhere!

290
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,157
-Ibiki!

291
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:16,657
-Go on!

292
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,191
Run!

293
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:17,824
-No!

294
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,391
I won't leave you!

295
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:20,424
-Get out!

296
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:21,991
You'll only be in my way here!

297
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,857
-You stay where you are.

298
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:28,657
-Get going!

299
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,024
-Incredible, isn't it?

300
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,191
That someone would
actually lay down his life

301
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,724
for the likes of you.

302
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,191
You could have hurried back to
the village and summoned help.

303
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,791
But that would have meant facing
up to your guilt, wouldn't it?

304
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,924
So instead you just ran away.

305
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,891
You didn't even have the
excuse that Ibiki was dead,

306
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:22,124
so there was nothing you could
do, because he was alive,

307
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,524
wasn't he?

308
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:26,457
-I have to give him credit
for that much, at least.

309
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,557
He not only survived the
torture and the fire,

310
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,557
but he even managed to get
back the forbidden scroll,

311
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:34,924
all without telling me
what I wanted to know.

312
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,257
What I really can't get
over is that he did it

313
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,491
all for your sake, his
worthless little brother.

314
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,357
Someone who betrayed his
own village, who's only ever

315
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:50,757
thought of himself.

316
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,724
Who trusts no one.

317
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,524
Not even your brother Ibiki.

318
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,324
Your own brother, who would
have given his life for you.

319
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:02,157
You don't even
trust him, do you?

320
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,624
You don't trust the
people in your own village

321
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:09,124
enough to go back to them
and admit what you've done.

322
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,457
You trust nobody.

323
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,757
And nobody trusts you.

324
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,457
You've learned
your lessons well.

325
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,324
I couldn't have asked
for a better student.

326
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,724
As a reward, Idate, I
will kill you quickly.

327
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,224
-Idate!

328
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,291
-Hey, guys!

329
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:33,057
Excellent timing.

330
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,691
-Don't sweat it, Naruto.

331
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:38,891
Just sit back and
leave this clown to me.

332
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,957
-This clown's tougher
than you think.

333
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:45,591
-It doesn't make any difference
how many of you there are.

334
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,591
You'll never defeat me.

335
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:50,291
I'm Aoi of the Rain,
and I wield the Blade

336
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,057
of the Thunder Spirit.

337
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,391
-Is that so?

338
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:56,591
Perfect.

339
00:18:56,624 --> 00:19:01,224
The Blade of the Thunder
Spirit against my Chidori.

340
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:02,324
All right.

341
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,324
Let's find out which
one of them is stronger!

342
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,357
-Heh.

343
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,624
I see that the stories are true.

344
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:23,357
I'd always heard that the
last of the great Uchiha clan

345
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:26,257
was a hopeless loser
unworthy of his family name.

346
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,357
-Sasuke!

347
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,791
-Run, Sakura!

348
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,391
He'll show no mercy!

349
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:37,657
He'll kill us all!

350
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,557
Get away while you still can!

351
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:40,457
-No way!

352
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:41,824
-What?

353
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,791
-We'll never abandon you.

354
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:46,191
We have sworn to protect you.

355
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,457
You can trust us, Idate.

356
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:49,557
-Yes.

357
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,224
Well, then, back to the
matter at hand-- Idate

358
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,757
and his little friend.

359
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:58,991
Time to start your
journey-- to the next world.

360
00:19:59,024 --> 00:19:59,857
-Take it back.

361
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,924
Take back what you said.

362
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:07,224
-What are you talking about?

363
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,257
-I'm warning you--
don't mess with me!

364
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,024
I'm Sasuke of the Leaf Village.

365
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:18,057
The last of the Uchiha!

366
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,891
[scream]

367
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,724
[scream]

368
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:54,124
-Sasuke!

369
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,557
Get up, Sasuke!

370
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,057
Hurry!

371
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,024
-It's a long way to
the bottom of the sea.

372
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:08,491
-No, leave him alone!

373
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:08,991
-Idate!

374
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:15,424
Sakura!

375
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,124
No, Sakura!

376

377
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,864
NARUTO: OK, so now what
are we supposed to do?

378
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,330
This guy and his thunder
sword, or whatever it is,

379
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:08,630
are more than a match for my
Rasengan and Sasuke's Chidori.

380
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,830
We've used up our
whole bag of tricks!

381
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:12,164
Oh, well.

382
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:13,930
We'll just have to come up with
some news ones, that's all.

383
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:15,564
'Cause there's no
way we're giving up.

384
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:17,997
We've gotta find a
way to beat this guy.

385
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,430
But how?

386
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,230
Next time, The Last Leg!

387
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,064
A Final Act of Desperation!
