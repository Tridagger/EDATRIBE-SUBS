00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,315
[theme song]

2
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:54,774
NARUTO: Unh.

3
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,648
Hey.

4
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,286
Perv, you awake?

5
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,056
One way to find out.

6
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,994
Hidden Finger jutsu.

7
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:10,937
1,000 years of death!

8
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:13,108
Man, he's totally out of it.

9
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,042
Some trainer.

10
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,281
He's pathetic.

11
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:17,182
OK, Frogman.

12
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,618
What was that all about?

13
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,588
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

14
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,933
-I'm glad you asked.

15
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,970
I'm the Hermit of Mount Myoboku.

16
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:30,908
The wise and immortal spirit.

17
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,943
That's right!

18
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:36,584
It is I, the Toad Mountain Sage!

19
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,788
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Long Time No See.

20
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:41,894
Jiraiya Returns!

21
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,629
-What?

22
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,965
Toad Sage?

23
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,566
-Exactly.

24
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:53,215
-Well, listen, you
pervy sage, what are you

25
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:54,451
going to do about this?

26
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,954
This guy is supposed
to be training me,

27
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:59,461
and you laid him out
flatter than a bath mat!

28
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:02,833
-Well, he shouldn't have
interfered with my research.

29
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,303
-Your research?

30
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,607
-You see, I'm a novelist.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,412
I am a writer of great
books, like this.

32
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:15,624
-Huh?

33
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:16,425
-Hm.

34
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,028
Hm-hm-hm-hm.

35
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,230
-What?

36
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,866
You wrote that?

37
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,501
-Yes!

38
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,104
I see you know it.

39
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,910
[chuckles] (THINKING) I'm famous
and it's not out in paperback

40
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:26,877
yet.

41
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,249
-You call that
pervy trash a novel?

42
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,151
Research.

43
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,686
Yeah, right.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,158
Just It excuse for you to peek
at girls in the bathhouse.

45
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:34,759
[screams]

46
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,096
-Ah!

47
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,466
Look at what you've done.

48
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:39,501
You ruined my peeking.

49
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,371
I mean my research.

50
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,707
-Dirty old man.

51
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:46,514
-You little-- there's
nothing dirty about it.

52
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,317
I happen to be a
serious artist who's

53
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:49,486
inspired by youth and beauty.

54
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,121
That's all.

55
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:50,856
And--

56
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:51,357
-Yeah.

57
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,325
Whatever.

58
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,928
Like anyone believes that.

59
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,130
Who cares anyway?

60
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,900
What about my training?

61
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:57,835
-Hm?

62
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:58,871
Your training?

63
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,407
You mean the Walking
On Water technique

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,343
you were having so
much trouble with?

65
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:03,946
-You can do it?

66
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,318
OK, then it's up to
you to teach it to me.

67
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,221
You at least owe me that,

68
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,123
-Huh!

69
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:10,158
Stop bothering me, kid.

70
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,059
I'm busy.

71
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:11,861
-Um!

72
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:12,730
Hey, wait!

73
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,466
Come back here, you pervy sage.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,436
Where's your sense
of responsibility?

75
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:18,240
You've got to train me.

76
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:19,876
-Not on your life!

77
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,546
I can't work with
someone who has

78
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,817
no respect for a true artist.

79
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,852
-Nunh.

80
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,424
TOAD SAGE: Besides,
I don't like kids.

81
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:31,131
-Uh, actually, I thought your
book, "Make-out Paradise", was,

82
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:34,603
uh, really well-written, and
interesting, and informative.

83
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:35,772
TOAD SAGE: Liar.

84
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,075
The purchase and
reading of that book

85
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,581
is prohibited for anyone
under the age of 18.

86
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,716
NARUTO: Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,086
But the reviews I
read were great!

88
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,290
-Do you really think
that's going to work on me?

89
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:46,592
What do you take
a for, an idiot?

90
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,496
I'm a goddamn sage!

91
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,066
Save your breath, kid.

92
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,270
You can't butter me up.

93
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,205
-OK!

94
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:53,873
You're right.

95
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:54,374
Sorry.

96
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,241
But wait.

97
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,014
You can't-- ah awh.

98
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:02,555
TOAD SAGE: [laughs] So
long, and good luck!

99
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,458
-That was cool!

100
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:06,596
I don't care if he
is a dirty old man.

101
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,199
That guy's the real deal!

102
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,779
NARUTO: Hey!

103
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,218
Pervy sage, where are you?

104
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,227
Where'd he disappear to?

105
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,335
[panicked scream]

106
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,002
TOAD SAGE: No!

107
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,437
No!

108
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,171
Wait!

109
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:29,805
[loud slap]

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,206
A-huh.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,841
Ooh.

112
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:31,943
[crash]

113
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:32,845
YOUNG WOMAN: What do
you think you're doing,

114
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:34,181
you disgusting old man?

115
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,352
-I'm sorry, but you have
such a beautiful pair

116
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,556
of soft and lovely, uh, hands!

117
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,693
You really do have
beautiful hands.

118
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:42,263
How do you keep them so soft?

119
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,331
YOUNG WOMAN: Filthy beast!

120
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:44,099
[loud slap]

121
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,201
TOAD SAGE: Ow!

122
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,470
So much for soft hands.

123
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,540
Sheesh.

124
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:49,609
-What was I thinking?

125
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,145
This guy's really pathetic.

126
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,850
He's even pervier
than my last trainer.

127
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:57,624
But it's not like
I have much choice.

128
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,826
TOAD SAGE: Hmm.

129
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,462
Looks like the
women in this town

130
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,533
are no friendlier than before.

131
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,470
Still, I like them feisty!

132
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:05,739
[chuckles pervily]

133
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,475
NARUTO: So you've
been here before, huh?

134
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,078
-Huh?

135
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:10,281
You again?

136
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,452
-I'm surprised they don't
make you wear a leash.

137
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,055
You old pervert!

138
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:14,455
-Shh!

139
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,056
Shh!

140
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,058
Shh!

141
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,160
You know, I really
wish you wouldn't

142
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,129
use the word "pervert."

143
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,765
-Oh, yeah! (LOUDLY)
Well, tell me

144
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:20,934
how you like the word "joke."

145
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,671
Because that's you are, mister.

146
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,073
A joke!

147
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:26,545
First I get stuck with a
closet perv, and now, oh,

148
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,882
why can't I get a
trainer that-- ah!

149
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:33,458
-Oh, put a lid on it, will you?

150
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:34,860
There you go, kid.

151
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:37,398
You can train in
there for a while.

152
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,367
[laughs]

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,369
NARUTO (MUFFLED ): Hey!

154
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,537
Hey!

155
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,340
Let me out of
here, you old toad!

156
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:54,463
-Ah, what I'd give
for just a few minutes

157
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,965
with a young, pretty girl.

158
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,053
[imagines female laughter]

159
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,242
[laughs pervily]

160
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,010
Ah.

161
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,012
Ah!

162
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:21,580
What?

163
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:22,381
What i-- what?

164
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:23,116
Ow!

165
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,051
NARUTO: Unh!

166
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:27,524
You can't get rid
of me that easy!

167
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,061
Well, what do you know?

168
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:30,964
A substitution jutsu.

169
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,633
Not bad, old man.

170
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,145
-That was close.

171
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,482
Ah!

172
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:42,919
[chuckles] Little squirt!

173
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,790
He'll have to be a
lot smarter than that

174
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:48,162
to outfox the Toad
Mountain Sage.

175
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:48,830
-Oh, yeah?

176
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:50,166
How am I doing now?

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,567
-Ah.

178
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,408
OK.

179
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,545
I'll admit you're not
totally without talent.

180
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,949
-So does that mean you'll
help me with my training?

181
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:00,820
-Not so fast, squirt.

182
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:02,889
It's a question of quid pro quo.

183
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,960
I'll give you what you
want, but in return, you

184
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:06,997
have to try and
get me what I want.

185
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,367
-So what do you want?

186
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,671
--[chuckles pervily]
You must know by now.

187
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:14,311
I like them ripe and luscious,
with curves like that, see?

188
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,950
And big, but not too
big, know what I mean?

189
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,452
If you bring me
something like that,

190
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:20,456
I will train you 'til
the cows come home!

191
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:21,291
-You will?

192
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,225
No lie?

193
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,429
-The Toad Mountain
Sage never lies!

194
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,365
-You got it!

195
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:26,267
Wait here.

196
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,441
-Hm?

197
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,444
(YELLING) Ah ha!

198
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:37,521
Uh um.

199
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:38,956
Too bad, kid.

200
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,697
It's not like we had
a contract, really.

201
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,865
Oh, ladies!

202
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,736
Can you show me the
way to town, uh?

203
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:53,651
Then I said, not with
my rice bowl, you don't.

204
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:55,554
[laughs]

205
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:56,523
[girls laugh]

206
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:57,358
[toad sage catches breath]

207
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,760
-That's a pretty funny story.

208
00:08:58,793 --> 00:08:59,929
-(CHUCKLING) It's funny, yes.

209
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,232
But it's not just a story.

210
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,835
Every word of it is true.

211
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:03,702
-Really?

212
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,838
What happened next?

213
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:08,010
NARUTO: Hey, pervy
sage I'm back!

214
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:08,912
-What? [giggles]

215
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:10,181
-Did he call you pervy?

216
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:11,851
-(IRRITATED)
Worthless little runt!

217
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,222
I told you not to call me that.

218
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,226
-Look, I got you one,
just the way you like 'em!

219
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,666
A ripe and luscious
one with curves!

220
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,805
-[stutters with anger] (IRATE)
That's not what I meant,

221
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:23,506
you moron!

222
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,987
-(LAUGHING) Ah, yeah!

223
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,523
Talk about ripe and juicy!

224
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,625
-Dig in.

225
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,696
We might as well not
let it all go to waste.

226
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,597
-Mm-hm.

227
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,233
That's so true! [laughs]

228
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,235
TOAD SAGE: The ladies!

229
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,938
What happened to the ladies?

230
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:41,539
Oh!

231
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,416
-[burps loudly] Ah.

232
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:47,083
Man.

233
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:49,387
That was the best.

234
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,757
-(SADLY) Struck out again.

235
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,432
-(THINKING) No doubt about it.

236
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,671
It has to be!

237
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,942
-Ah, now I must be off.

238
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,513
I've wasted too
much time already.

239
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:04,315
-Uh, hey!

240
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,784
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:06,719
Where are you going?

242
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,056
What about my training?

243
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,391
We had a deal!

244
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,763
-I don't give a flying
fish for your training.

245
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:13,967
I have my research to conduct!

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,801
-Hmp!

247
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,071
Research, my butt!

248
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,539
It's not like I don't
have better things

249
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,344
to do than hang around with
a pervy old coot like you.

250
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,783
I've got to train until
I'm stronger than anyone,

251
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,087
because I've got to
pass the Chunin exams.

252
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,962
And then, someday,
I'm going be Hokage!

253
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,898
-Huh!

254
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,434
That's a good one.

255
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,970
Tell me, did you fall on your
head when you were a baby?

256
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,339
Is that what makes you this way?

257
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:37,276
Now I know you're
wasting my time.

258
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,412
That's not enough.

259
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,048
I need to get on
with my research.

260
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,584
And for that, I
need a lovely lady.

261
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:44,924
No fruits, no
vegetables, but a lady!

262
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,493
-A lady?

263
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,831
Oh, if that's what you wanted,
why didn't you just say so?

264
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,267
No problem.

265
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,440
[knuckles cracking]

266
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:55,444
Ha!

267
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:56,245
Ah.

268
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,850
[giggling]

269
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,419
-Nuh!

270
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:00,820
-Unh!

271
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:01,421
Ah!

272
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,676
-Uh-uh-uh ah-ah-ah!

273
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:24,598
[whimpers incoherently] Hubba
hubba hubba hubba hubba.

274
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:28,505
-If you keep staring like
that, I'm going to blush.

275
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:32,946
-[mumbling incoherently]

276
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:33,881
-[giggles]

277
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:38,289
-You're so, so lovely.

278
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,926
We got a winner!

279
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,032
A perfect ten!

280
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:43,766
-(THINKING) Duh.

281
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,835
Pathetic!

282
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,005
-She's just my type.

283
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,209
I really, really like her.

284
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,345
How did you do it?

285
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,115
Where on earth
did she come from?

286
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:52,816
-Oh.

287
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,517
No biggie.

288
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,655
I call it my Sexy jutsu.

289
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:56,289
-Yeah!

290
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,291
I love it.

291
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:58,627
You're a genius, kid.

292
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,029
This is one amazing technique!

293
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,366
-(THINKING) Yeah.

294
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,269
She seem to have effect
on a lot of older guys.

295
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:03,971
-Yeah.

296
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:04,672
So, uhm--

297
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,774
-So?

298
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,076
You'll help me with my
training now, right?

299
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,044
TOAD SAGE: You bet!

300
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,749
But only on one condition.

301
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:11,350
-Huh?

302
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,920
One condition?

303
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,691
Uh, what is it?

304
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:26,846
-Ah, [pervy laughter] uh, uh,
[laughter] I'll do it if you

305
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,686
promise to stay like
that the whole time.

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,023
-Ooh!

307
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:33,926
(YELLING) I was right!

308
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,028
You are pathetic.

309
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,232
You're nothing but a
lousy little pervert!

310
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:39,870
-(ANGRILY) I am not
a little pervert!

311
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:40,672
-Oh, yeah?

312
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,107
Then tell me, what are you?

313
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:42,743
-Na-ha-ha-ha!

314
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,085
I'm a big one.

315
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,120
-Oh.

316
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:50,156
Great.

317
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,924
That makes all the difference.

318
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:00,883
-OK.

319
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,186
We'll just pretend
none of that happened.

320
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:03,789
Now let's begin your training.

321
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,725
-And you really
mean it this time?

322
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,698
-A sage always
means what he says.

323
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,069
Now, go ahead and
show me that technique

324
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:13,273
you were working on before.

325
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:14,175
-OK.

326
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:14,776
Uh.

327
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,354
Here goes.

328
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:21,956
Hmph!

329
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:35,147
Ah uh, dih huh, nuh hut.

330
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,550
Mm, eh.

331
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:44,297
Huh nuh eh unh ya gah!

332
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:44,898
-Hm.

333
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:51,244
[laughs]

334
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,246
-Uh.

335
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,248
Not again.

336
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:00,193
-(LAUGHING) You really
do need help, don't you?

337
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:01,596
-Eh!

338
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:03,833
I should know by now to
take my clothes off first.

339
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:04,935
-Hey!

340
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,505
Go on and build your
chakra one more time.

341
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,275
-Can't I dry off a little first?

342
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:09,243
-Now!

343
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:11,181
Do it.

344
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:11,782
Hmph!

345
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,527
-Hmm.

346
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:19,496
Wha--?

347
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,130
Amazing!

348
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,600
-Huh?

349
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:24,939
-You know, you have quite
a tight sexy little body.

350
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:25,774
-Eh!

351
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,677
What the-- do you mind, old man?

352
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,748
I'm trying to concentrate here!

353
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:30,382
-Oh.

354
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:31,519
Sorry about that.

355
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:32,621
Please, go right ahead.

356
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,355
-Unh, jerk!

357
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:42,805
-Hm?

358
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,600
(THINKING) So this
is the formula

359
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,372
used to imprison
the nine-tailed fox.

360
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:04,446
A double tetragram seal
with an eight-signed seal.

361
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,682
Huh.

362
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,318
That way, if any of
the demon's chakra

363
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,256
escapes the tetragram seal,
it will be safely channeled

364
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,665
into, and suppressed by,
the boy's own chakra.

365
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,768
The Fourth Hokage.

366
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,940
He did this for
boy's protection.

367
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,986
But since then, a five-pronged
seal has been added.

368
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,091
An odd-numbered seal on
top of an even-numbered?

369
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,628
Hmm.

370
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,097
That explains it.

371
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,435
That's why the boy's
chakra and the demons

372
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,405
are merging in an unstable way.

373
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,613
It's no wonder he can't
control his chakra very well.

374
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:45,656
-[laughing] Cut it out.

375
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:46,558
What are you doing?

376
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:48,127
That tickles! [giggles]

377
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:48,762
-Oh!

378
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,665
Sorry about that.

379
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,437
(THINKING) This is the
work of someone else.

380
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:55,708
The formula is crude.

381
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,779
If I to guess, I'd
say it was Orochimaru.

382
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:07,129
OK.

383
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:08,532
Raise your arms up
high over your head.

384
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,433
-Huh?

385
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:10,468
-It's a trust exercise.

386
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,237
Come on!

387
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,971
Raise them high!

388
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:17,548
-(THINKING) Well, this is
a weird way to get started.

389
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,729
-Five Pronged Seal, release!

390
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:25,330
-Ah!

391
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:29,303
Uh-hoo-ah.

392
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,064
[coughs] Uh.

393
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,669
What the heck was that for?

394
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,005
-What?

395
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,610
Just pushing a pressure
point to loosen you up.

396
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,979
Now, go on.

397
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,450
Try walking on the water again.

398
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,554
-Uh, unh, oh.

399
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:03,333
Ah!

400
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:03,901
Whoa!

401
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:04,402
That's weird.

402
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:12,450
[laughing]

403
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,786
Look at that!

404
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,687
I'm doing it.

405
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,324
Just don't ask me how.

406
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,492
Yahoo! [laughing]

407
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,561
Look at me.

408
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:19,764
No problem.

409
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:20,966
Piece of cake!
[laughs] This is fun.

410
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,168
-(THINKING) Hah.

411
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,072
I think It's about
time to teach him

412
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,642
how to control the fox's chakra.

413
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:26,744
-Look, I'm really doing it.

414
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:27,345
Woohoo!

415
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:27,912
-OK.

416
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:28,513
Out of the pool.

417
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,214
-Hm?

418
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,316
-Come on in.

419
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,886
I'm going to teach you
a killer technique.

420
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,189
-You are?

421
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:34,524
Really?

422
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,394
You mean like something really
powerful and destructive?

423
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,849
-Now, then, there's something
you need to understand, kid,

424
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,287
before we go any further.

425
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,257
I don't think you're
even aware of it,

426
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,463
but you possess two
chakras within you.

427
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:56,399
-Huh?

428
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:57,534
Two chakras?

429
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,504
TOAD SAGE: Haven't you
ever felt the presence

430
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,574
of a different chakra?

431
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,311
-Well, I'm not sure.

432
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:03,712
Hmm.

433
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:09,222
Oh, wait!

434
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,263
I do kind of remember
there was this one time.

435
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:16,369
It was like, all of a sudden,
I had this weird upsurge

436
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:19,107
of power, and I didn't
know where it came from.

437
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,779
I don't remember
when it was exactly.

438
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,050
I almost thought it was a dream.

439
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,586
-So I see.

440
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,923
NARUTO: But I do remember
feeling that this was something

441
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,294
different than my usual chakra.

442
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:37,140
My normal chakra, well, if
it was a color, it'd be blue,

443
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,545
but this was red!

444
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,346
-I see.

445
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:53,838
OK.

446
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,541
That's enough
training for today.

447
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:56,510
-What, already?

448
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,547
What about that
killer technique?

449
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,315
Come on.

450
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,350
I'm just getting started.

451
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:01,653
Let's go!

452
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:04,625
-In training as in cooking,
a watched pot never boils.

453
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:07,463
Now let's go back to town
and have a real bath,

454
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,600
not one where you
just fall in, OK?

455
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,761
-Ah.

456
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:27,534
This is better than falling in.

457
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,770
-Ah!

458
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:32,643
Nothing beats relaxing after
a long day of training.

459
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,413
-Hey, hey, pervy sage.

460
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,350
So tell me about this
killer technique.

461
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,588
-Tomorrow is soon enough.

462
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:39,857
-Ah, cheapskate.

463
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:51,144
[toad croaks]

464
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,580
-We'd better get
out soon, or we're

465
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:55,486
going to be stuck with
a giant boiled toad.

466
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,890
[both laugh]

467
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,672
TOAD SAGE: Sorry, Ebisu.

468
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:27,545
It wasn't my plan to steal
your student from you.

469
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:28,948
-Oh.

470
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,985
That's of little importance.

471
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,157
Lord Hokage has had his ninjas
searching for you everywhere.

472
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,163
We were just beginning to think
that you would never be found,

473
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:41,204
then you turn up here of all
places, right in front of me.

474
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:43,374
He will be pleased.

475
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,314
-Have you told the
Hokage you found me yet?

476
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,482
EBISU: No.

477
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:48,919
Not yet.

478
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,154
-Very good.

479
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,456
It's better that way.

480
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,593
-You're after
Orochimaru, aren't you?

481
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,032
-No, unfortunately, I
can't say that I am.

482
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:57,167
Sorry.

483
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,336
-Huh?

484
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,739
-The only thing
that brought me here

485
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,243
was the chance of doing
some research for a book.

486
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:05,883
I have no desire to get involved
in any of that other business.

487
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:06,785
-What do you mean?

488
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:07,987
You can't be serious!

489
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,060
You know better than
anyone there's only one way

490
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,528
to deal with Orochimaru.

491
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,634
He's one of the Sannin,
the legendary Three Ninja,

492
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,674
and he can only be stopped by
the power of another Sannin.

493
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:20,510
Your power, Master Jiraiya!

494
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:32,058
[closing theme song]

495
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,893
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Reading weird old scrolls,

496
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:07,034
signing contracts in blood,
memorizing the Inu I Tori Saru

497
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:11,509
Hitsuji seal, or is that
the bird, monkey, dog-- ah.

498
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,813
It's complicated,
and it sure isn't

499
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:15,116
like any training I'm used to.

500
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:19,490
But if it helps me get
to be Hokage, who cares?

501
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,162
Whatever works,
that's what I say.

502
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:26,089
Next time, "The Summoning
Jutsu, Wisdom of the Toad Sage".

503
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:30,756
I'll learn how to croak
like a toad if it'll help.
