00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:43,572
NARUTO: He's late.

5
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,851
Hm.

6
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,020
Hm.

SAKURA: Naruto!

8
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,056
Just sit down!

00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,524
-I don't want to.

10
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,862
How come our teacher's
the only one that's late?

11
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:00,662
I'm ready to roll.

12
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:01,864
Believe it.

13
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,833
The other group's already
met their new teachers

14
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,070
and took off on some
adventure or something,

15
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:08,205
and Iruka Sensei's gone, too.

16
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,876
-We know, OK?

17
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:11,743
Hey!

18
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,681
What are you doing?

[laughing]

20
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,220
Naruto!

21
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,257
-That's what he gets
for coming late.

22
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:21,857
Surprise!

23
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,032
-You're asking for trouble.

24
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,135
You know you shouldn't do that.

-Psh!

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,507
I love stuff like this.

-Huh.

28
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,143
Our teacher's a
Jonin-- an elite ninja.

29
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:37,678
You think he'd fall for that?

30
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:38,246
-Yeah.

31
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,247
Sasuke's right.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,649
You're so clueless, Naruto.

00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,234
-I'm sorry, Sensei.

38
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,137
I told him not to do it,
but he wouldn't listen.

39
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,105
I'd never do anything like that.

40
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,709
-Perfect shot!

41
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:03,347
-He actually fell
for that cheap trick.

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,015
Is this guy really a Jonin?

43
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,087
-Hmm.

44
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,291
How can I put this?

45
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,928
My first impression
of this group-- you're

46
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:15,796
a bunch of idiots.

KAKASHI: All right.

50
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:31,450
Why don't you introduce
yourself one at a time?

51
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:33,487
SAKURA: Introduce ourselves?

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,324
Well, what are we
supposed to say?

53
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,793
-Things you like.

54
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,295
Things you hate.

55
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,330
Dreams for the future.

56
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:42,466
Hobbies.

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,201
Things like that.

58
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:45,870
-Why don't you tell
us stuff first?

59
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,907
I mean, before we talk,
tell us about you,

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,676
so we can see how
it's supposed to work.

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,545
-Me?

62
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:54,282
I'm Kakashi Hatake.

Things I like and
things I hate--

00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:00,156
I don't feel like
telling you that.

00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,725
-Huh?

66
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:05,864
-My dreams for the future--
never really thought about it.

67
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,401
As for my hobbies-- I
have lots of hobbies.

68
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:10,738
-That was totally useless.

69
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,074
All he really told
us was his name.

70
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:14,308
-Uh huh.

71
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,011
-OK, your turn.

00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,781
You on the right-- you first.

73
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:19,516
-Believe it.

74
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,351
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

75
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:24,221
I like instant Ramen
in a cup, and I really

76
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,158
like the Ramen
Iruka Sensei got me

77
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:27,926
at the [inaudible] noodle shop.

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,629
But I hate the three
minutes you have

79
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,966
to wait after you pour the
water in the Ramen cup.

80
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,001
My hobby is eating
different kinds of Ramen

81
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,404
and comparing them.

82
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:39,076
And my future dream is to
be the greatest Hokage.

83
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,379
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

84
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:45,650
and start treating me like I'm
somebody-- somebody important.

up in a very interesting way.

a dream because I

will make it a reality.

and destroy a certain someone.

00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,680
Uh, I hope he doesn't mean me.

113
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,023
Good.

114
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,459
You're each unique, and
you have your own ideas.

00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,862
We'll have our first
mission tomorrow

116

-(HAPPILY) Uh, what kind of
mission are we going to have?

117
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:16,339
-It's a task the four
of us will do together.

118
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:16,974
-What?

119
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:17,441
What?

120
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,042
What?

121
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,312
What?

122
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,280
-A survival exercise.

-Huh?

124
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,751
Survival exercise?

-I thought we were supposed
to have a real mission, not

We already did this
stuff at the Academy.

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,127
That's how we got here.

129
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,263
KAKASHI: This is not like
your previous training.

130
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:38,603
-So, uh-- so, uh, what kind
of training is it then?

-Hey, hold on.

00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,450
That's a normal question.

00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,018
What's so funny?

135
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:55,092
-Well, if I tell you the answer,
you're not going to like it.

-Huh?

137
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,097
-Of the 27 graduates
who just came here,

138
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,068
only nine will actually
be accepted as Genin.

139
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:06,239
The other 18 will be weeded out
and sent back to the Academy.

140
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:09,310
In other words, this is a make
it or break it-- pass, fail

141
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:13,049
test, and the chance that
you'll fail is at least 66%.

142
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,988
See?

143
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,458
Didn't I tell you
you wouldn't like it?

144
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:20,559
-That's crazy!

145
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,362
We worked hard to get here.

146
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:23,563
Believe it!

00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:26,301
What was that graduation
test for anyway?

KAKASHI: Oh, that.

149
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,804
That was just to
select candidates

150
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:31,308
who might become Genin-- or not.

151
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,276
-(SURPRISED) What?

152
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,778
KAKASHI: That's how it is.

153
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:37,782
I decide whether
you pass or fail.

154
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:40,854
Be at the designated
training spot at 5:00 AM,

155
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:43,624
and bring your ninja gear.

look up to me some day.

00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,568
I've got to pass this test.

00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,368
Believe it.

161
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,871
Believe it.

00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:57,208
-(VOICEOVER) If I fail, I'll
be separated from Sasuke.

This is a trial of love.

-That's it.

165
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,955
You're dismissed.

breakfast, or else you'll puke.

-Your assignment is very simple.

186
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:20,621
You just have to take
these bells from me.

187
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,858
That's all there is to it.

188
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,292
[bells ringing]

189
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,763
If you can't get them by
noon, you go without lunch.

190
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:28,030
[naruto screaming]

191
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,333
You'll be tied to
those posts, and you'll

192
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:32,136
watch while I eat my
lunch in front of you.

193
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,072
-(VOICEOVER) So that's why.

194
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:37,377
-(VOICEOVER) He told us not to
eat breakfast to make it harder

195
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,943
on us.

196
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,380
Wait a minute!

197
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,214
There's three of us.

198
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,516
How come there's only two bells?

199
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,118
[laughing]

200
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:45,254
-Well, that way, at least one of
you will end up tied to a post

201
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:47,557
and ultimately
disqualified for failing

202
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,193
to complete the mission.

203
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,529
That one goes back
to the Academy.

204
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:52,931
[growling]

205
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:56,268
Then again, all three of
you could flunk out, too.

206
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,806
You can use any weapons,
including shuriken.

207
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,975
If you're not
prepared to kill me,

208
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,045
you won't be able
to take the bells.

209
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,249
-Those weapons are
too dangerous, Sensei.

210
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,518
[laughing]

211
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,321
-Especially since you couldn't
even dodge that eraser.

212
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,123
-Class clowns are usually
the weakest links.

213
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:15,829
You can safely ignore them--
lowest scores, losers.

214
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:16,896
[groaning]

215
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,667
When I say start, you can begin.

[growling]

217
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,109
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Losers.

218
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:26,876
Losers.

219
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,446
Losers.

-Don't be in such a hurry.

223
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,864
I didn't say start yet.

224
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:43,667
[groaning]

225
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,643
-(VOICEOVER) He's so fast,
I didn't even see it.

226
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,146
-(VOICEOVER) So this is a Jonin.

227
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,718
-But you came at me with the
full intention of destroying

228
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,388
me, so--

229
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,054
[groaning]

230
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,356
How can I say this?

231
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,626
I'm actually starting
to like you guys.

232
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,266
Get ready.

233
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,168
And-- start.

234
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,047
-Iruka, what did you
wish to see me about?

235
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,783
I don't think you
came here merely

236
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:23,252
to drink tea with me
and chat, did you?

237
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:26,758
-Naruto's been assigned
to Squad Seven.

238
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,693
The Jonin in charge
of that group--

239
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:32,031
just how tough a trainer is he?

240
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:33,700
-Kakashi, you mean.

241
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,270
You are concerned about him?

242
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,405
-I am.

243
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,576
I heard a rumor about
his training methods.

244
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:41,177
-Hm.

245
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:48,420
-What's this?

246
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,257
-All the trainees who've
ever been assigned to him--

247
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,493
those who passed and
those who failed.

248
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,229

249
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,169
-May I?

250
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,404
Huh?

251
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,108
Huh.

252
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,309
This-- this is--

253
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:10,750
KAKASHI: Ninja must know how
to conceal their movements

254
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:11,685
and hide effectively.

255
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,492
[music playing]

256
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:22,131
Well, they understand that much.

257
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,235
They've hidden well.

258
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,804
Huh?

259
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:26,905
-You and me!

260
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:27,839
Right now!

261
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,774
Fair and square!

262
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,243
Let's go!

263
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,544
-Hm?

264
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:33,380
-Fool.

265
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:34,950
-You know, compared
to the others,

266
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,651
you're a little bit weird.

267
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:37,953
-Oh yeah?

268
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:40,056
The only thing weird
here is your haircut.

00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:56,044

Taijutsu-- the physical art.

00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,618
-Uh!

273
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,020
(VOICEOVER) Taijutsu--
that's hand-to-hand combat!

274
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:06,392
Then why is he
reaching for a weapon?

275
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,173
-Huh.

276
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,070
-What the?

-What are you waiting for?

00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,140
Make your move.

00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:22,113
-But-- I mean, why are
you reading that book?

280
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:23,647
-Why?

281
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,752
To find out what happens
in the story, of course.

282
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,021
Don't let it bother you.

283
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,455
With your weak attacks,
it doesn't really

284
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,926
matter if I'm
reading or whatever.

Is that the sign of the tiger?

00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:58,528
That's dangerous!

296
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:01,298
He could destroy
Naruto with that.

297
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:04,469
-(VOICEOVER) That hand
sign is for a fire jutsu.

298
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:06,172
He's not just
toying with Naruto.

299
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,774
He's going to demolish him.

00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:10,144
Get out of there quick!

He's going to destroy you!

-That wasn't a hand sign at all.

311
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,535
He just poked him.

-(VOICEOVER) That must
be against the rules.

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,161
He's a Jonin.

00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:51,099
We can't possibly

This is even worse

MAN: Kakashi's test may be a bit
more difficult than the others.

-A bit more difficult?

328
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:25,111
Not a single student has
ever passed his test.

329
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:26,280
-That's true.

330
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,648
They all tried,
but not one of them

331
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,985
could live up to
Kakashi's standards.

332
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,823
So they were all eliminated.

-(ANGRILY) I know.

I know.

You told us already!

KAKASHI: You look pretty
wobbly for someone

I didn't even have
dinner last night.

347
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,301
Really bad idea to go on a diet.

348
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,103
-So, you caught me off guard.

349
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:09,305
That's all it was.

350
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,240
Believe it.

351
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:13,543
I'm so hungry I don't
have any strength.

352
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:15,113
But I can't let that stop me.

353
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,548
I've got to get one of
those bells no matter what.

354
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,819
I'll find the strength somehow.

Believe it.

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,423
I'm going to pass
this test, and I'm not

00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,734

-(YELLING) You're
overconfident, Sensei.

00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:55,132
They're not images.

367
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,101
They're real.

368
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,970
How could he do that?

369
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,777
-Hm.

370
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,478
[yelling]

371
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,582
It look like the
stories are true.

372
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:09,952
He can create shadow clones.

373
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:14,426
-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you.

374
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,828
-Show me what you can
do, nine-tail fox!

375
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:25,106
-(VOICEOVER) Those
aren't just illusions.

376
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,310
They're solid clones.

377
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:30,880
He's mastered an
extremely advanced jutsu.

378
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,482
-(VOICEOVER) It's
a forbidden skill,

379
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,923
and he defeated Mizuki with it.

380
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,190
Great technique.

381
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,461
But I don't think you can
maintain it for very long.

382
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,464
You talk like you're
the best, Naruto,

383
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,669
but you're still
the worst student.

384
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:50,506
You can't beat me
with this jutsu.

385
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,508
[bell ringing]

386
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,044
(VOICEOVER) What?

387
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,214
He got me from behind.

388
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,217
Huh?

389
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:58,918
-Oh.

390
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,121
[laughing]

391
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:03,524
-Didn't you say don't let
your enemies get behind you?

392
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,426
Good advice, Sensei.

393
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,495
Believe it.

394
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,831
I had one of my clones
come out of the river,

395
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:13,072
then sneak up behind
you super quiet.

396
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:15,707
Now, this is for nailing
me in the butt earlier!

397
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,011
-(VOICEOVER) When did
Naruto get so cool?

398
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:21,815
-(VOICEOVER) A
diversionary tactic , nice.

399
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:22,851
[yelling]

400
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,889
-You're mine, and
so are those bells!

401
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:30,861
[groaning]

402
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,832
[groaning]

403
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:34,606
-Huh?

404
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,176
SAKURA: He's holding himself.

405
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,916
Naruto punched Naruto.

406
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,252
[groaning]

407
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,986
-Ouch!

408
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,955
It's you!

409
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,426
You're Kakashi
Sensei, aren't you?

410
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,863
You transformed into
me using a jutsu!

411
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:57,631
You are!

412
00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:58,798
You're Kakashi Sensei!

413
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,333
You are!

414
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,668
Believe it.

415
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:01,970
You smell like an old
man, you must be him!

416
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:02,704
No, you are!

417
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:04,173
You're Kakashi Sensei!

418
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:05,241
No, you are!

419
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,143
Hey!

420
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,177
Let's undo the jutsu!

421
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,111
Yeah, that's it!

422
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,480
Believe it.

423
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:12,117
Then there will just be two of
us, so we'll know who's who.

424
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,086
Should have thought
of that sooner, fool.

425
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,888
You're the jerk.

426
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,422
Why didn't you think of it?

427
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,924
Just undo the jutsu!

428
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:21,997
Ow.

429
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,205
-(VOICEOVER) Naruto,
you are so not cool.

430
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:30,609
-(VOICEOVER) He got you
with a replacement jutsu.

431
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:32,010
Loser.

432
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:34,681
With this jutsu, you
quickly switch your own body

433
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,884
with an object, so
your enemy thinks

434
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,620
he's attacking you when he's
actually attacking a log

435
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:42,959
or rock, leaving him
open to a counterattack.

436
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:46,230
In this case, the Jonin let
himself get caught, then

437
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,599
switched bodies with one
of the Naruto clones.

438
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:50,836
So Naruto thought
he was nailing him,

439
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,107
but actually he was
just attacking himself.

440
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,543
And that Jonin was
so smooth, he made

441
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:59,347
Naruto look like a total moron.

442
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,049
[groaning]

443
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,986
-Hm?

444
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,756
A bell?

445
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,226
I must have got to
him with my attack.

446
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,128
He dropped a bell!

447
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:13,233
[laughing]

448
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,269
[screaming]

449
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:16,170
Hey!

450
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:16,703
Hey!

451
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,105
Let me down!

452
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,107
What is this?

453
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,410
-(VOICEOVER) Of
course it was a trap.

454
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,745
NARUTO: Help!

455
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,248
[groaning]

456
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,615
Somebody!

457
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:27,818
-(VOICEOVER) That Jonin doesn't
let down his guard even when

458
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,555
he's fighting a
fool like Naruto.

459
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,189
NARUTO: Help!

460
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,023
Come on!

461
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,058
The bell!

462
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:35,997
[groaning]

463
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,465
[groaning]

464
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,901
[sighing]

465
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,604
-Think before you use a
jutsu, or else your opponent

466
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,206
might use it against you.

467
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,474
[groaning]

468
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:50,115
Oh, and also, if the bait
is obvious, don't take it.

469
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,151
[groaning]

470
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,355
A ninja must see
through deception.

471
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:58,126
-(ANGRILY) I get it!

472
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,198
-I'm telling you this
because you don't get it.

473
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,865
You think you get
it, which is not

474
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,103
the same as actually getting it.

475
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:05,936
Get it?

476
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,007
-(VOICEOVER) This is my chance.

477
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,614
He finally dropped his guard!

478
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,149
-Won't you ever learn?

479
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:15,649
[yelling]

480
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,485
[gasping]

481
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,620
[gasping]

482
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,223
-He just got
blasted by shuriken!

483
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,292
Are you out of
your mind, Sasuke?

484
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:23,894
You went too far!

485
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,202
[music playing]

486
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,082
[theme music]

487
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,435
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Man, at this rate,

488
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,304
there's no way I can
beat Kakashi Sensei.

489
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:13,141
But if I don't get a
bell, I fail the test,

490
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,311
and that is not an option.

491
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,115
He keeps saying see
through deception,

492
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,287
which I would do if I had any
idea what he was talking about,

493
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,420
but I don't.

494
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:26,721
So how do I get my hands
on one of those bells?

495
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,888
Next time-- "You Failed!

496
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,589
Kakashi's Final Decision."

497
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:34,302
It might look bad, but
don't count me out!
