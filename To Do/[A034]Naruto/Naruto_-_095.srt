00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,333
[music playing]

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,800
[theme music]

3
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,850
-I'm not going to run away.

4
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,817
I never go back on my word.

5
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,717
That's my nindo.

6
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,617
-You've just thrown it all away.

7
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,584
Dreams don't come
true when you're dead.

8
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:05,350
-Just get out of
the way, Naruto.

9
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:05,850
No.

10
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:07,384
Look out.

11
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,050
-Get ready to pay up on our bet.

12
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,850
That cursed necklace of
yours is about to be mine.

13
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,150
Until I become Hokage, I
don't care what happens.

14
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,384
I am not going to die.

15
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,050
OK.

16
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,384
Let's see you
dodge me this time.

17
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,084
Here goes.

18
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,250
-That's impossible.

19
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,884
NARUTO: "The Fifth Hokage.

20
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,650
A Life on the Line."

21
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:54,150
Rasengan!

22
00:02:58,684 --> 00:02:59,650
-What's this?

23
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,384
JARAIYA (VOICEOVER): Well,
well, the kid actually did it.

24
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,984
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): A child
mastering a jutsu like that.

25
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,684
It's unheard of.

26
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,150
-It's impossible, but he did it.

27
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,017
He actually mastered the
Rasengan in one week.

28
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,917
-And you?

29
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,584
How can you be
standing after that?

30
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,417
-I focused my chakra
at the point of impact.

31
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,050
Before he'd even hit me,
I'd started healing myself.

32
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:25,350
You see now why Lord
Orochimaru values me so highly,

33
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,950
not only for my skills
and knowledge of jutsu,

34
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:32,350
but most of all for my
recuperative powers.

35
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,550
No matter how
great the injury, I

36
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,350
can repair and re-energize
any damaged cells.

37
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:44,117
But there is a limit, and
I'm almost out of chakra.

38
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,450
Naruto, on the other hand,
doesn't have that gift.

39
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:48,517
He looks finished.

40
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:01,784
What?

41
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,417
No.

42
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:16,650
I never thought, even
with my healing powers,

43
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:18,017
the damage was too great.

44
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,284
And now I haven't
enough chakra left.

45
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,250
[heart beating]

46
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:41,779
-His heart is failing.

47
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,712
the muscles surrounding his
heart have been torn to shreds.

48
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,146
How the heck did
it happen and when?

49
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,112
Wait, of course.

50
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:59,079
That moment just
before they separated.

51
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:00,812
Kabuto must have
struck at his heart.

52
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,346
Stop shaking.

53
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,012
Get a grip.

54
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,646
[groan]

55
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,746
[groan]

56
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,779
-How about it, Gamakichi?

57
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:22,746
Do we have to wait
for the kid to croak

58
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,012
before we get our snacks?

59
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,679
I'm getting hungry.

60
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,379
-Zip it, or I'll make
sure you definitely croak.

61
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,279
-You're wasting your time.

62
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:42,946
It's all over for him.

63
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,246
With my last strength, I severed
his heart's chakra network.

64
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,612
I cut him off from
getting any help

65
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:58,646
from the demon, the
Nine-Tailed Fox.

66
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:04,679
And he hasn't the
power to save himself.

67
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,346
I'm telling you.

68
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,879
He's finished.

69
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,279
Dead.

70
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,079
All your skills are useless now.

71
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,779
TSUNADE: Oh, shut up.

72
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:14,279
You'll be dead soon.

73
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:15,046
I'll see to that.

74
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:23,179
He stopped breathing.

75
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,879
No.

76
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,646
No.

77
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,146
No.

78
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,879
KURAMA: Dark.

79
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:54,312
It's getting dark.

80
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:57,012
The light is fading.

81
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,379
My strength fading.

82
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:00,879
Why?

83
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:04,846
What?

84
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,612
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): No.

85
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,879
Don't die.

86
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,912
Don't die.

87
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:20,579
Don't die.

88
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:29,279
Don't die. [gasp]

89
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:30,346
-Hey.

90
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,312
Don't forget our bet.

91
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,012
Told you, I'd win.

92
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,846
-He's still alive?

93
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:00,146
-To be Hokage.

94
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,279
That's still your
dream, Naruto, isn't it?

95
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:18,146
One more time.

96
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,012
Just one more time
for the last time.

97
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:27,046
I want those words to be true.

98
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,812
-Poor boy.

99
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,612
I really don't
think he'll make it.

100
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,979
-You're forgetting
Tsunade's healing powers.

101
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,312
Don't worry about him.

102
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,579
She'll have him back up
on his feet in no time.

103
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,346
-Perhaps so, but that's
not what I meant.

104
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,779
-Hm.

105
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:57,979
Forget Naruto.

106
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,312
I'd focus on me if I were you.

107
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,846
I'm the one you
have to worry about.

108
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,379
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): There's
far more to this little genin

109
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,146
than meets the eye.

110
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,146
There's no telling
what might happen

111
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,579
if the Akatsuki get
their hands on him.

112
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,646
But if he were to die right now.

113
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:23,612
What the devil?

114
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,612
-He's coming for the boy.

115
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,000
[groaning]

116
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:28,769
-Tsunade, you are the one
person I wouldn't want to kill.

117
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:29,969
Listen to me.

118
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:32,502
If that brat is
allowed to live, it

119
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,869
will mean more trouble
than you and your friends

120
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,702
could ever imagine.

121
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,635
Stay out of my way.

122
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,835
-No.

123
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,969
You listen to me.

124
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:47,269
If I do nothing else, I
will protect this boy.

125
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:48,635
-Ha.

126
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,702
And how do you plan to do that?

127
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:51,835
Look at you.

128
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,835
Your body is shivering
like a leaf in the wind.

129
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,602
Besides, why would
you, one of the Sannin,

130
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,902
risk your life to
save a lowly genin?

131
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:15,935
-By saving him,
I'm saving my home,

132
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,502
the Village Hidden
in the Leaves.

133
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,635
-You really think you're
protecting the village?

134
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:41,269
-You see, this boy,
this lowly little genin,

135
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:44,702
has been chosen by fate
to be Hokage someday.

136
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:49,069
-[laughing] What nonsense.

137
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:52,135
Even if it is true, what of it?

138
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,735
Who cares about the Hokage?

139
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,435
Only a fool would want that job.

140
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,702
-Playing at Hokage.

141
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:02,269
It's just a fool's game.

142
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,702
SHIZUNE: Think of my
uncle and your brother.

143
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:16,769
It would be a betrayal of
them, a betrayal of yourself.

144
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:18,869
Have you forgotten
all your dreams?

145
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:27,835
-Remember the Hokage that
have come before and all

146
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,969
they've accomplished
for the Leaf Village.

147
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,369
They were willing to gamble
everything, even their lives

148
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:36,069
to make sure the village
survived and prospered

149
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,069
through troubled times.

150
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,002
-I won't let her do it.

151
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:45,402
She can't sit there and
make fun of the old man.

152
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,535
I don't care if she is a lady.

153
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,402
I'll knock that
sneer off her face.

154
00:14:57,202 --> 00:15:03,169
-From now on, I'm
gambling everything too.

155
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,002
I'm putting my life on the line.

156
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:10,369
-Well, if you're really
willing to throw your life away

157
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,935
for the sake of one
insignificant brat,

158
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:14,835
I'm happy to accommodate you.

159
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,269
Now all that's left
is Naruto himself.

160
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,269
-Lady Tsunade.

161
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,235
JARAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Not enough time.

162
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,535
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
She's torn to ribbons,

163
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,702
and she can still
move that quickly.

164
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,035
Hm.

165
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,202
You really are
determined, aren't you?

166
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:12,869
I'm impressed.

167
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:19,269
-Didn't I make it
clear enough, you fool?

168
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,902
I meant what I said.

169
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:26,002
I will die before I
let you touch him.

170
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,469
-You're half dead already.

171
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:41,835
Ha.

172
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,269
Such brave talk.

173
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,369
But look at you, you're
still trembling all over.

174
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:48,935
Poor thing.

175
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,935
You just can't shake your
fear of blood, can you?

176
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,369
You see how pointless
it is, and all for what?

177
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:59,169
For the sake of an obnoxious
little boy you don't even know?

178
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,269
For the sake of a
worthless village

179
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,202
you left behind years ago?

180
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:13,969
What?

181
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,669
No.

182
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,735
You stopped the trembling.

183
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:20,702
How?

184
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,935
-I finally remembered something.

185
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,602
I've been chosen as the Fifth
Hokage of the Leaf Village.

186
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,702
-Wha-- what's that mark?

187
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:39,669
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): She's
overcome her fear at last.

188
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:41,169
But that mark.

189
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,535
-Whatever you call yourself,
it makes no difference.

190
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,469
You may have conquered
your inner weakness.

191
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,835
But what about the rest of you?

192
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,702
You can hardly expect to
defeat me in your condition.

193
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:55,702
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Ha.

194
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,335
-No.

195
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,002
Lady Tsunade, wait.

196
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,969
Let me treat your wounds.

197
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:07,435
Please, don't break the seal.

198
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,835
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Reserve Seal Release.

199
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:13,302
Ninja Art Mitotic Regeneration.

200
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:32,102
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
What jutsu is this?

201
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:39,269
[laughing] It seems
I'm not the only person

202
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,835
who's been spending their
time discovering new jutsu.

203
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,769
This one's very impressive.

204
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,135
How's it done?

205
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,602
-My chakra, for
years, I've stored it

206
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:53,069
up in a space
behind my forehead,

207
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:55,635
saving it for just
such an occasion.

208
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,435
With this chakra reservoir,
my body's ability

209
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:01,135
to create new cells
is accelerated.

210
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,435
The cells divide rapidly,
spreading throughout my body

211
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:08,935
and regenerating
any damaged organs.

212
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:12,335
It's like having the ability
to reincarnate myself.

213
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:15,602
You see you can slash your
way at me all you want,

214
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:17,769
but I can't be killed.

215
00:19:17,802 --> 00:19:19,302
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
What she doesn't

216
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:22,869
say is that a person, any
person, even her, can only

217
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,435
generate new cells a
limited number of times.

218
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:28,035
If you speed that up,
you shorten your life.

219
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,602
Lady Tsunade!

220
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:33,635
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

221
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:36,469
That can only mean--
Lord Orochimaru!

222
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,802
JARAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Quickly come out!

223
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,202
Come out!

224
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:43,702
-Do it.

225
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:45,202
Hurry!

226
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,802
-Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji.

227
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:50,702
-(ALL TOGETHER) Summoning jutsu.

228
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,043
[theme music]

229
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,525
JARAIYA: We have walked very
different paths, Orochimaru,

230
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:06,725
but today, our
paths meet at last.

231
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:07,925
It's time to end it.

232
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,392
You are no longer fit
to walk among men.

233
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:14,292
OROCHIMARU: [laughing] You make
that sound like a bad thing.

234
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:18,492
Mankind, the very word
fills me with loathing.

235
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,492
TSUNADE: You've
grinned your last.

236
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:24,092
After today, there will be
one less Sannin in the world.

237
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,792
NARUTO: Next time, "Deadlock.

238
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:27,658
Sannin Showdown."
