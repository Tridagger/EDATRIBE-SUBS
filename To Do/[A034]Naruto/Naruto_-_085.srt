00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,300
[theme music]

2
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,610
-Yah!

3
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,143
As you can see, you failed.

4
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:04,077
Jiraiya, the Toad Sage falls
victim to no woman's charm.

5
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,177
Rare beauties fall for me.

6
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,310
When you reach stature
I have, the ladies

7
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,643
worship at your awesomeness.

8
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,310
-Ah, don't give me that.

9
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,077
One wink from a
pretty girl, and you

10
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,477
turned into a mountain of mush.

11
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,343
You fell for it like a
ton of bricks, Pervy Sage.

12
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,177
-I really wish you
wouldn't call me

13
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,710
that in front of other people.

14
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,677
-Are you kidding me?

15
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,810
We've got worse
things to worry about

16
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:50,177
than what these
guys think of you.

17
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,010
Get with it, Pervy Sage.

18
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:54,543
-Didn't I just ask you
not to call me that?

19
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,443
-Whatever name you go by,
Master Jiraiya, I must say,

20
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,910
you're something of
a disappointment.

21
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:07,777
A lecherous old man with
the disposition of a child.

22
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,577
It's almost
impossible to believe

23
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,343
that you are one of the
three Legendary Sannin.

24
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:14,043
-What?

25
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,843
You-- you already
know who he is?

26
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,843
-Uh, don't be fooled
by appearances,

27
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:23,143
or, you know, anything this
little squirt might say.

28
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:26,043
-So you somehow
managed to release

29
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,077
the genjutsu we cast on her, eh?

30
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,943
-What kind of coward would
do something like that?

31
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:39,210
Using his Saimingan
to inflict an illusion

32
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,843
jutsu on an innocent
woman, all in order

33
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:44,043
to separate Naruto from me.

34
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,143
-T-- to separate us?

35
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:49,277
But why?

36
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,577
-I know that he's the
one you're really after.

37
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,477
-The Nine-Tailed
spirit inside Naruto--

38
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,710
that's what you're after?

39
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,643
-That explains how Kakashi knew.

40
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:09,477
Now I understand.

41
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,610
He learned it from you.

42
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:15,977
You're right.

43
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,943
Naruto is the prize that
the Akatsuki are after.

44
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:22,377
And we will have him.

45
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,077
-Huh?

46
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,410
Wh-- what's going on?

47
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,843
-No way you're getting Naruto.

48
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,843
-We'll see about that.

49
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,877
-Actually, this is
all very convenient.

50
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,577
I can eliminate you
both at the same time.

51
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,310
SASUKE: Stay out of this.

52
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:52,143
-Huh?

53
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:52,610
-Huh?

54
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:12,777
-The only one who's going
to eliminate him is me.

55
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,077
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hate
Among the Uchihas-- the Last

56
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,777
of the Clan.

57
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,843
Saskue.

58
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,677
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Of course-- revenge.

59
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,510
-Go away.

60
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:34,710
You don't interest
me at the moment.

61
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:35,577
-Well, get interested.

62
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,410
-Sasuke, no!

63
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,843
-Damn you lousy--

64
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,143
-No, Naruto.

65
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,077
Don't butt in.

66
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,410
Mind your own business.

67
00:05:56,043 --> 00:06:00,777
I told you before, I've
lived my whole life

68
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,477
for this day, this moment.

69
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,243
This fight is mine!

70
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,377
-Sasuke.

71
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,810
[grunting]

72
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:44,577
-Not finished.

73
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,943
ITACHI (VOICEOVER):
He can't even

74
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:49,643
manage to make the hand sign.

75
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:54,510
-This fight is mine.

76
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:55,843
-So be it.

77
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,743
-You heard him, old man.

78
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,477
This fight is none
of our business.

79
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,610
Let's let the two
of them sort it out.

80
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,777
-And now finally--

81
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,077
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): How?

82
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,710
All these years,
nothing has changed.

83
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,643
How can it be?

84
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,443
-You show him no mercy.

85
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:55,477
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What have
I been doing all these years?

86
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,410
Was it-- was it all for this?

87
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,943
-You're still too weak.

88
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:14,210
You don't have enough hate.

89
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,510
And you know something?

90
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:17,777
You never will.

91
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,210
[gasping]

92
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,277
-Where am I?

93
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:10,877
This place, I know it.

94
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:19,377
[whimpering]

95
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,343
ITACHI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

96
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:25,143
It's our childhood home.

97
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,643
-Father and mother.

98
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:43,277
-You're weak, Sasuke.

99
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,743
And 24 hours from now--

100
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:49,310
SASUKE: Don't.

101
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:50,710
-You'll be weaker still.

102
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,277
-No!

103
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,177
[screaming]

104
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:27,645
-Auntie!

105
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,611
Uncle!

106
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:34,578
ITACHI (VOICEOVER): You're
not even worth killing.

107
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:39,045
Foolish little brother.

108
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,945
If you wish to kill me one
day, foster your hatred

109
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,945
and despise me.

110
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,978
Surviving in such an
unsightly manner as this.

111
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,345
By all means, flee.

112
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:53,745
Cling to your wretched life.

113
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,145
[screaming]

114
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,111
-Isn't that heartwarming?

115
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,311
Using Tsukuyomi on
his own brother.

116
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,778
-That does it.

117
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:12,211
I'm through standing around.

118
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,378
What the-- what's going on?

119
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,845
-Ninja Art Toad Mouth Trap.

120
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:52,111
You've both just been
swallowed by the Mountain Toad.

121
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,411
Welcome, my friends, to
the belly of the beast.

122
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,045
He has a very sensitive
digestive tract.

123
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,611
Be careful not to upset him.

124
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,878
Not the most glorious
way to die, is it?

125
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,711
It must be humbling
to know that you've

126
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,311
been reduced to toad bait.

127
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:10,578
He he he.

128
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:14,211
-Whoa, I'm not
liking this at all.

129
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:17,711
-Naruto, stay still.

130
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,311
Just remain calm.

131
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,811
Trust in my jutsu.

132
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,145
-Kisame, come.

133
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,978
-Easier said than done.

134
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,078
-It's useless.

135
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,045
The ninja hasn't
been born who can

136
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,011
survive this powerful stomach.

137
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:48,511
-Don't look now, but there's a
wall of flesh coming after us.

138
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:02,978
It's too fast.

139
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,511
We won't make it.

140
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,311
It's no use.

141
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:09,578
-Huh?

142
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:16,478
-Huh?

143
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:20,878
Hey, Pervy Sage.

144
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,378
What the heck happened?

145
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,345
They both got away.

146
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,145
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
He did the impossible.

147
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:36,545
He broke through the wall.

148
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,411
-So we just run away again?

149
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,511
We do a lot of that.

150
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,811
-There's no rush for now.

151
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,411
We'll get Naruto when
the time is right.

152
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,911
Besides, I felt it wise
for us to find some place

153
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,111
to rest for awhile and
recharge my powers.

154
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,145
ITACHI (VOICEOVER):
On top of Tsukuyomi,

155
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:03,845
to have to use
Amaterasu as well--

156
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:06,011
it was more exhausting
than I thought.

157
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:19,211
-What is this stuff anyway?

158
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,578
Some kind of black fire?

159
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,678
JIRAIYA: Stay away from it.

160
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:22,178
-Gyah!

161
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:27,911
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
How did they do it?

162
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,345
What did they use to escape?

163
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:35,411
And these black flames--
to burn the Stone Toad when

164
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:38,278
it has the power to
spit fire itself.

165
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,611
That is strong jutsu indeed.

166
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,445
-There.

167
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,111
Sealing Jutsu.

168
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,478
Fire Seal, now.

169
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:27,778
All right.

170
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:31,745
Well, that takes care of
that for the time between.

171
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:32,978
Now for Sasuke.

172
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,111
-Sasuke.

173
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,378
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What did he do to him?

174
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:11,645
-Huh?

175
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,345
-Dynamic--

176
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:13,845
-Guy.

177
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:14,345
-Entry!

178
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:21,145
Oh.

179
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,645
[grumbling]

180
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:32,911
-I guess I was a little
over enthusiastic.

181
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,611
You see, I-- I was
trying to hurry

182
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:38,245
and I couldn't see very clearly.

183
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,678
Using my headband to peer into
the opening, all I could see

184
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:44,511
were two sinister
figures so-- I'm

185
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,245
going to put an end
to this right now.

186
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,411
-Do you know what?

187
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:50,845
If this is your way of
saying sorry, it stinks.

188
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,211
-I'm sorry but it was just
a simple misunderstanding.

189
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,278
-Simple-minded's more like it.

190
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:57,911
But never mind that now.

191
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,245
We've got to get Sasuke to
the medical corps at once.

192
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,411
GUY: Right.

193
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:05,078
JIRAIYA: He's badly beaten
up, his arm is broken,

194
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,311
and he's been knocked out
by whatever jutsu that

195
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:11,011
was that Itachi used on him.

196
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:14,678
GUY (VOICEOVER): Could it be the
same thing he used on Kakashi?

197
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:19,711
-Pervy Sage, Sasuke is going to
be all right though, isn't he?

198
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,111
-Physically, yes.

199
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:23,645
But I am worried about what
may have been done to his mind.

200
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:28,478
-Enough!

201
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:29,478
You're dead!

202
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:38,445
Die!

203
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:05,978
Yeah

204
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:06,878
-Enough.

205
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,111
[screaming]

206
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,478
-What the heck.

207
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:31,245
What did Sasuke ever
do to deserve this?

208
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,378
OK, Pervy Sage, it's
time for a new game

209
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:38,978
plan starting right now.

210
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:42,545
I admit I let those
goons scare me a little.

211
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:43,745
But that's over.

212
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,578
No more running.

213
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:49,711
After all, it's me
they're after, right?

214
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:53,778
Well, OK then, it's time I
give them what they want.

215
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:55,178
-Hmph.

216
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:56,511
Nice speech, kid.

217
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:59,778
But I'm afraid you wouldn't
stand a chance against them.

218
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,111
You're not in the same league.

219
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,578
What would have happened if I
hadn't shown up just now, huh?

220
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,745
It took all I had to
get them away from you.

221
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:09,845
-Is that right?

222
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:10,978
So what are you suggesting?

223
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,645
That we just do nothing?

224
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,845
Sit here waiting for
them to hit us again?

225
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:16,811
What kind of strategy is that?

226
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:17,778
-Just be quiet.

227
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,045
You haven't earned the right.

228
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:31,578
I'm sorry, Guy.

229
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:35,411
I wanted to let Sasuke
fight his own fight.

230
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:37,378
I see now I should
have intervened sooner.

231
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,845
-This is obviously
the same sort of jutsu

232
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,311
that Kakashi was hit with.

233
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:47,011
We don't know when
he'll come out of it.

234
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:47,578
-What?

235
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,111
Kakashi-sensei?

236
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,345
-There's nothing worse
than seeing your students

237
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,611
fall in battle.

238
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:12,245
It's like losing little
pieces of your soul.

239
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,111
What we need is a supreme
medical specialist,

240
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,311
a master of healing
arts, and soon.

241
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:22,011
-You're right.

242
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,445
And the woman
you're talking about

243
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,478
is the one we've come to find.

244
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,445
-Huh?

245
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:28,411
The woman?

246
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:28,911
-Huh?

247
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:42,645
-You don't mean--

248
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:00,278
-Wha-- what are you going
to do with all that cash?

249
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,845
-Yes, that's exactly who I mean.

250
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:05,878
Another of the Legendary Sannin.

251
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:08,978
The Queen of Slugs and Elixirs.

252
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:11,345
-Take a good look, Shizune.

253
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:13,178
The losing streak is over.

254
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,545
Our luck is about to change.

255
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,111
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
The Gambling Fool

256
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:19,511
and Mistress of the Healing
Arts-- Lady Tsunade.

257
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,780
[theme music]

258
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,147
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A festival?

259
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,147
Food and games and prizes?

260
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,313
I love festivals.

261
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,147
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Great.

262
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,980
But hand over your wallet, kid.

263
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:06,513
I'll take care of it for you.

264
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:07,613
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Say what?

265
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:08,713
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
The three worst things

266
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:10,513
for a ninja are money,
gambling, and women.

267
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,380
Without the money, you
won't get into trouble

268
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:13,247
with the other two.

269
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,580
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh, come on.

270
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:16,380
You think everybody's
like you, Pervy Sage?

271
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:19,613
Well, I'm going to have a good
time, and you can't stop me.

272
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:22,013
Next time, A New
Training Begins.

273
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,547
I Will Be Strong!

274
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,747
Man, it's like hanging
out with your mother.
