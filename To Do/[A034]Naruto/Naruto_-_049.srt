00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:47,416
-What?

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,016
-What the--?

5
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,192
-Oh.

6
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,160
-An empty shell.

7
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,667
BOY (VOICEOVER):
Lee's hidden strength.

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,736
Forbidden secret jutsu.

9
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:06,174
-But how?

10
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,242
We didn't do it.

11
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,314
-It was when you closed
your eyes to pray.

12
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,883
-Huh?

13
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:18,323
-At that moment, Lee closed his
eyes too because of the pain.

14
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,927
That's when he did it.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,329
[crash]

16
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:22,929

[grunts] Gaara.

18
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:37,849
-Huh?

19
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:38,371
Aa.

20
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,222
[evil laughter]

21
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,163
-Oh, know it's--

22
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:49,331
-So it's happened.

23
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,766
Just as I thought.

24
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,468
That look in his eyes.

25
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:56,073
It could only mean The demon
inside him has been awakened.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,016
-Ah!

27
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,018
Yah!

28
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,452
Yah.

29
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,020

-Oh.

00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:26,981
[hollers] Uh!

35
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,358
-The poor kid is helpless.

36
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:37,127
He doesn't have anything left.

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,733
Gaara's just toying
with him now.

38
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,135
-I don't get it.

39
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,838
What's Lee doing
just standing there?

40
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,373
With his speed, he
should easily be

41
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,410
able to get out of the
way of those blasts.

42
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:51,513
Why doesn't he dodge them?

43
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,649
-For a very simple reason.

44
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,284
He can't dodge them.

45
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:55,852
-Huh?

46
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,387
Why is that?

47
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,459
-The Lotus is what you might
call a double-edged sword.

48
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,393
-Wha--?

49
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,095
What does that mean?

50
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,766
-You know that it's a
forbidden technique.

51
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,501
Why do you think that is?

52
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,737
-Well--

53
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,406
-The Lotus isn't
ninjutsu or genjutsu

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,945
It's taijutsu requiring
extreme physical effort.

55
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:19,115
The strain it puts on
the body is unimaginable.

56
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,953
No one can sustain it for long.

57
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:25,658
Right now, Lee is in so much
pain he can hardly move at all.

58
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,560
Isn't that right, Guy?

59
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,564
-But-- But that means--

60
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,444
-[grunts] [yells]

[cringing pain groan]

64
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:02,639
-No ninjutsu or genjutsu.

65
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:05,076
All he's got is taijutsu.

66
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,544
And not much of that.

67
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:08,780
-There's no way he can win this.

68
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:09,749
-Win?

69
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,617
He'll be lucky to survive.

70
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:15,423
-Lee.

71
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,599
-All right, you guys.

72
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,169
Keep it moving.

73
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:28,473
You want to run 200 more laps?

74
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,243
-[chuckles] Dummy.

75
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,410
Why bother?

76
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,313
You'll never be a ninja.

77
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:34,949
[kids laughing]

78
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:36,351
-Will too.

79
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,353
-There's no way a kid who
can't even do ninjutsu

80
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,821
can ever be a ninja.

81
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:40,689
-Yes, I can.

82
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,091
-Whatever.

83
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,393
I don't get why you're
even at this ninja academy

84
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,295
when you can't do
ninjutsu do genjutzu.

85
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,866
And you're even worse
than average at taijutsu.

86
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,434
It's idiotic.

87
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:53,473
-Hey, you know what everyone
here is calling you, don't you?

88
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:54,941
-Dork Lee!

89
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,443
Dork Lee!

90
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:58,780
Dork Lee!

91
00:05:58,813 --> 00:05:59,714
-Hey, Lee.

92
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:00,749
Where you going?

93
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,285
Get back in line.

94
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:05,890
--[smugly chuckles] So that's
the no-talent overachiever

95
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:07,458
I've heard so much about.

96
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,393
-Yeah.

97
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,462
He kind of reminds
me of someone.

98
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,297
-Hm?

99
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,267
-Especially around the eyebrows.

100
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,735
-[chuckles]

101
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,170
-Rock Lee.

nothing going for him

105
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,987
-But you kept at it, didn't you?

106
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:34,093
You kept practicing your
little lousy taijutsu.

397, 398, 399, 400.

If I can't do 500 kicks,
then it's 2,000 squats.

-411.

112
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:01,829
-Someone else is here.

-412, 413, 414, 415--

114

then at least 1,000 punches.

-He's still at it.

122

-If I cannot do 2,000 punches,
then I have to do 2,000 jump

124
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:52,963
-You focused everything
on your taijutsu,

125
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:56,835
training relentlessly, until--

126
00:07:56,868 --> 00:08:00,106
-As of today, you are all Genin.

127
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,009
So now tell me, why
have you done it?

128
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,646
What are your goals?

129
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:05,079
Hm?

130
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,813
-Oh.

131
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,581
Me, me, Sensei.

132
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:07,482
Me.

133
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:07,950
-Yes.

134
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,185
Tenten.

135
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,020
-I want to be a great
and powerful ninja

136
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:15,360
to walk in the footsteps of the
legendary Kanoitchi Sunadai.

137
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,661
-I see.

138
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:17,395
And you.

139
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:18,194
Neji.

140
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,036
-I'd rather not say.

141
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,306
-How about me, Sensei?

142
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,241
I want to show I can
be a splendid ninja

143
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:32,382
as well even if I do not
have ninjutsu or genjutsu I

144
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,518
want to prove it
to the whole world.

145
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,088
-There's that the
look in his eye.

146
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:38,423
-Hm.

147
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:39,057
-What?

148
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,326
What is so funny?

149
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,861
You think I am joking?

150
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,129
I mean it.

151
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,198
I will be a splendid
ninja just by using

152
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:47,802
taijutsu and nothing else.

153
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:49,070
-It's painful to watch.

154
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,940
Why doesn't he give up?

155
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,408
-He should quit while he can.

156
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,679
It was just bad luck he
got Gaara as an opponent.

157
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,315
Huh?

158
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:58,617
Come on, Bushy Brow.

159
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:04,424
-Lee.

160
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,792
-Uh aa.

161
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:06,793
Aa.

00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:08,162
-[attack cry]

-[groans] [moans]

164
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:23,615
-[yells] Not yet.

165
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,383
-Lee.

166
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:26,186
[sighs] This is stupid.

167
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,522
Why do you keep on
doing it to yourself?

168
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:29,557
Come on.

169
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,992
You're never going
to win against Neji

170
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,730
because he's--
well, he's a genius.

171
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:35,932
-A genius, huh?

172
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,568
What does that mean-- genius?

173
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:40,104
So I was not born with a
whole lot of natural talent.

174
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,606
Not gifted like Neji.

175
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,109
But I work hard and
I never give up.

176
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,044
That is my gift.

177
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,880
That is my ninja way.

178
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,515
-It doesn't change a thing.

179
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:49,684
-Huh?

180
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,487
-The sad fact is
you'll never beat me.

181
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,959
No matter how hard you work, no
matter how many times you try.

182
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,329
-That is not true
and you know it.

183
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,032
It is not true.

184
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,850
-True or not, you
didn't listen to them.

185
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:19,022
You, you never gave up.

186
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:24,362
-[screams] [grunts]

187
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:34,443
-[growling]

188
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:52,066
- [evil giggling] What good
do you think that'll do?

189
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,468
-I pity the kid.

190
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,871
Gaara will just toy with
him til he begs for mercy.

191
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:59,275
-Well, then, Gaara's
in for a long match

192
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,977
because that will never happen.

193
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:01,611
-Huh?

194
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,546
-Huh?

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,850
-Lee doesn't know
how to give up.

196
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:12,726
-[yells] [screams]

197
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,063
-Lee, will struggle on
long after the point

198
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:19,635
where anyone else
would have quit.

199
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:22,606
-If I cannot do 1,200
without a mistake,

200
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,609
then it is 2,000 kicks.

201
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,949
1,117, 1,118, 1,119, 1,100--

202
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:30,950
-Uh.

203
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:45,937
-[yells]

204
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,871
-Lee.

205
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,875
[chuckles] Taking
a break already?

206
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:50,776
-Huh?

207
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,744
[music playing]

208
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,257
-What is it, Guy Sensei?

209
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,528
If it is about my messing up
on the last assignment, anh,

210
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,665
I said I was sorry.

211
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,000
Anh.

212
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:12,371
-Lee, it's true you're different
from Neji and the others.

213
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,706
-Anh.

214
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,375
-You have no gift for
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

215
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:19,280
And your taijutsu needs work.

216
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:24,053
But, then again, you have a
gift that Neji doesn't have.

217
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,121
Not as flashy.

218
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,424
But perhaps even more important.

219
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,762
-You do not have to
make me feel better.

220
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:31,797
-You idiot.

221
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,400
You think I'd waste
my time with that?

222
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,935
No.

223
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,939
All I'm saying is that you
have the gift of perseverance.

224
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:41,643
And that's what makes
you a genius too.

225
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,378
-Uh?

226
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,315
Anh.

227
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,117
But is that true, Sensie?

228
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,053
Anh.

229
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:49,653
I wonder.

230
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:53,926
Unh.

231
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,661
I use to think so.

232
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:59,066
I use to believe that if I just
trained harder than Neji, two

233
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,238
or three times harder, I would
make myself strong enough.

234
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:06,175
But now I am not so sure.

235
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,279
I do not know if I will ever
be able to work hard enough

236
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,614
to be real talent.

237
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,589
That is why I'm always
taking out Neji.

238
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:19,059
I keep thinking all of
my efforts will pay off.

239
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,829
But it is always the same.

240
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,632
I am no match for him at all.

241
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,304
Every time we have a ninja
mission, my legs begin shaking.

242
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,677
I do not know if I can take it.

243
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,114
Sometimes it seems like the
whole thing is pointless.

244
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:39,919
Like I am a loser and I
will always be a loser.

245
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:45,927
[sobs] I do not know what to do.

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,329
-You're right.

247
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:50,000
All the effort is pointless if
you don't believe in yourself.

248
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,641
You know, Lee.

249
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:59,412
We're a lot alike, you and I.

250
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,548
-You mean the eyebrows?

251
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,352
-No, I don't mean our eyebrows.

252
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,288
You see, I was a loser too once.

253
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,124
-What?

254
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,258
You were a loser?

255
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,793
-Oh, yes indeed.

256
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:14,865
But I made myself the equal
of any ninja, even Kakashi.

257
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,968
And I did it through effort.

258
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,771
You say you want to
show the world you

259
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,641
can be a splendid ninja
even if you don't have all

260
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:23,810
the gifts that others
are blessed with.

261
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,681
That's your nindo,
your ninja way, right?

262
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,317
Well, I think
that's a fine goal.

263
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,920
As fine a goal as
I've ever heard.

264
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,789
And one worth sticking to.

265
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,163
Don't let anything
steer you off the path

266
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,498
you've drawn for yourself.

267
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:42,134
Forge ahead to the end.

268
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,403
Stick to it, Lee.

269
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,604
Make me proud.

270
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,308
Be everything you can be.

271
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:50,112
Will you do that for me, Lee?

272
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:50,746
-Yes, sir.

273
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,947
[music playing]

274
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:09,871
- [pants heavily] Guy
Sensei, thank you.

275
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:15,846
Unh.

276
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,018
-He can't go on.

277
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:23,623
Make him quit before
he gets himself killed.

278
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,192
-Bushy Brow.

279
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:26,760
-Hm.

280
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,565
[wind whipping]

281
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,568
[speed zipping]

282
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,936
-Hm?

283
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,637
-What?

284
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,239
-He's still able to--

285
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,674
-Move like that?

286
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,810
[music playing]

287
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:42,648
-I will make you proud, Sensei.

288
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:46,786
I will forge ahead,
follow my path to the end,

289
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,159
and become the ninja
I know I can be.

290
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,494
-Lee's smiling.

291
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,196
He's running for his life.

292
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,565
But he's still smiling.

293
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,699
-Yes.

294
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,236
But now it's
Gaara's turn to run.

295
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,005
-Uh?

296
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:04,643
The Leaf Village
Lotus blooms twice.

297
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,280
-I've heard that
somewhere before.

298
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,582
Yeah.

299
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,516
Lee told me that.

300
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,985
[gonging]

301
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:14,456
-Sakura, The Lotus of the
Leaf Village blooms twice.

302
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,196
When we meet again, I will
have become a stronger ninja.

303
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,664
I promise.

304
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,469
-But-- No, Guy, you didn't.

305
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,505
-Yes, Kakashi, I did.

306
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,044
-So that Genin, that boy, is
able to open the Eight Inner

307
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,214
Gates and use the Hidden Lotus?

308
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,585
-Hidden Lotus?

309
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,354
-That's correct.

310
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:44,095
-Well, if that isn't
the most-- [grunts] OK.

311
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:50,102
So then how many of the Inner
Gates is he able to open now?

312
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,038
-Five Gates.

313
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,105
-OK.

314
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,774
What exactly are these
Eight Inner Gates

315
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:54,743
you're talking about?

316
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,545
And the Hidden Lotus?

317
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,949
-The Eight Gates are like
valves or chakra limiters

318
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:04,455
that must be opened if one is
to release the Hidden Lotus.

319
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,558
-I'm still not following.

320
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:10,129
-There are Gates along
the chakra network located

321
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,698
at those points
in the body where

322
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,134
the chakra is most
heavily concentrated.

323
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,204
Starting at the head,
they are the Gate

324
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:20,409
of Opening, the Gate of Rest,
of Life, of Pain, of Closing,

325
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,847
of Joy, of Shock, and
the Gate of Death.

326
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:27,185
These are what are called
the Eight Inner Gates.

327
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,689
Their purpose is to
limit the flow of chakra

328
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,257
through the body.

329
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,228
But the Lotus exerts tremendous
pressure on these limiters,

330
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,497
eventually forcing
the Gates open.

331
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,432
[explosive bursting]

332
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:41,470
[explosive bursting]

333
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,006
-This releases the
restraints on the chakra.

334
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,509
The result being that
a person's strength

335
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:49,515
can be increased
tenfold or more.

336
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,619
-The Primary Lotus opens
only the First Gate--

337
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,087
[explosive bursting]

338
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,557
--the Gate of Opening,
releasing the brain's restraints

339
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,129
on the muscles, freeing a
person to bring forth its body

340
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,832
strength to it's full extent.

341
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:07,404
You'll see results.

342
00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:10,008
-And, uh, Hidden Lotus?

343
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,745
-At the Second Gate,
the Gate of Rest,

344
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,247
one's strength is
increased further.

345
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,917
And at the Third Gate,
the Gate of Life,

346
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:19,520
one enters the Hidden Lotus.

347
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,856
-Wait a minute.

348
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,858
Just the Primary Lotus
almost destroyed him.

349
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,360
He could barely move.

350
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:26,764
What's going to happen to
him if he takes it farther?

351
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:27,831
-Exactly.

352
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,267
-Uh.

353
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,736
-By opening all Eight Gates,
you could attain power

354
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,773
beyond even the Hokages.

355
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:39,480
The only drawback is you die.

356
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:39,947
[gonging]

357
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:41,249
-[gasps]

358
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:44,152
-I don't know what this
boy means to you, Guy.

359
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,523
But I shouldn't have to
tell you that we never

360
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,459
bring our personal
feelings into play.

361
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,997
I wouldn't have thought
you were capable of this.

362
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,899
[cymbals crashing]

363
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,001
-You have no right.

364
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,002
[cymbals crashing]

365
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,836
-You know nothing about him.

366
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,604
[cymbals crashing]

367
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,071
-Nothing at all.

368
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:02,711
That boy has something
important to prove.

369
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:06,482
And he's determined to prove it
even at the cost of his life.

370
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,155
-I want to show I can
be a splendid ninja

371
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:15,461
as well even if I do not
have ninjutsu or genjutsu.

372
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,331
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

373
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,869
-And I am determined to
help him reach his goal.

374
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:23,138
Not for his sake.

375
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:27,376
But because that goal
is worth reaching.

376
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,478
-All right, Lee.

377
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:30,013
I'm going to be teaching
you a new technique.

378
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,148
So pay attention now.

379
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,516
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. [cheers]

380
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,484
-OK, OK.

381
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:34,085
Enough of that.

382
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:34,853
-(LAUGHING) Yeah!

383
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,787
A new technique.

384
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,555
A new technique.

385
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,122
A new technique.

386
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,192
-(GROWLS) Lee!

387
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,728
I said pay attention.

388
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,831
-Ahyahah.

389
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:44,599
Right.

390
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:45,300
Pay attention.

391
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,234
Yes, sir.

392
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,104
-Let me first just
say one thing.

393
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,839
This technique is
even more forbidden

394
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:51,575
than the Primary Lotus.

395
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,243
It is not without danger.

396
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,480
But it will be your trump card.

397
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:56,682
-Ahp.

398
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,384
It will?

399
00:19:58,417 --> 00:19:59,752
-But listen.

400
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,923
You can only use this forbidden
technique on one condition.

401
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,760
One very strict condition.

402
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:06,661
And that is--

403
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:10,400
-[pants] And that is--

404
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,574
[aero speeding]

405
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,575
-What?

406
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:18,877
-Um-um.

407
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,347
-I don't know what you think
you're planning right now.

408
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,451
But this match is over for you.

409
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,786
-You are right.

410
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,821
[thundering]

411
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:31,060
-It is over one way or another.

412
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,595
Neji.

413
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,732
Insoske .

414
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:38,136
And--

415
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:44,545
-I am not going to be the
only one to lose here.

416
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,882
Guy Sensei, please
let this work.

417
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,418
It is now or never.

418
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,633
[lightening striking]

419
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:06,206
-To protect and maintain
one's own ninja way.

420
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:09,711
-The Third Gate,
Gate of Life, open!

421
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:10,412
[music playing]

422
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,840
[theme music]

423
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:53,861
[music playing]

424
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,998
-I will show you
that hard work pays.

425
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,267
I would not have gotten
this far if it did not.

426
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,471
Neji, Soske, Narato,
if you can win,

427
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,143
so can I. You did not think
I had a chance, did you?

428
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,246
But you did not know I
had an ace in the hole.

429
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,550
I have been saving it
until just the right time.

430
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,620
And that time is now.

431
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,954
-Next time, the Fifth Gate.

432
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,987
A splendid ninja is born.

433
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,221
-It is now or never.

434
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,654
