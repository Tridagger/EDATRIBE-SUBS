00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:04,964
-All right!

3
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,597
I'm finally gonna get
to do some trainin'.

4
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:42,697
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Come on.

5
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,997
This is the only way
I'm gonna get better.

6
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,464
Can't give up yet.

00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:55,297
[barking]

8
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,764
-So what's going on?

9
00:02:56,797 --> 00:03:00,764
It's not like you to stop
by and pick me up like this.

10
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,064
Besides, aren't we all
supposed to meet up

11
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,697
at Kurenai-sensei's place soon?

12
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,430
-Taking some time
to converse once

13
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:13,297
in a while-- that's a part of
being on a squad, isn't it?

14
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,497
That mission you guys went
on, I'd like to hear about it.

15
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,064
-It was pretty incredible.

16
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:20,564
But unless you lived
through it, you

17
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:22,130
wouldn't really understand it.

18
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,464

00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,997
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
I can't let Akamaru

20
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,930
go through something
like that again.

21
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:31,264
That's why I have to perfect
my jutsu as much as I can.

22
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:34,564
-Even so, I'd like
to hear the details.

23
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:39,130
After all, that's what being
on a squad is all about.

24
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:40,330
-Hey.

25
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:42,164
You in a bad mood because
you're the only one who

26
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:43,130
didn't get to go?

27
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,564
-Yeah.

28
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:47,864
That's gotta be it.

29
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,997
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
I've still a long way

30
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,997
to go 'til I can see his moves.

31
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,564
KIBA: Isn't it a little
early for training?

[barking]

33
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,430
-Neji, let's go ahead
and take a break.

34
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,430
-Yes, sir.

35
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,930
-Come on, Hinata!

36
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:21,864
-OK!

37
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:23,797
I'll be right back, father.

38
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,097
-Fine.

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,630
[barking]

40
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,964
-You're eating barbecued
meat for breakfast.

41
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,864
-And he just lost
all that weight

42
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,297
when he was resting
in the hospital.

43
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,930
Amazing how fast he
got back to normal.

44
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,930
-Well, with an
appetite like that,

45
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:48,730
at least we don't have to
worry about his health.

46
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,664
-When I'm finished
with my breakfast,

47
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:53,064
you're gonna help me
with my training again.

48
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:54,030
Right, Asuma-sensei?

49
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,097
-Hey, are you an
idiot, or something?

50
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,564
You're supposed to be taking
it easy and recuperating,

51
00:04:58,597 --> 00:04:59,497
you nincompoop!

52
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:06,964
-Yah!

53
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:07,464
Ha!

54
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,530
-Oi, slow down.

55
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:21,597
Come on, let's take
a little break.

56
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,830
-What is the matter, Guy-sensei?

57
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:27,330
One's youthful energy
must not be wasted!

58
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:29,230
-Yeah, but your
youthful energy's

59
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,130
running my body into the ground.

60
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,164
-Thank you very much,
and see you again soon.

61
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,330
-All right, kids.

62
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:50,264
Keep training.

63
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,397
-I'm gonna learn
the Shuriken Jutsu

64
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,564
by the time you come back.

65
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:54,297
Ha!

66
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,930
-Yeah.

67
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:56,397
I, uh, I will too.

68
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,964
-Oh, Temari, someday I'm
gonna be a strong kunoichi,

69
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:01,264
just like you.

70
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,730
-I'm very honored
to hear that, dear.

71
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,230
-Thanks again.

72
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,197
I had to ask you guys
to teach at the Academy

73
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,564
because we're a bit
short-staffed at the moment.

74
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,764
I'm sure you would have
rather gone sightseeing, or--

75
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,930
-No problem.

76
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:14,697
I helped out 'cause I enjoy it.

77
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,697
-Same here.

78
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,330
Besides, these kids
were the future

79
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:18,930
of the Leaf's military power.

80
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,597
This was a good opportunity
for us to evaluate them.

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,764
-Yeah.

82
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,997
Well, careful getting home.

83
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,692
-OK.

84
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,464
-I'll see you next time
you need to be rescued.

85
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,164
Just let me know, and I'll come.

86
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,897
You big crybaby.

87
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,497
-You girls are all alike.

88
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,364
You had to get the
last word in, huh?

89
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,864
KIBA: Let's kick some
butt today, Akamaru!

90
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,330
[bark]

91
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:01,430
-All right.

92
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,430
So we're all here?

93
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:10,897
There's nothing to be
nervous about, Hinata.

94
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,397
-OK.

95
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,197
-Now, everybody stand ready.

96
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,997
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I
have to work harder,

97
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,697
so I can be as strong as Naruto.

98
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:27,730
-OK!

99
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:29,730
I'm ready to go!

100
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:36,864
I just gotta wait for Pervy
Sage to show up, and-- It's him!

101
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,664
Uh-- um-- hm?

102
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,597
Hey, what about my training?

103
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,097
Now, don't look
so mopey, Naruto.

104
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,264
Some important last
minute work came in,

105
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,464
and I have to take care of it.

106
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:56,930
-It's probably research for some
kind of trashy novel, isn't it?

107
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,797
I wouldn't exactly call that
important work, you know?

108
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,230
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
It's actually

109
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,764
a mission to gather
information about the Akatsuki

110
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:05,097
organization.

111
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,064
But if I tell Naruto, he might
ask to come along with me.

112
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:10,930
Tell you what.

113
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:12,130
I'll make it up to ya.

114
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,997
-What is it?

115
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,430
-Something to help you from
getting too bored while you're

116
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:20,864
sitting at home alone.

117
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:23,564
I put together a special
training regimen for you.

118
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,564
-No way!

119
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:25,064
You did?

120
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:25,664
-Hey!

121
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,830
Hold on a second!

122
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:28,897
My own personal super
secret training methods

123
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,964
are inscribed
within that scroll.

124
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:32,830
You can't just
open it up outside,

125
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:34,197
where other people might see it.

126
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,030
-I won't!

127
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,830
-Well, you'd better get started.

128
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,297
-I'm gonna use this
scroll to train

129
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,997
like I've never trained before!

130
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,697
Thanks a million for
this, Pervy Sage.

131
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,530
The walls have ears.

132
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,830
Paper doors have eyes.

133
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:04,464
Pervy Sage's secret
training system!

134
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:04,964
Huh?

135
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,197
Willpower?

136
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,030
Pervy Sage!

137
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,530
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): You all
built the great Hidden Leaf

138
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:37,597
Village, and I've been
entrusted with its well being.

139
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,497
No matter what
danger may strike,

140
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,997
it's my duty to
protect this village.

141
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,764
The Hokage sure
has it tough huh?

142
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:47,397
SHIZUNE: Yes.

143
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,930
You really do.

144
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,264
-That you, Shizune?

145
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:51,764
Enter.

146
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,597
I'm sorry there's so many
reports to go through.

147
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,797
They've been accumulating
because so many things have

148
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,797
been happening to
the village lately.

149
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,364
-I guess the only
thing I can do is

150
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,730
start at the top of the pile.

151
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,597
Leaf Maximum Security Prison?

152
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,697
Did the name of
the prison change?

153
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,064
-Yes.

154
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,430
It used to be called the Ninja
Prison for Capital Expenses

155
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:14,997
and Felonies.

156
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,930
Fortunately,
because there's been

157
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:23,530
a drop in the number of
shinobi committing crimes,

158
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:26,030
the facility has been
downsized and the name

159
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:28,530
was changed to
reflect the cutbacks.

160
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:31,230
It was originally built
to house murderers, those

161
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,064
who committed
treason and the like.

162
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,997
The most hardened criminals.

163
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,797
But there hasn't been much
trouble the last few years,

164
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,264
and the prison's
been quite secure.

165
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,130
[whistle]

166
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,597
-Chow time!

167
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,397
-I gotta get my
hands on some grub.

168
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,230
Right, bro?

169
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:58,630
-My stomach is growlin'.

170
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:00,430
I can hardly wait to eat.

171
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:01,364
-Knock it off.

172
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,364
Fujin Raijin, if
you don't shut up,

173
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,530
you're gonna starve tonight.

174
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,697
Those guys are such a handful.

175
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,530
Keep it moving.

176
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:20,697
Wait, stop right there.

177
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,964
Looks like you have an injury.

178
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,630
Get that checked out
at the infirmary.

179
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:25,130
-Yeah.

180
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:28,964
-OK, who's next?

181
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,479
-Hey, I got a little question.

182
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,645
-Yeah, What?

183
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,612
-Well, look at my itty
bitty little pinky.

184
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,345
Why does it gotta be so
short and weak like it is.

185
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,279
-That's an easy one, Raijin.

186
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,845
If the pinky finger was big and
strong like the others, then

187
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,445
your thumb wouldn't
be special anymore!

188
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,912
-Oh.

189
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:05,845
Yeah!

190
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,379
Big brother.

191
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,312
Big brother!

192
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:10,812
-I'm a lizard.

193
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,579
-Raijin, ever since I've known
you, you've been a moron!

194
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,445
-Yeah.

195
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,345
Yeah.

196
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,645
[gurgling]

197
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,379
-We haven't had enough
to eat, have we, Fujin?

198
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:20,945
-You're right.

199
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,145
-You're out of your cell.

200
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,445
What's the matter now?

201
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,979
What is it this time?

202
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,112
-We're completely starving.

203
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,012
-You gotta give us some grub.

204
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,812
-Uh-oh.

205
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:54,745
If these guys find out I don't
have anything-- Well, I-- Uh,

206
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,345
it's just, right now--

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,379
-Let me see if I understand.

208
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:04,212
You're saying you have
absolutely nothing to offer us?

209
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:07,979
-Nothing you can present that
will satisfy Fujin and Raijin

210
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:08,745
tonight?

211
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,812
-No, we'll find something.

212
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,645
-What do you think?

213
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,545
Tastes good, huh?

214
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,612
-Mm-hm.

215
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,745
-I'll be sure and bring you
something else later tonight.

216
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,645
That ought to hold you
over for now, though.

217
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,179
-OK.

218
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:30,512
-You all right?

219
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,312
When they have enough
food in their bellies,

220
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:38,079
those two are pretty calm,
but when they're hungry,

221
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:40,012
they're impossible to control.

222
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,212
-Yeah.

223
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,245
They even turned against
their own teammates

224
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,712
during a mission over
a meal they wanted,

225
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,545
and then the people who
captured them barely

226
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,812
managed to hold them down.

227
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:56,579
-Huh?

228
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:57,079
-Hm?

229
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,545
[sniffing]

230
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,845
-I'm smelling
something delicious.

231
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,945
-Me too.

232
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,345
-That way.

233
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,112
-Food, food, food, food, food,
food, food, food, food, food,

234
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:10,612
food.

235
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:16,679
[sigh]

236
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:20,279
-All this paperwork I have
to go through is so boring.

237
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:25,412
-Unfortunately, there's still
a lot more to do, Lady Tsunade.

238
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:25,912
-Huh?

239
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,312
SHIZUNE: That's odd.

240
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,445
It looks like some sort
of formula for a potion.

241
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,979
-What formula is this?

242
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:41,279
Find any available Jonin
and bring them here at once.

243
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,745
-Really?

244
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,345
-Do it!

245
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,679
-Oh, yes ma'am!

246
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,112
-Tell me.

247
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,645
Is it all to your liking?

248
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,279
I guess that's a yes.

249
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,379
There's plenty more, you know.

250
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,379
-I should've known that
delicious smell was

251
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:19,379
coming from your
cell, big brother.

252
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:20,579
-Yeah.

253
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,079
'Cause somehow you
always figure out

254
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,379
how to get the
tastiest food for us.

255
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,545
-It took a lot of
sneaking around,

256
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,145
but it was definitely worth it.

257
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,879
I would feel absolutely
terrible if my brothers

258
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,845
had to go hungry.

259
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,045
-You're the best.

260
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,545
We're lizards.

261
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,812
-You're too funny.

262
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:45,179
But even so, you
must still be hungry.

263
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,579
What would you say if I could
get even more gourmet food?

264
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:49,079
-Hm?

265
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:50,012
What?

266
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:50,512
Food?

267
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:51,479
Where?

268
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:54,045
Give me!

269
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
-I know a place where we can
go visit an old friend of mine.

270
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,879
There, you can
taste cuisine that's

271
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:02,979
even more scrumptious than this.

272
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,279
-An old friend of yours?

273
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:07,945
Is this the same fella you
told us about a long time ago?

274
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:08,879
-Yeah.

275
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:12,479
His name was, uh, O-- O-- O--

276
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,645
-That's right.

277
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,712
Lord Orochimaru.

278
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,979
NARUTO: Pervy Sage
thinks he can just

279
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,512
ditch me in my
training like that!

280
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:26,912
-Come on.

281
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,479
Don't be so hard on him, Naruto.

282
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:31,245
There was a mission Master
Jiraiya had to complete.

283
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,045
-Hmph!

284
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,445
-I'm sure that's it.

285
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,245
Lady's Tsunade must've send
Master Jiraiya on a really

286
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,079
important mission that
only he could accomplish.

287
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,479
-Oh, is that right?

288
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,912
So it was grandma
Tsunade's fault, huh?

289
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,612
-Well, there's
nothing we can do now.

290
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:46,779
Listen.

291
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,112
Ramen noodles are my
treat tonight, OK Naruto?

292
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:51,145
So just cheer up.

293
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:51,645
Huh?

294
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:55,812
-That's it!

295
00:16:55,845 --> 00:17:00,079
I'm gonna go give Grandma
Tsunade a piece of my mind.

296
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:02,512
Thanks for the free
eats, Iruka-sensei!

297
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:03,412
-Naruto, wait!

298
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:03,912
I--

299
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:10,812
-Hm?

300
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:14,845
Oh, great.

301
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:15,979
What is it this time?

302
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,679
-Hm?

303
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,745
What?

304
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,279
The Leaf Maximum
Security Prison?

305
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:34,307
-The crime occurred
about a year ago.

306
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,707
A Chunin Academy staff
member manipulated Naruto,

307
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,707
and used him to sneak
out the secret scroll.

308
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,974
-According to the final
report, Mizuki acted alone.

309
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,874
He was punished and the
case was closed, wasn't it?

310
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,007
-That's right.

311
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,341
But I'm not sure he
was acting alone.

312
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,274
Evidence has surfaced
that indicates

313
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,541
there may be a mastermind
who orchestrated

314
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,874
the crime from the shadows.

315
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:00,607
I found this clue in my files.

316
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:04,207
When he was first locked up at
the maximum security prison,

317
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:07,374
Mizuki was concealing
this piece of paper.

318
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:08,907
At the time, the
guards just assumed

319
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,607
it was an innocent doodle.

320
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,774
-Lady Tsunade.

321
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,407
What is it, anyway?

322
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,741
-I'm not certain.

323
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:17,874
However, the handwriting
resembles a document

324
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,407
that was confiscated at the
location where Orochimaru

325
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:23,241
was experimenting on humans.

326
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,307
-Wait.

327
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:27,107
Are you saying Orochimaru
is behind this?

328
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:30,041
-That possibility does exist.

329
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,374
Think about it.

330
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:34,441
If a lone, inexperienced Chunin
stole the secret scrolls,

331
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,874
he wouldn't actually be able
to do anything with them.

332
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,374
He lacks the power.

333
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,341
No.

334
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:40,841
It would only make
sense if Orochimaru

335
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:44,841
were behind him, commanding
him, pulling the strings.

336
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,441
Asuma, Kurenai, get going
to the maximum security

337
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,841
prison at once.

338
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,507
Find out everything
Mizuki knows.

339
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:01,607
-Orochimaru.

340
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,307
-Watch yourself.

341
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,741
Something doesn't
seem quite right here.

342
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:28,741
-It's much too quiet,
even for a jail.

343
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:29,441
Let's move.

344
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:34,807
Oh.

345
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,107
How touching.

346
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,274
They've sent a welcoming
party to greet us.

347
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,541
-Yeah!

348
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,107
And we're gonna give you a
big welcome, right, brother?

349
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,074
-You bet.

350
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,441
-Asuma.

351
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,241
Don't tell me those two are--

352
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,841
-It's them.

353
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:58,307
The famous idiot brothers,
Fujin and Raijin.

354
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,041
-Asuma.

355
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,174
-Hey, if you want
to throw a party,

356
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,841
you guys gotta it
make some more noise.

357
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:17,674
MIZUKI: Calm down, tough guy.

358
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,074
The welcome party's
only just beginning.

359
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,874
-Being stuck in prison really
