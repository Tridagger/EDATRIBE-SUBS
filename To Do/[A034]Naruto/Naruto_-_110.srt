00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,833
[theme music]

2
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,443
SAKON (VOICEOVER): You mustn't
lose sight of your purpose.

3
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:03,843
-Don't leave me!

4
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,309
-Thank you

5
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:11,809
-Sasuke.

6
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:30,509
Kotetsu: [yawn] Ugh,
it's four in the morning.

7
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:33,409
The Fifth Hokage is
a real slave driver.

8
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:36,009
She forgot these papers,
she should go get them.

9
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:36,509
Huh?

10
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:42,076
-What is it?

11
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,943
-Hey wake up.

12
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:51,376
You're gonna catch a cold
if you sleep out here.

13
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,876
-[mumbling]

14
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,209
-Thank you. [ECHOS

15
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,209
-Sasuke, no!

16
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:14,976
[crying]

17
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:26,276
-[snore] [knock] Ugh.

18
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,609
Oh, thank you, boys.

19
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,276
-Huh?

20
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,843
You were fast asleep,
weren't you Lady Hokage?

21
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,376
You made us go fetch these
heavy documents while you just

22
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,776
sit here taking a nap?

23
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,809
-[nervous laugther] No

24
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:44,043
-Well in any case Lady Hokage,
we have something to report.

25
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:44,743
-What is it?

26
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,876
What did you say?

27
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,343
Are you sure of that?

28
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,709
-Yes.

29
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,809
-We heard this from
Sakura herself.

30
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,909
There's no reason to
doubt you told us.

31
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,843
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

32
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,109
He's always making his move.

33
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:10,209
-In addition to grabbing all
I desire, this time around I'm

34
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:14,043
going to grind the Hidden
Leaf Village into dust.

35
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:15,843
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
[growl] So that's

36
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:19,143
what that wretch is after, he's
going for the Uchiha's powers.

37
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:28,909
Izumo, Kotetsu, there's
somebody that I need to see.

38
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:30,943
-[yawn]

39
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,143
-Would you hurry up
and eat Shikamaru?

40
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,643
Your dad has an important
mission to get to.

41
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,043
If you just sit there he won't
have time for morning training.

42
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,576
-Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:41,876
-Don't talk, just eat.

44
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,876
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
From the second I get up,

45
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,243
it's nag, nag, nag. [doorbell]

46
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:48,543
-Hmm?

47
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,476
Now who would be visiting
us so early in the morning?

48
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,043
-Hey, dad.

49
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:56,209
-What is it?

50
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:57,543
-What on earth
made want to marry

51
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,609
such a crabby woman like mom?

52
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:01,409
-Hmm.

53
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:03,776
That's a good question.

54
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,476
Even a crab like your mom
can be gentle sometimes.

55
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,243
She has her moments.

56
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,743
[slurp]

57
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,076
-That's the reason?

58
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,743
SHIKAKU: [slurp] Mhm.

59
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,409
YOSHINO: Shikamaru.

60
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,609
Lady Hokage has sent a
messenger to see you.

61
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:22,109
-Hmm?

62
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:31,176
-Late last night Sasuke Uchiha
left the Hidden Leaf Village.

63
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,676
And we are quite certain he's
headed for the Hidden Sound

64
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,343
Village.

65
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,843
-He just left?

66
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,776
How could this happen?

67
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:39,843
-Simple.

68
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,976
Orochimaru must have
him in his clutches.

69
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,909
-[gasp] What?

70
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,443
Wait, that doesn't
make any sense.

71
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,143
What does Sasuke have to
gain by talking to someone

72
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,143
as depraved as Orochimaru?

73
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,376
-At this point his
motive doesn't matter.

74
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,209
We need to deal with it quickly.

75
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:58,909
I've decided it's time for you
to carry out your first mission

76
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,976
as a Chuunin, Shikamaru.

77
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,943
-So all I gotta do
is bring Sasuke back?

78
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,209
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): As
long as none of our enemies

79
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,309
are with him, shouldn't
be that big a deal.

80
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:11,409
-Yes, that's your mission.

81
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:13,909
But it must be
accomplished without delay.

82
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:17,343
And you may find it more
dangerous task than you think.

83
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,176
-Huh?

84
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,109
-There's a strong
possibility that Sasuke

85
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:24,343
is being guarded by
Orochimaru's men.

86
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,743
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Damn, this

87
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,309
is going to be a
real pain in the ass.

88
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,576
What happened to Sasuke anyway?

89
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:33,143
I used to look up to him, and
now he;s joined up with the bad

90
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:33,876
guys.

91
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,143
This really stinks.

92
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,476
-Well if we're going to
be facing opposition,

93
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,909
I'm going to need to request
a team composed exclusively

94
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,109
of Jounin and Chuunin.

95
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,976
-I can't honor that request.

96
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:47,809
-What?

97
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:48,909
And why not?

98
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:52,376
-You already know the answer.

99
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,676
As I'm sure you're
aware, most of the Jounin

100
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,643
have been sent out on missions.

101
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,309
Only a handful stayed behind
to defend in case of attack.

102
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:07,009
Go round up any skilled Genin
you feel are up to the job.

103
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,043
You have 30 minutes
to leave this village.

104
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,243
-This whole thing's a drag,
but I do know the guy,

105
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,243
so I can't just let it go.

106
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,076
Well, that's just the
way it is, I guess.

107
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,776
-Hold on.

108
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,076
There is one person I strongly
recommend you include.

109
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,243
-No way!

110
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:40,543
You gotta be kidding.

111
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:44,043
-You just woke up, and
you're already this annoying?

112
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:46,476
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Why'd
she want me to bring this guy?

113
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:53,643
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, you jerk!

114
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:55,109
-Hey, hold on a second.

115
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,576
I"ll go get dressed.

116
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:00,976
-[sigh]

117
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,376
-So, uh, besides
me, have you come up

118
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,609
with any other top
notch guys to ask?

119
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,409
-A few.

120
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,209
Wake up, will ya?

121
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:13,309
-You said top notch guys, right?

122
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,409
-[sigh] Plan B, I guess.

123
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,843
-Wait, plan B is potato chips?

124
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,543
-They're barbecue flavor.

125
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,876
Feel free to help out.

126
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:34,543
[munching] Now.

127
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:35,043
-Aargh!

128
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:40,509
Even for a bag of
potato chips, I

129
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:44,443
refuse to let anyone
have the last bite.

130
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:48,076
-Chouji and I have been on
the same team for a long time.

131
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,676
We work well together, so
asking him's a no-brainer.

132
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,476
-[chuckle]

133
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,776
-I get it, you know him.

134
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,543
But for this kind
of thing, don't you

135
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,743
think your first choice
should be someone like Shino?

136
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,743
-Man, you always have to yell?

137
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,143
-Huh?

138
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,143
-Not on your life!

139
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,076
-Shino can't do it.

140
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:23,776
He's off on some special mission
with his father right now.

141
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:24,676
-Hey, wait.

142
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:25,876
Not them too.

143
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,776
-Yep, they're on the team.

144
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,143
-Aargh!

145
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,443
-Woof, woof.

146
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:32,676
-I see.

147
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,543
Sound's like an interesting job.

148
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:38,109
I guess getting up early to walk
the dogs pays off sometimes.

149
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,909
-Hey, Shikamaru, is
there anybody else?

150
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:43,143
-I wish we had time to
find some more guys,

151
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,976
but we're late already.

152
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,276
If we don't run across
anybody else on our way out

153
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,376
of the village, I
suppose it'll just be us.

154
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,209
-Your surgery, I heard
that it went well.

155
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,509
-It did

156
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,143
-And they said you're
fit to be released?

157
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,676
-I was told I could
resume my training soon.

158
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,243
I have to take it
easy, of course.

159
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:03,743
-I see.

160
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,109
Yes, I understand.

161
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,809
-Yeah, it's kind
of a drag, but I

162
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:21,109
figure the more guys
we have the better, so.

163
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:27,109
LEE (VOICEOVER): Why
now of all times?

164
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,643
-Lee, it's up to you.

165
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:33,976
You do what you must do.

166
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:39,876
-Huh?

167
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:58,509
-Tomorrow I think I will try
climbing these steps by myself.

168
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,009
-Lee.

169
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,843
-I will be fine, you
go on without me.

170
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:14,709
-It's time to go.

171
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,209
Oh well, at least I got five.

172
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,251
-All right!

173
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,185
come on, let's get going
everybody, follow me!

174
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,618
-Um.

175
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,618
Hey, uh, Naruto,
I'm kind of supposed

176
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,351
to be the platoon leader here.

177
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:48,951
I know it's a drag but--

178
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:52,018
-[grunt] You really think you're
the best person to direct this

179
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,118
operation?

180
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:56,018
You don't seem very reliable me.

181
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,585
-What's up with you
acting like you're

182
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,685
in charge of a sudden Naruto?

183
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,218
I mean, taking orders
from somebody as lazy

184
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:05,951
as Shikamaru doesn't exactly
thrill me either, but still.

185
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:07,218
-Woof

186
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:09,851
-But none of you get to
decide who's the leader here,

187
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:13,051
because Shikamaru is the only
one of us who's a Chuunin.

188
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:14,551
That means the
elders of the village

189
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:16,451
clearly believe he's
got what it takes

190
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,418
to call the shots on this one.

191
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:19,451
-[moan]

192
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,251
-If that's the case,
then perhaps you

193
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:23,885
should start coming up
with some sort of a plan.

194
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,085
From what I heard,
Sasuke's gone to the enemy,

195
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:28,918
and there's a real chance
they could ambush us.

196
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,385
-Well for starters, this
is a rescue operation,

197
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,885
so we'll be in the
position of pursuit.

198
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,151
Which means the
enemy already has

199
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,451
an important advantage over us.

200
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,785
That said, I'm arranging us
in a deployment formation that

201
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:44,851
can respond to any
assault by the enemy.

202
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,551
If any of you don't
follow my exact orders,

203
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,318
we're all going to die.

204
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,418
-[gasp]

205
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,751
-OK, we'll go with a
single-file strike formation.

206
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:58,018
As we all know, the
most important position

207
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:01,818
is the spearhead, so
that's going to be Kiba.

208
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:02,651
You're upfront.

209
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,151
-[gasp]

210
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:07,151
-SHIKAMARU: With all the
walks you and Akamaru go on,

211
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:10,451
you're the most familiar with
the Land of Fire's terrain.

212
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,785
And with that sensitive
nose of yours,

213
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,818
you'll be able to
track Sasuke's scent,

214
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:18,151
while sniffing out any booby
traps the enemy may have set.

215
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:21,185
Moreover, because we'll have
two sets of eyes up front,

216
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,618
you and Akamaru will be
more effective in protecting

217
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:27,985
our single-file line
from an assault.

218
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:31,351
Second in line will be
yours truly, platoon leader.

219
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,885
From that position, I'll
be able to direct everyone

220
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,385
behind using silent
hand signals.

221
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,918
And because I'm
so close to Kiba,

222
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:41,218
I'll be in position to
react in any situation.

223
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:45,885
In the middle, the number
three position is Naruto.

224
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:48,151
The middle of the line is
the perfect location for you

225
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:51,151
because you're the most capable
of executing quick moves

226
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,785
either in front of
you, behind you.

227
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:58,651
You're the cornerstone, and you
have the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

228
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,818
Fourth in line is Chouji.

229
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,985
Chouji, you might
not have any speed,

230
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,751
but your striking
power is the greatest

231
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,718
of the platoon members.

232
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,185
Kiba, myself, and Naruto will
launch a surprise attack,

233
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,451
then you'll swoop in
and finish them off.

234
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,751
You're the second
wave of our assault.

235
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:18,918
Finally, on the end
will be you, Neji.

236
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:22,018
Your position is most
difficult, rear lookout.

237
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:24,985
I want to use your Byakugan
to constantly scan ahead

238
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:26,251
for weakness in our ranks.

239
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,018
Got it?

240
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,118
Then take a look at this.

241
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:43,285
This diagram shows exactly
what part of the perimeter

242
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:45,451
you're responsible for.

243
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,118
Kiba watches the front.

244
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:50,018
I'm responsible for
a wider forward view.

245
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,685
Naruto's got the left,
Chouji the right,

246
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,518
and Neji, using your Byakugan,
you cover the entire area

247
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:59,551
to the rear.

248
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:02,085
All right, now I think I
should familiarize myself

249
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,918
with our arms and weaponry.

250
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,785
I'll need to check out
all of the ninja tools

251
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,918
you each of you plan on
carrying into battle,

252
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,618
that way I'll know what we have.

253
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,285
Are there any questions?

254
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,651
-Uh-uh.

255
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:17,218
-LEE (VOICEOVER): Even though
he has just assembled this team,

256
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:21,285
he has already created the best
possible formation for them.

257
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,351
-Since no one has
anything to add,

258
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,251
I saved the most
important thing for last.

259
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,251
For as long as I've
known him, Sasuke and I

260
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:33,251
haven't exactly
been close buddies.

261
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:41,585
In fact, I don't really like him
at all. [gasps] All the same,

262
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:44,651
Sasuke's a ninja belonging
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

263
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:48,885
He's a comrade, and I'll put my
life on the line to help him.

264
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:51,651
That's the way of our village.

265
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:57,651
I know I usually seem like a
pretty lazy guy, but not today.

266
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,451
Because now I'm responsible
for your lives too.

267
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,318
-Wow, I never thought
I'd see Shikamaru

268
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:08,851
acting like a Chuunin.

269
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,518
Very impressive.

270
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:15,551
-OK, as soon as we check
our gear, we'll go.

271
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:16,651
Show me your weapons.

272
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,051
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke would never

273
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,318
let a guy like that
sink his claws into him.

274
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,551
I mean, he's already
a total powerhouse.

275
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:35,951
It's not he needs that
kind of help, you know.

276
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:39,585
Don't worry, I guarantee it.

277
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:43,918
Damnit, why Sasuke?

278
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:45,818
SHIKAMARU: All right,
let's move out.

279
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:46,351
SAKURA: Wait!

280
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:46,851
-Huh?

281
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,885
-Are you all right?

282
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,885
-Lady Hokage told me everything.

283
00:16:56,918 --> 00:17:01,385
Sorry Sakura, I can't
take you on this mission.

284
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:04,585
I know you tried, but even
you couldn't convince Sasuke,

285
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:05,318
could you?

286
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:06,818
-[gasp]

287
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,385
-Now our only option is for
me to find him, and force

288
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,551
him to come back to the village.

289
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:15,018
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
else you can do for him.

290
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:22,085
-But that means-- did Sasuke
turn his back on you Sakura?

291
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,485
LEE (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

292
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:44,485
--[crying] Naruto, this is a
once in a lifetime request.

293
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,451
Just bring him home.

294
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:50,885
Please bring Sasuke back to me.

295
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,851
I did everything I could.

296
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:58,751
I tried, but I couldn't stop
him from leaving the village.

297
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,251
At this point.

298
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:03,351
There's only one person
who can stop him.

299
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,951
Only one who can save him.

300
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,351
Naruto, it's all up to you.

301
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:24,385
-Well gosh Sakura, you must
really care about Sasuke, huh?

302
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:25,785
I get it.

303
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:29,318
I can see that deep down, this
must be really painful for you.

304
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,651
I know you must be suffering.

305
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,818
-Sakura, I want to
ask you something.

306
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,585
-Huh?

307
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:45,118
-Naruto, what do
you think of him?

308
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:48,051
-He knows about my feelings, and
he purposely gets in the way.

309
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,951
It's almost like he
enjoys interfering

310
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,251
and making me feel bad.

311
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,118
Despite what he says,
he doesn't understand

312
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:55,718
one single thing about me.

313
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,518
He's just annoying.

314
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:09,085
[cries] Naruto,
thank you so much.

315
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:14,751
[cries] Naruto,
thank you so much.

316
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:15,751
-Don't you worry one bit.

317
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:18,218
I'm going to bring Sasuke back.

318
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,885
I promise that on
my life, Sakura.

319
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,718
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
More than anyone

320
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:28,985
else, you always understood me.

321
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:34,485
You've always been there
when I needed help.

322
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:34,985
Naruto.

323
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,285
-Whoa, hold on Naruto.

324
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,385
That's quite a statement.

325
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,051
Are you sure you
should be promising her

326
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:46,918
that we'll get him?

327
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,985
-Sure.

328
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,185
When I give my word
you can count on it.

329
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,118
That's my ninja way.

330
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,318
Well come on, what're we
waiting for, let's get going.

331
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,385
-All right then.

332
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,685
This little interruption
cost us some time.

333
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,385
Let's get moving.

334
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:00,885
-Right.

335
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,885
-Did you see Naruto
give you the thumbs

336
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,085
up when he made that promise?

337
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,951
That means he will do it.

338
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,651
I can tell Naruto will succeed.

339
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:47,118
-Sasuke, I think
this is far enough.

340
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:51,085
We're already past the
Hidden Leaf Village.

341
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,918
-So what's up?

342
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,818
-Orochimaru gave us
a very important task

343
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:59,118
to take care of when
we reach this point.

344
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:01,218
-You going to tell me what
we have to do, or not?

345
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:20,051
--[chuckles] Before
we go any further,

346
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:22,185
I'm afraid you must
die just this once.

347
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:31,873
[theme music]

348
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,577
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
From this position

349
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:05,344
it's going to be dangerous,
use your five senses.

350
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:06,877
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Roger, got it!

351
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:07,711
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
We have to find them

352
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,777
before they find us.

353
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,311
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
You can count on me!

354
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:11,544
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
As soon as we locate--

355
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:12,911
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yep.

356
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:14,444
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Are
you even listening to me?

357
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,577
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): It
doesn't matter who they are,

358
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,644
I'll beat'em no problem.

359
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,044
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Ugh, why do

360
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:21,911
I even bother explaining
things to him?

361
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,677
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Sound versus Leaf.
