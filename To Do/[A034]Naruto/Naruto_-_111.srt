00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,833
[theme music]

2
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:05,728
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Hang on, Sasuke.

3
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,662
-Before we go any
further, I'm afraid you

4
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:25,295
must die just this once.

5
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,228
-I must die, once?

6
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:42,728
--[chuckle] You will take one
of these awakening pills.

7
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,928
-What's it for?

8
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,028
Awakening from what?

9
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:50,495
-That mark on your shoulder is
only a first state curse mark.

10
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,695
But those pills will stimulate
and magnify its power,

11
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:54,962
making it a level two.

12
00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:00,862
-One problem, strengthening
the curse mark

13
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:04,095
will also increase its
effects on your body.

14
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:07,962
Such a rapid change
would kill you at once.

15
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,695
And so, to ensure you
survive the transition

16
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:14,662
to the second state, we
must give your body time

17
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,662
to get accustomed to it.

18
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,162
Several hours, at least.

19
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:23,595
After that, once the
transition is complete,

20
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,795
your power may even
be equal to ours.

21
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:30,962
Unfortunately, the
fact remains that even

22
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:34,662
with all these preparations,
you'll still have to die.

23
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,228
-So I'm dead.

24
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,528
What'll happen after that?

25
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:04,528
-Not to worry.

26
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:06,762
Why do you think my
friends and I are here?

27
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,562
We'll cast a barrier
ninjutsu to lessen

28
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,995
the effects of the transition.

29
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,395
Instead of dying,
you'll only be suspended

30
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,895
in a state of
half-death for a while.

31
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,495
-And I'm supposed to
trust you guys to make

32
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:32,128
sure this half-death doesn't
end up being the real thing?

33
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:34,362
-Listen Sasuke.

34
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,462
Don't forget who we are.

35
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,895
Orochimaru's hand
picked bodyguards.

36
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,762
If there's anybody who knows
about curse marks, barrier

37
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,862
ninjutsu, and all
the rest, it'd be us.

38
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,795
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
One thing's for sure, I

39
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:01,895
can't afford to die.

40
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:02,628
Not yet.

41
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:07,362
-I guess I'm in your hands.

42
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:33,862
-Right.

43
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,062
Get ready.

44
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,562
We've got to do this
quickly, or we'll lose him.

45
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,928
Get in position.

46
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:54,462
Now.

47
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:18,862
-Four Black Mist Formation!

48
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:38,595
-Sealing jutsu.

49
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:44,962
There.

50
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,128
That'll hold him for now.

51
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:57,528
-Ugh, I'm exhausted.

52
00:06:57,562 --> 00:07:00,062
-Who would've ever guessed that
this mission would turn out

53
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,362
to be such a tough one?

54
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:08,328
[wind] [gasps]

55
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,695
-Stay here while
we check it out.

56
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,662
Raido, come on.

57
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:13,162
-Right.

58
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,662
-Great.

59
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,262
It looks like we've got company.

60
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:30,095
-There's just one--
no, wait-- two of them.

61
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:30,695
-Get ready.

62
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,328
-They work for Orochimaru.

63
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,828
-And judging from the path
these four are taking,

64
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,595
I guess they've just
come from the Village

65
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:50,462
Hidden in the Leaves.

66
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,095
What you got in the coffin?

67
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,628
-Fighting two Jounin at once?

68
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:05,228
I'm trembling at the prospect.

69
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,128
GENMA (VOICEOVER): They
all have curse marks.

70
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,728
-You might want to
think this over.

71
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:56,062
It won't be like last time when
you jumped us all by surprise.

72
00:08:56,095 --> 00:09:01,028
-Yeah, you're right scum,
you won't survive this time.

73
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:04,362
GENMA: Truse me, you
pawns of Orochimaru,

74
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,228
you don't want to mess
with the Leaf Shinobi.

75
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,095
-Where are they?

76
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,095
It's been too long.

77
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:32,462
-So you think maybe
something's happened to them?

78
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:33,728
-Let's go find out.

79
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:34,228
-Right.

80
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,495
-[wimper]

81
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,195
-Akamaru?

82
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,862
-What's the matter with him?

83
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:48,828
-He smells blood.

84
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:49,762
Somewhere nearby.

85
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,462
-[gasp] What happened?

86
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,397
-Raido, Genma!

87
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:35,497
[fading heartbeat]
This isn't good.

88
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,464
-Both of them taken down.

89
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,430
It's impossible.

90
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,264
-[grunt]

91
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,064
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
All I can do right now

92
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,597
is just try and stabilize him.

93
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,530
IWASHI: I'm going Shizune.

94
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:11,897
I'm going to find them
and make them pay.

95
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,430
-No you won't!

96
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,097
-What?

97
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,364
What do you mean?

98
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:19,964
-She's right, Iwashi.

99
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:24,164
They-- they were using
jutsu beyond the powers

100
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,397
of mere shinobi.

101
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:32,864
[cough] If you go after them
, you'll only be killed.

102
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,897
-Genma, that's enough talking.

103
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,297
-Here's what happened,
the scent of two newcomers

104
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,230
converged on the scent of
Sasuke and four others.

105
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:54,597
The two have stayed behind while
Sasuke's group has moved on.

106
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,830
So what now?

107
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:59,297
-Just as I thought,
Sasuke's got an escort.

108
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,197
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Man, this is turning out

109
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,097
to be such a drag.

110
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,897
-There's no question, we
gotta go after Sasuke.

111
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,864
-Who died and make you boss?

112
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:09,630
Last time I checked,
Shikamaru was

113
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:10,930
in charge of running this show.

114
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,730
It's up to him to decide.

115
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:13,564
-Hmph.

116
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,597
Well, Shikamaru?

117
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,664
-Since Akamaru smelled
blood, my guess

118
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:19,730
is that there was a battle
between Sasuke's group

119
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,097
and the two newcomers.

120
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,830
If we go to the spot
where they fought,

121
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,964
we might be able to gather
some useful information.

122
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,630
Of course we can't just
rush in, it might be a trap.

123
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,464
So when we get closer, we'll go
into full reconnaissance mode

124
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:34,530
and take it slowly.

125
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:36,230
-And while we're
doing that, Sasuke

126
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,697
will have crossed beyond the
borders of the Land of Fire

127
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,030
and out of our hands.

128
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:42,230
-OK Shikamaru, so
what's it going to be?

129
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:50,897
-We follow Sasuke.

130
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,964
-Way to go.

131
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,064
I knew you'd make
the right choice.

132
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,164
-One thing.

133
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,630
-What?

134
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,697
-These guys have already
been in one fight,

135
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,364
so they'll be on their guard.

136
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,164
Unless they're complete
idiots, they'll

137
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:08,064
have to know there's going to
be more ninja on their trail.

138
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,397
There's a good chance we'll
hit some booby traps or even

139
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,597
an ambush up ahead.

140
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:17,564
So from this point on,
we proceed with caution.

141
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,730
I want everybody,
not just Akamaru,

142
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,797
to put all your
senses on full alert.

143
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,430
If you catch a trace of anything
suspicious, sound the alarm.

144
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,664
We want to find these
guys before they find us.

145
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:30,164
-Ha!

146
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:31,164
Got it.

147
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,697
And when we do
find them I'm going

148
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,597
to clobber them with this
brand new jutsu of mine.

149
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,297
KIBA (VOICEOVER): That Naruto.

150
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,564
Every time I turn around, he's
got a new trick up his sleeve.

151
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:42,097
And just when I
thought I'd finally

152
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,764
caught up to that
little pain in the neck.

153
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:48,230
-[sniff] [wimper]

154
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:50,930
-The enemy's scent is
here, all around us.

155
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:51,964
-Everyone stop!

156
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,897
Look up on that tree, see that?

157
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,864
NEJI: A paper bomb.

158
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:05,564
I'm sure there's
five more of them.

159
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:08,597
A perimeter barrier,
that's what it is.

160
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,764
-A perimeter barrier?

161
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,930
-It's a type of trap ninjutsu.

162
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,564
There's a delay
after the perimeter

163
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,764
is breached, giving the
victim just enough time

164
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,164
to get to the center of the
area for the full effect.

165
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,597
It's a tricky jutsu, I learned
about it in one of the books

166
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,197
my dad used to make me read.

167
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:31,230
-Ugh.

168
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,097
Now we got to waste
time going around it.

169
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,530
Great.

170
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,030
-Lee, it's up to you.

171
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:02,364
You do what you must do.

172
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:20,497
HOKAGE: No Lee, it's
too soon for that.

173
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,164
-But Lady Hokage--

174
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,797
-I know you like to push
yourself, but take it easy.

175
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,530
Your body's still recovering
from the operation.

176
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,730
This is one thing you
don't want to rush.

177
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:43,964
-But I need to start training,
if only a little bit.

178
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:47,030
This waiting around
doing nothing--

179
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,530
-Building your physical
strength isn't the only type

180
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:50,930
of training you need.

181
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:55,097
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

182
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,697
A true ninja endures hardship
with patience and restraint.

183
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,830
He knows how to wait.

184
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:05,030
So just look at this as
another kind of training.

185
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,797
-A kind of training?

186
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,197
-You don't want to hurt
yourself and make things worse.

187
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,064
Here.

188
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,497
-Uh?

189
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,764
What is that?

190
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:22,597
-It's just some medicine
I made up for you.

191
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,997
Go on, drink up.

192
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,897
You want to get
better, don't you?

193
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,364
-[grunts] Yes ma'am.

194
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:31,997
-Let's head back, OK?

195
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,497
-Right.

196
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:41,230
KIBA: Man, this whole forest
is crawling with booby traps.

197
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,764
SHIKAMARU: Yeah, but luckily
they're easy to spot.

198
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:45,864
These guys are moving
fast and getting sloppy.

199
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:54,030
-Naruto, do me a favor and
watch where you're going.

200
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,564
I don't want to
blowing us all up.

201
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,897
There's trip wires everywhere.

202
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,997
-Tell me something I don't know.

203
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,697
-Naruto, hold it!

204
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,264
-[grunt], just in time.

205
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:21,197
Got him with my Shadow
Possession jutsu.

206
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,464
KIBA: Didn't I tell you to
watch your step, you moron?

207
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:28,530
SHIKAMARU: I get it.

208
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,064
One wire catches the
light and is easy to see,

209
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:32,930
the other is camouflaged.

210
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:37,930
While you're busy avoiding the
first, you trip the second.

211
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:41,197
-They've created a
trap within a trap.

212
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,864
They're clever,
whoever they are.

213
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,764
-All their other traps
were quick and dirty,

214
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,064
as if they were moving fast.

215
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,364
But not this one.

216
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:51,964
-They may have stopped to rest.

217
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:54,730
Perhaps one of them is injured.

218
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:58,297
Or is this part of the trap?

219
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:58,797
Byakugan!

220
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:09,964
I see them.

221
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:12,130
-Well let's go,
I'm dying to show

222
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:13,497
these clowns what I've got.

223
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,564
-Is that right?

224
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:16,564
Hate to disappoint
you, hotshot, but I've

225
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,664
got a new jutsu I've
been working on too.

226
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,364
-Yeah, me too.

227
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,164
-All right, calm down.

228
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:26,064
First we make a plan and
get everything ready.

229
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,097
Then, we nail these bastards.

230
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,997
[panting]

231
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:49,830
-It drives me crazy,
stopping and having

232
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,997
to rest when we
should be moving on.

233
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,997
-Buwo, what did you expect?

234
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,630
You think you can
fight a level two

235
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,130
battle without
feeling the effects?

236
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:01,864
-To feel like your whole
body is completely useless,

237
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,364
it's frustrating.

238
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:06,530
-Can't be helped if you're going
to take on two Jounin level

239
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,730
ninja.

240
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,997
If we'd held anything
back, we'd have been dead.

241
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:17,130
SHIKAMARU: That's it.

242
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:18,930
Now Kiba, the timing
of those smoke

243
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:21,797
bombs is absolutely
crucial, got it?

244
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,730
KIBA: I got it.

245
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,797
-So, split up.

246
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,530
Let's go.

247
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:31,030
-Looks like we've
caught them napping.

248
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,464
Hm?

249
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,930
Hold on, where's Sasuke?

250
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:38,897
-He's in there.

251
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,664
Inside that coffin.

252
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:43,397
-You don't mean he's dead?

253
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,830
-It's been sealed with a
barrier jutsu that's hard for me

254
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:48,197
to see through clearly.

255
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,230
Considering they went through
all that trouble to get him,

256
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:53,797
I can't believe they'd be
willing to kill him so quickly.

257
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:58,297
-Let's just hope you're right.

258
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,564
Huh?

259
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:19,130
[gasps] [screams]

260
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,239
[theme music]

261
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:02,887
[barking]

262
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,953
NARUTO: Give me a
break, this is crazy.

263
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:14,753
[interposing voices]

264
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:15,920
ALL: Akamaru, keep quiet!

265
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,053
KIBA: Hey, leave him alone.

266
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,153
NARUTO: Oh forget it.

267
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:20,253
Just get me close enough
to use my Rasengan,

268
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,653
and leave the rest to me.

269
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:27,153
Next time, Squad Mutiny,
Everything Falls Apart.
