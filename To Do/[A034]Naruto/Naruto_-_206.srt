00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,140
[theme song in japanese]

2
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:17,780
-Why would the third have
tried to eliminate Yakumo?

3
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,983
There's no way
that could be true.

4
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,521
But if it is, if Kurenai
sensei did carry out

5
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,124
that kind of mission,
that would explain

6
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:31,160
why she's acting so weird.

7
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,761
Nah, that's crazy.

8
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,063
It couldn't be.

9
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,739
-How you doing Kurenai sensei?

10
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,207
Are you OK?

11
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,609
-Yes.

12
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,144
You did a good job
patching me up, Sakura.

13
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,812
I feel much better now.

14
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,187
-So what do you think, you guys?

15
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,556
Who do you figure
she's covering for?

16
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,558
-Well, it was the
third Hokage who

17
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,627
told her to look after Yakumo.

18
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,462
-So what was her actual mission?

19
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,796
-What the hell?

20
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,645
-You guys seeing this?

21
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,680
Look, it's a Hidden
Leaf Village.

22
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:25,981
It's--

23
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:26,649
-Oh.

24
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:45,067
-It looks like the aftermath of
some gigantic war or something.

25
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,868
-Hinata.

26
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,536
-Uh, right.

27
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,003
Byakugan.

28
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:00,015
-There isn't anybody
in the village.

29
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,451
-This isn't good.

30
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,119
-What the hell's
going on around here?

31
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:28,577
-Kiba, Hinata you two
picking anything up?

32
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:33,515
-No sign of enemies
in the vicinity.

33
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,485
-Akamaru hasn't caught a
whiff of anything either.

34
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,554
-I don't understand
what happened here.

35
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:39,955
How could this even be?

36
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,591
-Let's just get Yakumo
and Kurenai sensei back

37
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,959
to the hospital for now.

38
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,629
We can take a look around
the village after that.

39
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,896
-Yeah, you're right.

40
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,912
This is bad.

41
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,948
-Come on, let's get
these two inside.

42
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,128
-Don't worry about me.

43
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,863
Take care of Yakumo.

44
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,231
-Right.

45
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,833
-You're totally safe now.

46
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,768
Huh?

47
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,635
Oh, no.

48
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,004
She's unconscious.

49
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,140
-Her vital signs are dropping.

50
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:33,242
Hopefully, there's
still medicine.

51
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,944
Naruto, we need to
see what we can find.

52
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:37,046
-Yeah, but shouldn't we--

53
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,147
-Naruto, come on.

54
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,515
-All right.

55
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,055
-I don't smell any blood.

56
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,891
Looks like they've all been
evacuated to somewhere.

57
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,460
-Let's go have a look
around the village.

58
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,561
-Right.

59
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:54,663
-Make sure you
act as a team, OK?

60
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,598
And I don't care what
you find out there,

61
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:59,168
I want you back
here in 30 minutes.

62
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:01,136
-Got it.

63
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,904
Hmph.

64
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:02,538
-What?

65
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,239
What is it?

66
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:05,007
-Heh, heh.

67
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,608
Aw, nothing.

68
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,010
Just feels good to be getting
orders from you again,

69
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:08,977
you know?

70
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,928
-Hey, we're looking
for medicine, remember?

71
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,996
Snap out of it, will you?

72
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,734
-Sorry, I'm just worried about
Kurenai sensei, that's all.

73
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,602
-All the more reason
to keep looking.

74
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,070
-That's not what I meant.

75
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,005
She came to eliminate her.

76
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,908
You know, Yakumo.

77
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,443
-Eliminate?

78
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,946
-Oh, uh, never mind.

79
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,782
I just spaced out
there for a second.

80
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:47,836
Sorry.

81
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:50,052
-Huh?

82
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,720
Wait, did you just see that?

83
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,489
-See what?

84
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:55,124
-We're not the
only ones in here.

85
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:55,791
-Huh?

86
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,069
Sakura, you look after
Kurenai and Yakumo.

87
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,137
I'm going after him.

88
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,071
-Got it.

89
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,711
-Stop right there.

90
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,147
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

91
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,047
What?

92
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:21,116
It didn't activate.

93
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,850
Hmm?

94
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,751
-Aaah.

95
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,262
Aaaah.

96
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:34,830
Hold on.

97
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:36,932
We haven't the time to
be fighting right now.

98
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:40,469
-You the guy who attacked
us back at the villa, right?

99
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,537
-My name is Unkai.

100
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,738
I'm from the Kurama clan.

101
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:43,872
-Kurama?

102
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:45,607
You mean the same
one as Yakumo's?

103
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,876
Why would her own
clan be after her?

104
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:53,849
-Listen to me.

105
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:55,984
If you don't, then
everyone will die.

106
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:16,505
[barking]

107
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:20,742
-What the hell's
that smell in here?

108
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,143
-Byakugan.

109
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,848
-What?

110
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:31,453
Kiba, muzzke Akamaru.

111
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,722
Hinata, stop using the Byakugan.

112
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,723
-Huh?

113
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:35,538
-Why?

114
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:36,236
What is it?

115
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,526
-None of this is real.

116
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,961
We're caught in the
middle one big Jutsu.

117
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,096
-What do you mean?

118
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,531
-It's true.

119
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,734
We're inside of Yakumo's
genjutsu right now.

120
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,104
I know it seems as if Hidden
Leaf Village has been ravaged

121
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,607
by war, but everything
you see here

122
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,242
is nothing but an illusion.

123
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,543
-So what?

124
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,777
-The entire village
isn't real then?

125
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:58,881
We're all just trapped
in one big genjutsu?

126
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,115
I'm not buying it.

127
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,451
There's no way
that could be true.

128
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,719
-Oh, no?

129
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,721
But if her latent powers
have finally awakened,

130
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:08,190
it would be easy for her.

131
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:09,992
-The whole village?

132
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:11,493
The ground we're standing on?

133
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,831
The sky, everything is genjutsu?

134
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:18,700
-Heightened senses can
occasionally be a weakness.

135
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:22,070
No matter how superior
one sight or smell may be,

136
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,874
it's ultimately the human brain
that receives and interprets

137
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:26,575
information.

138
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:33,982
The mind is a vastly intricate
network of electrical impulses.

139
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:36,652
There's a lot of room for error.

140
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,588
But the senses of the
insect are minimal.

141
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,957
Unlike the human
brain, the insect mind

142
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,929
utilizes the barest amount
of information necessary.

143
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,532
Look, my insects are
still under control.

144
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,668
They can't be deceived.

145
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,043
-Within the confines
of Yakumo's genjutsu,

146
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,713
she'll often call down
lightly or start fires,

147
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:09,985
and our human minds perceive
those phenomena to be real.

148
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,722
Our brains are turned against
us causing actual damage

149
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:14,923
to the body.

150
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:25,033
-So grandma's mansion, that
was Yakumo's power, too?

151
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,468
-And that's not all.

152
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,470
Were she feeling
so inclined, she

153
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,872
could easily kill
anyone she chose to.

154
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,645
-So these tremors--

155
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,114
-Are just genjutsu as well?

156
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:39,948
-Just wait.

157
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:54,463
-A serpent.

158
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:57,966
-It's gigantic.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,534
More genjutsu, huh?

160
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:03,005
-It's an image of terror
created in our cerebrums,

161
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,107
but it can't harm us.

162
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,879
That would be unthinkable.

163
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:11,580
Impossible.

164
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,859
-Yakumo?

165
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,860
Kurenai sensei?

166
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:44,613
[scream]

167
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,615
-So tell me the truth.

168
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,918
Yakumo can kill using genjutsu?

169
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:55,090
So is that why the Third
Hokage tried to get rid of her?

170
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,360
[scream]

171
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,335
-Yakumo.

172
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,110
Yakumo.

173
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,608
-Kurenai sensei.

174
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,611
Kurenai sensei.

175
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,614
I'm over here sensei.

176
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,559
-No way.

177
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,694
I don't believe it.

178
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,629
Yakumo would never
do such a thing.

179
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,867
-Every few generations or
so, within the Kurama clan,

180
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,373
children of a special nature
are born to us, such as Yakumo.

181
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,608
Most terrifying
of all is the fact

182
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,377
she doesn't control this power.

183
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,747
It is ruled entirely by the
girl's unconscious mind.

184
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,386
-Man, it's getting
kind of hot in here.

185
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,560
-Don't do it!

186
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,269
-I don't know what's behind
this door, but it can't be good.

187
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
-You can't open it.

188
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,176
-What the heck?

189
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,683
Well, there's something
you don't see everyday.

190
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,258
-It's an illusion our
brains have created due

191
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,492
to Yakumo's genjutsu.

192
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,230
But illusion or no,
were you to dive in,

193
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,366
your mind would
determine it to be real,

194
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,269
and your body would burn up.

195
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,372
That is the power Yakumo wields.

196
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,774
-So that's what this
is all about, huh?

197
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,310
The Third Hokage and Kurenai?

198
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,812
That's why they wanted her gone.

199
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,747
-Nothing of the sort.

200
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,348
They never meant
to kill the girl.

201
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,451
That's not what they were after.

202
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:15,621
What they wanted was to kill
the monster inside of her.

203
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,223
-A monster?

204
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,692
-She was growing stronger
and stronger everyday,

205
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:23,796
and out of that ocean of
power, a creature most terrible

206
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,431
was born.

207
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,501
If left unchecked, it will
eventually take hold of Yakumo

208
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,472
absorbing her
consciousness into its own.

209
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,741
The Hokage and Kurenai
came to a decision.

210
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,444
They believed that the only
way to keep Yakumo safe

211
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,080
was to seal away
the girl's power.

212
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,483
-Trapped inside of her.

213
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,450
No kidding.

214
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,422
So, that's what's going on.

215
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,858
Well, I'm not
sitting around here.

216
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,694
What?

217
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,361
Aaah.

218
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,367
Hiragana, that was
all the money I had.

219
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,602
-I told you.

220
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,737
If you fall in that lava,
your body will be incinerated.

221
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,672
-So what are you saying?

222
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,141
We can't get out of here?

223
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,077
-No, there is one way.

224
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,279
-OK, then what is it?

225
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,448
-If you seal off
your five senses,

226
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,518
the genjutsu will no longer
have any effect on you.

227
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,722
You must escape from this world
of illusion and attack her.

228
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,489
-Attack Yakumo?

229
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,190
Aaah.

230
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:39,863
Huh?

231
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:47,537
It's Satomi Hill.

232
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,940
How'd I get here?

233
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,174
Huh?

234
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:51,842
Unkai?

235
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:59,082
-Well, it looks like you made
it out of her illusion safely.

236
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,083
Did you?

237
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:02,085
-What the hell happened here?

238
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,821
-From the very moment
you brought Yakumo out

239
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:07,324
of that lodge, you
were immediately

240
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:09,292
caught up inside
of her genjutsu.

241
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:09,926
-Huh?

242
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:19,603
Hey, guys, come on.

243
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:22,272
Snap out of it.

244
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,808
Hey, Kiba.

245
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,077
Shino.

246
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,278
-Where are we?

247
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,579
-You've got to get up.

248
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,547
Come on, hurry.

249
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,082
Old man Unkai is wounded.

250
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:32,783
-Unkai?

251
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,254
-What happened?

252
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,790
These burns are awful.

253
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,124
The old man here
is the only reason

254
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,326
we were able to break
free of Yakumo's genjutsu.

255
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,695
You should have seen it.

256
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:46,797
-That's not true.

257
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,733
Actually, we were
all driven out.

258
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,935
Yakumo doesn't care about us.

259
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:54,938
Her only target here
is Kurenai Yuhi.

260
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,039
-So wait.

261
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:57,741
Where is she now then?

262
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,076
-I think I may know.

263
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,079
-What are you doing?

264
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:43,286
-What do you think
of my work, sensei?

265
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,956
Amazing, isn't it?

266
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:48,225
-Yakumo, what did you
do with the others?

267
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:49,159
-You needn't worry.

268
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,927
They're not hurt.

269
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:53,063
I just send them away.

270
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:54,231
I'm not in a hurry.

271
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:56,066
I'll have my revenge
on the Hidden Leaf

272
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,567
Village in due time.

273
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,937
But first, I have some
business with you, sensei.

274
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:03,874
-Yakumo, leave the
village out of it.

275
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:07,644
I know that you're angry, but
this is between you and me.

276
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:09,079
-You're not fooling anyone.

277
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,567
So, impressive, huh?

278
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,802
I could let you live, or
kill you in a heartbeat.

279
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,673
Your fate rests
entirely with me.

280
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,208
Tell me the truth.

281
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:43,079
My father and mother were both
eliminated, and then my clan.

282
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:48,084
And once they were all gone,
the village set its eyes on me.

283
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,786
All by order of the third.

284
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:50,382
-No.

285
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,062
Yakumo, the Third
Hokage would never

286
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:00,197
have ordered such a mission.

287
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,599
-Why are you lying to me?

288
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:15,078
Tell me the truth.

289
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,713
Now.

290
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:20,083
If you don't Kurenai sensei,
I'll send you into oblivion.

291
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:23,086
-You poor, sad child.

292
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,855
If killing me will put an
end to all your suffering,

293
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:28,091
then you should just
go ahead and do it.

294
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:34,164
So long as this deep hatred
can finally be put to rest.

295
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,765
-Oh, save it.

296
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,669
Your crocodile tears
aren't fooling anyone.

297
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:47,911
-1,001, 1,002,
1,003, 1,004, 1,005.

298
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,012
Whoa, Nellie.

299
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,114
Rain or shine, there's
nothing like breaking

300
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,750
a sweat with a little training.

301
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,219
Huh?

302
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:57,954
There's more them, huh?

303
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,289
All right then.

304
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,224
Get ready Kurama
clan, here I come.

305
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,664
Huh?

306
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,640
I see.

307
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,808
So you were caught in
their genjutsu as well.

308
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,610
-Yes, sir.

309
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:23,079
-Well, you're alive, and
that's all that really matters,

310
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,682
am I right?

311
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:28,285
Whoa-ho, you got
back in no time.

312
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,954
So, uh, where's the cavalry?

313
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:34,257
-Sorry, you guys, but there's
no time to explain right now.

314
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,925
-Huh?

315
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,693
Hey.

316
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,928
Hold on a second.

317
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,298
What was that all about?

318
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,265
Hmm?

319
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,100
So who's this?

320
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,669
You want to fill me in?

321
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,270
-You'll just have to wait.

322
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:48,972
This man needs help.

323
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,173
-Yeah, but--

324
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,207
-Please, just hurry.

325
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:51,908
-OK.

326
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:55,745
-Byakugan.

327
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,687
-Them again.

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,856
-Yakumo, stop this.

329
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,825
-They're together
right now in a room

330
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,927
in the center of the building.

331
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,595
-Come on.

332
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,064
-Wait a sec.

333
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,065
Hold on!

334
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:21,805
Kiba!

335
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,681
[theme song in japanese]

336
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,539
-What's the situation now, guys?

337
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,542
-We haven't seen Naruto
since he went in.

338
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,210
-My insects have
detected something odd

339
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,578
and returned to me.

340
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:10,079
-Hinata, is your
Byakugan any help?

341
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:13,950
-There's some kind of powerful
force getting in the way.

342
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,954
And all we can do
is watch and wait.

343
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:19,122
-So what?

344
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:22,559
We just cross our fingers
and hope for the best?

345
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,130
Next time, the Supposed
Sealed Ability.
