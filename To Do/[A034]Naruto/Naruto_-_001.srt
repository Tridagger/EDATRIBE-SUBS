00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,100
NARRATOR: 12 years ago, a nine
tailed fox suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,266
Its tails lashed out,
smashing mountains and sending

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,100
tidal waves crashing
to the shores.

4
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:31,466
The ninja rose up to
defend their villages.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,933
-Hold the attack and wait
for the fourth Hokage!

6
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,000
-It's getting closer!

7
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,733
Don't let it near the village!

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,066
NARRATOR: One shinobi
faced the nine tailed fox

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,133
in mortal combat.

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,066
He sacrificed his life
to capture the beast

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,100
and seal it in a human body.

12
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:56,233
This ninja was known
as the Fourth Hokage.

13
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:04,296
[baby crying]

14
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,396
-[laughing]

15
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,930
-Naruto, come back here!

16
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:16,951
When I get my hands on you!

17
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,885
-You've crossed the
line this time, Naruto!

18
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:24,818
-[laughing]

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,185
-Give it up!

20
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,551
You're just bent
because you don't

21
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:30,585
have the guts to do what I do!

22
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:31,218
Do you?

23
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,718
Losers!

24
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:32,851
Wannabes!

25
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,685
You'll never catch
me! [laughing]

26
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:36,585
-Lord Hokage!

27
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,451
It's an emergency!

28
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:41,118
-I hope you're not bothering
me with some trivia.

29
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,551
And don't tell me
it's Naruto again.

30
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:44,785
-It is Naruto again!

31
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,685
He climbed onto the
great stone faces!

32
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:50,285
-He put graffiti
all over the Hokage.

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,285
-[sigh]

34
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,251
-Naruto!

35
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,018
-Hold on!

36
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,651
-[laughing]

37
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,551
-That was too easy.

38
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,918
-Oh yeah, Naruto?

39
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,018
-[screaming]

40
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,651
-Where'd you come
from, Iruka-sensei?

41
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,985
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,485
-No, what are you doing here?

43
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,785
You're supposed to be in class.

44
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,885
I'm at the end of
my rope, Naruto.

45
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:26,151
You failed the
graduation test last time

46
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:27,818
and the time before that.

47
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,551
Tomorrow, you've
got another chance,

48
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,385
and you're messing up again.

49
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,051
-Hmph!

50
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,085
Fine!

51
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,151
Because you missed
it, Naruto, everyone

52
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,385
will review the
transformation jutsu!

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,051
-Aww.

54
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,551
-All right, Sakura here.

55
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:43,885
Let's do it.

56
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,951
Transform!

57
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,285
-You transformed into me.

58
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:47,885
Good.

59
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:51,651
-Yes!

60
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:52,918
I did it!

61
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,451
-I kicked butt!

62
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,418
-Yes!

63
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,818
Sasuke, did you see that?

64
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,585
-Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

65
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,651
Uh, good.

66
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,018
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

67
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,151
-This is a total
waste of time, Naruto.

68
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,818
-We always pay for
your screw-ups.

69
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,885
-Like I care.

70
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:24,285
-Naruto.

71
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,518
Do your best.

72
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,118
-Transform!

73
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,051
-Ooh. [giggle]

74
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:34,516
-Huh?

75
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,068
-[laughing] Gotcha!

76
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,868
That's my sexy jutsu!

77
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,101
-Cut the stupid tricks!

78
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:46,001
This is your last warning!

79
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,334
-This sucks.

80
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,468
Loser.

81
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,601
-You're not going home
until you've cleaned off

82
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,768
every single drop of paint.

83
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,201
-So what?

84
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,234
It's not like there's anyone
waiting at home for me!

85
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,434
-Naruto?

86
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,701
-What do you want now, sensei?

87
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,001
-Well, I was just thinking.

88
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,934
Maybe after you
clean this all up,

89
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,601
I could take you
out for some ramen.

90
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:30,401
The good stuff.

91
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:33,201
What do you think?

92
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,668
-Huh?

93
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,034
Now that's some
serious motivation!

94
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,001
I'll have this clean in no time!

95
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,568
Enter Naruto Uzumaki!

96
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,301
-Naruto.

97
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,401
-Hm?

98
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:59,268
-Why would you do that
to the Hokage faces?

99
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,301
I mean, you know who the
Hokage are, don't you?

100
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:06,368
-Course I do. [slurping]

101
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,634
Everybody knows.

102
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,701
They were the greatest
shinobi of their time, right?

103
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,768
The best of the best.

104
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,201
Undefeated ninja champs.

105
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,701
And the Fourth
Hokage's the one who

106
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,068
saved the village from
the nine tailed fox.

107
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,434
He was the most amazing.

108
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,834
-Then why did you--

109
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,568
-Because I'm going to be
greater than any of them.

110
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,501
Me.

111
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,434
Naruto.

112
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,201
The next Hokage!

113
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,001
A ninja legend!

114
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,901
Then everyone will have
to stop disrespecting me

115
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,668
and look up to me.

116
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,268
Believe it!

117
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:45,768
Uh, by the way, I kind of want
to ask a little favor, sensei.

118
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,434
-You want another bowl?

119
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,468
-Uh-uh.

120
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,768
I want to try on your headband.

121
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,368
Come on, please?

122
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,401
-Oh, this?

123
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,668
No way.

124
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,268
You can only wear
the Leaf headband

125
00:05:56,301 --> 00:06:00,068
when you finally graduate from
the Academy and become a ninja.

126
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,268
You've got to pass
the test tomorrow.

127
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,401
-That is so uncool!

128
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,601
-Hey, is that why you
took off your goggles?

129
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,234
-I want another bowl!

130
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,301
-We will now start
the final exam.

131
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,268
When your name is called,
proceed to the testing room.

132
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,734
The final test will
be on the clone jutsu.

133
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:23,401
-Ugh, that's my worst technique!

134
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,068
Great!

135
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,568
I'm never gonna pass!

136
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,868
All right.

137
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,234
Get it together, Naruto.

138
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,201
You can do this.

139
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:33,683
Believe it.

140
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,434
Clone jutsu!

141
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,634
You fail!

142
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,601
-Iruka-sensei.

143
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:57,768
He's off, but his moves weren't
bad, and he did hang in there

144
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,968
and replicate.

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,768
This is his third
try, so you know

146
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,234
he really wants
to become a ninja.

147
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:05,034
We could cut him a
break and pass him.

148
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,434
-Mizuki-sensei,
the other students

149
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,568
created at least three
effective replications.

150
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,734
But Naruto could only
create one, and look at it.

151
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,401
It's pitiful.

152
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,401
I can't pass him.

153
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,568
-[growling]

154
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:24,268
[interposing voices]

155
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,234
-There.

156
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,868
You see him?

157
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,234
It's that boy.

158
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,734
I heard he's the
only one who failed.

159
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:43,701
-Hmph.

160
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:45,101
Well, it serves him right.

161
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,934
-Just imagine what would
happen if he became a ninja.

162
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,268
I mean, he's the boy who--

163
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,301
-Shh.

164
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,601
We're not allowed
to talk about that.

165
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:05,001
-Iruka, there's something
we need to talk about.

166
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:15,701
-Iruka-sensei's tough,
but he's not against you.

167
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:16,501
-Then why?

168
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,801
Why only me?

169
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,834
-He wants you to be
strong with all his heart,

170
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:26,001
but that will never happen
if he goes easy on you.

171
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:27,668
He's like you, you know?

172
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,034
No parents, no family.

173
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:34,301
-But this time, I really
wanted to graduate.

174
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,968
--[laughs] Then I guess
I have to tell you.

175
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:45,201
It's a secret, but I'm
going to let you in on it.

176
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:45,683
-A secret?

177
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,834
-Iruka.

178
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,734
-What is it, Lord Hokage?

179
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,768
-I know how you feel.

180
00:08:56,801 --> 00:09:00,101
You grew up just like
Naruto, without knowing

181
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,468
the love of a mother and father.

182
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,401
The warmth of a family.

183
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:08,468
-It's getting closer!

184
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,668
Don't let it near the village!

185
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,134
-Let me go!

186
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:15,268
My mom and dad are still
fighting back there! [screams]

187
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,668
[knocking]

188
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,468
-Iruka-sensei, wake up.

189
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,601
-Huh?

190
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:22,334
-What?

191
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:23,501
What is it?

192
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:26,534
-You need to come to
Lord Hokage's right away.

193
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,501
It's Naruto.

194
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,801
He stole the sacred scroll.

195
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,301
-You mean the scroll of sealing?

196
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:32,868
No!

197
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,668
-Let's see.

198
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,301
The first one is
multi-shadow clone jutsu.

199
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,268
Ugh, not this again!

200
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,201
It's my worst jutsu!

201
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:48,068
-Lord Hokage, this
is not just a prank!

202
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,301
This is a serious crime!

203
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:51,101
-That scroll
contains secrets that

204
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,001
were sealed by the First Hokage!

205
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,301
Secrets known only
to our village!

206
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,834
-If it falls into
the wrong hands,

207
00:09:56,868 --> 00:10:01,134
they could destroy our
entire way of life.

208
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,068
-All right.

209
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,701
Bring Naruto here at once.

210
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:04,301
-Sir!

211
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,601
-Where would he go?

212
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,434
-Now that I've told
everyone what Naruto did,

213
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,634
I can eliminate him.

214
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,468
They'll be glad he's gone.

215
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:33,268
And of course, I keep
the scroll for myself.

216
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:47,564
-[panting]

217
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,179
-It's all over.

218
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:55,112
-[laughing]

219
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,412
-Huh?

220
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,512
-Got me already.

221
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:58,546
Not bad.

222
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:59,779
You're quick, sensei.

223
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,946
I only had time to
learn one technique.

224
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,946
-He's been out here practicing.

225
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,712
I can tell how hard
he's been working.

226
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,012
-Listen, Iruka-sensei.

227
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,712
I'm going to show you
this amazing jutsu,

228
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,112
and you're going
to let me graduate.

229
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,546
Then everything will be OK!

230
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,946
That's the way it works, right?

231
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,346
Anyone who learns a jutsu
from this scroll passes!

232
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,112
-Huh?

233
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,712
Where'd you get that idea?

234
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,812
-Mizuki-sensei told me about it.

235
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,246
Believe it!

236
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,079
He told me where to find
the scroll, and this place.

237
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,179
-Huh?

238
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,146
Mizuki?

239
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:29,646
Huh?

240
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,546
Look out!

241
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,779
-I see you found
our little hideaway.

242
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,512
-So that's the way it is, huh?

243
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,512
I should've known.

244
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,279
-Naruto!

245
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,446
Give me the scroll, now!

246
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,346
-Wait a minute.

247
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,779
What's going on here?

248
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,912
-Naruto, don't let
Mizuki get the scroll!

249
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,746
It contains forbidden
jutsu that could

250
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,112
put this village
in great danger.

251
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:01,279
Mizuki used you to get
the scroll for himself,

252
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,212
for his own power!

253
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,246
-Naruto, Iruka's just
trying to scare you

254
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,412
because he doesn't want
you to have the scroll.

255
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,112
-Stop lying, Mizuki!

256
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,112
Don't let him trick you, Naruto!

257
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:20,846
--[laughing] Oh, I'll tell
you who's really lying,

258
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,246
-No, Mizuki!

259
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,812
-They've been lying to you
your whole life, Naruto,

260
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,512
since the decree 12 years ago.

261
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,846
-What decree?

262
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,412
-Everyone knows except you.

263
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,912
Iruka's trying to hide
it from you even now.

264
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,846
He'd do anything to shut me up.

265
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,079
-What is this decree?

266
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:40,279
Why does everyone
else know about it?

267
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,346
-Don't tell him!

268
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,279
It's forbidden!

269
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,012
-The decree is no
one can tell you

270
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:48,412
the nine tailed
fox is inside you.

271
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,279
The fox spirit that
killed Iruka's parents

272
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,746
and destroyed our village
has taken over your body.

273
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,746
You are the nine tailed fox.

274
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,279
-Stop it!

275
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,912
-They've all been sneaking
around hiding things from you

276
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,379
your whole life.

277
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,946
Didn't you think it was
strange how they treated you?

278
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,646
Like dirt, like they hated
you for just being alive!

279
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,212
-No!

280
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,479
No, no, no, no!

281
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,479
-Naruto!

282
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,679
-That's why you will never
be accepted in this village.

283
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,512
Even your beloved
sensei hates your guts!

284
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,379
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Iruka,
Naruto never had a mother

285
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,379
a father to care for him.

286
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:29,012
He's shut out of everything
and doesn't know why.

287
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,212
Most people won't
even look at him.

288
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,979
How would you feel if
everywhere you went,

289
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,512
people turned
their backs on you?

290
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,046
That's why he gets in trouble.

291
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,012
So people will notice him.

292
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,679
It may not show, but
he's always thinking

293
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:45,012
about the family
he doesn't have.

294
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,412
He's hurting inside.

295
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:48,379
-Die, Naruto!

296
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,612
-Naruto, get down!

297
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,879
-[groan]

298
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,246
-Why?

299
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,946
-Because we're the same.

300
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,812
When I lost my parents,
no one seemed to care.

301
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,912
They didn't have time for me.

302
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:21,212
They just forgot I was there.

303
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,346
My grades dropped.

304
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,812
I became the class clown.

305
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:29,979
I just wanted them to see
me and to know my name.

306
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,812
My schoolwork wasn't good
enough to get their attention,

307
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,046
so I did crazy things.

308
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,112
And then I had to pay for it.

309
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,946
It was hard.

310
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,546
I know that's how
you feel, Naruto.

311
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,212
You feel lonely and
it hurts inside,

312
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:52,412
and I could have been
there for you more.

313
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,579
I let you down.

314
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,812
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:57,646
No one should have
to suffer that much.

316
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,512
No one should be
alone like that.

317
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:05,346
-[laughing] Don't make me laugh!

318
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,212
Iruka always hated you!

319
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:11,046
He was orphaned because the nine
tailed fox killed his parents,

320
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,812
and that beast is
now inside you!

321
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:17,712
He'd say anything to
get the scroll from you.

322
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:20,579
-Naruto!

323
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,779
Naruto!

324
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:26,379
--[laughing] You know,
once he makes up his mind,

325
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,012
nothing can change it.

326
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:32,979
He's going to use the scroll
to take revenge on the village.

327
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,612
You saw that look in
his eye, didn't you?

328
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:39,179
Those are the eyes of a beast.

329
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:39,579
-No.

330
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,446
Naruto isn't like that!

331
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,312
-You're a joke.

332
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:52,546
As soon as I eliminate
Naruto and get the scroll,

333
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,846
I'll be back for you.

334
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,846
-[groaning] I won't let you.

335
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,546
-This is not good.

336
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,879
Mizuki has a big mouth.

337
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,612
He made Naruto feel so bad.

338
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,246
Worse than he's ever felt.

339
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,746
It could unleash the
power inside of him.

340
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,879
If Naruto keeps tampering
with the scroll,

341
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,379
the seal that locks the
fox spirit inside of him

342
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,912
could be broken, and the
beast could come out.

343
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:29,012
If that happens,
I fear for us all.

344
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:34,612
-Naruto, everything
Mizuki said was a lie!

345
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:35,579
Give me the scroll!

346
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,379
Hurry!

347
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:40,312
He's coming after
you to take it away!

348
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,279
[groan]

349
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,446
-It can't be.

350
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,412
How did you know?

351
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:08,946
Naruto, how did you know?

352
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,246
That it was me, and not Iruka?

353
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,612
-[laughing]

354
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:18,579
-Because I'm Iruka.

355
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,579
-You're a fool.

356
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:22,779
Why are you
protecting that freak?

357
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:25,479
He's the one that
wiped out your family.

358
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,979
-I don't care what you say.

359
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,679
You're not getting your
hands on that scroll.

360
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,546
-As if you could stop me.

361
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,779
Don't you get it?

362
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:34,612
Naruto is just like me.

363
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,312
-How's that?

364
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,412
-He wants the school for his
own power and his own vengeance.

365
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,146
That's how beasts are.

366
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,546
He'll pour all his rage into the
scroll and destroy everything.

367
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,046
-You're right.

368
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,212
-[gasp]

369
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:52,946
So it's true.

370
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,646
Iruka-sensei never
believed in me.

371
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,012
He thinks I'm some beast!

372
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,379
Some kind of freak!

373
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,146
-That is how beasts are.

374
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,646
But that's not who Naruto is.

375
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,279
He's nothing like that.

376
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,612
Naruto is one of a
kind, works hard,

377
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,179
puts his whole heart into it.

378
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:15,912
Sure, he messes up sometimes,
and everyone jumps on him.

379
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,346
But his suffering only
makes him stronger.

380
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:21,579
That's what separates
him from being a beast.

381
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:22,812
So you're wrong.

382
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:24,979
He's nothing like
the nine tailed fox.

383
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:29,379
He's Naruto Uzumaki of the
Village Hidden in the Leaves.

384
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,779
-Hmph!

385
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,079
You really believe that drivel?

386
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:39,579
Iruka, I was going to
save you for later,

387
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,846
but I changed my mind.

388
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,846
You're finished!

389
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,612
-So this is it.

390
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,446
-[grunt]

391
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,012
-Naruto!

392
00:18:56,846 --> 00:19:00,179
-Not bad, for a little punk.

393
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:05,612
-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you!

394
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,012
-Such big words.

395
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,412
I can completely destroy
you with a single move.

396
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:11,946
-Take your best shot, fool.

397
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,679
I'll give it back to
you a thousand fold!

398
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:16,912
-Let's see you try!

399
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,712
Show me what you can
do, nine tailed fox!

400
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:20,912
-Shadow clone jutsu!

401
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,512
-Naruto.

402
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,012
Those aren't just illusions.

403
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,379
They're solid clones.

404
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:40,512
He's mastered an
extremely advanced jutsu.

405
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,379
-Huh?

406
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,579
Wha-- what is this?

407
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:44,446
[interposing voices]

408
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,412
-If you're not coming, then
we're going to come after you.

409
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,812
-[screams]

410
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:58,379
[punching]

411
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,979
-[groaning]

412
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:08,712
-Sorry.

413
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,279
I kind of got carried away.

414
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:11,179
You OK, Iruka-sensei?

415
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,212
-Yeah.

416
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:16,579
He's amazing.

417
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:19,179
He wants to surpass
all the Hokage.

418
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:22,046
And I'm starting to
believe he might do it.

419
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:27,279
Naruto, come here a minute.

420
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:29,912
I've got something
I want to give you.

421
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,979
[interposing voices]

422
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:35,279
-You're telling me no
one can find Naruto?

423
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:35,946
-Not a clue.

424
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:37,212
-This is bad news.

425
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,712
We've got to smoke
him out or something.

426
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,446
-There's no longer
any need to worry.

427
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:45,412
-Lord Hokage!

428
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:46,679
-The scroll's safe.

429
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,479
Naruto will be back soon.

430
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,779
-Sensei, how much longer?

431
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:54,412
-OK, you can open your eyes now.

432
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,446
Congratulations.

433
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,212
You graduate.

434
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:16,146
And to celebrate,
I have a surprise.

435
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,379
We're going out
for ramen tonight.

436
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:25,246
Huh?

437
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,246
-Iruka-sensei!

438
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,179
-Hey, that hurts!

439
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,579
Naruto.

440
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:32,912
This is only the beginning.

441
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:35,679
The road gets tougher
now that you're a ninja.

442
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,379
But if I told you that, I
guess it would ruin the moment,

443
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:41,612
so I'll tell you later.

444
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:42,512
Over ramen.

445
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,628
[music - akeboshi, "wind"]

446
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,033
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Why
are you following me?

447
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,933
You want to become
the Fifth Hokage?

448
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,633
Listen up, you little shrimp.

449
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,833
I don't care if you are
the Hokage's grandson!

450
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,633
You can't just snap your
fingers and become a top ninja!

451
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,033
You'd better be ready,
squirt, because if you even

452
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:38,133
think about being a Hokage,
you'll have to beat me first.

453
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,366
Next time, My Name
is Konohamaru!
