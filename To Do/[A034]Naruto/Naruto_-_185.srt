[eerie groaning]

[growl]

4
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:36,214
-Huh?

5
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,406
Sorry about that.

6
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,346
Ah, for the love
of-- you didn't?

7
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
I guess not.

8
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:52,915
I could still use
a shower though.

9
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,417
I really worked
up a sweat today.

10
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,033
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "The
Legend from the Hidden Leaf,

00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,167
the Onbaa."

12
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:19,775
-Nothing beats hard
work and elbow grease.

13
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,016
Huh?

00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,356
[barking]

15
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,191
-What's up?

16
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:36,926
Why all the barking?

17
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,928
-He says you kind
of reek, Naruto.

18
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,863
You been skipping
bath time lately?

19
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,031
-Hey, you watch it, bub.

20
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:43,899
I'm not in the mood, OK?

21
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,468
-Seriously, you stink.

22
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:50,206
-Oh, right I forgot
about that eagle.

23
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,974
Oh hey, Sakura.

24
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:52,741
-Well, well.

25
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,709
Hey there lazy bones.

26
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,010
I heard you haven't
got a mission.

27
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,146
-It's not like I'm
just lounging around.

28
00:03:57,146 --> 00:04:01,016
-No kidding, you've really
been going at it, huh?

29
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,284
You ripped your pants.

30
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:02,885
-Huh?

31
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:03,486
Where?

32
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,420
Oh, you're right.

33
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,455
I didn't even notice.

34
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,724
-Ah, hopeless as ever.

35
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,092
You can bring them by later.

36
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,427
I'll stitch them up for you.

37
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:12,361
-Like, for real?

38
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:13,863
You mean it?

39
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:17,099
I can't believe how kind
you're being to me, Sakura.

40
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,168
That may be the
nicest thing you've

41
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:22,404
offered to do for me
my whole entire life.

42
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,372
-All right, all right.

43
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:27,309
Don't get carried away.

44
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:27,910
Naruto!

45
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:38,254
-Wait!

46
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,321
I don't understand.

47
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,090
What did I do?

48
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:44,193
-You just put your
hands on me, didn't you?

49
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,995
-Of course not.

50
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,162
I wouldn't do that.

51
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,832
-And what about those grubby
little paws sticking out

52
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:53,969
of your pockets, huh?

53
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:54,444
Wait.

54
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,305
What the--

55
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:58,240
-Huh?

56
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:00,709
Ah.

57
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:01,810
-Check your back.

58
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:02,778
-Ah!

59
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,481
What the heck is that thing?

60
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:06,382
-Onbaa.

61
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:06,916
Onbaa.

62
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,221
-What did that eagle eat?

63
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,790
-There's some kind of creature
on your back, you idiot.

64
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:15,424
-What is it?

65
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:16,759
Some kind of caterpillar?

66
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,200
-Get it off.

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,893
Get it off.

68
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,028
Nah, it's not a bug.

69
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,897
It's a little animal.

70
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:25,167
It doesn't want to let go.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,035
-Onbaa.

72
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,871
Onbaa.

73
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,773
-Ah, why does this happen to me?

74
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,884
-Hm.

75
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,719
I don't suppose any
of you have ever

76
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:45,854
been told the
legend of the Onbaa?

77
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,156
-Onbaa?

78
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,892
It's not ringing any bells.

79
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,294
-You're familiar with
it, aren't you Shizune?

80
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,329
-Sorry.

81
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,431
How old a story are
we talking about here?

82
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,466
Something out of folklore?

83
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:01,170
-Well, that's what
I always figured.

84
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:04,173
A long time ago, when I
was still a little girl,

85
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:08,277
I was told of a legend, the
tale of a dangerous bearlike

86
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,079
creature known as
an Onbaa living

87
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:12,348
in the mountains
near our village.

88
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:15,718
Then one day, that
little idiot, Jiraiya,

89
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,253
pledged to spend him summer
break studying the creature

90
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:20,489
and headed off into
the woods like a loon.

91
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,424
-The Pervy Sage did?

92
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,025
-Yep.

93
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,896
-What are you, deranged?

94
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,866
You don't seriously believe
there's an Onbaa out there,

95
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,934
do you?

96
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,769
-Well, we'll just see,
won't we, once I've

97
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,771
completed my investigation.

98
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,772
-Whatever.

99
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,207
Even if there was
an Onbaa out there,

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,175
it wouldn't want
anything to do with you.

101
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,811
-What do you know, you
billboard of a female?

102
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:44,213
-I'm not a billboard, you jerk.

103
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,081
And there's no such
thing as a stupid Onbaa.

104
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:46,915
-Yeah?

105
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,484
You want to bet on it?

106
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,252
-Sure thing, pipsqueak.

107
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,054
-I'm betting on
Jiraiya this time.

108
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,426
-OK, guys.

109
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,230
I'm off to wrestle me an Onbaa.

110
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:04,233
-So did Pervy Sage ever
find one of them or not?

111
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,335
-He returned to the
village three days later

112
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:09,171
and said he'd won
through a ring out move.

113
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:10,039
The little liar.

114
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,413
Aw, there it is.

115
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,486
-What am I looking at?

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,022
That's the worst
handwriting I've ever seen.

117
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,358
-Oh, like you're one
to talk, you dummy.

118
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,993
-Let's see now.

119
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:34,430
Onbaa big, about nine feet tall.

120
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,965
When these frightening
beasts get angry,

121
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,336
no one can match them, but
I beat one at wrestling.

122
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,871
Are you kidding me?

123
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,174
Onbaa children are
carried piggyback.

124
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,176
This is how they are raised.

125
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,912
Ah!

126
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:52,081
-I thought his little
chronicle was hogwash

127
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:54,249
ripped from the
pages of the legend.

128
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:57,086
Although, seeing is
believing, I guess.

129
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,021
-That's great and
all, but can we

130
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:01,323
get back to my problem
for a second here?

131
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,325
He's stuck to my back like glue.

132
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,460
-Oh, right.

133
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,795
Well, let's see,
according to legend,

134
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,997
the Onbaa offspring
consider the first thing

135
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,833
they see as their
mother, and will

136
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,302
cling to that creature's
back exclusively.

137
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:16,004
They supposedly ride around
in this unusual fashion

138
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,940
until they've reached
full maturity.

139
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,142
But before that
fateful day arrives,

140
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,144
the two are never separated.

141
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,179
-I guess you're just going
to have to wait for it

142
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,748
to grow up, Naruto.

143
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,283
-Oh, yeah, that's
an awesome idea.

144
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,285
What the heck am I gonna
do when this thing is

145
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,288
a nine foot tall behemoth?

146
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:35,257
-Ah.

147
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,358
-Oh, that's great you guys.

148
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,360
Thanks a lot for the support.

149
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,095
-Relax, it's just a legend.

150
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,030
I'm sure you'll be fine.

151
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,399
-I don't find that
very reassuring.

152
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,300
-Onbaa.

153
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,901
Onbaa.

154
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,176
-Hang in there, Naruto.

155
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,879
-We'll be on the
sidelines cheering for ya.

156
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,947
-Well, feel free to come
join me on the field!

157
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,386
What are you doing?

158
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,288
-I will not be out done.

159
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:08,157
-This isn't a weight, you know.

160
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,846
Spill it, Hinata.

161
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,147
What's up?

162
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,417
-Uh, well, it's just I
heard this weird rumor.

163
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,351
-Really?

164
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,786
How weird?

165
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,724
-People are saying, well,
you have a baby with you.

166
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:44,059
-Oh, you mean this guy?

167
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,060
-Onbaa.

168
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,995
Onbaa.

169
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,298
-Oh.

170
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:49,832
-Huh?

171
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,767
Hinata.

172
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,734
Hey, are you OK?

173
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:53,268
Hinata.

174
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,803
Hinata, speak to me.

175
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,109
-Onbaa.

176
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,110
-Ah

177
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,712
-Onbaa.

178
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:05,480
-What the-- Hinata!

179
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:06,163
-Onbaa.

180
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:22,331
-You don't like it?

181
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:25,334
What are ya, a gourmet?

182
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,935
[running water]

183
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:27,418
-Ah!

184
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,180
I get the feeling
I'll be spending

185
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,849
a lot of time in the tub.

186
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:41,324
-Onbaa.

187
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:41,850
Onbaa.

188
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,926
-You know, we don't
allow pets in here, son.

189
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,294
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,897
The health department is
pretty strict about it.

191
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,833
-I missed out on dinner because
of the little fuzz bucket.

192
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,034
Just this once, OK?

193
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,770
-He sure is a cute little
fella, I'll give you that.

194
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:02,771
-Yeah.

195
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,440
You got a name for
your friend there.

196
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,341
-Onbaa.

197
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,843
Onbaa.

198
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,479
-That's about all he says, I
guess we should go with that.

199
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,847
-Onbaa, huh?

200
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,361
-He looks like he's
eyeballing your soup.

201
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:26,929
-Huh?

202
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,338
-Onbaa.

203
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,140
-One side of fishcake, old man.

204
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:38,907
-Coming up.

205
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:58,427
[growling]

206
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,442
-Ever since Onbaa
latched onto my back,

207
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,178
I get all the cushiest
jobs in the village.

208
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:17,946
Seems like a good deal to me.

209
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,752
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): He's
bigger now, and so quickly.

210
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:29,891
This is bad.

211
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,150
-All right, Naruto,
your current mission

212
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,119
is to get rid of the
mountain bandits holed up

213
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,454
in the Yamabuki Pass.

214
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,088
-What?

215
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,356
All of them?

216
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,558
Come on, grandma, you're only
trying to get rid of Onbaa

217
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:58,294
now that he's getting
bigger, right?

218
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,629
-No, of course, not.

219
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,298
It's just I been keeping
an eye on you lately.

220
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm impressed with the
amount of growth I've seen.

221
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,736
-OK, so who am I going away?

222
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:11,307
TSUNADE: No, no, no, I think a
solo recon will be sufficient.

223
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,310
This is what you were
talking about, after all.

224
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,047
-You want him out of here, I
see the writing on the wall.

225
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:18,488
-Onbaa.

226
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,590
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): It's
all in fate's hands now.

227
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,091
-Come on, let's
get back to work.

228
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,309
-Gee, Mister, thanks a lot.

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,688
Na- Na- Naruto.

230
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,656
Naruto.

231
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,160
Boy, Onbaa, I sure am having
a blast hanging out with you.

232
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,265
Forget that old
stick in the mud,

233
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:12,201
if grandma thinks she can
split us up now, she's crazy.

234
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,303
I'll wipe the floor
with those bandits

235
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:17,073
so we can finish up the mission
and return to the Hidden Leaf

236
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,641
Village with our
heads held high.

237
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,409
Does that sound like a plan?

238
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,010
-Onbaa.

239
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,986
-All right, you
bandits, open up!

240
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,158
-Who are you, you little snot?

241
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,026
-Yeah, kid.

242
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,561
-What are you doing here?

243
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,097
-You're looking at
Naruto Uzumaki and Onbaa.

244
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,631
You jerks ready?

245
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:43,733
-Say what?

246
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,235
-Kill him!

247
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,603
-Shadow clone jutsu.

248
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,377
-Onbaa.

249
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:54,977
-Onbaa!

250
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:01,050
That may have just been
a clone, but anyone

251
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,053
who lays a hand on Onbaa
is gonna answer to me.

252
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,632
How bout it?

253
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,600
You had enough yet?

254
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,105
-Onbaa.

255
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,039
-Thanks, buddy.

256
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,074
That was a close call.

257
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,313
Onbaa, you really
saved me there.

258
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,648
I owe you one.

259
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,282
-Onbaa.

260
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,624
-Now, let's get
back to the village.

261
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,693
Wait till they here how you did.

262
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,296
Onbaa, I don't care
what anyone says,

263
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:50,166
there's no way you're a
threat to the Hidden Leaf.

264
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,700
You and I will be
like Kiba and Akamaru.

265
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:55,438
The Naruto Onbaa duo,
joined at the hip.

266
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,411
What the heck was that?

267
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,446
-Onbaa.

268
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,314
-Hey, don't you worry, buddy.

269
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,482
I'll take care of you.

270
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,246
Onbaa, is that thing

271
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,209
Is that your mother chasing us?

272
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,111
Why she so mad?

273
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,748
Ah, I didn't steal him, I swear!

274
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,251
Hey, come on, say
something, will ya?

275
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:42,733
-Onbaa.

276
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,422
-Are you crazy?

277
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,291
What are you doing?

278
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,627
You've got the wrong idea.

279
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,195
Onbaa, this is your mother.

280
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,064
Give her a hug or
something and quick.

281
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,505
You don't understand!

282
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,105
Ah!

283
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,710
-Onbaa.

284
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:08,310
Onbaa.

285
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,315
-Onbaa.

286
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,016
-Onbaa.

287
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:14,498
-Onbaa?

288
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,521
-Aw.

289
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,121
-Onbaa.

290
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,325
-Onbaa.

291
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,808
Onbaa.

292
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,031
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
All right, I've

293
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,432
had just about enough of this.

294
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,134
I mean, if you're a
mother, you should

295
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:36,038
have taken better
care of your kids.

296
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,706
-Look, lady, you
don't have to worry.

297
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:41,010
I'm giving Onbaa
back to you, OK?

298
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:41,510
Huh?

299
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:42,211
Why am I so light?

300
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,690
Onbaa, you got so
big all of a sudden.

301
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,230
Hey, uh, come on, talk to me.

302
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,197
What's wrong?

303
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,570
This can't be happening.

304
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,057
Wait a minute,
Onbaa, it's me, OK?

305
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,258
Just take it easy.

306
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,429
I mean, you and I are
like two peas in a pod.

307
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:36,432
Come on, Onbaa,
you can remember.

308
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,301
Look, it's your old
pal, Naruto Uzumaki.

309
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:42,104
He gave you all the fishcake.

310
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,205
Fishcake, your favorite.

311
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,442
That stuff that
looked like this.

312
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,443
You see?

313
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:51,013
Ring any bells for ya?

314
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,349
Come on, buddy, it's me, Naruto.

315
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,589
Don't you remember
riding on my back?

316
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:02,324
We went everywhere together.

317
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,670
[growl]

318
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,271
-I guess this is it.

319
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,110
Huh?

320
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,618
-Onbaa.

321
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:32,287
-Onbaa.

322
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:35,057
-Onbaa.

323
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,459
-I don't know about
you, but I'm bushed.

324
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:47,336
Comfy.

325
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,738
I could lie here forever.

326
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,273
Best piggyback
ride I've ever had.

327
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:58,662
Onbaa.

328
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,703
So long, Onbaa!

329
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,242
Enjoy your new life
with your mother, OK?

330
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:32,581
Okie dokie.

331
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:43,425
You should see the
look on your face.

332
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:47,096
-The Onbaa are no longer
a legend, are you happy?

333
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,965
They're mating like rabbits in
the woods outside the village,

334
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,368
and the eagles are scooping
them up and dropping them here.

335
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,304
-Onbaa.

336
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,705
-Onbaa.

337
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,174
-Naruto, how do you get
rid of these things?

338
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,409
Tell me.

339
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,711
-Hard to say, there was a
bit of wrestling involved.

340
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,379
Maybe you should try that?

341
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:05,748
-Don't screw with me.

342
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,283
The village will be
buried at this rate.

343
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,284
-Onbaa.

344
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:09,767
Onbaa.

345
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,331
TSUNADE: Spill it, Naruto!

346
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,333
NARUTO: Don't look at me.

347
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:40,449
[theme music]

348
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,796
NARUTO: Me and Shino
had to go settle

349
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,332
a dispute over some
dead guy's will.

350
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,667
On the way there,
this creepy old lady

351
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,537
appeared on the road and
muttered, even the dead laugh

352
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,305
in Motoyoshi Village.

353
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:16,876
We had no idea what we were
getting ourselves into.

354
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:21,013
The stuff we saw there, it makes
my blood run cold just talking

355
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,815
about it.

356
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,251
Next time, "Laughing Shino."

357
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:29,588
I can't even go to the
bathroom alone at night.
