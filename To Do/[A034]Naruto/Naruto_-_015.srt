[theme music]

2
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:54,277
-Where is he?

3
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,647
Where's the needle
attack coming at us from?

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,084
Are they clones?

5
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,086
We've got to find the real one.

6
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,355
Which one is it?

7
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:06,525
-Look into every nerve
as hard as you like.

8
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,695
You will never learn the secret.

9
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,696
-Oh, yeah?

10
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,098
Shadow clone jutsu!

11
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,732
-No!

12
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:12,667
Don't!

13
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,669
[yelling]

14
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,885
-These mirrors only
reflect my image,

15
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:30,122
allowing me to transport
myself at light speed.

16
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:36,196
Through my eyes, you appear
to be moving in slow motion.

17
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,132
-I knew it.

18
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:40,868
-It's a blood mark
trait, Kikegenkai.

19
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:42,670
[man laughing]

20
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,639
-Kikegenkai?

21
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,241
What is it?

22
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:47,210
-It's my Sharingan.

23
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,712
He inherited it.

24
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:49,980
-But that means--

25
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,048
-Yes.

26
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,251
Even I can't copy that jutsu.

27
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:55,821
There's no way to destroy it.

28
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:57,723
And no way to stop him.

29
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,099
-I couldn't break through.

30
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,367
So what?

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,937
He's not going to stop me.

32
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,372
I'm not giving up.

33
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:13,276
And I'm not going to die
here because I have a dream.

34
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,712
And no one's going to
take it away from me.

35
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,681
Someday, I'll be
respected in my village.

36
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:23,088
That's my dream, to be
the greatest Hukage.

37
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,323
-Dreams.

38
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,192
The bridge will
be the battlefield

39
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,894
where our dreams collide.

40
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:33,268
Now, I must fight for my dream,
just as you fight for yours.

41
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,904
Please do not blame me.

42
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:39,008
I fight for someone
who is precious to me.

43
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,377
I live for him.

44
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,282
And I face death for
him, so that his dream

45
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,350
may become reality.

46
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:47,686
That is my dream.

47
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,891
And for the sake of
that dream, if I must,

48
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:55,128
I will act as a shinobi
and take your lives.

49
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,841
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "Zero
Visibility-- The Sharingan

50
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:12,117
Shatters."

51
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,751
-Sasuke.

52
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,085
Naruto.

53
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,087
Take this guy out!

54
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,455
You can do it.

55
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,857
-Don't, Sakura.

56
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,126
Don't push them.

57
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,593
-Huh?

58
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,663
-Even if they
somehow found a way

59
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,700
to overcome the mirror
jutsu, they still

60
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:28,137
couldn't defeat this ninja.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,038
-Uh.

62
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,473
How can you be so sure?

63
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,512
-They have the desire to win.

64
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:38,216
But they don't have
the instinct to kill.

65
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:43,389
That boy is a whole other breed.

66
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:45,258
He lives for pain.

67
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,328
He thrives on it.

68
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:50,665
-Exactly.

69
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,868
Your village has
become complacent.

70
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:57,507
Your trainees never learn the
most important lesson of all,

71
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,910
to kill the feelings
in their own hearts.

72
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:01,912
To crush an opponent
mercilessly.

73
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:05,317
To destroy with no
emotion or regret.

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,618
-Uh.

75
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:10,156
But then, Sensei, what
are we going to do?

76
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,157
Please tell us.

77
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:17,665
-I could make a break to
save Naruto and Sasuke,

78
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,503
but he'd slay the
bridge builder.

79
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:26,610
If I use shadow clones-- nah.

80
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,079
He'd just match them
with water clones.

81
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:30,581
I'd be wasting chakra.

82
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:37,157
So I have no choice.

83
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,893
It's me or Zabuza, here and now.

84
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:43,364
I'll have to do
this the hard way.

85
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:46,201
-The Sharingan.

86
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:46,802
-Sharingan.

87
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:53,277
-You're no fun Kakashi,
using the same old trick.

88
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:01,654
-Huh?

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,599
-Sensai, no!

90
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:21,613
-If it's just an old
trick, why did you stop me?

91
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,690
-Let your opponent see
your jutsu too many times,

92
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,593
and he'll find a way
to use it against you.

93
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,362
-Then, count yourself lucky.

94
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:39,202
You're the only man alive
who's seen my Sharingan twice.

95
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,703
Show's over.

96
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,238
There won't be a third time.

97
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,212
-Even if you didn't
see me, you'd

98
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,515
have no chance against Haku.

99
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:50,115
-Oh.

100
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,123
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Is that possible?

101
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:59,793
That boy in the mask is
stronger than Kakashi Sensai?

102
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:03,265
-When I found him, he
was just a street kid.

103
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,636
But I trained him in the most
advanced ninja techniques.

104
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,128
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): I taught
him everything I know.

105
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:36,907
Plus, he had special abilities
that he refined on his own.

106
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,780
The boy developed quickly.

107
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:46,219
Soon, he could face the most
powerful enemy, out-numbered,

108
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,188
in total darkness.

109
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,223
It didn't matter.

110
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:53,395
He could strike with
perfect accuracy.

111
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:58,201
He cared nothing for his own
life or the lives of others.

112
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:01,805
He'd become a unique
fighting machine, a shinobi.

113
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,414
In the end, his power
surpassed even mine.

114
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,017
His bloodline trait,
the Kikegenkai,

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,553
cannot be defeated by anyone.

116
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,823
I've created a tool
that can destroy

117
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,192
anything that stands in my way.

118
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:21,663
Unlike the useless punks
who follow you around.

119
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,466
-I didn't get do him.

120
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,368
Then, I'll try it again.

121
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,337
As many times as it takes.

122
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,240
Shadow clone jutsu!

123
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,706
-Naruto!

124
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,575
Don't!

125
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,909
[yelling and fighting]

126
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,872
[grunting]

127
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,340
[yelling and fighting continues]

128
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:07,721
-How is he doing that?

129
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,591
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
It was barely there.

130
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:10,892
But I saw it.

131
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:21,271
I could see the trails
and follow his moves.

132
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,642
-One more time.

133
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,645
Shadow clone jutsu!

134
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:29,019
[yelling]

135
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,594
-Don't you see
that it's useless?

136
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,049
[yelling continues]

137
00:09:58,718 --> 00:10:00,220
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I can see his speed.

138
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:02,223
But that doesn't
mean I can match it.

139
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:12,803
The water, it's being repelled.

140
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,906
What if I try something else.

141
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:19,444
Not water but-- yes.

142
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:20,913
Now, it's my move.

143
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:28,055
-You think those Genin
punks together can be Haku?

144
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,594
He's the ultimate, a
battle tool of destruction.

145
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:33,061
-Are you finished bragging?

146
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,665
You're starting to put me sleep.

147
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,234
Let's finish this.

148
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,736
Now.

149
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,037
-Fine.

150
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,739
But there's one more
thing you should know.

151
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,709
A little more
bragging, as you say.

152
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:46,212
-Hm?

153
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:50,117
-Did you really think our last
battle was just win or lose?

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,520
That took your attacks
like some rank Genin?

155
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,734
[grunting and coughing]

156
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:11,310
[yelling]

157
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,311
-He's finished.

158
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,954
-Haku was there, hiding,
watching every move you made.

159
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:22,491
Studying your Sharingan.

160
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:25,962
Haku can see a jutsu once
and immediately devise

161
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,098
a lethal counterattack.

162
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:30,434
It's one of his gifts.

163
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:32,303
-Oh.

164
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:34,539
-I've been waiting to
see the look on your face

165
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:38,210
when you realize you're
Sharingan has become worthless.

166
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:39,645
-Huh?

167
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,617
-You once said the same
jutsu won't work on me twice.

168
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,621
Well, now, I'm telling you that.

169
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,356
-Huh?

170
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,858
-Ninja art.

171
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:51,860
Hidden misjutsu.

172
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:52,461
-Uh.

173
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,982
-Ninja art.

174
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,818
Hidden misjutsu.

175
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:11,419
-Uh.

176
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:22,566
This is it.

177
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:34,915
TAZUNA (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

178
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,851
The mist is so thick.

179
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,753
Visibility is zero.

180
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,354
-Sensai.

181
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,329
-Sakura, stay with Tazuna.

182
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,530
-Oh.

183
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:48,966
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I have
to be strong and believe

184
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,202
in Sasuke, Naruto,
and Kakashi Sensai.

185
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:55,207
And I have my job to do
no matter what it takes.

186
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,008
-Hm?

187
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,345
Oh, Sakura.

188
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,914
-Follow my lead, Mr. Tazuna.

189
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,850
And whatever
happens, stay close.

190
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:03,851
-All right.

191
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:05,220
I'll stay right behind you.

192
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,294
-I know you need me, Zabuza.

193
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:12,662
I'll finish them off quickly.

194
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:19,505
-Shadow clone jutsu!

195
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:22,574
[yelling]

196
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,777
SHADOW CLONE (VOICEOVER):
He just won't give up.

197
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:33,188
What?

198
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:33,889
Fireball jutsu?

199
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:42,366
[yelling and fighting]

200
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,035
SHADOW CLONE
(VOICEOVER): It shouldn't

201
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,938
be taking this long
to defeat them.

202
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:51,511
[yelling and fighting]

203
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,084
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Got him that time.

204
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,552
I'm starting to get the timing.

205
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,802
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): It's
the hidden mist jutsu.

206
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,406
But this mist is too
thick even for Zabuza.

207
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,908
How can he fight in it?

208
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:52,321
-Very skillful, as I'd
expect from Kakashi,

209
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,556
the Sharingan warrior.

210
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,968
-His eyes are closed.

211
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,103
-But next time
you see me will be

212
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,074
the last time you see anything.

213
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,779
Without your Sharingan,
you're nothing.

214
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,149
-What?

215
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,084
-You wanted me to
believe you could

216
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:19,588
see through anything,
even through time.

217
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,960
[yelling]

218
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:24,895
-How?

219
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:28,066
Can you see into the future?

220
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,934
-Yes.

221
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,071
This is your last battle.

222
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,074
Ever.

223
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,076
But your prediction was wrong.

224
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,945
I'm still alive.

225
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,181
So you're a fraud, Kakashi.

226
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:41,449
You can't read the future.

227
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,985
And you can't read me.

228
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,188
The Sharingan is
just a cheap trick

229
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:48,625
that makes you seem more
powerful than you are.

230
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:54,265
I know now your Sharingan as two
separate elements, the piercing

231
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,604
eye which sees every
detail and the hypnotic

232
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,875
eye which mesmerized
your opponent.

233
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,080
Employing these abilities you
can execute multiple jutsu

234
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:08,183
in quick succession
to make it seem

235
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,752
like you could see the future.

236
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,191
First, with the
piercing eye, you

237
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,561
copy my movements instantly.

238
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:20,966
This replication of movement
makes me doubt my own thoughts.

239
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,210
Once I was shaken, you
infiltrated my mind,

240
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:31,679
waiting for this
slightest flutter

241
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:35,217
to anticipate my actions,
seeking out any hints

242
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:37,887
to my next move.

243
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,491
All you're doing is
copying me like a monkey.

244
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:44,128
You can beat me
with cheap tricks.

245
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,531
I'll crush you.

246
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,367
When I'm finished
with you, you'll

247
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,736
never open that
monkey mouth again.

248
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:55,842
You time it precisely,
waiting for the right moment.

249
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:56,878
-What is that?

250
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,913
-The instant my mind
because unfocused,

251
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:02,117
you create a new illusion.

252
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,253
With your hypnotic
eye, you induce

253
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,958
me to make hand signs while
you are making the same signs.

254
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,995
So you seem to be copying
me when actually you're

255
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,764
controlling my movements.

256
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,932
-Water-style.

257
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,401
Giant vortex jutsu.

258
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:25,614
-Impossible.

259
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,855
Now, that I know this.

260
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,791
A very simple plan
can defeat you.

261
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:38,863
First, neutralize your piercing
eye with zero visibility mist.

262
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:46,106
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): The mist
is slowing my reaction time.

263
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,711
-Next, neutralize your hypnotic
eye by keeping my own eyes

264
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:52,080
closed.

265
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,318
You can't bore into my mind if
you can't look into my eyes.

266
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,322
-Brilliant, except
with your eyes closed,

267
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,359
you can't see me either.

268
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:03,662
-Have you forgotten
who I am, Kakashi?

269
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:05,597
I'm the demon of
the hidden mist,

270
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,532
master of the silent kill.

271
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,569
I can take you our
by sound alone.

272
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,915
SHADOW CLONE (VOICEOVER):
He read my movements,

273
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,819
but that's not possible.

274
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,522
-I was so close, but I
couldn't quite get to him.

275
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:28,659
-Naruto, can you do it again?

276
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:29,160
-Huh?

277
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:30,028
Of course.

278
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:30,762
Nothing can stop me.

279
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:31,897
Believe it.

280
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,000
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He
doesn't want to show it,

281
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,468
but he's exhausted.

282
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:38,972
The shadow clone jutsu
uses up so much chakra.

283
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:42,276
But thanks to him,
I figured it out.

284
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,047
I know how to break through.

285
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,350
SHADOW CLONE (VOICEOVER):
The human eye cannot track

286
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,385
my movements.

287
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,854
It must have been a coincidence.

288
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,497
-Naruto, run for it!

289
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,466
Get out of here and
attack from the outside.

290
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,335
Hurry!

291
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:03,036
-Uh.

292
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:03,570
All right.

293
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,572
You got it.

294
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:06,974
-You cannot escape.

295
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,892
-You think you can keep me here?

296
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,263
Forget it.

297
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:24,997
-That's it.

298
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,231
Fire-style.

299
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,233
Fireball jutsu!

300
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,136
-I couldn't get passed him.

301
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,538
-That was good, Naruto.

302
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,540
-Huh?

303
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,510
One more time?

304
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,244
-Yeah.

305
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:02,945
Let's do it.

306
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,353
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): There must
be a limit to his chakra, too.

307
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,988
I can feel him slowing down.

308
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,634
SHADOW CLONE (VOICEOVER):
No more games.

309
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,903
I need to stop this now.

310
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,371
This time you'll stay down.

311
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:30,746
-Sasuke!

312
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:41,693
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): An enemy
you can't see and can't hear.

313
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:45,498
It's been a long time since
I faced anyone this tough.

314
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:50,705
And Sasuke and Naruto, I don't
know if they can hold out.

315
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:55,377
Stay calm.

316
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,579
Think.

317
00:20:56,612 --> 00:21:00,384
Where will he strike?

318
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,351
The bridge builder.

319
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:19,374
-Too late.

320
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:25,215
[screaming]

321
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,798
[music playing]

322
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:13,184
NARUTO: Why did it
turn out this way?

323
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,987
How could this have happened?

324
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,690
I never asked for
your protection.

325
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:21,761
I didn't need you
to do what you did.

326
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,396
I hated you.

327
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:27,034
Yet, you sacrificed
your life for mine.

328
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:28,218
I'll never forgive you.

329
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:34,885
Next time, "The Broken Seal."
