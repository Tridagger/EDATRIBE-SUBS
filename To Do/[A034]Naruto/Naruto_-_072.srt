[theme music]

2
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,800
-I sense that Sasuke
has stopped moving,

3
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:59,171
but he's still a
long way ahead of us.

4
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,708
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
If Sasuke's stop,

5
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,312
it must mean he's
caught up to them.

6
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,781
Come on!

7
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,518
-Did I just smell what
I think I smelled?

8
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:09,589
-Huh?

9
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:10,224
What is it?

10
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,292
What's wrong?

11
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:12,127
-What is it?

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,397
You smell some kind of trouble?

13
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,104
-Strange I never
noticed it before.

14
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,245
Sakura, did you use the
same shampoo as I do?

15
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:28,488
Back Minty Rainforest
Mist, right?

16
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,091
With extra body?

17
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:30,759
-What?

18
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,127
Are you kidding me?

19
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:35,600
-But I wonder why my coat looks
so much glossier than yours.

20
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,036
-Knock it off, will you!

21
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,407
It's no time to be talking
about hair products!

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,308
-Sorry.

23
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,044
Just making an observation.

24
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,881
-I smell like a dog.

25
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,384
I smell like a dog.

26
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:45,985
-Huh?

27
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,287
Sakura?

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,357
-I smell like a dog.

29
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,059
I smell like a dog.

30
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,764
I smell like a dog.

31
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,532
-Gah.

32
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,135
Look what you've done.

33
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:56,869
Sakura!

34
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:57,805
-Where are you going?

35
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:00,643
You won't get very
far without me!

36
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,413
NARUTO: A mistake from the past!

37
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:03,815
A face revealed!

38
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,627
-Oh, geez.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,895
-If it isn't Sasuke Uchiha.

40
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,271
-This is as far as you guys go.

41
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:18,440
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Oh man.

42
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,443
Gaara, where are you
when we need you?

43
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:22,913
You picked a lousy time
to be out of commission.

44
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,350
This Uchiha kid is trouble.

45
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:31,362
-So, what're you
going to do, huh?

46
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:32,630
-Go, Kankuro.

47
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:34,400
Get Gaara away from here.

48
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,779
I'll take care of this one.

49
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,849
-Don't be a fool, Temari.

50
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,387
This kid's too much for you
to handle all by herself.

51
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,722
-Don't argue.

52
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,527
Our mission is to make
sure that Gaara is safe.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
He's our first
and only priority.

54
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,402
Don't worry about me.

55
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,975
This is what I've
been waiting for.

56
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,879
Get going, Kankuro.

57
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:05,152
-No you don't!

58
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:05,653
Damn.

59
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:10,628
-Take this!

60
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,677
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Bad timing.

61
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,713
I would have to
face this Uchiha kid

62
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,784
when my chakra is almost gone.

63
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,528
I'm in real trouble if
he uses his Sharingan.

64
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,301
I've got to force him to waste
a lot of his chakra and quickly.

65
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,004
It's my only chance.

66
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:37,807
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Should I use the Chidori

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,146
and try to take her our quickly?

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,616
Hell, why not?

69
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,878
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
Hm He's holding back.

70
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:03,751
Saving his chakra for Gaara.

71
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,221
-Wind Scythe jutsu!

72
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:18,977
[shout] Is that the
best you can do?

73
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,447
Sand Storm jutsu!

74
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,999
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I've got to do something

75
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,737
about that damn fan of hers.

76
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,374
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
Still holding back.

77
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,811
This fight won't
last long that way.

78
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:39,980
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Oh well.

79
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:40,981
Can't be helped.

80
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:46,557
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Good.

81
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:50,531
I was wondering when you
were going to get serious.

82
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,166
-Fire Style!

83
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,439
Phoenix Flower jutsu!

84
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,075
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
That's more like it.

85
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:12,034
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Now to finish her off.

86
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,537
Fire Style!

87
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,976
Fireball jutsu!

88
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,448
Did I get her?

89
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,020
-Wind Scythe jutsu!

90
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:25,390
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
I've got you.

91
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,364
-You're mine.

92
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:33,837
All mine.

93
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:44,756
Hah.

94
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,691
What the!

95
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:46,458
A substitution?

96
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh no!

97
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,494
-Gotta run.

98
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,598
I've wasted way too much
time on you already.

99
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,528
-Hopefully I held him off long
enough for Gaara to get away.

100
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,141
-Whoa.

101
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,011
-Wha-- what the hell's going on?

102
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:44,090
-Who or what is that?

103
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,693
-What is this?

104
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,529
Who the devil are you?

105
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,301
-You have lost it, old man.

106
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,137
Don't you recognize me?

107
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,406
It's me, Orochimaru.

108
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,548
-It can't be.

109
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:02,221
Then you've mastered even
that forbidden jutsu?

110
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:09,433
[chuckling] It's been 10
years of hard work since I

111
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,603
left the village.

112
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,340
-You're no longer human.

113
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,009
You're a demon!

114
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:24,759
[laughter]

115
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,697
-So he did it after all.

116
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,367
-This is why I
could never choose

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,737
you to be the fourth Hokage.

118
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,607
Your mind and soul are twisted!

119
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,815
[chuckling]

120
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,487
-So I've finally
been found out, eh?

121
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,362
Aw, such a pity.

122
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,331
-Orochimaru.

123
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:28,367
Explain yourself.

124
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,702
What is the meaning of this?

125
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,307
-And after I set all
those booby traps

126
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,479
to give me plenty of warning.

127
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,549
I wasn't expecting you.

128
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,085
I should've known.

129
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:40,954
You could get past anything.

130
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,491
-A steady flow of
people have gone

131
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:45,797
missing from the village--
genin, chunin, even

132
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,265
ANBU black ops.

133
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,168
Many of them were
last seen with you.

134
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:52,240
And you've been acting
rather strange lately.

135
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,109
-You.

136
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:54,678
A superior shinobi.

137
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:58,484
How could you have
done such a thing?

138
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:01,824
-Now I'll have to
kill you as well.

139
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,760
-So you admit it.

140
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:06,598
Then it is all your
doing, Orochimaru.

141
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:07,599
But why?

142
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,970
What exactly are
you up to in here?

143
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,640
-Oh well.

144
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,309
Since you've caught
me red handed

145
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:17,049
there's no point in
pretending now, is there?

146
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,818
Its research.

147
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,822
I'm developing jutsu.

148
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:24,929
-And for that you sacrifice
your fellow shinobi?

149
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:29,604
-It's forbidden jutsu
you're after, isn't it?

150
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:32,876
Just what is it you want?

151
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,246
-I want everything.

152
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,549
-Everything?

153
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,284
What exactly?

154
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:47,201
-I want to know every
jutsu in the world.

155
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:50,773
And even those jutsu
yet to be discovered.

156
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:54,746
I'm like the one who first took
blue and yellow, consciously

157
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,553
mixed them together and
created a new color, green.

158
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:01,525
Only in my case, the
color blue represents

159
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:05,264
chakra, the color
yellow, a hand side,

160
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,102
and the green, a new jutsu.

161
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,608
And just as there are countless
shades of color in the world,

162
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:15,482
there must be an almost
limitless number of jutsu.

163
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:19,255
To find them, to unlock
the truth long hidden

164
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:25,666
from mortal eyes, that takes
years, endless experimentation.

165
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,270
Ultimately, the
truth reveals itself

166
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,008
only to one who
proves himself worthy,

167
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,781
one who is willing to
sacrifice years of his life.

168
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:36,184
But alas.

169
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:39,489
I've found there are not enough
years in even the longest life.

170
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:43,095
This mortal existence
is too fleeting.

171
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,263
Yes.

172
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:47,569
Even if I were named
Hokage, one day I would die

173
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,406
and that would be the end of it.

174
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:53,145
Orochimaru, what sort of
forbidden jutsu have you

175
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,781
been seeking here?

176
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,717
-Oh.

177
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,019
I think you've already guessed.

178
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:07,870
Eternal youth and immortality.

179
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:20,592
able The Immortality jutsu.

180
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,764
a technique for eternally
recycling one's spirit

181
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:24,832
on Earth.

182
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:28,606
In a way, it's a kind
of revival jutsu.

183
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,581
You find a body, a young body,
pour your spirit into it,

184
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,049
and make it your own.

185
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,863
I was using my old
familiar form until now,

186
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,800
because I wanted
our reunion to be

187
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,707
a nice nostalgic one, sensei.

188
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,613
Growing old is a
sad, empty thing.

189
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:57,688
I only have to look at you
to be reminded of that.

190
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:00,292
You will die here, old man.

191
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,397
While I move on to
another stronger body.

192
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,302
But first, I really
must thank you

193
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:11,611
and all the Leaf Village for
preparing my next body so well.

194
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:16,954
[gasp]

195
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,390
-Now I understand.

196
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,324
It's Sasuke Uchiha.

197
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:32,560
-Exactly.

198
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:34,330
You guessed it.

199
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,901
It's Sasuke I want.

200
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:41,208
-So you've mastered a jutsu
that preserves your soul forever

201
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,978
in the bodies of others.

202
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,615
How many bodies
has it had already?

203
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,018
How many faces?

204
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:47,853
-Hm.

205
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:49,756
Two or three, perhaps.

206
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,863
But I'll wait for Sasuke
until he's ripened a bit.

207
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:56,935
And then when he's been raised
and trained to my liking.

208
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,808
Tell me.

209
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,981
Which face would you
prefer me to wear?

210
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:08,188
Perhaps it would be easier for
you to look on a familiar face,

211
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,660
as you die cursing your
brief, wasted life.

212
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,500
-You monster.

213
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,889
Lord Hokage!

214
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,799
[chuckling]

215
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,272
-You really shouldn't
lower your guard, sensei.

216
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,273
That's your problem.

217
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,743
You've always been naive.

218
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:47,688
[panting]

219
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,691
ENMA: What's wrong with you?

220
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,161
This isn't like you.

221
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,162
-I'm sorry.

222
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,554
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Those eyes.

223
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:31,228
Always with malice and ambition
hidden just behind them.

224
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,764
Almost hidden.

225
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,634
I had seen it.

226
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:39,275
I had seen it, but
pretended not to notice.

227
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,679
Your strength and abilities.

228
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:43,449
You were the sort
of student that

229
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,387
comes along once
in a generation.

230
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,524
It was a time of
war and darkness.

231
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:52,665
We had need of ninja
like you, I thought.

232
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,401
I wanted to believe
that in you I'd

233
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,639
found the one worthy
of succeeding me.

234
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:58,408
You're right.

235
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,311
I was naive.

236
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:04,017
And it was my weakness then
that brought all these troubles

237
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,487
to us now.

238
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,492
-What are you planning to do?

239
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,459
Kill me, sensei?

240
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:13,333
-Ninja Art!

241
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,167
Summoning Tombstone!

242
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,813
-But can you go through with it?

243
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,183
I wonder.

244
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,486
Sarutobi-sensei!

245
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:25,987
-Hm!

246
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,586
-Kill him, Sarutobi!

247
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:45,588
Now is your chance!

248
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:09,762
Sarutobi, why?

249
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,632
-I couldn't do it.

250
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:20,914
Now I'll correct my mistake
and bury you once and for all!

251
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,751
It's time to end this!

252
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:26,324
-Hm.

253
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:28,427
I'm afraid it's too late now.

254
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:35,205
-Shadow Clone jutsu!

255
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:35,773
-No.

256
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,175
Shadow clones?

257
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,614
He's going to exhaust what
little chakra he has left!

258
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:41,650
-Heh.

259
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:44,555
You'll only shorten
your life, sensei.

260
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:48,494
I think your impatience is
getting the better of you.

261
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,964
-Could it be?

262
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,900
Is he?

263
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,271
[casting spell]

264
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,515
-Yes.

265
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,418
That's the bunch of hand signs.

266
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,319
I knew it!

267
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:17,644
[laughter]

268
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:21,617
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): So, it's
just as the fourth Hokage said.

269
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,986
This is the Reaper.

270
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,255
The Face of Death.

271
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:28,529
Invisible to all but the
one who casts the jutsu!

272
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,133
-Whatever you're
planning, it's too late.

273
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:31,968
It's over.

274
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,538
I've won.

275
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,741
The Leaf Village will fall.

276
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:38,847
-You're forgetting that the
Leaf VIllage is my home.

277
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,586
And as Hokage, I am entrusted
with my home's protection.

278
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,424
I am head of the household,
the central pillar!

279
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,230
He would destroy my home
must first destroy me.

280
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:52,736
And I warn you, it
will not be easy.

281
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,138
-Genjutsu!

282
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,307
Infinite Darkness jutsu!

283
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:04,957
-What nonsense.

284
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:06,960
In the grand scheme
of time, you're

285
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:09,298
just a trivial footnote
in the brief history

286
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:12,937
of a cluster of huts
called the Lead Village.

287
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,442
[grunting]

288
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,920
OROCHIMARU: In time,
the Hokage stone faces

289
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:26,460
will crumble and be
worn down to nothing.

290
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,163
-You've never
understood that it's

291
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,200
far more than a mere
cluster of huts.

292
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:40,651
It is a place where every
year, shinobi are born, raised,

293
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:44,758
grow old, fight and die
to protect their home.

294
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,668
[grunting]

295
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,373
These people are precious to me.

296
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,343
We share a home.

297
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,179
We share a life.

298
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:24,492
And though we may not ties of
blood, they are precious to me.

299
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:25,493
They are my family!

300
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:32,973
[chuckling]

301
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,909
OROCHIMARU: The pillar
of your village.

302
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,914
A pillar full of
termites and rot.

303
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:40,052
I don't have to knock you down.

304
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,189
You're already falling.

305
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,223
-Heh.

306
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:46,329
And if I do fall,
you still will fail.

307
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:49,201
I am only one of a long line.

308
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:53,341
I carry this title in trust for
those Hokage who came before

309
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,511
and those who will come after!

310
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,449
I am the third Hokage!

311
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,722
You can't stop it
by destroying me.

312
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,694
A new and stronger Hokage
will take my place,

313
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:10,737
becoming the pillar, roof, and
walls that defend the village.

314
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,044
Now, Orochimaru, get ready.

315
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:17,749
For I'm about to perform
a jutsu that even

316
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:20,587
you haven't seen before.

317
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,923
Behold!

318
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:24,460
Sealing jutsu,
Reaper Death Seal!

319
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,048
[theme music]

320
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:12,421
HOKAGE: Every year,
shinobi are born,

321
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:16,261
raised and nurtured, trained to
fight to defend this village.

322
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,864
I've watched them grow.

323
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,300
I've watched some of them die.

324
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,803
They are precious to me.

325
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:24,108
We share a bond stronger
than any blood tie.

326
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,679
You've learned many
things, and yet this you

327
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:28,248
will never understand.

328
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,188
They are my family,
and I allow no one--

329
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,526
no one to attack my family!

330
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,264
NARUTO: Next time--
forbidden secret technique!

331
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,531
Reaper Death Seal!
