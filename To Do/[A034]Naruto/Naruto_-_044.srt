1
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:16,519
[music playing]

2
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,290
-All right.

3
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,760
Moving on to the next match.

4
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:50,495
-This year's rookies
look like they

5
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,797
could be quite a challenge.

6
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,374
-Yeah!

7
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:01,342
It's here!

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,476
It's here at last!

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,811
The moment I've
been waiting for.

10
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:06,815
Finally I get a chance
to show what I've got.

11
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,616
-Look at that.

12
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,184
It's us against the kid.

13
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,988
Hey Akamaru, I think you
and I just won the lottery.

14
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,393
NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
It's your moment, Naruto.

15
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,628
Go on, show us.

16
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:21,366
Show us how much you've grown.

17
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,634
-It's my time to shine.

18
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,904
NARUTO UZUMAKI:
Akamaru unleashed.

19
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,839
Who's top dog now?

20
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:36,049
-Now the seventh match, Naruto
Uzumaki and Kiba Inuzuka.

21
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:51,534
-I've been waiting
forever for this.

22
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,836
Sorry, Kiba.

23
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,872
Don't take it personally
if I blow you away.

24
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,708
-That's just what
I was going to say.

25
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,877
Only not so politely.

26
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:02,280
Right, Akamaru?

27
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,281
-Oh, yeah?

28
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,817
Well, talking is easy.

29
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,187
Let's see what you've got to
say at the end of the match.

30
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,223
-Little squirt.

31
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,124
-Wait a second.

32
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,125
Are you kidding me?

33
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,260
What's the puppy doing here?

34
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,828
He's just going
to get in the way.

35
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,830
-Deal with it.

36
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,265
I never go into battle
without Akamaru.

37
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,003
-Come on, isn't that against
the rules or something?

38
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:23,071
-No.

39
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:26,575
Like Shino's bugs,
they are a part of him.

40
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:30,212
He is within the rules.

41
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,113
-Whatever.

42
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:32,249
Fine with me.

43
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:35,185
I do my best work
with a handicap.

44
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,088
-We'll just see about that.

45
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,159
Akamaru, you stay right here
and leave all this to me.

46
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,929
I've got it.

47
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,097
-Go on, Naruto!

48
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,199
You can't lose to this jerk.

49
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:48,901
-The moment is finally here.

50
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,277
(VOICEOVER) Sorry,
Kakashi, but your boy

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,613
doesn't stand a
chance against Kiba.

52
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,782
Not a chance.

53
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,718
(VOICEOVER) Kiba is on my team.

54
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,621
I should be rooting
for him, but I really

55
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,156
want to support Naruto.

56
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:13,063
Kiba wouldn't like
it, but even so--

57
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,938
(VOICEOVER) Naruto.

58
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:20,739
-Oh, man.

59
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:21,707
Kiba is so lucky.

60
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:28,114
(VOICEOVER) I wonder how much
stronger he's gotten since he

61
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,482
became a Genin?

62
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:33,153
INSTRUCTOR: Today we'll work
on your transformation Jutsu.

63
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:35,856
Let's see you transform
into Lord Hokage.

64
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,827
(VOICEOVER) Because if he's
anything like he used to be--

65
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,233
-Transform!

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,980
-Hey, what's going on?

67
00:04:56,013 --> 00:05:00,552
I was having such a nice nap.

68
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:01,419
-Just kidding.

69
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:02,755
Just kidding.

70
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,357
You didn't think that
was for real, did you?

71
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,959
-That's enough, Naruto.

72
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,594
It's your third
year at the academy.

73
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:10,097
Now straighten up.

74
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,298
-How pathetic.

75
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:13,668
Who the heck is that kid?

76
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,536
-I'm glad we switched
to this class.

77
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,604
That guy is hysterical.

78
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:17,906
-Yeah.

79
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,110
He sure keeps things
interesting, doesn't he?

80
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:22,511
-Mr. Popularity.

81
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:25,648
-Try it again, and
no fooling around.

82
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:26,249
-Transform!

83
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:36,995
-Incredible.

84
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,330
Are you serious?

85
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:46,707
[laughing]

86
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,074
-Is this kid for real?

87
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,743
You've been here
three years and can't

88
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,578
do a decent transformation?

89
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,916
What a joke.

90
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,485
-I don't have to
pretend to be hokage.

91
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,921
You just wait.

92
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:01,390
Someday I'm going to
be hokage for real.

93
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:02,291
Then you'll be sorry.

94
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:05,629
-Yeah right.

95
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:07,097
On what planet?

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,309
-Look, I feel sorry for you.

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,946
So I'm going to finish
you off with one shot, K?

98
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,512
-Yeah?

99
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,814
Is that right?

100
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,716
Man, you're even
dumber than you look

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,318
if you think you can beat me.

102
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,821
-You sure talk tough for
such a little squirt.

103
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,769
-When you're ready,
you can begin.

104
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:43,106
-Ninja art of beast
mimicry all force jutsu.

105
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,915
-Here I come.

106
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,705
-This little guy is going
to be out for a while.

107
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:12,741
You can call the match.

108
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:13,575
-Thought as much.

109
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,143
-Yeah.

110
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,213
I thought Kiba might be too
much for him, but that was fast.

111
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,715
-Oh, Naruto.

112
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,751
That was embarrassing.

113
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:22,552
-See?

114
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,321
Told you.

115
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,523
-What was that?

116
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:26,957
-I blinked and it was over.

117
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,592
That kid is pitiful.

118
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,464
(VOICEOVER) Naruto!

119
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,876
(VOICEOVER) So that's it.

120
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:55,190
-And my future dream is
to be the greatest hokage.

121
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,326
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

122
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,430
and start treating me like I'm
somebody-- somebody important.

123
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,433
(VOICEOVER) I always
made fun of his boasting.

124
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:04,401
I thought he was crazy.

125
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,640
NARUTO UZUMAKI: So this
is what a Jonin is.

126
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:12,010
A true elite ninja.

127
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,312
I've got to get away.

128
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:20,553
If I don't, seriously,
he'll annihilate me.

129
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,891
-You're not hurt, are you?

130
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:24,492
Scaredy-cat.

131
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:30,098
Unless you have what it
takes to prove me wrong.

132
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,414
-How do you like this?

133
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:44,348
-Stupid fool.

134
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,150
You don't know
what you're doing!

135
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:57,196
-I may not know the
password, but there's

136
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,434
no way you're the Sasuke I know.

137
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,969
Let's see you try it!

138
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:06,707
-What?

139
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,010
No way.

140
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:10,446
-I was wrong about him.

141
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,022
-Hey, kid.

142
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,024
You're not hurt, are you?

143
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,263
You scaredy-cat.

144
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,843
No way.

145
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,545
I never go back on my word.

146
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,414
That's the way of the ninja.

147
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:56,566
(VOICEOVER) Come on, Naruto.

148
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,937
Show them what you got.

149
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,176
Don't ever-- don't
ever underestimate me!

150
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,684
-Yeah!

151
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,221
-The kid's come a long way.

152
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,989
-Naruto!

153
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,925
-Atta boy, Naruto!

154
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:18,926
-Yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,960
More tough talk.

156
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,795
Look at yourself in a mirror.

157
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,497
You're a mess.

158
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,834
-I just wanted to
see what you've got.

159
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:29,104
Frankly, you hit
like an old lady.

160
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,640
You have a better
chance of winning this

161
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:34,310
if you send that puppy
in to fight for you.

162
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:37,481
-You're going to regret that.

163
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:38,615
Come on, Akamaru.

164
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,858
-Smoke grenades?

165
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:47,059
-Take this!

166
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,118
-This sucks.

167
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,120
I can't see a thing.

168
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,291
Gotta get out of this
smoke-- and fast!

169
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,362
-He fell for it.

170
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:22,801
-What the?

171
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,068
-Darn.

172
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:26,338
The best part, and I
can't see anything.

173
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,224
-Yeah!

174
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,394
This fight is over.

175
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,729
Good doggy.

176
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:47,463
Way to--

177
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,813
Hey Akamaru, what are you doing?

178
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,780
What are you doing?

179
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,182
-Surprise!

180
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:17,164
Gotcha!

181
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:22,990
-You used a
transformation jutsu!

182
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:25,360
You little-- get off!

183
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,196
Let go of me!

184
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:31,066
-You smell even
worse than the dog.

185
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,334
-What did you do with him?

186
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:32,969
Where is he?

187
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,337
-He's right here.

188
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,808
-How did you-- OK.

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,777
-Woah.

190
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,545
Is that really Naruto?

191
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,483
Who would've thought that Naruto
would be a match for Kiba?

192
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,952
-To balance a transformation
jutsu and a clone

193
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,222
jutsu at the same
time-- there's no way

194
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,725
he should be able to do that.

195
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:54,059
-He's got his jutsu down.

196
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:55,661
There's no doubt about it.

197
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:56,729
-Well, well.

198
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,533
Kid's better than I thought.

199
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:02,269
(VOICEOVER) He's certainly
an interesting one.

200
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,205
It's not every day
you see a Shinobi who

201
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:06,608
would bite his opponent.

202
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,576
-Wasn't that amazing?

203
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,545
Amazing!

204
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,513
-That was amazing, Naruto!

205
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,020
-What do you know?

206
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,756
Gotten a little stronger, I see.

207
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,726
But not nearly strong enough.

208
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,461
Because now I'm getting serious.

209
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:24,295
-Oh?

210
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,163
Well, good.

211
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:26,197
I was hoping you
would, because I

212
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:29,468
want to seriously knock you out.

213
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,637
-He's gone to a
higher level just

214
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,272
during the course of this match.

215
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:37,244
That boy never
ceases to amaze me.

216
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:40,914
(VOICEOVER) Can this really
be the same little goof ball?

217
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:42,350
-I don't know what
happened, but this

218
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:45,787
ain't the Naruto
we used to know.

219
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,958
(VOICEOVER) Whatever
training method Kakashi used,

220
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,026
it sure worked.

221
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,562
(VOICEOVER) But still--

222
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:01,841
-Huh?

223
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,217
(VOICEOVER) He's
about to find out

224
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,490
that Kiba and Akamaru
have tricks of their own.

225
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:21,429
-Naruto, if I were you,
I'd let Akamaru go.

226
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,151
-What the heck happened?

227
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,220
What was that thing you fed him?

228
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:43,855
How come all his
fur just turned red?

229
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:48,894
-Are you sure you want to
stick around to find out?

230
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:49,995
(VOICEOVER) Food pills.

231
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,397
(VOICEOVER) That's it.

232
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,701
Kiba is going in for the kill.

233
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:58,439
-Let's go, Akamaru!

234
00:14:58,472 --> 00:14:59,406
Beast mimicry!

235
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,155
-Man beast clones!

236
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:19,164
-He's got a crazy look in
his eyes all of the sudden.

237
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:20,832
Hey, wait a second,
he took something!

238
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:21,599
No fair!

239
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,400
That's cheating!

240
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,702
He ought to be disqualified!

241
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:24,670
-Food pills.

242
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,572
They're just another tool.

243
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,875
They're allowed.

244
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,810
-You're no help at all!

245
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,713
-I don't get it.

246
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:34,615
What was that stuff he ate?

247
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:36,117
-Those are food pills.

248
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,286
-They're what?

249
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,988
-It's something the
military developed.

250
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:41,956
An energy booster
that's so powerful

251
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,727
that troops who take it can
fight for three days and nights

252
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,961
without a break.

253
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,963
But after extended
battling, it can

254
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:51,668
result in high levels of anxiety
and almost total exhaustion.

255
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,376
Right now, Kiba and
Akamaru's Chakra

256
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,378
is at least doubled in strength.

257
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,947
-Let's finish this.

258
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,715
Now!

259
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,551
On all fours!

260
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:06,533
Jutsu!

261
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,181
-Naruto!

262
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:35,586
-It's bad news for Naruto.

263
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,856
Kiba already fights
like a wild beast.

264
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:41,660
His chakra is intense enough
even without enhancement.

265
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:44,597
The idea of these pills doubling
the strength of his chakra--

266
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,635
well, they're the
perfect weapon for Kiba.

267
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,003
(VOICEOVER) Oh no!

268
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:50,604
Naruto!

269
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,977
-They've got me off balance.

270
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,745
Can't counter attack.

271
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,348
All I can do is try
and keep on my feet

272
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,551
and stay out of their way.

273
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:09,293
-Now I got you!

274
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,862
Man beast ultimate taijutsu!

275
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,835
Bang over bang!

276
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,690
-I told you it was
going to get serious.

277
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:51,542
-I will-- I will be hokage.

278
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,345
I will.

279
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,879
-And how are you
going to do that?

280
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,048
By lying flat on your face?

281
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:00,419
I got news for you.

282
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,655
I'm going to be hokage.

283
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:15,203
[laughs]

284
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,672
Come on.

285
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:19,308
Do you really believe a
weakling like you can be hokage?

286
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:22,144
You must be weak in the head.

287
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,681
[laughs]

288
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:25,448
(VOICEOVER) No.

289
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:27,618
You're wrong, Kiba.

290
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,290
Weak?

291
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:36,261
That's one thing Naruto isn't.

292
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,263
-Someday you'll see.

293
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll be Lord Hokage!

294
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:45,038
I'll show you.

295
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,807
All of you.

296
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,379
(VOICEOVER) Unlike me,
unlike the rest of the world,

297
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,982
Naruto always
believed in himself.

298
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,297
It was amazing to see
how difficult everything

299
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:08,333
was for him.

300
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:10,068
But he never gave up.

301
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:22,983
Always alone, no
one watching him.

302
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,985
No one helping him.

303
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,926
No one cared what
happened to him.

304
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,033
-There.

305
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,870
You see him?

306
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,304
-It's that boy.

307
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,341
I heard he's the
only one who failed.

308
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,943
-Well, it serves him right.

309
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,414
-Just imagine what would
happen if he became a ninja?

310
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:50,848
I mean, he's the boy who--

311
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:51,884
-Shh.

312
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,487
We're not allowed
to talk about that.

313
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,090
(VOICEOVER) No
one respected him.

314
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,058
No one even acknowledged him.

315
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,569
-Shadow clone jutsu!

316
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:27,191
(VOICEOVER) But now--
now everyone is watching.

317
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,203
-On your feet, Naruto!

318
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:45,212
(VOICEOVER) Everyone
is acknowledging him.

319
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:05,270
-Sorry, but you can
forget about being hokage,

320
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:09,140
because I'm the top
dog around here.

321
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:25,827
[music playing]

322
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:56,633
NARUTO UZUMAKI: This guy Kiba
is either desperate or dumb.

323
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,736
He's hitting me with
all his jutsu at once.

324
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,871
A ninja has gotta be
careful about that.

325
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:03,842
You never know when your jutsu
might come back to haunt you.

326
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,176
The tables have turned.

327
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,646
He's kicked me around
pretty good so far.

328
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,717
Now I'm going to give it
back to him in spades.

329
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,411
Next time, surprise attack.

330
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:15,345
Naruto's secret weapon.

331
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:16,778
Look out, Kiba.

332
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,245
Have I got a surprise for you!
