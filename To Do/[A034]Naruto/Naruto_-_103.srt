[theme music]

2
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:58,068
-What do you think, Aoi?

3
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,002
What should we do?

4
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,735
I will be accompanying
Fukusuke at sea.

5
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,035
I want you three
to go after Idate.

6
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,835
-Right.

7
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,035
-Hey, Hayate.

8
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,935
The ocean is the other way.

9
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,268
Where the hell do you think
you're going, you idiot?

10
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,468
You have to turn around.

11
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,602
-You can forget about it.

12
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,335
There's no way I'm
turning around.

13
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,302
-Let's go.

14
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,268
-Yes sir.

15
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,568
SAILOR (VOICEOVER): What does
that kid think he's doing?

16
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:38,902
-It looks like the little
fool is running away, Sir.

17
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,802
Not surprising, Idate has
always been like that.

18
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:43,235
SAILOR: You know him?

19
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:45,635
-I guess you could say that.

20
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:53,935
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The Race is On.

21
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:55,368
Trouble on the High Seas.

22
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,568
-I knew that little
bastard would run away.

23
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,902
-I guess it really
shouldn't have

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,568
come as a surprise knowing
him as long as we have.

25
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:10,802
-It was a mistake
to let him run.

26
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,435
-You idiots.

27
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,902
Idate is a better man than that.

28
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,902
-Yes, boss.

29
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:18,502
-I believe in Idate.

30
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:22,502
he must have some sort
of plan up his sleeve.

31
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,202
-Jirocho.

32
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,902
-Chief counselor.

33
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,902
-So tell me, how
will you settle this?

34
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,135
You just turned this
most hallowed tradition

35
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:37,702
into little more than a farce in
the presence of a feudal lord,

36
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,002
no less.

37
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:42,968
-Your Excellency, this race
has only just now begun.

38
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:45,102
Do me the honor of seeing
it through to the finish.

39
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:55,202
-If you're that insistent
then you'd better win,

40
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,602
no matter what.

41
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:02,668
Because if you
lose, I'll see to it

42
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,768
your entire family is
scattered to the wind.

43
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:06,902
-You have a deal.

44
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,735
I'm a man of my word.

45
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,968
If Idate should end
up losing, then you

46
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,802
have free reign to
do whatever you wish.

47
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:21,202
-That is so like you,
Jirocho, stubborn as an ox.

48
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:22,768
I hope you're ready to pay up.

49
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,602
JIROCHO (VOICEOVER): I'm
counting on you Idate.

50
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:36,768
IDATE (VOICEOVER):
Hold on, Boss.

51
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:40,268
Give me all your money.

52
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,335
Don't you move a muscle.

53
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,135
-Huh.

54
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:53,602
Well, a starving thief, huh?

55
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,468
-Shut your mouth.

56
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,168
-This is the grownups game, kid.

57
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,868
You couldn't even peel an apple
with bad thing, could you?

58
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:07,368
Here.

59
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,702
Take it, and remember,
kid, the blade

60
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,202
wasn't invented for the
purpose of hurting people.

61
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,768
You live out on the
street, don't you, son?

62
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,502
I'm Jirocho, the
head of the Wasabi

63
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:33,235
family in Port Degarashi.

64
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:36,368
-Jirocho of the Wasabi?

65
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,702
-How about it?

66
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,335
Why don't you come stay with me?

67
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,568
-Huh?

68
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,568
But why when I was
just trying to--

69
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,702
-When a man is starving,
it's easy for him

70
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,968
to make a mistake like that.

71
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:49,202
It's of no concern.

72
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,035
-Um, this is--

73
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,635
-Forget about it.

74
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:57,102
That was a gift.

75
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,635
Keep it.

76
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,502
But no more thieving antics.

77
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,635
Do we have a deal?

78
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,402
-Mister.

79
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,302
I wish to follow you.

80
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,235
Make me your disciple.

81
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:16,068
I mean, please, Boss.

82
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,335
-What's your name?

83
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,735
-Idate.

84
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:19,668
Idate Morino.

85
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:29,835
-Shall we go then, Idate?

86
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,668
IDATE (VOICEOVER):
Have faith in me, Boss.

87
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,235
I promise I'll win this for you.

88
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,768
-We'll catch up to
him pretty soon.

89
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,968
-But it's too late
now. he won't be able

90
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:46,368
win this far away from the port.

91
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:47,368
-I don't know.

92
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,868
He might have planned
to come this way

93
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:50,502
from the very beginning.

94
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,968
-Huh?

95
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:52,468
-Huh?

96
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:08,702
-(LAUGHING) Well,
this was lucky.

97
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,968
Let's see we put an
end to this right here?

98
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,068
It's funny, isn't it?

99
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:21,035
-Yeah, who'd have thought those
three would be escorting him?

100
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,568
Double lucky.

101
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:31,668
Now I can pay them back
for the Chunin exam.

102
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,735
You two go on ahead.

103
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,735
I'll keep them tied up here.

104
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:39,568
-You got it.

105
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,202
-Finally caught up to ya.

106
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,202
Hey, wait up, will ya?

107
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:44,202
So what gives?

108
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:45,735
Why the heck did
you come this way?

109
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,102
-Will you shut up?

110
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,735
It's none of your
business anyway, kid.

111
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,635
-What's with the attitude, pal?

112
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,068
-I said shut up!

113
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,968
-Watch out!

114
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,902
-I don't think they've
even noticed it.

115
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:00,902
This is genjutsu.

116
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:05,302
-Are you going to
slow down or what?

117
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,635
-I've already been here.

118
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,268
Great, I'm trapped in
some sort of genjutsu.

119
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,468
-Say what?

120
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:15,768
-In this case, release.

121
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:23,868
Over there.

122
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,302
-Hey.

123
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,735
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
No, don't go that way.

124
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,668
-Huh?

125
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,202
What's going on around here?

126
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:37,168
-I'm out.

127
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,335
[yelling]

128
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,435
-Just hold still.

129
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,035
I'll have them pull us up now.

130
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:51,035
-Oh man, that was a close one.

131
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:54,368
-Somebody set up one
genjutsu one top of another.

132
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,435
That's not very
easy to pull off.

133
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,602
-You idiot, if you had just
stopped for two seconds,

134
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,102
we wouldn't be in this mess.

135
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,835
-What did you say?

136
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,335
-Hey, knock it off.

137
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:03,835
Stop.

138
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:04,335
Stop.

139
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,335
Ah.

140
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,802
No, all of my ninja tools.

141
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,602
-Look, I didn't
need your help, OK?

142
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:15,868
-You didn't need it?

143
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,935
Hey, listen, you fat head,
how about a little thanks

144
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:19,135
for saving your life?

145
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:22,135
-You only saved me because
you're bound to by duty.

146
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:23,902
There's no need for
me to thank you.

147
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,468
-What did you say?

148
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,035
-Stop it, Naruto.

149
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,102
He's absolutely right.

150
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,702
But look, if you don't
want to wind up dead,

151
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:35,102
then I suggest you
stick close to us.

152
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,702
-Hey, where you going anyway?

153
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,502
What happened to Port Degarashi?

154
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:40,535
-What about it?

155
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:41,468
Forget that port.

156
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,002
I'm heading north from here.

157
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,035
-You are?

158
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,868
So does that mean
it's faster that way?

159
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,035
-That's right.

160
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,268
-Yeah, maybe.

161
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,635
How do we even know if
we can trust this guy?

162
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:54,802
-That's the problem
with all you ninja.

163
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:55,835
-What?

164
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,335
-Look, at this time
of the year, there

165
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,068
are some pretty
strong seasonal winds

166
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,368
blowing hard across the sea.

167
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:04,635
Back at the starting point,
I noticed the clouds.

168
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,735
I could see the wind
was blowing toward us.

169
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:10,302
On top of that, there's a port
to the north where the ocean

170
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:13,802
current flows directly
into Nagi Island.

171
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,168
That's what I was saying.

172
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:17,135
You ought to use this a
little more right here.

173
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:27,435
-Looks like it's going
to get it a bit rough.

174
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,835
-Hey, let's not push our luck.

175
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,035
Get us turned more
towards the south.

176
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,702
-That will eat up too much time.

177
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:42,968
-Just get to land.

178
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,535
There's no one on earth
who's faster than me.

179
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,068
My victory is inevitable.

180
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:48,902
-As you wish then.

181
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:58,502
-Hey, I can smell
salt on the wind.

182
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,468
SAKURA: It's the ocean.

183
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,568
What's that out
across the water?

184
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,035
-It's the halfway
point, Motaroki Shrine

185
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,135
over on Nagi Island.

186
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,868
We can probably get ourselves
there within an hour from here.

187
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:22,402
One sec.

188
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,435
Hey, Gramps, it's me.

189
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,435
Idate of the Wasabi.

190
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:31,302
-Hey, there.

191
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:32,635
I've been waiting for you.

192
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,635
-It's going just as
I thought it would.

193
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,568
I'm gonna need you
to lend me that boat.

194
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:38,402
-You bet.

195
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,368
I have things all ready for ya.

196
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:42,235
You can use that one
right over there.

197
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,435
There isn't a
faster boat around.

198
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,102
-Thanks a lot, Gramps.

199
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,602
-It's not a problem.

200
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:53,635
Jirocho has done a lot
for me over the years.

201
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:56,502
Just make sure you don't
lose to the Wagarashi.

202
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,602
I've had about all I
can stand from them

203
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,335
and the way they rule this land.

204
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:02,002
-Don't worry about a thing.

205
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,835
I may be the
underdog, but you're

206
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:06,102
looking at the right
hand man of the Wasabi.

207
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:06,868
Leave it to me.

208
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,035
I won't fail you.

209
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,568
I promise.

210
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:10,435
-Yeah.

211
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:10,935
Right.

212
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:11,435
Whatever.

213
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:37,890
IDATE (VOICEOVER): We
Should be able to see

214
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,957
the port at Nagi Island soon.

215
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,557
Hope we get there
before Fukusuke.

216
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:54,357
-Hey, Naruto, what do you think?

217
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,790
-What about?

218
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:57,924
-About Idate.

219
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,424
I mean, he's not just
some ordinary guy.

220
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,590
The level of speed he
runs at is extraordinary.

221
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:11,490
He's probably received some
sort of special training.

222
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,090
-What kind of training?

223
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,990
-It's possible he's spend
some time in one of the hidden

224
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,624
villages.

225
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:19,657
-Get real.

226
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,124
That blockhead could
never be a ninja.

227
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,490
-Look who's talking?

228
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:23,957
Last time I checked.

229
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,790
You were the reigning
king of stupid.

230
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:27,857
-Well, yeah, but
I mean, come on.

231
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,957
I did make it to the final round
of the Chunin exams, didn't I?

232
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,324
-You didn't really make it
to the final round, did you?

233
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,557
-Yeah, that's right.

234
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,224
And if I hadn't been
interrupted in the middle of it,

235
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:42,357
I could have won the
tournament and become a Chunin.

236
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,157
-Yeah, well, whoever
your proctor was must've

237
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,090
been a real push over.

238
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:52,657
Sounds like the Chunin exam
has lowered its standards some.

239
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,724
-I see.

240
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:57,390
So that means you were--

241
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:59,157
-I remember now.

242
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,190
-Idate Morino.

243
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,624
-Morino.

244
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:04,024
Oh yeah, that's right.

245
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,990
Wasn't he the proctor
of the first exam?

246
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,290
-All right, you
baby-faced degenerates.

247
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,790
Pipe down and listen up.

248
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,557
It's time to begin.

249
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,190
I am Ibiki Morino, your proctor.

250
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:20,757
And from this moment,
your worst enemy.

251
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,857
-Ibiki Morino.

252
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,824
-What'd you say?

253
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:27,557
My brother, he's alive?

254
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,390
-Yes.

255
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:29,624
-Well, of course, he's alive.

256
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:30,924
Why wouldn't he be?

257
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,824
He threw such a curve ball
at me the 10th question in.

258
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:34,757
-Seriously?

259
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,824
He's really alive then?

260
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:38,957
-Ah, that's great.

261
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,357
Now what?

262
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,024
-It's an ambush.

263
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:50,924
-How we doing?

264
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,824
-See for yourself.

265
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,557
They're just up ahead.

266
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,390
-All right then.

267
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:55,157
Let's get rolling.

268
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:15,257
-Naruto and I will
fend these guys off.

269
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,257
Sakura, you keep
an eye on Idate.

270
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,724
-Maybe we should all just run.

271
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,024
-It's too late for that.

272
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,724
Start working on these ropes.

273
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,290
I'll cover you.

274
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,690
-Yeah, you've got it.

275
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,357
Shoot, I'll have to cut these.

276
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,490
That's perfect.

277
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,357
I had to lose all my gear.

278
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,457
hey, lend me that, will ya?

279
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,290
-What?

280
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:46,590
-Come on, hand it over already.

281
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:47,924
-Forget it, you imbecile.

282
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,757
This is more precious to
me than my own life is.

283
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,357
There's no way I'm
giving it to you.

284
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,690
-Look, get over yourself.

285
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,390
We don't have time
for this right now.

286
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:58,590
-Get away from me, you idiot.

287
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,124
-Hurry up already,
you knucklehead.

288
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,190
-Well, that was a piece of cake.

289
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,524
-Ah!

290
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:11,924
-Don't worry, Sakura.

291
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,324
It's just a bunch of clones.

292
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:16,157
Only the real one can
actually attack us.

293
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,457
We're going to be fine.

294
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:19,957
-Sharingan.

295
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,257
-Sakura, Naruto, watch out.

296
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,857
One of them isn't
a shadow clone.

297
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,324
Be careful!

298
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,324
-Just tell us where, Sasuke.

299
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:34,590
You'd better stay close
to my side, Idate.

300
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:35,824
-No way.

301
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,757
Why would I want to need
help from a bunch of ninja?

302
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,857
-Look around you, pal,
beggars can't be choosers.

303
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,290
-Naruta, behind you.

304
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:46,790
-Naruto.

305
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,490
-A clone?

306
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,690
Aw, crap.

307
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:54,390
-Go for clone.

308
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,157
Great, the real one got away.

309
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,890
SAKURA: Nice work, Naruto.

310
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,790
-That shadow clone
kid is a handful.

311
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,490
Switch to plan B, Kagari.

312
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:12,090
We'll kill every
last one of them.

313
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:12,990
Oboro style.

314
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:13,690
Black rain jutsu.

315
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:21,090
-Susake, they've changed
into water clones.

316
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,090
-I know.

317
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:30,590
-It's raining?

318
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,624
Wait a sec, I think this is oil.

319
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,024
SUSAKE (VOICEOVER):
Enough already.

320
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,257
I'll take them all
out in one shot.

321
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,024
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): A
tiger seal hand sign.

322
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,024
SAKURA: Susake, don't!

323
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,524
-Aw, nuts.

324
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,024
-Ah, unlucky.

325
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:53,957
-Don't be so sure.

326
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,957
-Fire attack.

327
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,657
-Brother?

328
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,424
-Get out of here.

329
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:18,957
You'll only get in my way.

330
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:24,024
-Brother!

331
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,324
-What's wrong, Idate?

332
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,157
-Nothing.

333
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,090
I'm fine.

334
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,457
-What are we going
to do, Susake?

335
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,190
The fire is out of control.

336
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,924
-We dive into the ocean.

337
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:39,090
We're just going to have to
swim to the port at Nagi Island.

338
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:39,790
-You're right.

339
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,190
It's our only option.

340
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,690
Idate, do you know how to swim?

341
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,224
-Of course.

342
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:49,890
-OK, you go first.

343
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,590
Then I can cover you.

344
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:53,024
With all this smoke
everywhere, we

345
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:56,157
shouldn't have any problems
slipping away unnoticed.

346
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,924
Idate.

347
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,224
-You can forget about it.

348
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:00,824
What do you think, I'm stupid?

349
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:03,390
You three probably just
want to use me as a decoy.

350
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:04,724
-What are you talking about?

351
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,990
-You want them to focus
on me while you guys get

352
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,157
the hell out of here.

353
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,490
-Stop talking nonsense.

354
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,457
-I said forget it.

355
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,824
I don't trust ninjas.

356
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:12,924
-Get out of here already.

357
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:15,057
We don't need you
getting in our way.

358
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,757
-Get out of here.

359
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,557
You'll only get in my way.

360
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,357
NARUTO: Hurry up and go!

361
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,824
SAKURA: There's no way
we'd use you as a decoy.

362
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:31,290
-No.

363
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:32,257
I won't.

364
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:45,624
-Son of a-- Get down!

365
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:55,624
You've got to trust me, Idate.

366
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:57,357
I promise we'll protect you.

367
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,290
Watch out!

368
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,257
Ah!

369
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,257
-Sakura!

370
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,224
-S-- Sakura.

371
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,224
-Hurry, go on ahead.

372
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:16,324
I promise, we'll be
right behind you.

373
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:16,824
-Uh-huh.

374
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:26,457
-Well, shall we cut out?

375
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,890
-Cut out?

376
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:30,290
We haven't even gotten
to the best part.

377
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:36,390
-They're surprisingly tenacious.

378
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,090
-Yeah.

379
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:40,790
-But we're not letting
them get away this time.

380
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,157
-I should be OK now.

381
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,657
Huh?

382
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,857
-Long time no see, Idate.

383
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,790
-You.

384
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:15,990
You're the one who--

385
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,024
-Really?

386
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,924
How many times do
I have to teach you

387
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:21,124
that you can't trust anyone.

388
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:22,290
[grunting]

389
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,090
AOI: Such a fool you are.

390
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:32,157
[theme music]

391
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,780
SAILOR: It doesn't matter
what you were like before.

392
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,680
That's water under the bridge.

393
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:09,213
This race is far from over.

394
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,247
You'll never know the
truth unless you see it

395
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,980
through to the end.

396
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,580
Your boss believes in you.

397
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,580
You've got all this time
to stall things and act

398
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:22,313
like a big shot, then show me
some guts while you're at it.

399
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,747
Next time, Run, Idate, Run.

400
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,947
Nagi Island Awaits.
