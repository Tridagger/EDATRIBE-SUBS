[theme music]

2
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:50,991
-Ugh!

3
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:51,592
Aah!

4
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,332
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I've got him that time.

5
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,201
I'm starting to get the timing.

6
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,878
[grunts]

7
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:06,646
HAKU (VOICEOVER): He
read my movements.

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,817
But that's not possible.

9
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,588
-I was so close, but I
couldn't quite get to him.

10
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:15,392
-Naruto, can you do it again?

11
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,093
-Huh?

12
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:16,960
Of course.

13
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:17,828
Nothing can stop me.

14
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:18,963
Believe it!

15
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:21,066
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He
doesn't want to show it,

16
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,402
but he's exhausted.

17
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,606
The Shadow Clone Jutsu
uses up so much chakra.

18
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,244
But thanks to him,
I figured it out.

19
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:32,015
I know how to break through.

20
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:36,354
HAKU (VOICEOVER): The human
eye cannot track my movements.

21
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:37,923
It must have been a coincidence.

22
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,966
-Naruto, run for it!

23
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,068
-Huh?

24
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:47,870
-Get out of here and
attack from the outside!

25
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:48,671
Hurry!

26
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,644
-Uh, all right, you got it!

27
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:55,080
-You cannot escape.

Aah!

31
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,657
Ugh.

32
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,065
You think you
could keep me here?

33
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,035
Forget it!

34
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:11,836
-That's it!

35
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,640
Fire Style, Fireball Jutsu!

36
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:31,030
-Ugh!

37
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:43,214
I couldn't get past him.

38
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:44,782
-That was good, Naruto.

39
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,584
-Huh?

40
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,787
-One more time.

41
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,322
-Yeah.

42
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,757
Let's do it!

43
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,632
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): There must
be a limit to his chakra, too.

44
00:03:56,665 --> 00:04:00,203
I can feel him slowing down.

45
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:00,804
-Aah!

46
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,779
-No more games.

47
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,416
I need to stop this now!

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,054
This time you'll stay down!

49
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,022
-Ugh!

50
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,993
Aah!

51
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,330
-Uh, Sasuke!

52
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:19,930
Aah!

53
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:28,376
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): An enemy
you can't see and can't hear.

54
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:33,183
It's been a long time since
I faced anyone this tough.

55
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:37,789
And Sasuke and Naruto, I don't
know if they can hold out.

56
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,095
Stay calm.

57
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,297
Think.

58
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,634
Where will he strike?

59
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,404
[gasp] The bridge builder!

-Hm.

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,295
-Too late!

64
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,470
[screams]

65
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:26,222
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
"The Broken Seal."

66
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,090
-That scream.

67
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:29,326
That was Sakura.

68
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,429
What's happening to her?

69
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:34,400
Where is Kakashi?

70
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,204
NARUTO: [groans]

71
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,139
Sakura.

72
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:41,043
She's in trouble.

73
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:43,113
-We've got to break through.

74
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,288
-I'll bust us out of here.

75
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,890
-Naruto.

76
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:54,128
-I'll fake him out.

77
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:57,232
-You've exhausted my patience.

78
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,801
-[grunts]

79
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,823
SASUKE: Naruto, behind you!

80
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,563
-Ugh!

81
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,065
SASUKE: Naruto!

82
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:25,271
-Your chance of escaping my
House of Mirrors is zero.

83
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,008
That is absolute.

84
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,345
-Naruto, are you able to get up?

85
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:31,647
-[groans]

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,050
-Try not to use any more chakra.

87
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,621
That's only going
to help him now.

88
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:38,556
-I know, Sasuke.

89
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,761
I know. [groans]

90
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,663
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): We
can't go on like this.

91
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,299
He's blocking
every move we make.

92
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,535
I've got to find a way
to outmaneuver him.

93
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,009
My eyes have adjusted
to his movements.

94
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,546
-Looking for a counterattack?

95
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,082
I'll save you the trouble.

96
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,022
What?

97
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:07,029
-Get up, loser!

98
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,698
We've got to team up!

99
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,333
-[groans]

100
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,804
HAKU (VOICEOVER): I'm aiming
at his vital spots now.

101
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:17,410
But I can't get a direct hit.

102
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,413
-[grunts]

103
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,416
I know what we have to do.

104
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,317
Believe it, Sasuke.

105
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,827
HAKU (VOICEOVER):
It's not just luck.

106
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,796
He's fighting to
protect his friend.

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,198
That's why he's so determined.

108
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:37,738
But he can't possibly
see the needles coming.

109
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,541
-Ugh.

110
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:43,112
HAKU (VOICEOVER): My movements
are beyond human speed.

111
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:48,519
And yet he's tracking
them somehow.

112
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:54,261
Whatever he's doing,
I've got to stop him now.

113
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:55,529
-He disappeared.

114
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:56,497
Where did he go?

115
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,066
How could he just vanish?

116
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,803
Naruto, you'd better
not pass out again.

117
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,005
Come on, let's go!

118
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,707
I can't keep protecting
you like this.

119
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,709
-Well, then, don't!

120
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:07,412
I never asked for your help.

121
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,647
Ugh.

122
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,648
-Uh?

123
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,451
HAKU: You can't revive him.

124
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,954
He's reached his limits.

125
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,290
-[grunts]

126
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,993
-[chuckles]

127
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:22,266
HAKU: Impressive.

128
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,803
You have excellent moves.

129
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,506
Your attacks are very skillful.

130
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,280
But you've reached
your limits as well.

131
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:39,524
Motor functions,
reflexes, judgment--

132
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:43,095
your abilities are
weakening slowly but surely.

133
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,734
Now, you're finished!

134
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,470
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Here he comes.

135
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:56,781
Stay calm, focus,
concentrate, see everything.

136
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,203
HAKU (VOICEOVER):
He saw every move.

137
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:17,542
But there's no way
he could do that.

138
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:28,057
Impossible.

139
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:31,596
Those eyes.

140
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,597
The Sharingan.

141
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,138
Pure.

142
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,040
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
It's not complete,

143
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:43,578
but I could see
through his deceptions.

144
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:47,618
HAKU (VOICEOVER): So he, too,
has a Kekkei Genkai, the power

145
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:51,256
of a unique bloodline trait
passed down within a clan.

146
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,493
Interesting, even though
it's not perfected.

147
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,732
To uncover this power in
the midst of a lethal attack

148
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,534
is an amazing feat.

149
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:04,207
And because of that, I won't
be able to fight much longer.

150
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:08,146
My jutsu uses a tremendous
amount of chakra.

151
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,083
And his swift movements
also take energy.

152
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:14,421
There's no doubt that
the longer we fight,

153
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,860
the more he will use the
Sharingan to perceive my moves.

154
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:25,503
Even now, his eyes
are tracking me.

155
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,177
I can't target him directly.

156
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,513
He'll just block
a frontal attack.

157
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:35,818
So I'll have to throw him
off-guard by attacking

158
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,753
his partner.

159
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,723
Then I'll destroy him.

160
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,198
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I've got to stop him!

161
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,207
-Ugh!

162
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,775
[gasping]

163
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,020
-Kakashi-sensei!

164
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,555
-You were late, Kakashi.

165
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,762
You let your concern for
those little punks' safety

166
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:11,334
cloud your mind, adding
further to the fog that

167
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,271
already hinders your Sharingan.

168
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,308
Your eyes are sharp,
Kakashi, but not

169
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,046
sharp enough to read my moves.

170
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,614
Not anymore.

171
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,252
[snickers]

172
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,920
Come on, Kakashi.

173
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,522
I want this to be fun.

174
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:31,161
I want to enjoy myself
as I exact my revenge.

175
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:34,065
As for those brats, don't worry.

176
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,834
They're at Haku's mercy.

177
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:39,606
No, they're breathing their
last breaths right now.

178
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,749
Relax.

179
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,653
You'll have plenty of time
to whip out an apology

180
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:53,993
for failing those brats when
you see them in the next life.

181
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:57,564
[laughs]

182
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,326
-[panting]

183
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,607
-He said Sasuke will die.

184
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,777
No, I won't believe that.

185
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,045
I have faith in him.

186
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,981
Sasuke will beat them to a pulp!

187
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,150
Cha!

188
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,585
And that masked
kid, we'll make him

189
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,254
wish that he was never born!

190
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,956
I can't lose Sasuke.

191
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,227
Anyone who tries to take
him from me will pay for it!

192
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,931
And Naruto either.

193
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,899
KAKASHI: Exactly

194
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,867
-[gasp]

195
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,843
-I-- I believe in
their abilities.

196
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,647
I have faith in them.

197
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:05,257
Naruto, the number 1 hyperactive
knucklehead ninja, and Sasuke,

198
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:10,399
heir to the most powerful clan
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

199
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,735
-Huh, you mean--

200
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,736
-Yes.

201
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,209
His full name is Sasuke Uchiha.

202
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,946
The unique powers of
the Uchiha bloodline

203
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,817
run through his veins.

204
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,754
The Kekkei Genkai
is his birthright.

205
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,959
-Ah, I heard that
one young ninja

206
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,662
survived the tragedy
of the Uchiha clan.

207
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,944
No wonder he
advances so quickly.

208
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,584
But so does Haku.

209
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,789
No one can match him.

210
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,325
No one has ever stopped
his Secret Jutsu.

211
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,964
Even the most skilled
Jonin fall before him.

212
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:05,341
Just as you will fall
before me, right now!

213
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,078
-Sakura, stay with Tazuna.

214
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,013
-OK.

215
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:10,582
Uh, got it.

216
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,625
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He's right.

217
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,094
It's time to end this.

218
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,696
But he is the one who will fall!

219
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,169
-[groans]

220
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,951
-You always get in
the way, Naruto.

221
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:37,986
It never fails.

222
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,687
-Ah!

223
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,256
You beat him, Sasuke!

224
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:40,857
Huh?

225
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:59,516
-You should see the
look on your face.

226
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,221
You-- you look
like a total loser.

227
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,522
-Huh?

228
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:09,697
Why-- why did you-- uh, save me?

229
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,233
Why did you do it?

230
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,639
-I don't know why, I just did.

231
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:25,986
-And my future dream is
to be the greatest Hokage.

232
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,022
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

233
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:31,026
and start treating me like
I'm somebody, somebody--

234
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:31,995
-Get up, loser.

235
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,730
-We climbed all
the way to the top.

236
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,332
NARUTO AND SASUKE:
I want some more!

237
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,300
-Why are they so
obsessed with him?

238
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:36,934
Sasuke!

239
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,670
Sasuke!

240
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,272
-We've got to team up!

241
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,210
-We've done this 1,000 times!

242
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:47,782
-[grunts]

243
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,151
[coughs]

244
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:57,530
You, I hated you.

245
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:59,265
-Then why?

246
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:01,368
It doesn't make any sense.

247
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,873
Why did you protect me?

248
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:05,608
Uhh.

249
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,514
[grunts]

250
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:11,649
I didn't ask for this!

251
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,818
I didn't ask for you to save me!

252
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,593
-I don't know.

253
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,297
My body just moved.

254
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,068
There was no time to think.

255
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,506
[groans]

256
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,341
Loser!

[grunts]

258
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:39,769
-Sasuke!

259
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:46,598
-He-- he's still out there.

260
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,067
My brother.

261
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:59,148
I promised myself I'd stay
alive until I killed him.

262
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:08,494
Naruto, don't let
your dream die.

263
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,497
[sighs]

264
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,989
[faint heartbeat]

265
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:52,555
-He found-- he
found the strength

266
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,126
he didn't realize he had.

267
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,360
Why?

268
00:17:56,394 --> 00:18:00,133
Because of a certain person
who was precious to him.

269
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:05,573
To save that person, he rushed
in knowing it was a trap.

270
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:09,513
He was a true ninja,
worthy of honor.

271
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,388
Is this the first time you have
seen a friend die in battle?

272
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:19,459
This is part of what
it means to be a ninja.

273
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,334
-Shut up.

274
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,879
I-- I hated you, too, Sasuke.

275
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:45,863
And yet-- you'll pay for this.

276
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,078
-Hm?

277
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,228
-I'm going to kill you!

278
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,610
HAKU (VOICEOVER):
What is this chakra?

279
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:29,556
Chakra cannot be seen,
yet it's clearly visible.

280
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,359
It's something ghastly.

281
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:36,132
I can feel the wrath, the
blood lust, like evil itself.

282
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:54,458
His hand is healing
and changing.

283
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:59,831
This boy, what is he?

00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,007
-Uhh.

288
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:12,783
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Is
Zabuza creating this?

289
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:13,650
He's not.

290
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:14,586
I know this chakra.

291
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,992
There's no way.

292
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,762
ZABUZA: What is this energy?

293
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:23,831
It's something foul.

294
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:25,333
Kakashi?

295
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,168
No.

296
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,871
It's too powerful, even for him.

297
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,774
Where is it coming from?

298
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:34,346
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

299
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:46,330
This puts everyone in danger.

300
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:50,068
Now, of all times,
the seal has broken.

301
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,670
I have to stop it.

Motivate your anger to

Climbing the mountain,

Break into the contents,
never falling down.

My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

310
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:11,371
Sneaking out of the
classroom, by the backdoor.

311
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:15,009
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

312
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,881
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

313
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:21,818
Don't try to live so wise.

314
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:25,190
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

316
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,699
will hate yourself in the end.

Don't try to live so wise.

Don't try with fakes

will hate yourself in the end.

Don't try to live so wise.

Look what you've done.

327
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,827
You're going to pay for this.

And there's no turning back.

331
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,273
You destroyed Sasuke's dreams.
