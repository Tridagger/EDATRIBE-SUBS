00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,110
[theme song]

2
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,346
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Finally, I get the chance

3
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,047
to put all my training
to use on a real mission.

4
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,661
-They're both caught in
some sort of genjutsu.

5
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,366
[sobbing]

6
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:42,706
-Yakumo?

7
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,041
Yakumo, is that you?

8
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,594
Thank goodness you're alive.

9
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:09,033
-Please help me!

10
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:13,570
-It'll be all right.

11
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,739
I'm here now.

12
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:20,010
No matter what happens I promise
I'll make sure you're safe.

13
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:20,611
-Kurenai-sensei.

14
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:26,550
Ah.

15
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,530
-So the two who went in
before you haven't come out.

16
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:44,134
Perhaps Yakumo has
been awakened at last.

17
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,637
You deal with
Kurenai and Yakumo.

18
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,439
-Right.

19
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:50,074
-While they're at
it you intercept

20
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,277
those other pests headed this
way and take care of them.

21
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,977
-Yes, sir.

22
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,429
-Whatever happens,
leave this to me.

23
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,002
That crest.

24
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,638
You two are of the Kurama clan?

25
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:25,676
-Kurenai Yuhi, you will
hand Yakumo over to us.

26
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,643
-Why?

27
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,112
What do the Kurama
want with her?

28
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:31,215
-This concerns our clan only.

29
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:34,618
It's no business of yours.

30
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:38,689
-This child was entrusted to
my care by the third Hokage.

31
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:39,456
-Right.

32
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,524
Then we'll try force!

33
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,632
[scream]

34
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,514
There's no use struggling.

35
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,487
What the?

36
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,156
-She wasn't caught
in our genjutsu.

37
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,959
We're caught in the
genjutsu of hers!

38
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,728
-But then-- where is she?

39
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,229
-Ah!

40
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:21,231
The pain!

41
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,699
-You're all right!

42
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:28,639
Ah!

43
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,723
-If it's a fight
you want-- well, OK!

44
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:47,724
-No!

45
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,725
Naruto!

46
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,626
-Wait!

47
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,394
What are you doing?

48
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:54,731
-Uh-oh!

49
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:08,946
Whoa!

50
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:10,047
That is one monster bean stalk.

51
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:23,961
Can't move!

52
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,666
This is not good.

53
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,668
-Naruto.

54
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,670
-Now die!

55
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:34,371
-Shino!

56
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,712
-Your genjutsu doesn't
work on insects.

57
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,181
-Work on what?

58
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,082
No!

59
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,149
What are they doing?

60
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:46,617
Ah!

61
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,523
[muffled shouts]

62
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:00,330
-He's gone.

63
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:06,203
-Got him.

64
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:09,139
He can run and hide, but
he can't hide his scent.

65
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:12,075
Man Beast Clone!

66
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:12,676
Fang Over Fang!

67
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,186
See ya later.

68
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,621
-Severe Leaf Hurricane!

69
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:32,396
Your half-baked
genjutsu is useless

70
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,131
against a well-trained ninja.

71
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,332
-Stop it!

72
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,734
Let go of me, you
overgrown weed!

73
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,070
-Oh, good grief.

74
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:40,737
Hey, Naruto.

75
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,041
Release.

76
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,082
-Oh.

77
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:54,985
Good morning, Sakura.

78
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:56,620
Is breakfast ready?

79
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,623
-Why do you always rush
in like that, you idiot?

80
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:00,424
-That's right!

81
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:01,591
Yakumo and Kurenai-sensei!

82
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:05,529
Kurenai-sensei!

83
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:14,571
-Who are these guys?

84
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,976
They're all unconscious.

85
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,745
Caught in a genjutsu
from the looks of it.

86
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,214
-Kurenai-sensei.

87
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:25,315
You here?

88
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,651
Uh, Kurenai-sensei?

89
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,418
Hello?

90
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:29,720
Whoa, I don't get it.

91
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:30,620
What's going on?

92
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:32,656
She's not here.

93
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:33,357
-Byakugan.

94
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,366
-Well, what is it?

95
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,001
-Kurenai-sensei is gone.

96
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:53,010
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): There's
another one still after us.

97
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,218
Fools.

98
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,520
Do they think they can
use genjutsu on me?

99
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:04,654
-Release.

100
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:05,355
What?

101
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,490
It's not working.

102
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:20,570
-That's Unkai.

103
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,672
The man who was made
leader of the Kurama clan

104
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:24,741
after my father's death.

105
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,510
-Unkai of the Kurama.

106
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:29,579
I won't be able to outsmart
you as easily as the others,

107
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:30,981
will I?

108
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,983
[laughter]

109
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:36,253
-That's high praise indeed,
coming from Kurenai Yuhi.

110
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,521
I'm flattered.

111
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:40,090
But why don't we avoid
this battle altogether?

112
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,728
Just hand Yakumo over to me.

113
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,332
-Hang on tight.

114
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,401
-Don't be a fool, Kurenai Yuhi.

115
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:55,505
How do you expect to fight
when you can't escape my jutsu?

116
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:04,047
Madness!

117
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:14,591
Curse you!

118
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:15,559
I smell blood.

119
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:22,632
I've got you now.

120
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:28,105
There you are!

121
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,483
Why do you protect her?

122
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:43,053
Hand over Yakumo, or the next
one will pierce your heart.

123
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,534
-Kurenai-sensei!

124
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,068
-Huh?

125
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:11,982
-No one touches Kurenai-sensei.

126
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:14,584
Not while I'm around!

127
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,653
-Careful!

128
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh, no.

129
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,222
Not this again.

130
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:20,423
-Oh, brother.

131
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,293
Naruto, when are you
ever going to learn?

132
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:23,994
-Byakugan.

133
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,964
Naruto!

134
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:28,665
Above you!

135
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:35,005
-So, Byakugan, is it?

136
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,973
-You wanna play games, OK.

137
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,675
Multi-shadow clone jutsu!

138
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:41,978
Attack!

139
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:48,351
-Hm.

140
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,986
Shadow clones, then.

141
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,987
-Yeah.

142
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:51,721
And they're not illusions.

143
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:52,689
They're the real thing.

144
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:53,990
Let's get him!

145
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:54,991
-Yeah!

146
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:55,458
-Let's go!

147
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,335
-Uzumaki Barrage!

148
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,646
-I swear, I will
have Yakumo yet.

149
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:21,384
-Byakugan!

150
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,370
-The sedative I gave
her seems to be working.

151
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,672
She should rest comfortably
for a while now.

152
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:45,375
But what she really needs
is a full examination

153
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,644
at the hospital
back in the village.

154
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,980
-We're lucky to have
you here, Sakura.

155
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,148
Thank you.

156
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,985
-Sensei, you need
looking after, too.

157
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,052
-Yes.

158
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,320
I think you're right.

159
00:12:57,354 --> 00:12:58,655
-Let me take a look at that.

160
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:08,598
-They've been like
that the whole time.

161
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:10,267
-I don't think
they'll be waking up

162
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,169
from that genjutsu
for quite a while.

163
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:14,137
-Fine.

164
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,473
So much the better for us.

165
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,008
Huh?

166
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:18,708
Look.

167
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:19,409
Is that--

168
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:22,579
-Kurenai-sensei!

169
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:30,353
-Oh, there you are.

170
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,956
Good to see you're
all right after all.

171
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,090
-Yes.

172
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:37,260
-Can't you see
she's not all right?

173
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,362
She's been very badly
injured, and even

174
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,531
thought I've
treated the wound we

175
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:44,267
must get her back
to the village.

176
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,502
-I'll be all right.

177
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,138
I'm more concerned about
Yakumo's condition.

178
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,572
-Yes.

179
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:52,409
Especially when our enemies
might return at any moment.

180
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:54,110
And there still
remains the question

181
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:55,545
of what became of
the three ninja

182
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:59,082
we assigned to protect Yakumo.

183
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,383
All right.

184
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,018
I'll take care of things here.

185
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:05,088
The rest of you take Kurenai
and Yakumo back to the village.

186
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:07,190
Organize a backup unit.

187
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,125
-They're masters of genjutsu.

188
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,094
You gonna be all right alone?

189
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,362
-Are you kidding?

190
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:16,399
With this finely-tuned
lethal weapon of a body?

191
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:20,136
You think I can't handle
their genjutsu tricks?

192
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,641
I can handle the
jutsu wait-and-see.

193
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:25,408
Get it?

194
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:28,611
The jutsu wait-and-see?

195
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:29,512
-Oh, boy.

196
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,724
-Yakumo, you're awake.

197
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,063
How are you feeling?

198
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,733
I suppose you must be kind
of mad at Kurenai-sensei

199
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,000
for sealing your genjutsu.

200
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,608
-That woman-- she hates me.

201
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:03,079
She wanted to make sure I
never mastered genjutsu.

202
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:03,680
-No.

203
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,115
No she didn't.

204
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,082
-Then why?

205
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:06,716
Why?

206
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,650
-Search me.

207
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:08,518
But come on.

208
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,253
I'm sure she had a good reason.

209
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,321
You're wrong about her.

210
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:12,956
She doesn't hate you.

211
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,658
Look, she risked her life to
save you from those people,

212
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:16,493
right?

213
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:18,661
-Those people are Kurama.

214
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:21,731
We're from the same clan,
and from the same blood.

215
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:26,369
-Well-- so if they're your own
people, then why the heck--

216
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:34,010
-Kiba, will you make sure
Kurenai-sensei gets back

217
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:37,213
to the village all right?

218
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,181
-It's all right.

219
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,682
I can get back on my own.

220
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:40,650
-Kiba!

221
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,386
-There's something
I need to know.

222
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,489
Kurenai-sensei,
I want the truth.

223
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:49,659
This Yakumo business, everything
that's been going on lately--

224
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:52,395
does it have anything to do
with why you quit our squad?

225
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:02,405
-Long ago the Kurama clan was
a mighty force in the village.

226
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,641
For generations they
were known and respected

227
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:07,744
throughout the Leaf as masters
in the art of genjutsu.

228
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:11,714
But some years ago their
powers began to wane.

229
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:15,518
They produced fewer and
fewer chunin and jonin.

230
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:18,588
They were a clan in decline
until a bright star, full

231
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:22,492
of promise, was born-- Yakumo.

232
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,027
-They put their faith in me.

233
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,230
As the only child of the
head family, it was up to me

234
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,333
to restore the clan's greatness.

235
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:33,670
Unfortunately I was frail
and often sick as a child,

236
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,538
and it began to appear
that I might never

237
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,108
be allowed to enter the academy.

238
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,411
This made me very sad.

239
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:44,047
I truly wanted to live
up to expectations

240
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,715
of my parents and the clan.

241
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,324
Sensing my despair, my father
went to the third Hokage

242
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,059
and pleaded with
him on my behalf.

243
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,198
-The third Hokage
recognized that there

244
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,968
were great powers lying
dormant in Yakumo.

245
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:09,138
So he agreed to put her under
my personal supervision.

246
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,308
-By order of the
third Hokage I was

247
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:16,579
given Kurenai-sensei as
my own private teacher.

248
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:17,413
But she--

249
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,287
-What is it?

250
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,456
-Kurenai-sensei, she-- she--

251
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,625
-But why did you do it?

252
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,264
-I don't know.

253
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:10,733
Maybe because I
use genjutsu too.

254
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,970
Maybe because I was jealous
of those great powers lying

255
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,305
dormant in her.

256
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:18,408
-You were jealous?

257
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:22,712
-One master of genjutsu
is enough for any village.

258
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,247
-No way.

259
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,982
I can't believe that
you would really--

260
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,317
-Believe it.

261
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,452
Now you know why I quit.

262
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:33,256
Someone capable of that doesn't
deserve to lead your squad.

263
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:34,090
-No way.

264
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,024
Are you serious?

265
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:36,092
You're saying she--

266
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,227
-It's not just Kurenai-sensei.

267
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:40,263
Everyone feels the
same way about me.

268
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:41,464
The whole village.

269
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,400
-What are you talking about?

270
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,970
-I'm still not buying it.

271
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,471
It just doesn't smell right.

272
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,540
She's hiding something from us.

273
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,711
-Yes, I-- I have
the same feeling.

274
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:57,981
-You're both right.

275
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,216
I was watching her.

276
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,185
Her hand trembled
with emotion when

277
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,088
she spoke of what
she'd done to Yakumo.

278
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,623
She felt it deeply.

279
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:10,493
But when she explained
her motives for doing it

280
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,130
the trembling suddenly stopped.

281
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,665
-Meaning what, exactly?

282
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:16,966
-She felt nothing.

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,337
Because that pat of
her story was a lie.

284
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:24,607
-So that stuff about
being jealous of Yakumo?

285
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:28,044
-Perhaps she's trying
to protect someone else.

286
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:31,381
-Who's so important that
she'd make up a lie like that?

287
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,949
Who could she be protecting?

288
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,155
-Then one day, by
chance, I happened

289
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:42,525
to overhear Kurenai-sensei
and the third Hokage talking.

290
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,203
-I'm confident that Yakumo's
powers will not fully

291
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:57,707
awaken for a long while yet.

292
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,275
-I see.

293
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,310
Nevertheless, sooner
or later, the day

294
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:04,280
will come when the dam bursts.

295
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,549
And then the power
of the Kurama clan

296
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:10,119
will be so great that it
will threaten the Hidden Leaf

297
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,621
Village itself.

298
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:16,025
But by that time it may be too
late to eliminate the threat.

299
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,401
-So it wasn't just
Kurenai-sensei.

300
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:29,072
It was the third Hokage
who took away my powers.

301
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,440
-You must have heard it wrong.

302
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,675
Why would the third Hokage
do something like that?

303
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,577
-For the same reason
that right before I

304
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,213
began training
with Kurenai-sensei

305
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,549
my father and
mother were killed.

306
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:40,717
-What?

307
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,585
-Our house caught fire.

308
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,588
The flames spread quickly--
too quickly for my parents

309
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:47,657
to be saved.

310
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:51,194
But they were jonin,
alert and highly-trained.

311
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:54,263
They'd never be caught
off guard like that.

312
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:56,365
A fire that
mysteriously broke out

313
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,534
in broad daylight--
the investigation

314
00:20:58,534 --> 00:21:01,537
rules it was an accident.

315
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,107
But the report was
sealed and kept secret.

316
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,342
I was never allowed to see it.

317
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,010
-What do you mean?

318
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:11,114
Are you saying the fire
was set on purpose?

319
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:15,651
-My parents were put to death
by order of the third Hokage.

320
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:20,957
-No way.

321
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,258
It's a lie.

322
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,192
A lie!

323
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,393
I'm not gonna listen!

324
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,968
[theme music]

325
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:03,292
NARUTO: Yakumo has one story.

326
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:05,394
Kurenai-sensei tells
a different one.

327
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:07,096
Which one is true?

328
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,298
They can't both by
lying, can they?

329
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:11,634
All I know is that the
third Hokage would never

330
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,470
have done that to
her, or her parents.

331
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:17,039
For now I've just gotta focus
on getting Kurenai-sensei

332
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,574
to the hospital.

333
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:19,575
Why?

334
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:22,345
That could be easier
said than done!

335
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,681
Next time--
Gentjutsu Or Reality?
