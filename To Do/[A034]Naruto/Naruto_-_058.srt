BAKI: Open up, now.

4
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:58,627
-Huh?

5
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,529
-So what's up?

6
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:00,864
What's all the ruckus?

7
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,466
-(ANGRILY) You idiots.

8
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,370
Didn't I tell you not to let him
out of your sight for a second?

9
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:05,771
-Huh?

10
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:06,372
Oh.

11
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,917
-Oh no.

12
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,385
Gaara's gone.

13
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:15,886
-Yeah.

14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,386
But where?

15
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,766
-This is bad.

16
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,770
Very bad.

NARRATOR: Hospital Besieged.

20
00:02:49,702 --> 00:03:00,084
[sand falling]

21
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:01,086
-Man.

22
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,788
Is he ever going to wake up?

23
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:03,923
Maybe the kid croaked.

24
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,678
[sigh]

26
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,359
-You're wasting your time
if those are for Sasuke.

27
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:35,536
-Ino.

28
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,309
-So you haven't heard
the news that he still

29
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,513
hasn't come back yet?

30
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,850
You're a little behind
the curve, aren't you,

31
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,185
billboard brow?

32
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:51,726
-As a matter of fact, I
was getting it for Lee.

33
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,996
The last one must
be wilting by now.

34
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:00,506
-Yeah, you're right.

35
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,642
SAKURA: Lee, you
shouldn't be out of bed.

36
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,210
-191--

37
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
SAKURA: Stop it.

38
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,213
-(ANGRILY) Keep away from me.

39
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,149
Do not count me out.

40
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,252
I am not through yet.

41
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,990
-Here you go.

42
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,760
-Thank you.

43
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:15,561
-Tell him hi.

44
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,863
I hope he's feeling better.

45
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,271
SHIKAMARU: The sand stopped.

46
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,540
What's up with that?

47
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:49,277
Did they forget to
wind it or something?

48
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,579
What a drag.

49
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,260
So, you decided to wake up, huh?

50
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:01,829
-Where am I?

51
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:02,764
What is this?

52
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,099
-The hospital.

53
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,135
They said you've been out
cold like this for three days

54
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,038
straight.

55
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,008
-Three days?

56
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,913
(ANGRILY) Three days straight?

57
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,715
-Uh, yeah.

58
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,084
More or less.

59
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,687
-(SHOUTING) Shikamaru, when's
the final competition begin?

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,421
-Tomorrow.

61
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,157
-(SHOUTING) What?

62
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,526
Are you crazy?

63
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,329
Why the heck didn't
you wake me up sooner?

64
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:26,365
I can't be lying around
here at a time like this.

65
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,067
I've got to be getting ready.

66
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,203
And Pervy Sage.

67
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,738
Where's Pervy Sage?

68
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,876
That old coot's supposed to
be supervising my training.

69
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,844
-Hey, calm down kid.

70
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,913
Get a grip.

71
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:37,481
I don't know what
you're talking about.

72
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,983
-(SHOUTING) Where
are my clothes?

73
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,585
I've got to get dressed.

74
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,521
Where'd they put them?

75
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:42,522
Where are my clothes?

76
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:43,324
Oh come on, where are they?

77
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,458
-Oh man.

78
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,727
This kid gives me
such a headache.

79
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,264
I liked him better
when he was in a coma.

80
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,368
(SHOUTING) Would
you knock it off?

81
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,770
(CALMLY) Now listen.

82
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:54,306
You don't want to
be freaking out

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,309
the day before a
big competition.

84
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:59,748
Resting can be the best thing.

85
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,984
Are you OK?

86
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:04,187
Is something wrong?

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,088
-Yeah.

88
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,490
I'm really starving.

89
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:07,525
-Is that all?

90
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,963
Man, stop scaring me like that.

91
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,698
Oh, look at this.

92
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:12,099
-Hm?

93
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:18,074
-i went to all the trouble of
getting this stuff for Choji

94
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,811
and then the doctors told
me he couldn't have it.

95
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,247
Such a drag.

96
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,216
But at least we can eat it.

97
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,451
-Choji?

98
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,588
You mean he's here
in the hospital too?

99
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,491
-Nothing to worry about.

100
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:32,328
All he's got is a bad
case of indigestion.

101
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:35,400
He ate one short rib too many.

102
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,534
-I should've figured.

103
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,769
That's just like him.

104
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:38,838
-Yeah.

105
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,273
Well, you two are
just lucky I'm around

106
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,243
or you wouldn't
have any visitors.

107
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,045
Here.

108
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:44,947
-Oh, wow.

109
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,548
This looks delicious.

110
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:49,286
-What?

111
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,288
What is it now?

112
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,824
[laughing]

113
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,461
-Let's eat it in front of
Choji, it'll drive him crazy.

114
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,497
SHIKAMARU: Man, that's mean.

115
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:58,534
I like it.

116
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:03,908
-What the-- where is everybody?

117
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,580
Out to lunch?

118
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:12,254
Hm.

119
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,838
Oh well.

120
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:25,406
Huh?

121
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,811
[clock ticking]

122
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:29,212
-Hm.

123
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:52,713
[bird chirping]

124
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:34,975
-OK.

125
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:35,776
Well.

126
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,011
Hope you like it.

127
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,397
[moan]

128
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,135
-I'm still starving.

129
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:53,568
[knock]

130
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:54,169
-Huh?

131
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:09,391
Come on, don't torture
me like that, Shikamaru.

132
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:30,456
[wind blowing]

133
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,223
-Oh.

134
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:32,059
That's right.

135
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:45,544
[groan]

136
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:53,356
[screaming]

137
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,758
-But why?

138
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:58,363
He failed.

139
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,734
Why save him?

140
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,837
-Because he's-- he's my student.

141
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,108
And also because he
is precious to me.

142
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,827
-What am I?

143
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:28,908
[screaming]

144
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:12,673
-I can't move my body.

145
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,043
[shout]

146
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,611
-Ah!

147
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,149
-(SHOUTING) What the heck do
you think you're doing in here,

148
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:21,285
you rat?

149
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:22,654
-Hey, man.

150
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:23,689
Go easy.

151
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,592
I'm using my shadow
possession jutsu.

152
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,429
So when you're bashing
him, you're bashing me too.

153
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,430
You got it?

154
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:30,566
-Oh, sorry Shikamaru.

155
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,510
Out with it.

156
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,712
What were you trying to pull?

157
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:42,950
-Hey, Choji.

158
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,352
Feeling better?

159
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:44,987
-Oh.

160
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,923
Ino.

161
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,658
[giggling]

162
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:49,594
(VOICEOVER) All right.

163
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,530
A pretty girl with food.

164
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:52,731
This is my lucky day.

165
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,453
-Well?

166
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:08,722
Are you gonna tell us
what you were gonna do?

167
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,429
-I was going to kill him.

168
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:14,696
-What?

169
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,100
-(VOICEOVER) This guy's
one cool customer.

170
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,502
Look at him.

171
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,305
He's not even phased by my
shadow possession jutsu.

172
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,080
-You already beat him
once in the competition.

173
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:26,848
What's your problem?

174
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,651
Wasn't that enough for you?

175
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:30,620
Do you have some kind
of personal grudge

176
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,623
against him or something?

177
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:36,162
-I have nothing against him.

178
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,830
It's nothing that complicated.

179
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,767
I simply want to
kill him, that's all.

180
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,035
-(SHOUTING) You know what?

181
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:42,037
You're sick in the head.

182
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,005
You're crazy.

183
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,140
-Yeah.

184
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,609
You think we're going
to just stand by and let

185
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,011
you do whatever you want?

186
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:50,082
You sick selfish psycho.

187
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,652
(VOICEOVER) This guy
gives me the creeps.

188
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:55,156
There's always been
something weird about him.

189
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,492
Scary.

190
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,928
If he decides to
make a move, I'm

191
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,866
not sure we'll be
able to stop him.

192
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,568
-If you don't stay
out of my way,

193
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,204
I'll have to kill
you two as well.

194
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,239
-(SHOUTING) Oh really?

195
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:08,209
Well let's just see you try it.

196
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:08,910
-Hey.

197
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:09,477
Whoa kid.

198
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:10,813
Take it easy.

199
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,681
(VOICEOVER) Best thing
to do is try and bluff

200
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:15,052
our way out of this.

201
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,485
Yeah.

202
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,721
Yeah.

203
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,756
We watched your last
match against Lee.

204
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:19,158
We know you're tough.

205
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:22,330
But you know, Naruto and
I have a few little tricks

206
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,065
up our sleeves as well.

207
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:26,068
We were holding back
during the competition.

208
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:28,705
There are things you
haven't seen yet.

209
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:31,609
On top of that, hey,
it's two against one.

210
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,612
So don't be a fool, OK?

211
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,818
Just take my advice
and go quietly.

212
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,855
-I'll say it once more.

213
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:43,360
If you get in my
way, I'll kill you.

214
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:45,697
-(VOICEOVER) OK, plan B.

215
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,232
-(SHOUTING) And
I'll say it again.

216
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,501
Let's see you try it.

217
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,469
-Back off, will you?

218
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,272
We don't want to go there.

219
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,740
This guy fights like he's mad.

220
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:55,244
Like he's a demon or something.

221
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,382
-He can act like a demon if he
wants to, but you know what?

222
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:00,385
I got the real
thing inside of me.

223
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:15,240
-They told me
Naruto was in here.

224
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:19,213
From the mess someone's made
of that bed, he probably was.

225
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:22,083
Well I guess that
means he's all right.

226
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:27,391
[sand falling]

227
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,459
-Idiot.

228
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,628
Leave this to me.

229
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,096
What's the point
of getting him mad?

230
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:40,310
-A demon, huh?

231
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:44,082
My demon is as real as yours is.

232
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:46,285
From my birth, my
upbringing was not

233
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,190
what most people would
consider a happy one.

234
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,294
To ensure that I became
the strongest of Shinobi,

235
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:55,165
my father had cast
his ninjutsu on me,

236
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,470
infusing my unborn self
with the sand spirit.

237
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:02,877
I destroyed the life of a
woman who gave birth to me.

238
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,512
I was born a monster.

239
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:09,052
-(VOICEOVER) A sand spirit?

240
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:12,123
-Its name is Shukaku and
it's the living incarnation

241
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,859
of an old monk of
the sand village

242
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:18,065
who'd been sealed
up in a jar of tea.

243
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:18,866
-Yeah.

244
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,669
Some kind of demonic jutsu.

245
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,506
But to use it on a baby?

246
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,241
Before it's even born?

247
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,310
Man, that's creepy.

248
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:31,485
-(VOICEOVER) Can it be true?

249
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,455
He's got one inside of him too?

250
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:37,861
-(SARCASTICALLY) Gee.

251
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,764
What a swell guy your
dad must've been.

252
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,301
He really must have
loved you a lot.

253
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,237
-You speak of love?

254
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,510
Don't measure me
by your standards.

255
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,513
Love.

256
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:51,814
Family.

257
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:55,253
The only emotional ties
I have to my family

258
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,091
are the ones I'd like to
wrap around their necks.

259
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,995
They're only ties of hate.

260
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,365
Given life by the
death of my mother,

261
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:05,569
I was brought into
being and nurtured

262
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,738
as the salvation of the village.

263
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:10,776
I was the Kazekage child.

264
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,313
My father taught me
the innermost secrets

265
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,582
of the Shinobi.

266
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,087
He pampered and protected
me and left mt to myself.

267
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,390
For a time, I thought
that was love.

268
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:27,767
And that was when
everything started.

269
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,069
-When what started?

270
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,743
-What was it?

271
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,212
Are you gonna tell us or not?

272
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,853
So go on.

273
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:41,722
What started?

274
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:42,389
What was it?

275
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:49,199
-In the six years since
I became six years old,

276
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:53,204
my father tried to destroy me
more times than I can count.

277
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:56,343
[gasping]

278
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,847
-You just finished saying
how your father pampered

279
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,382
and protected you.

280
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,450
So which is it?

281
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:12,332
-Those who get to be too strong
are apt to become feared.

282
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,803
The jutsu that gave me
birth had unbalanced

283
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:16,405
something in my mind.

284
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:18,308
Even the fools in
my village finally

285
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,946
realized I had
emotional problems.

286
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,650
My father, the
Kazekage, had created me

287
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:26,287
as his ultimate weapon.

288
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,091
But I eventually became a
threat to the very village

289
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:30,459
I was meant to save.

290
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:34,465
By the time I was six, I
became a figure of terror

291
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,201
to the villagers.

292
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:39,139
To them, I was a
relic of the past

293
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,475
that they wished
would disappear.

294
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,313
So you see, I had failed
at the one purpose

295
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:47,251
for which I was given life.

296
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,721
What then was left for
me in this existence?

297
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,590
Why go on living?

298
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,929
For a long time, I couldn't
find an answer to that.

299
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:58,300
But in order to live,
you need a purpose.

300
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:03,174
To exist for no reason is
the same as being dead.

301
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,610
-What is this guy talking about?

302
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:11,319
-(VOICEOVER) I know just
what he means, exactly.

303
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:16,060
He's-- he's the same as me.

304
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,030
-Then in time the
answer came to me.

305
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,601
To put it simply my
reason for living

306
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,336
is in the killing of others.

307
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,306
For years I lived
in fear of those

308
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,242
who were sent to murder me.

309
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:30,146
But now I am at peace.

310
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,051
I killed many
would-be assassins.

311
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,554
And it was while I was
doing it that the truth was

312
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,257
made clear to me.

313
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,627
I live solely for myself.

314
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,663
I love only myself.

315
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:44,968
As it was the death of my
mother that first gave me life,

316
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,238
now it is the death of
others that sustains me.

317
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:50,343
That makes me almost
happy to be alive.

318
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:54,416
And there's no end to it
as long as there are still

319
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:59,556
people to kill in this
great, wide, crowded world.

320
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,960
I will never disappear.

321
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:02,961
-(VOICEOVER) This freak.

322
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:05,966
He's out of his mind.

323
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,136
-(VOICEOVER) I was alone too.

324
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,942
I didn't know what I was
here for, why I was alive.

325
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,311
Until Iruka sensei came along.

326
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,581
He saw what was in me.

327
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,886
He gave me a purpose,
a reason for living.

328
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,357
But this guy had no one.

329
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,094
He had to find the
answer on his own.

330
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,364
And this is what
he came up with.

331
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,467
To kill in order to live.

332
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,476
Could I have ended
up like that if--

333
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:39,949
[gasp]

334
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:46,358
We're so different, but we're
so close to being the same.

335
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,293
No.

336
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:49,229
I don't think I
can beat this guy.

337
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,202
-Hey, where you going?

338
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,270
What's wrong?

339
00:19:54,304 --> 00:20:01,447
[sand falling]

340
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,783
-(VOICEOVER) He shouldn't
be able to do that.

341
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:07,723
Not with my shadow
possession jutsu on him.

342
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:11,629
[gasp]

343
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:13,965
-Naruto.

344
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,302
Hey, wake up.

345
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:19,440
Oh man, what a drag.

346
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:20,107
Naruto.

347
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,309
-Now, let me feel alive.

348
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,615
-Incoming.

349
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,183
-All right.

350
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,019
That's enough.

351
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,521
Save it til tomorrow.

352
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:32,125
That's when the final
competition begins.

353
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,162
You're just wasting it today.

354
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:36,966
Is that what you want?

355
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,670
-Don't leave me alone.

356
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:41,773
I'm not bleeding
but it hurts a lot.

357
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,015
What am I?

358
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:50,987
What am I?

359
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:58,477
[gaara breathing]

360
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,388
-All the same, I will kill you.

361
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:17,859
Just you wait.

362
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:19,895
I'll kill you all.

363
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,066
[footsteps]

364
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,439
THEME SONG: [Japanese]

365
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:02,955
-Hey.

366
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:04,189
Konohamaru, what's going on?

367
00:23:04,223 --> 00:23:06,326
I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

368
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,029
Come on, I'm going to be late.

369
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:09,531
The final competition's
about to start.

370
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,567
Everything I've
trained for, lived for.

371
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,971
The whole point of my
existence up til now.

372
00:23:14,004 --> 00:23:15,306
And what am I doing?

373
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,646
Messing around with you
on this stupid shortcut.

374
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,749
Next time.

375
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:23,715
The Final Rounds, Rush
to the Battle Arena.

376
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:30,615
[moan] That's what I get
for listening to a kid.

377
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,249
