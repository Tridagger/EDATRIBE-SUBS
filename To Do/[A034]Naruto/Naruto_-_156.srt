-We should hurry back
to the restaurant, then.

-(THINKING) That
lightning just now,

7
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:05,275
it came from over the
Katabami gold mine.

Boss, but how?

-No, it can't-- Ranmaru.

11
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:40,675
Ranmaru, wake up already.

12
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,708
Quit joking around, OK?

13
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,742
It isn't funny.

14
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,142
Hey, Ranmaru.

15
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,075
Tell me.

16
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:55,008
Tell me what you did to Ranmaru.

-Nothing.

18

I swear.

19

KARASHI: Ranmaru, he, he
laid his hands on you, boss.

22
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,475
And you came back.

23
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,442

-You know, I'm not
a real smart person.

60
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:42,775
He's dead.

61
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,775
And I don't know
how it happened.

62
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:47,008
I don't have the slightest idea.

63
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:50,342
So who killed him?

64
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,008
Was it you?

65
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:51,708
-No.

66
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:54,175
It wasn't me, I swear.

67
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,275
Maybe those guys from
the Leaf Village.

00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,208
-[gasp] You're right.

69
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:01,175
If those brats had
never come, then I

70
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,175
could have had Ranmaru
with me forever.

71
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,708
Where are they hiding?

72
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:06,508
Come on.

73
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,875
You better know where.

74
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:09,642
Because if you
don't, you're dead.

75
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:13,408
-Yeah, I know, maybe.

76
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,542

79
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,742
And take me where they are.

80
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:26,708
Get up!

81
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:31,642
-Yes, boss. [whimpering]

82
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,642
-Don't go yet, Ranmaru.

83
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,575
I haven't given you a funeral.

84
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,042

their corpses at your feet.

This child, did he
really sacrifice

89
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,175
himself to save
the likes of Raiga?

little longer, Ranmaru.

we're almost done

You kids sure did a lot

-You'll never believe
what happened.

Oh, it was horrible, mom.

Karashi what are
you talking about?

109
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,542
-It's Tenten.

110
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,408

112
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:32,742
-What do you mean?

113
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:33,508
What happened to her?

114
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:35,475
-She-- she fell off a cliff.

115
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,275
-What?

116
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,208
What are you talking about?

117
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:41,975
-We were both running, Tenten
and I. Lee was still busy.

118
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:45,108
And she told me I
could train with her.

119
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,375
But then, when we
got to Lighting Pass,

120
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:50,908
a bolt of lightning hit a
tree and knocked i towards us.

121
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:53,942
And Tenten, Tenten fell
off the cliff, all the way

122
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,242
to the bottom.

123
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,442
-How awful!

124
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,542
Hurry back and
help the poor girl.

125
00:09:58,575 --> 00:09:59,575
-We have to go.

126
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,042
Tenten needs our help.

127
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:01,542
-Yeah!

00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,808
-Uh, go on.

129
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,775
And I, I'm going to go
grab the first aid kit.

130
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,042
I'll be right behind you.

131
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,175
I promise.

132
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,908
-Very well.

133
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:17,775
Naruto, Lee, let's go.

134
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:18,275
-Right.

135
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:18,775
-Right!

136
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,075
-Karashi, what are you--

137
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,208
-I'm going to run away.

138
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,675
And so are you, mom.

139
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,208
-What on earth are you
talking about, child?

140
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,075
-It doesn't matter.

141
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,975
I'll explain it all later.

142
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,742
Grab your stuff, and let's go.

143
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,342
-I'll be waiting
at Lighting Pass.

144
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,842
So bring them to me, you worm.

145
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,375
I will have my revenge.

146
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:49,108
If you don't, the corpses
I lay at Ranmaru's feet

147
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,842
during his funeral will
be you and your mother.

148
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,208
-Mom, we gotta go.

149
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:55,908
I'm begging you.

150
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:58,008
-I don't want to.

151
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,142
No sir.

152
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,942
I'm not budging until
anyone else comes back.

153
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,475
-You don't get it.

154
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:04,942
We're leaving, mom, now!

155
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:05,908
GRANDMA: Let go of me!

156
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,342
No, Karashi, I won't.

157
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,375
-Would lightning in
some tree really be

158
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,375
enough to send
Tenten over a cliff?

159
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:18,008
-Huh?

160
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,108
What do you mean?

161
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,175
-I don't know.

162
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,342
Perhaps Karashi's
training didn't stick.

163
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,975
-That is my fault.

164
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,775
-Then what?

165
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,308
-Maybe, maybe it's some
kind of trap again.

166
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:31,175
LEE: Or someone is
threatening him.

167
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,475
-But we already beat
the Kurosuki family.

168
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:35,342
-Maybe my eyes were clouded.

169
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,342
NARUTO: No way.

170
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,342
It's him.

171
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:43,775
[thunder]

172
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,005
-He's burning up.

173
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:01,472
-Is he still gone?

174
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,172
-Raiga woke up.

175
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,339
Let's worry about you.

176
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:06,672
-It's all right.

177
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,705
I know I'm going to
be dead soon, anyway.

178
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,905
-I won't let that happen.

179
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,472
You're not getting
off that easy, no way.

180
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:16,605
The people you and Raiga
killed, they all wanted to live.

181
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,539
But you didn't leave
them that choice.

182
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,439
You decided for them.

183
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:23,905
Well, you don't get to
decide this time, OK?

184
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,005
You're going to live.

185
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,839
And you're going to
take some responsibility

186
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:31,005
for all those people
whose lives you cut short.

-[coughing]

188
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,105
-Are you OK?

189
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,572
[wind howling and wood creaking]

190
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,372
-(THINKING) The storm.

191
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,372
We won't be safe here.

192
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:42,772
I'll take him to
grandma's place.

193
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,439
-Ready to die?

194
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,372
-Raiga.

195
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:54,905
-He is alive.

196
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,439
You were right.

197
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,439
-Come on, Raiga.

198
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,539
Let's do this thing.

199
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,372
And this time, you're
going down for good.

200
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,372
-[roaring]

201
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,872
-[roaring]

202
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,094
-Lee!

203
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,305
-This is it!

204
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,272
What are you doing?

205
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,072
What's going on?

206
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,072
His lightning's way
stronger this time.

207
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:33,872
[screaming]

208
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:36,272
-He was using sheer
chakra before.

209
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:38,839
So there was a limit to
the power he was wielding.

210
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:42,272
But this time, he's using
real lightning as his source.

211
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:48,239
If he can draw upon the
power of nature itself,

212
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:51,939
truly harness it,
there's no stopping him.

213
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,939
-[roaring]

214
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:55,439
-Get down, now!

215
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:01,439
[inaudible]

216
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:10,405
If we can dodge his attacks, and
take the battle right to him--

217
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,672
Naruto!

218
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,505
-One step ahead of you.

219
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:18,439
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

220
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,372
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

221
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,772
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

222
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,239
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

223
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,739
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

224
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,705
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

225
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,705
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

226
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:50,639
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

227
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,605
-Excellent work, Naruto.

228
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,439
Gentle fist.

229
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,239
[groaning]

230
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:06,105
-Negi!

231
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,839
[screaming]

232
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,672
-[chuckling] You brat.

233
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,372
Are you really that dumb?

234
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:21,005
This isn't extraordinary
chakra I'm blasting you with.

235
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,439
It's actual lightning.

236
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:31,405
[chuckling] You
really are that dumb.

237
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,339
LEE: Stop it.

238
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,105
How dare you
disrespect an opponent

239
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,405
who fought you with all he had?

240
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,972
-Oh, I remember you.

241
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,039
On second thought, no funeral.

242
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,772
I'll just kill you.

243
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:03,539
-I'm very angry.

244
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,372
[coughing]

245
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:18,605
-Karashi, what are you doing?

246
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,005
-I'll explain later.

247
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,639
Please, just come with me.

248
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:23,039
We have to go, now.

249
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,505
-I'm staying put,
and that's that.

250
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:26,439
Oh, Tenten.

251
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,839
This stupid son of
mine did what now?

252
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:34,839
-Ow!

253
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,405
It's not like I had a choice.

254
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,705
If the boss had stayed dead,
I wouldn't have done it.

255
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:41,139
Look, he's going to
kill us if we stay here.

256
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,872
We have to run away.

257
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,605
-Go if you want, Grandma Sansho.

258
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,872
-What?

259
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,505
-But I'm not running away.

260
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,705
And I'm not giving up.

261
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:52,539
I will save this child.

262
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:53,572
-[coughing]

263
00:16:56,872 --> 00:17:00,705
-Well then, I'll stay and feed
the curry of life to this boy.

264
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,472
-Grandma.

265
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,572
-Why not?

266
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,505
My curry certainly did
the trick with Lee.

267
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,872
-[giggling]

268
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:14,172
-Well, don't blame
me if he gets worse.

269
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,805
-[screaming]

270
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,939
-I hate this kid.

271
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,172
-One and two, and one and two.

272
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:31,072
One and two, and one and two.

273
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:35,139
One and two, and one and two.

274
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:38,105
-This is bad, really bad.

275
00:17:56,572 --> 00:18:00,005
-[roaring]

276
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,439

277
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,405
-Ah!

278
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,905
[screaming]

279
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:21,405
-[sniffing]

280
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:34,839
-Eat this.

281
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,839
You'll feel a lot better.

282
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:44,272
Just a bite?

283
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:45,805
-Oh.

284
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,205
KARASHI: You messed up
on the blend of spices.

285
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,139
-I did what?

286
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,939
Son, are you honestly
telling me you

287
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:04,072
memorized it, my recipe
for the curry of life?

288
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,180
Karashi.

289
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,039
-Here it is.

290
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,572
One genuine order of our
signature curry of life.

291
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,372
-Here, try this.

292
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:31,705
Are you so dependent
on Raiga you can't even

293
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,072
eat when you're not with him?

294
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,905
-Why?

295
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,005
Why are you helping me?

296
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,339
-Do I need a reason
to not let you die?

297
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:44,072
Grandma Sansho and Karashi
put their heart and soul

298
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,305
into making this curry.

299
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,605
They did it to save you.

300
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,939
Don't you feel anything
seeing the two of them

301
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,772
try their best
for you like that?

302
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,672
Because if you don't
feel something,

303
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:57,805
then you're just a
horrible human being.

304
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,039
People help each other,
whether it's saving their life

305
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,572
or just lending a hand.

306
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:06,005
If someone needs help, don't
you naturally just step in?

307
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:14,739
-Well, why don't you go ahead
and try it, just one bite?

308
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:29,372
-[gasp] [gulping]

309
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:31,472
-So was it good?

310
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:34,172
What you're feeling, that's
what it feels like to live.

311
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,405
-[gasp]

312
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,005
-Raiga.

313
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,305
I want him to eat
this curry, too.

314
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,639
-Let's go.

315
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:53,105

316
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:04,372
-[screaming]

317
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,505
I'm still standing.

318
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,305
-This kid is unbelievable.

319
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,739

321
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:03,567
NARUTO: Darn it.

322
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:06,534
What in the world
happened to my body?

323
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,601
I mean, everywhere I look,
stuff is pitch black.

324
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:10,934
And I'm all numb.

325
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,834
And I can't move anything.

326
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,201
Whoa.

327
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,301
What's this feeling?

328
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,767
It's warm.

329
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,001
My whole body is burning up.

330
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,867
And there's this taste
bringing energy up

331
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,401
from the bottom of my stomach!

332
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:29,801
Next time, "Run,
the Curry of Life."
