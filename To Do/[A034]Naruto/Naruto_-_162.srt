00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,044
[theme song]

2
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,078
-What is it?

3
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:18,778
What's wrong?

4
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:44,478
-You!

5
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:45,978
Identify yourself!

6
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:46,478
Now!

7
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,711
-It was you, wasn't it?

8
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:05,578
You killed him.

9
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:06,078
-What?

10
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:06,652
Me?

11
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,178
No.

12
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,544
I know nothing about it.

13
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:09,044
I swear.

14
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:25,611
The cursed warrior.

15
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:39,978
-Hey!

16
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,011
Look at me!

17
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,211
I'm a booger!

18
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:47,511
It gets boring training alone.

19
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,811
Specially if you're not
really training for anything.

20
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,611
When are we gonna
go after Sasuke,

21
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,344
or something big like that?

22
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:06,011
-A request from the
Land of Birds, huh?

23
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,711
That's a long way from here.

24
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:08,711
-Yes.

25
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,511
That was our first
reaction as well.

26
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,311
-An apparition in the
form of a cursed warrior

27
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:17,511
is terrorizing the people and
giving rise to wicked rumors.

28
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:20,744
They want us to
go catch a ghost?

29
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,911
-I told the man it was too
far to go on such a wild goose

30
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,644
chase, but he was
incredibly persistent.

31
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,544
-I've been ordered not to
accept no for an answer.

32
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,778
I am begging you to
accept this mission.

33
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,544
Is it because the
money isn't enough?

34
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,844
Is that it?

35
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:51,144
This is a difficult time
for the Land of Birds.

36
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,678
We had to bankrupt our treasury
to afford even that much.

37
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,178
-It's not a question
of the money.

38
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,211
My problem is with the
nature of the mission itself.

39
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,678
But, now that you mention
it, there's not enough here

40
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:04,944
to even cover out
travel expenses.

41
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,911
-Then I have no choice.

42
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:10,111
I must make the
ultimate sacrifice.

43
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:10,778
-Wait!

44
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,278
No!

45
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:25,444
-I'll throw in all the
money I have in the world.

46
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,644
Everything I own I
will gladly give up.

47
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:28,544
Please.

48
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,611
Just say yes.

49
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:30,111
-Aw.

50
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,644
-Uh-huh.

51
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:41,044
So you gave in, huh?

52
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:41,744
-Yeah.

53
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:43,278
I'm just a big softy.

54
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,644
Problem is, most of
our jonin and chunin

55
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,611
are out on other missions.

56
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:50,044
I don't know who to
give this one to.

57
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:54,211
-Ah-- ah-- ah-choo!

58
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,544
-I guess someone must
be talking about you.

59
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:57,344
-No way.

60
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:58,478
They're all out on missions.

61
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,444
Anyway, isn't that when
your ears are burning?

62
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,378
Hey, who is that guy?

63
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,611
-Whoever he is, he's been
lurking there for a while.

64
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,678
-How am I supposed
to swallow my ramen

65
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,378
with you staring
at me like that?

66
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,078
If you're hungry, go in
there and order some!

67
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:32,444
-Who said I'm hungry?

68
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,878
[stomach growling]

69
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,178
-Huh?

70
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,111
[slurping]

71
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,644
-It's good, huh?

72
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,111
Another bowl?

73
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:51,678
-Yeah.

74
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,811
Please.

75
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:54,111
-Thanks for coming.

76
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:57,011
And as long as Naruto's
treating, come back any time.

77
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,244
-Oh, brother.

78
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:00,944
Oh, no, you weren't
hungry at all, were you?

79
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:02,178
-I'm sorry.

80
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,311
I, uh-- kind of got carried
away there, didn't I?

81
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,011
I really apprec--

82
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:05,678
-Eh, that's all right.

83
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,544
Don't worry about it.

84
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:07,911
I was happy to help out.

85
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,578
So anyway, tell
me about yourself.

86
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:10,811
What's your name?

87
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,478
I take it you're a stranger
around here, right?

88
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,311
-That's right.

89
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,778
I come from the Land of Birds.

90
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,078
My name's Chishima.

91
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,344
I've traveled here with a
mission for the Leaf Village

92
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,444
ninja.

93
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:22,111
-I hate to say it,
but it takes money

94
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:24,344
to get a mission like that.

95
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,744
-I just finished paying for
it out of my own pocket.

96
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,544
That's why I'm totally broke.

97
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:29,711
-Really?

98
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:32,911
So I guess this mission
must mean a lot to you.

99
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,044
-It could mean the difference
between life and death

100
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,144
for a very dear friend of mine.

101
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:38,711
-Life and death, huh?

102
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,778
What sort of trouble
is your friend in?

103
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,511
-Sagi and I have been
close since we were little.

104
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,411
We were raised like brothers.

105
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,744
He's now the lord of
the Land of Birds.

106
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:49,878
-Whoa!

107
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,944
I'm sitting here with
the brother of a lord?

108
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:52,578
-No.

109
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,578
You misunderstand.

110
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,211
We grew up together,
and our bond

111
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,711
is as strong as
that of brothers.

112
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,211
But I'm merely his friend.

113
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,278
-Oh.

114
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:03,378
So I guess he's a real
young feudal lord.

115
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,844
-Huh?

116
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:07,611
Well, anyway, things have been
very hard for my friend Sagi

117
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:08,978
recently.

118
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,611
First with the death of his
father, Lord Owashi, and then

119
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:13,344
his twin sister
died shortly after.

120
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,978
And now the friend I once
knew, always smiling,

121
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,178
always cheerful, has become
like a different person.

122
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:22,111
He won't show his face in the
village, even when I visit him.

123
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,778
This change in him
worries the others,

124
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,144
because Sagi is the
lord of our land.

125
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,744
I don't care about all that.

126
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,744
I'm worried because
he's my friend.

127
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:38,078
I would do anything to help
him, to bring him back again.

128
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:41,244
No matter the cost.

129
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,278
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

130
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,578
That's just the way
I felt about Sasuke.

131
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,944
The way I still feel.

132
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:51,444
-Just leave everything to me.

133
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,844
After all, that's what
friends are for, right?

134
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:55,720
-Right.

135
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,578
-I've seen some dirty
tricks in my time,

136
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,444
but this takes the cake!

137
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,878
-Listen, you.

138
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:08,611
The least you could
do is knock before you

139
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,078
come barging in here.

140
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:10,711
-Yeah, yeah.

141
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:12,011
Never mind that.

142
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,478
What do you mean by taking
every cent the poor guy has

143
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,811
and then refusing to
do his mission for him?

144
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,111
-Huh?

145
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:21,078
-You oughta be ashamed of
yourself, Grandma Tsunade.

146
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:24,611
You're a big, fat cheat!

147
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,711
-You want to try that again?

148
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:27,678
NARUTO: Ow!

149
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,611
Never mind!

150
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:29,111
Sorry!

151
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:35,111
-I hope I didn't
get him in trouble.

152
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:36,778
Poor Naruto.

153
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,611
-I wouldn't worry about him.

154
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:42,711
He may not seem like
it, but he's solid.

155
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:47,344
You picked a good one
to have on your side.

156
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,244
-Oh.

157
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:49,644
Thank you.

158
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:50,478
-Idiot.

159
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,378
Who said I refused his mission?

160
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,211
-I see.

161
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,611
So you weren't cheating him.

162
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,378
You were waiting for Neji to get
back from the mission he's on.

163
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:01,211
-That's right, you little jerk.

164
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,211
So, Neji is finishing
a mission with Lee.

165
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:06,478
Meanwhile, find
Tenten and get ready.

166
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,144
You'll be going out with
Neji as squad leader.

167
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,211
Got it?

168
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,211
-Yeah.

169
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,078
-By the way, did
your friend tell you

170
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,244
the details of the mission?

171
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:16,478
-Well, no.

172
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:17,044
Not exactly.

173
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,144
-Their land's being haunted.

174
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,511
-I-- what?

175
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:28,044
-They call it the
cursed warrior.

176
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,611
A ghost wearing white armor that
appears in the dead of night.

177
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:34,978
Or so they say.

178
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:35,478
Huh?

179
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,144
-It's nothing.

180
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,278
I just thought
you said something

181
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:42,444
about a ghost, that's all.

182
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,344
-I did.

183
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:43,878
What's wrong?

184
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,911
You scared?

185
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,844
-Course not.

186
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,344
What kind of ninja
would I be if I

187
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,911
was scared by stuff like that?

188
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,444
But come to think
of it, will ninjutsu

189
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,411
even work against a ghost?

190
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,078
-Good question.

191
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,411
-Looks like you'll be the
first to find out, Naruto.

192
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,311
-Thanks a lot.

193
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,678
You know, you could have
said something before

194
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,444
about there being
a ghost involved.

195
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,811
-I didn't mention it?

196
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,478
I thought I did.

197
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,444
-No.

198
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,044
I think I would have
remembered that.

199
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,178
But anyway, it's
just a rumor, right?

200
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,378
Has anyone seen it?

201
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,911
-Well, I've never
seen it myself, but--

202
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,411
-I thought so.

203
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,444
-Then again, my master, Lord
Moso, saw it with his own eyes,

204
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,611
so close he could
feel its breath.

205
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,978
-That close, huh?

206
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,244
-The Land of Birds.

207
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,378
That's a long journey.

208
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,111
-Delicious.

209
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,844
Is it all gone?

210
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,578
-You sure eat a lot
for being so skinny.

211
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:45,078
-I know.

212
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,278
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:50,144
Everyone's always wondering
where I put it all.

214
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:51,711
-OK, so anyway.

215
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:55,311
Do your people really believe
in this cursed warrior guy?

216
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:57,311
-Some think it's the
disembodied spirit

217
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,844
of Sagi's father, Lord Owashi.

218
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:02,978
-I've never liked that
word, disembodied.

219
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,678
-Well.

220
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,478
Forgetting the ghost
for now, why don't you

221
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,244
tell us more of the
history of your land?

222
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:09,944
The background?

223
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:11,144
-All right.

224
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:13,344
It's called the Land of
Birds because our capital

225
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:17,578
is built on a lake to which the
birds come when they migrate.

226
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:20,144
It's always been a green
and peaceful place,

227
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:24,011
made fertile by the waters from
the lake and the many canals.

228
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,578
The first signs of trouble
came with the sudden death

229
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:29,644
of our previous
leader, Lord Owashi.

230
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,878
As to who would take
over the leadership

231
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,278
it was between his son, Lord
Sagi, and his most trusted

232
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,678
advisor, Lord Komei.

233
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:40,111
Lord Komei argued
that Sagi was far too

234
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,244
young to assume
the role, and there

235
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,244
were many who agreed with him.

236
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,944
Nevertheless Lord Sagi
was eventually chosen,

237
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,144
largely because Moso--
our high priest,

238
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,744
and my master-- agreed
to act as regent,

239
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,944
advising Sagi and
helping him to govern.

240
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,911
Then, less than a half
a year later, Lady Toki,

241
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:02,978
Sagi's twin sister, died
as suddenly as his father.

242
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,078
Since that time
the Sagi I knew has

243
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,244
become a completely
different person.

244
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,744
He's retreated from view,
sees no one, governs the land

245
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:23,444
from within the
confines of his palace.

246
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,678
And it was about that time
that the white warrior

247
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,411
began appearing in the capital.

248
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:31,378
Rumors started to spread
about Lord Owashi's death,

249
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:35,378
that it was not a natural one.

250
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,111
People began to say that
the white warrior was

251
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,778
in fact the spirit of
Lord Owashi come back

252
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:44,444
to Earth to wreak vengeance on
the traitors who murdered him.

253
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:44,944
-Vengeance.

254
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,078
Great.

255
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:47,311
-Huh.

256
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,278
I don't believe for one
second this spirit is real.

257
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:51,578
-Then what do you--

258
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,311
-It sounds like this High
Priest Moso gained the most

259
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,044
from Lord Owashi's death.

260
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,144
-My master is a good
and virtuous man.

261
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:00,211
He could never be
involved in this.

262
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,078
-Well, what about
that other guy?

263
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,144
-Exactly.

264
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,344
It's Komei, the advisor,
I'm suspicious of.

265
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:08,611
He could have assassinated
Lord Owashi to gain power,

266
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,911
and then got angry
when it didn't work.

267
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:11,911
-It's true.

268
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,311
He's been complaining
bitterly ever

269
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,611
since Lord Sagi was
chosen over him.

270
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:17,578
I wouldn't put it past
him to have manufactured

271
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:23,144
the cursed warrior himself, and
then started these evil rumors.

272
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:24,244
-Yeah, exactly.

273
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,611
Now you're talking.

274
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:29,711
The ghost isn't any ghost at
all, but this Lord Komei guy.

275
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:32,244
-So the mystery's solved
just like that, eh?

276
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:54,578
-We've patrolled the
perimeter again, Lord Komei.

277
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,478
Nothing to report.

278
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:56,978
-Hm.

279
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:01,978
Very well, then.

280
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,011
Turn in.

281
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:03,844
-Thank you, sir.

282
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:11,844
-Hm?

283
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:04,501
-OK.

284
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,335
How much farther?

285
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,468
-Not much.

286
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,201
Lord Moso's house
is just up ahead.

287
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,568
-Where is he?

288
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,335
-Which way'd he go?

289
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,435
-Where's he gone?

290
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:21,168
-There!

291
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:21,701
-Ah!

292
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:22,201
-He's here!

293
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:22,968
-Get him!

294
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,101
-Pull him down from there!

295
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:31,235
-It's the cursed warrior!

296
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:35,468
-Whoa!

297
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,735
He vanished!

298
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,168
-My Lord Komei,
are you all right?

299
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,201
-Yes.

300
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:42,901
I'm fine.

301
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,868
Get ahold of yourself.

302
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,368

303
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,301
-What's that sound?

304
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,168
-The thing can fly?

305
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,068
-Clad all in white, with
a helmet and a halberd

306
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,868
in its hand, wearing the
mask of an evil demon

307
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,268
with eyes of fire.

308
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,201
There can be no doubt about it.

309
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,801
That's the cursed warrior.

310
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,368
-Let's go.

311
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:19,535
-No offense, but I think
I'll move faster on my own.

312
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,135
Wait right here, OK?

313
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,635
While I find out who
this ghost really is.

314
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:24,501
-Oh.

315
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:25,001
OK.

316
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:41,901
-Where is he now?

317
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:43,368
-He's right up ahead.

318
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:01,701
-Byakugan.

319
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,368
I don't see him.

320
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,668
-We know he went in there.

321
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:16,835
-Yes.

322
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:20,001
But there's no human
presence in that building.

323
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,335
At least, I don't detect the
presence of a living human.

-Huh?

325
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:24,835
What the heck does that mean?

326
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:25,668
No, wait a second.

327
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,801
I don't think I want to know.

328
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:27,835
-Quiet.

329
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,735

something just now.

Good job, Neji.

00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:41,768
I thought you said
nobody was in there?

-Not quite.

00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:45,735
I said no living
body was in there.

-OK, I've officially
had enough of this.

behind this little prank.

-Ooh, I didn't get a
very good look at him.

363
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:14,956
-What do you mean?

364
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:15,889
Assassins?

365
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:16,823
-Perhaps.

366
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,656
And they could be shinobi.

367
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,156
So be on your guard, everyone.

368
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:21,089
-Right.

369
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:25,123
-Protect Lord Sagi
no matter what.

370
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:29,523
Next time-- The
Tactician's Intent!
