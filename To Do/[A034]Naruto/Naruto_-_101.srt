00:01:55,528 --> 00:02:01,828
-Hey, you want to see it,
don't cha I'd say it's time.

3
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:02,895
-For what?

4
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:03,728
-Come on.

5
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,728
You know what I'm talking about.

6
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:08,562
Kakashi Sensei's real face.

00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,528
--[screaming] What's
the matter with you?

8
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,295
-Please.

9
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,762
This is the lame.

10
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:15,028
You can count me out.

11
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:17,995
When we finish today's
mission, I'm outta here.

12
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:20,428
-Yeah, you're totally
right. (THINKING)

13
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:24,662
Who am I kidding.
[giggling] This sounds fun.

14
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:31,762
-What if he has lips, like a
blimp. (ECHOING) Like a blimp.

15
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:49,228
--[giggling] (THINKING)
Just one more little push.

16
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,362
Or maybe buck teeth.

17
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,628
(ECHOING) Buck teeth.

18
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:10,128
NARUTO: Gotta see, gotta know
Kakashi Sensei's true face.

19
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:12,295
KAKASHI SENSEI: Well, this
is out of the ordinary.

20
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,695
-Here, thanks for waiting.

21
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,162
The three of you
treating me to lunch?

22
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,562
I wouldn't be surprised
if it snowed on me.

23
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,128
-He fell for it.

24
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,895
-You know what I mean?

25
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:29,495
-Here, thanks for waiting.

The three of you
treating me to lunch?

I wouldn't be surprised
if it snowed on me today,

28
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:36,662
or something.

29
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,495
-He fell for it.

30
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,528
Is that the idea?

00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:47,195
-Here, thanks for waiting.

-The three of you

You're not going to drop a big
pile of snow on me are you,

34
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:56,628
or something like that?

35
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,895
No, I'm just being silly.

36
00:03:58,928 --> 00:03:59,395
Oh!

37
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:09,295
-He fell for it.

38

Come on.

40
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,895
You guys are up to
something, right?

00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,328
-W-w-w-w-w-what?

42
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,262
Are you crazy?

43
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:20,195
-Kakashi Sensei, please.

44
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,028
You've just been
out of the hospital.

45
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,528
Now, uh, p-please.

46
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,528
Uh, why don't you
just go ahead and eat.

-Well, all right then.

48
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,628
I suppose I should just dig in.

-Thank you for waiting.

pork is on us.

-Hey, Sasuke.

55
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:50,328
What a coincidence!

I can't see squat.

59
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:59,295
-Ah, all done.

60
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,795
That was tasty.

61
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,095
-So fast?

62
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,095
Something wrong?

63
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,062
-[giggling] No.

64
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,028
Of course not.

65
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,062
What makes you say that?

66
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,462
-What the--

67
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:08,962
-Huh?

68
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,162
-Huh?

69
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,762
-OK, now I'm curious.

71
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,128
-That's it.

72
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:25,062
Nothing's going to stop
me from seeing that face.

73
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,028
-Yeah, but how?

74
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,428
You got any ideas?

75
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,628
-Don't you worry.

76
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,862
We'll see it one way or another.

77
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:35,495
-I'm asking you how,
you stupid little troll.

78
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,795
-All right, smarty pants.

79
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,128
How do you propose we do it?

80
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,262
-Well, we--

81
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:42,828
-We'll just have to tail
him around for the day.

82
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,562
He'll take off the
mask eventually.

83
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,328
-Oh, Sasuke, I swear,
you are so smart.

84
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,362
-Oh, whatever.

85
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:49,695
Good plan, captain obvious.

86
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:50,595
-I'm sorry.

87
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:51,862
What was that?

88
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,262
-Uh, never mind.

Kakashi Sensei doing?

91

-It's so disappointing.

92
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,562
-He's onto us.

93
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:11,762
-Naruto, you idiot.

94
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:12,828
You blew our cover.

95
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:14,595
-Why the heck is it my fault?

96
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:22,862
-Wait, my favorite book
is going to be a movie?

97
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,795
I better order
tickets in advance.

98
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:26,528
-Hey, he's on the move.

99
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:27,928
-Let's go, before we lose him.

100
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:28,628
-Yeah, right.

101
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:35,428
-He' gone.

-Oh great.

103
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,262
He got away.

-Are you kidding?

105
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:39,862
Where did he vanish off to?

106
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:41,295
-Hey.

107
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:42,995
What are you three doing?

108
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,595
Do you guys need
me for something?

109
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,595
-Uh, no, not really.

110
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:48,095
-Hmm.

111
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:58,362
-Hey, how did he figure out
we were tailing him, huh?

112
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,628
-Maybe there were
just too many of us.

113
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:01,562
-Oh, please.

114
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:02,895
If you know how to
hide, it doesn't

115
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,528
matter how many
people there are.

116
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:08,195
Don't tell me you've forgotten
all of your Jutsu, Sakura.

117
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,995
-You're the one who forgets.

118
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,095
We should shadow him.

119
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,028
It'll be good practice.

120
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,928
But we should do
it solo this time.

121
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,095
-Yeah, I think so too.

122
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:18,962
We should totally ditch Naruto.

123
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:19,895
-Say what?

124
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:26,228
-Forlorn, Jinko fell on him.

125
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,528
I'm losing you.

126
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,428
And in doing so, I am lost.

127
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:39,395
-Huh?

128
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:40,362
What the?

129
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:49,128
-Ah.

130
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:49,962
Hmm?

131
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:53,862
-[nervous laughter] he got away.

132
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:56,128
-Just as clumsy as always.

133
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,162
-Why are you such an idiot?

00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:12,395
-Aw, what is Kakashi
Sensei doing?

136
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,962
He hasn't even moved in ages.

137
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,595
Don't tell me!

00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:28,062
Hmm?

00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,462
Huh?

145
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:42,562
SAKURA: Sasuke, how did it go?

146
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,795
-I got tired of shadowing him.

00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,228
-[sighs]

148
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:57,095
-Off we go.

-(THINKING) Our mission
is helping out at a farm.

150
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,828
-(THINKING) The mission
itself is no big deal.

151
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:05,262

happens, we're going to see it.

-What's with you guys today?

154
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:14,528
You seem ready for anything.

155
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,628
-Oh, we're ready all right.

156
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:17,728
-Hmm.

157
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:19,095
-All righty then.

158
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:19,762
Good to hear.

159
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:29,962
-So, I finally found
you, Kakashi Hatake.

160
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:41,575
Oh, Kakashi, it's
been a long time.

161
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,875
But my revenge is
finally at hand.

162
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:45,442
-Your revenge?

163
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,442
For what, boss?

164
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:48,142
-You fool!

165
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,442
Have you forgotten?

166
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,309
Well, I haven't.

167
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,042
It was three years
ago in the spring.

168
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,542
-No!

169
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,609
-There's no need
to be frightened.

170
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,075
-No!

171
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:06,142
-Our boss says he has something
he needs to talk to you about.

00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:06,775
-Your boss?

Marry me.

176
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:20,875
I beg of you.

177
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:21,542
-Wow, boss.

00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,975
You're the man!

-Eww.

-Don't be shy now.

Embrace your
emotions, my flower,

and fly to my boss-- whoa!

00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,075
-No, thanks.

00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:38,375
Even if you don't like what
you see, I'm filthy rich.

186
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,209
-I said no, OK?

187
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,209
-What?

188
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,809
How could you possibly
refuse me-- oh!

189
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,642
-No means no!

190
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:50,042
-But I arranged such
a romantic setting.

191
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,542
-What part of no
don't you understand?

192
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,742
KAKASHI SENSEI: I think this
has gone on long enough.

193
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,675
-Huh?

194
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,175
-Howdy do.

195
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,809
Look, it doesn't matter
how you slice it.

196
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,642
I don't think the
lady's interested.

197
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,775
Rejection hurts.

198
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,042
But what can you do?

199
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,009
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

200
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,642
-You got a lot of
nerve there, pal.

201
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:11,409
I don't think you grasp
who you're dealing with.

202
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,209
You're tangling with the
Moya triad, ninja trio

203
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,542
that strikes fear in
the hearts of children.

204
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:18,742
-Moya triad?

205
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,442
Never heard of you.

206
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,842
-Never heard of the Moya triad?

207
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,142
-You dare to mock us?

208
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:26,142
-Who do you think you are?

209
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,675
-Who, me?

210
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,642
The name's Kakashi Hatake.

211
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,442
I'm hardly worth mentioning.

212
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,975
-So why'd you even bother.

213
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:33,775
-No good scum.

214
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,609
-You'll live to regret this.

215
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:37,342
-You should know
better than to meddle

216
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,475
in a man's quest for love.

217
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:40,809
-Quest for love?

218
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:44,375
You mean stalking, don't you?

219
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,375
-Hold your tongue.

220
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,375
All right, boys, time to dance.

221
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,242
-Right.

222
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,609
-Four, three, two, one.

223
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:53,475
Hustle and bustle.

224
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,675
[screaming] [yelping]

225
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,309
-[neighing]

226
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,975
-Hey, come on, a
little help over here?

227
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:03,909
Seriously?

228
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,342
I'm pretty scared of heights.

229
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,209
-I'll take you back
to the village.

230
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,509
-Darling.

231
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,209
What are you-- are you just
going to leave us up here?

232
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,809
So anyway, that's
how it all went down.

233
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:16,509
-Don't gloat.

234
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,909
You're the one who lost.

235
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:20,409
-So now we're going to get
payback for three years ago.

236
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:21,375
[chuckling]

237
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,275
-The boss has only
gotten stronger.

238
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,875
He'll crush that chump into
dust if they go toe to toe.

239
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,942
The suspense is killing me.

240
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:28,809
Oh!

241
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:29,942
-You dingbat.

242
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,842
I'm not going to stick
my neck out like that.

243
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,475
-Huh?

244
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,709
-If I'm going to do this,
it will be from the shadows.

245
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,442
-That's pretty dirty.

246
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,609
[cawing]

247
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,342
-Oh, welcome.

248
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,142
My, my, my.

249
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,075
Welcome.

250
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:47,975
Welcome.

251
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:48,475
Welcome!

252
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:55,675
[giddy laughter]

253
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,175
-Oh, wow.

254
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,609
-That looks good.

255
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:01,342
-How lavish.

256
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,275
-Take your time.

257
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:11,542
[giggling] Enjoy
your meal, Kakashi.

258
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,209
For it will be your last.

259
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,809
I've added a tasteless
and odorless narcotic

260
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:19,809
to your food that brings
on uncontrollable hiccups.

261
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:25,809
Dig in, my friend, and
hiccup until you die.

262
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:28,409
A fitting end for
one such as you.

263
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:32,642
-Huh?

264
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,009
What's the matter with you guys?

265
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,909
No one's picking up
their chopsticks.

266
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,242
-Oh, it's nothing.

267
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,075
Don't wait on us,
Kakashi Sensei.

268
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,609
You go ahead and eat.

269
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:43,842
-Actually, I'm kind of
on a diet right now.

270
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,475
-(THINKING) So that's how
he wants to play it, huh?

271
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,042
Well I don't care what it takes.

272
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,275
That mask is coming off.

273
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,075
Oh no.

274
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,575
My hand slipped.

275
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:53,075
Whoa.

276
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,975
[screaming]

277
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:09,375
-Are you out of your mind?

278
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,309
-Sorry about that.

279
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:11,542
My hand just slipped.

280
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,942
-What do you mean
your hand slipped?

281
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,409
-Oh no.

282
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,075
All our cooking.

283
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,675
How could he do such a thing?

284
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,109
[moaning]

285
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:24,075
-OK, what's our next move, guys?

286
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,342
-Don't worry about it.

287
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,242
I think I have a plan.

288
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,809
-What kind of plan?

289
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:29,309
-Hmph.

290
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,842
-Not too shabby.

291
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,942
Way to come through Sasuke.

292
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,275
Who wouldn't take their
mask off in a hot spring.

293
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,409
-All right, you loser.

294
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,175
Zip your lip already.

295
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,509
-Oh.

296
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:49,975
--[evil laughter] Tonight you
breathe your last breath,

297
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,509
Kakashi.

298
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,642
I've coated this
blow dart with elixir

299
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:59,709
I concocted that brings on wild
and uncontrollable laughter.

300
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,709
-Huh?

301
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:09,975
[laughing madly]

302
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,409
-You'll die laughing!

303
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,909
A fitting end for
one such as you.

304
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:19,042
-Oh man, I wanted
to get a look too.

305
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:22,342
But with these hot springs,
I'm out of the loop.

306
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,742
I want to see.

307
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:24,609
Oh.

308
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:25,675
[gurgling]

309
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,909
NARUTO: What's the
holdup Kakashi Sensei?

310
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:28,909
KAKASHI SENSEI: One sec.

311
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:30,009
I'm coming.

312
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:30,642
-Hmm?

313
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:31,875
I gotta see this.

314
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,875
-This is it.

315
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,242
-Here we go.

316
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,009
-Oh, I can't see a thing.

317
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,342
-[giggling]

318
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:55,942
-Phew.

319
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,409
It is hot in here.

320
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,775
I'm just coming in for a minute.

321
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,542
-Gah!

322
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,442
You've got to be kidding.

323
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:04,442
-Now.

324
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,342
-Hmm?

325
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,842
What's up with you two?

326
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,675
Well, I'm getting in.

327
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,042
-[laughing madly]

328
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,975
-Ah!

329
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,442
-Oh!

330
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,209
-He escaped again.

331
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:23,975
-What's going on?

332
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,409
This is killing me.

333
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,309
-Just great.

334
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,509
What the heck was Kakashi
Sensei thinking back there?

335
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,409
Huh?

336
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:45,309
-[laughter]

337
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:46,209
-Oh man.

338
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,775
I'm completely flushed.

339
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,742
Hmm?

340
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,109
-Where did our clothes go?

341
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,642
[cawing]

342
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:01,309
-[laughing]

343
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,575
-Come back any time now.

344
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,709
-Thank you very much.

345
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,309
Safe journey to you.

346
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:06,709
-Come back any time.

347
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,942
Come back any time. [laughing]

348
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:10,975
-Curse you, Kakashi Hatake.

349
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,075
I will be your doom.

350
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,775
-It's a good thing
we brought along

351
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,442
a spare set of
clothes, huh boss?

352
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:18,275
-Yeah.

353
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,775
I wonder who took them, anyway.

354
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,042
KAKASHI SENSEI: All right.

355
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,675
You've all got jobs to do.

356
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,142
You'd best get to work.

357
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,742
Dismissed.

358
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,475
-I've about had it, guys.

359
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,609
I don't think my nerves can
handle much more of this.

360
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,409
-I'm getting pretty
fed up myself.

361
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,642
-Yeah, me too.

362
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:39,675
That makes three of us.

363
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:40,942
-All right then.

364
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,275
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

365
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,242
-Desperate measures?

366
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,475
-Why are we dressed like this?

367
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,609
-Isn't it obvious?

368
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,942
We're posing as a
trio of rogue ninja.

369
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:52,675
-Where did you even
get these things?

370
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,842
-Uh, look, let's not get
bogged down in the details.

371
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,642
-Do you even have a plan?

372
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,142
-Ha!

373
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,742
Strip off the mask by
force if we have to.

374
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,609
-All right, Kakashi.

375
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:09,442
-Look!

376
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:12,209
-Huh?

377
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:14,242
-Hey, Kakashi Hatake!

378
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,409
-Huh?

379
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,942
What are the three of you up to?

380
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:18,609
-W-what are you talking about?

381
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,309
We're just three
wandering ninja.

382
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:23,042
It's not like we want to see
what's behind your mask or--

383
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:24,042
-You idiot.

384
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,942
Don't say any more
than you have to.

385
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,442
-That's my suit.

386
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,275
-Hey, boss, it looks
like you're not

387
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,775
the only one who wants to
get revenge on Kakashi.

388
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,242
Now's our chance.

389
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,275
-Let's do it!

390
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,675
-Right!

391
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,709
-Hold it right there.

392
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:44,175
[laughing] Kakashi, it's time
you pay for your transgress.

393
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,075
And the price is
death, delivered

394
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,609
in the form of
this elixir, which

395
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:51,875
will make you weep
uncontroll-- [screaming]

396
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:52,975
-That's funny.

397
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:55,075
I was just wondering
how long you fellows

398
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,575
were going to hide for.

399
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,542
You finally decide
to show yourselves.

400
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:01,209
-[whimpering]

401
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:02,542
-First things first, though.

402
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:06,575
Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto,
why on earth are you

403
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:07,875
dressed like that?

404
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,709
--[stuttering] Well,
the thing is--

405
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:11,842
-(THINKING) Oh boy.

406
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,675
We'd better come up
with something fast.

407
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,675
You fools!

408
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,642
You fell right into our trap.

409
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:20,609
We've known all along you
were targeting Kakashi Sensei.

410
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,342
-That's impossible.

411
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,242
Are you telling me
that our machinations

412
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,409
were exposed from
the very beginning?

413
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:27,542
-Of course.

414
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,075
This was all just a ruse
to lure you guys out.

415
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,475
And you fell for it,
hook, line, and sinker.

416
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,942
-So we were caught up in
your web of deception.

417
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,075
-Drat.

418
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,509
We underestimated them,
because they were kids.

419
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,975
-No one filled me
in on any of this.

420
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,642
-Nice work, Sakura.

421
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:45,775
-Well, I'm not sure I really
get what's going on around here.

422
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,342
But whatever.

423
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,709
-[whimpering]

424
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,142
-Please forgive us.

425
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,475
Forgive us.

426
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,742
-Words aren't going to help you.

427
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,942
-[whimpering and yelping]

428
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:05,209
-[neighing]

429
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:07,542
-This is just like three
years ago all over again.

430
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,909
We're swinging from a rope
like an oversized yo-yo.

431
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,275
You've got us all trussed
up in the same stupid rope--

432
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,042
-Hey, by the way,
who are you guys?

433
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,409
-And he doesn't even
remember who we are.

434
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,642
-Hey, Kakashi Sensei?

435
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:27,609
-Yeah?

436
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,642
-What are you hiding
under that mask?

437
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:31,642
-What?

438
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,475
You want to know
what's behind my mask?

439
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,642
-Yeah.

440
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,775
-You should have just said
so in the first place.

441
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,642
-So does that mean
you'll show us?

442
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:39,209
-Sure.

443
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:40,042
I don't mind.

444
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:40,909
-Huh?

445
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,275
-What's the big deal?

446
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:46,509
All right.

447
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,209
-(THINKING) Is it blimp lips?

448
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,209
-(THINKING) or buck teeth?

449
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,175
-(THINKING) or a tiny mouth?

450
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,775
-Behind this mask--

451
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,142
-(THINKING) behind that mask?

452
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,042
-Is another mask.

453
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,109
Pretty cool, huh?

454
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:11,609
-Huh!

455
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,709
-[laughing]

456
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,209
NARUTO: Are you
freaking kidding me?

457
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:21,775
What the hell kind
of ending is that?

458
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,375
[cawing]

459
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:32,808
[music playing]

460
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,210
NARUTO: I was born and
raised in the leaf village,

461
00:23:04,243 --> 00:23:06,143
in the land of fire.

462
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,943
First name Naruto,
last name Uzumaki.

463
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,710
People have been
known to call me--

464
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:12,577
SAKURA: The knucklehead ninja.

465
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,910
NARUTO: I am not the
knucklehead ninja.

466
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:16,810
KAKASHI SENSEI: Why are
you talking like that?

467
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:17,977
NARUTO: We're
heading off to meet

468
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,143
with Boss Wasabi, aren't we?

469
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:23,377
I've got to learn how
to talk to him properly.

470
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,877
Next time, "Mission, Help and
Old Friend in the Land of Tea."

471
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,410
[music playing]
