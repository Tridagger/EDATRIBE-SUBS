[theme music]

00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:52,104
[baby crying]

3
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:07,136
WOMAN: (SINGING) Natsuhiboshi,
why are you so red?

4
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:12,814
Because I had a sad
dream last night.

5
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:22,535
My eyes are red from the tears
I shed, swollen as I cry.

6
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,373
-There you are!

7
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,242
-Neji!

8
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:00,415
Naruto!

9
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,219
-What happened to them?

10
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,955
-Our shinobi friend
struck again.

11
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,657
-What?

12
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,726
He came back?

13
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,594
NARUTO: Yep.

14
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,733
And this time they took Sumaru.

15
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,603
-They got him?

16
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:11,672
-Yeah.

17
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,509
-Regardless, our first
order of business

18
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,915
is to make sure these
people here are all right.

19
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:17,618
Help us carry them back.

20
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:18,219
-Right.

21
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:18,754
Will do.

22
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:19,489
-Yes, of course.

23
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:34,286
-Mizura.

24
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,658
Naruto!

25
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,230
-They were jumped by
that ninja in the mask.

26
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,533
-No one's badly hurt.

27
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,636
They're merely unconscious.

28
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,257
-Where-- where's everybody else?

29
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,494
-Tenten and Lee have got 'em.

30
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,465
They're bringing them back now.

31
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:56,633
-I see.

32
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,772
So Sumaru's with them?

33
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,542
-Uh-- uh--

34
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,947
-He was taken away by
the masked shinobi.

35
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,317
-That's right.

36
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,488
He took him off into
the Valley of Death.

37
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,293
We couldn't go after him.

38
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,697
-The Valley of Death?

39
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:22,455
-Did he inhale much of
the gas in the valley?

40
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:23,691
-Don't worry.

41
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:26,497
I've put him in a state
of suspended animation.

42
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,268
The gas didn't effect him.

43
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,840
-I can understand wanting to
use him to bait your trap,

44
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:32,409
but all the same--

45
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,848
-These are children
from our own village.

46
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:38,055
-I always suspected
you'd lose your nerve.

47
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,859
Well, it's too late.

48
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:43,834
Your hands are far too
dirty to play the saint now.

49
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,471
So enough of that.

50
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:48,577
For now we'll let them think
the other masked shinobi took

51
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,380
Sumaru.

52
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,086
Once we have the
star back, well,

53
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,890
we'll leave it to them
to sort it all out.

54
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,416
-Hm?

55
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,323
-Oh, Mizura wasn't
feeling too well.

56
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:13,831
He's taking a break
from training.

57
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:14,431
-Byakugan.

58
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:21,647
What?

59
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,132
-Mizura!

60
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:31,401
-How are you feeling?

61
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,036
-Lie down.

62
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,405
You need to rest.

63
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,510
-No one can afford to
rest at a time like this.

64
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,420
-I know it can't
be easy, but you

65
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:43,493
must try not to push yourself.

66
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,395
-I'm fine.

67
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,900
I can walk by myself.

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,501
-Huh?

69
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:55,719
-Huh?

70
00:05:59,059 --> 00:05:59,894
-You see?

71
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,565
I told you you have to rest.

72
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:02,533
-I'm all right.

73
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,001
Let me be!

74
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:24,547
-Mother!

75
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,061
No!

76
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,631
Mother!

77
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:36,472
Father!

78
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:38,710
-No, Sumaru.

79
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,913
Don't cry.

80
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:43,152
Your parents died defending
the star and our village

81
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,791
to the very best
of their abilities.

82
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,729
Look up, Sumaru.

83
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,101
Look up at the sky.

84
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,171
There is a treasure
that can be seen only

85
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:55,045
from the Village
Hidden in the Stars.

86
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:57,483
If you would claim your
shinobi birthright,

87
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:01,725
then the village and the
star are yours to defend.

88
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:04,832
Be strong, just as
your parents were.

89
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,870
Make them proud of you, eh?

90
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,022
-Lord Hoshikage.

91
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,523
-Hmph.

92
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:33,225
There.

93
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,662
Yeah, that ought to do the job.

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,808
-Naruto.

95
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,144
-Yeah, what's up?

96
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:44,014
-At this rate,
Mizura won't make it.

97
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:51,764
I sensed a disturbance in his
chakra, so I looked into it.

98
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,604
Even as he rests,
his chakra is working

99
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,510
at an alarming,
unsustainable rate.

100
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,247
It's too much for
his body to take.

101
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,850
His systems will soon fail.

102
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,204
-Are you serious?

103
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,943
His own chakra's
going to kill him?

104
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,245
-Without a doubt.

105
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,214
-But how?

106
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:18,053
-It's because of
the star training.

107
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,557
-Huh?

108
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,231
-The star has a unique power of
triggering a surge in chakra.

109
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:27,273
The problem is most ninja
are incapable of controlling

110
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,542
this surge.

111
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,781
Their bodies give out,
and they collapse.

112
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,551
Or worse.

113
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:37,761
This is what happened to Mizura
in the middle of his training.

114
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,267
The Third Hoshikage
stopped the star training,

115
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,141
because it was proving far
too dangerous for our people.

116
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,645
NEJI: But you're doing it again.

117
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:49,086
-That's because of Lord
Akahoshi, our current leader.

118
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,660
He decided to resume the
star training six months ago.

119
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,130
-But that's crazy!

120
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,599
Somebody's gotta make him stop!

121
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,136
-We were born and raised here.

122
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,107
We don't fear the star training.

123
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,044
We undergo it proudly.

124
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,581
-But why?

125
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,020
-We've been raised to
believe there is no greater

126
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:09,194
honor than to serve the village
as a Hidden Star shinobi.

127
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,867
For that, we'd
sacrifice anything.

128
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,203
Even our own lives.

129
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,287
-Unbelievable.

130
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:41,096
-Go on.

131
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,409
Let's see if that gets
your attention, Natsuhi.

132
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,788
-Hotarubi, protect the star.

133
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,658
Protect Sumaru.

134
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:32,972
Akahoshi's chakra.

135
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,969
-Go ahead and take it.

136
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,907
It'll help you
get around easier.

137
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,714
I mean, just until
you get better.

138
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,718
MIZURA (VOICEOVER):
Thank you, Naruto.

139
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:18,502
But I never will.

140
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:33,099
-They say his condition's
stabilized, at least.

141
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,905
-Then for the moment, I
guess, everyone is all right.

142
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,775
-Something's not right.

143
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:39,245
Not by a longshot.

144
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,451
Hokuto and Mizura,
the way they're always

145
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,187
thinking about the village.

146
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,025
And Sumaru, too.

147
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:45,859
Same thing.

148
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,129
The village, the village.

149
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,511
-What are you saying?

150
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:56,348
-I mean, I know
how they feel when

151
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,221
it comes to defending your
village and your friends.

152
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,091
I'd do the same thing.

153
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,463
I'd be willing to
risk everything.

154
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:05,334
Even my life.

155
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,504
-Of course.

156
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:08,541
We all would.

157
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,812
-Right.

158
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:13,451
-Well, this isn't the time
to try and figure it out.

159
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,388
Right now, we've
gotta catch that thief

160
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,925
and get the star back.

161
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,464
-Yeah, but, if they
didn't get it back,

162
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:22,470
at least they wouldn't have to
suffer through that training.

163
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,074
-Tenten has a point.

164
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:25,811
-Yeah.

165
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,414
Without the star,
they can't train,

166
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,485
which means they put
the village at risk.

167
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:32,525
If they do train, they
put their lives at r-- Ah!

168
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,226
I give up!

169
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:33,961
It's to confusing.

170
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,198
I don't know what to do!

171
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:37,903
-We fulfill our mission,
which is to protect the star.

172
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,274
And that means that we
have to get it back.

173
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,379
What these people choose
to do with it after that

174
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,982
is none of our affair.

175
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:44,417
-Yes.

176
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,419
You are right.

177
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:46,521
-OK.

178
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:47,156
-All right.

179
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:48,492
Let's do it.

180
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,131
-Lee and Tenten, I want you to
investigate the village leader

181
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,300
one more time.

182
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:52,901
-What?

183
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:53,971
Again?

184
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:55,607
-I want to know why that
flying shinobi would

185
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,246
risk his life going into
the valley of death.

186
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,953
And if he already at the
star, why kidnap Sumaru?

187
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,290
-Good question.

188
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,860
Why would he?

189
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,531
-The shinobi who
grabbed the star

190
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:10,037
had a very different chakra
from the one who took Sumaru.

191
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:10,505
-What?

192
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,276
-So you mean--

193
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:13,144
-Yes.

194
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:15,449
They're two different shinobi.

195
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:18,021
-But what does that mean?

196
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:21,428
-That this mission is more
complicated than we thought.

197
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,529
-As I expected.

198
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,569
Very impressive ninja
art Kujaku, Lady Natsuhi.

199
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:54,632
-Where is he?

200
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,903
What have you done with Sumaru?

201
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,172
-First thing's first.

202
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,244
I'll take the star,
if you don't mind.

203
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,181
-Not until I get Sumaru.

204
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:03,918
-First the star.

205
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:04,920
-No.

206
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,089
-Very well.

207
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:08,261
Then I'll just have
to take it from you.

208
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,497
[snickering]

209
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,501
-What's so amusing?

210
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:15,342
-That you actually believe
you're a match for me.

211
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,014
-I don't think you realize that
after you left the village,

212
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:19,351
there were a select
few of us who

213
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,288
secretly continued our training.

214
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,557
-Ha.

215
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:25,597
You think you finished the
star training all on your own?

216
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,270
-You're about to learn that I'm
more than a match for you now,

217
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,505
Lady Natsuhi.

218
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,374
Ninja Art Kujaku!

219
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:38,624
Beast!

220
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:39,594
-The fool.

221
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,965
He leaves me no choice.

222
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,702
Ninja Art Kujaku!

223
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:44,304
Beast!

224
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:02,977
-Her power is great.

225
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,979
Yasaka!

226
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,383
Shizo!

227
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:07,353
Go on.

228
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,290
-My lord.

229
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,626
-What are you up to, Akahoshi?

230
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:17,674
-You'll just have to stay
to find that, m'lady.

231
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,144
-Neji.

232
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:20,213
What is it?

233
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,685
-I just detected a
massive flow of chakra.

234
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:24,121
-The shinobi?

235
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,693
-It has to be.

236
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,564
Who's there?

237
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,100
-Friends from the Leaf.

238
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:33,273
The shinobi who stole the
star has just now reappeared.

239
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,579
-Lord Akahoshi is
trying to delay him.

240
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,349
-Please, you must come and help.

241
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:38,184
-You got it.

242
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,086
We're on our way!

243
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:47,403
-The shinobi is powerful, and
Lord Akahoshi is all alone.

244
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,241
-He won't be able
to hold him long.

245
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,713
NARUTO: Just show us the way,
and leave the rest to us.

246
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,360
-There is no one here.

247
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,596
-Huh.

248
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,534
TENTEN: Their presence
is very faint.

249
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,206
They must have gone
out a while ago.

250
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,745
-It seems an ideal
opportunity to poke around.

251
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:07,713
-Right.

252
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,185
-Ninja Art, Phantom Jutsu.

253
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:10,786
-Huh?

254
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:11,655
Lee?

255
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:14,495
Since when do you know ninjutsu?

256
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:16,064
-All clear!

257
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:16,732
Come on in, Tenten!

258
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,734
There is no one here!

259
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,173
-What the-- That's not ninjutsu!

260
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,294
It's very--

261
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,330
-Suspicious.

262
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:32,733
[door sliding]

263
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:43,556
-Hm.

264
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:44,524
LEE (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

265
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:45,693
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): Oh, boy.

266
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:55,715
-Funny.

267
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,118
Thought I heard something.

268
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:08,876
-It's been set up
like a hospital room.

269
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:11,581
I can see there's
somebody in the bed.

270
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,283
-But who is it?

271
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:16,325
TENTEN: Wait, is that--

272
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:19,465
-It is Sumaru!

273
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,348
-Why did you force
Sumaru and the others

274
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,687
to resume the star training?

275
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:33,462
The Third Hoshikage must've
warned you how dangerous it is.

276
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:34,697
Why would you do it?

277
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:40,577
-You yourself are
the answer to that!

278
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,479
-What?

279
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,547
-Look your chakra.

280
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:43,850
It's incredible!

281
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:47,592
Imagine an army of
100, or even 10 ninja

282
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,562
with powers like yours.

283
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,700
The five great hidden
villages combined

284
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,604
would be no match for us!

285
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,842
It's not too late, Natsuhi.

286
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,782
Together you and I can make the
Hidden Star village invincible.

287
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,527
-Ah!

288
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,663
It hurts.

289
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,199
It hurts!

290
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,371
-Why does my body feel
like it's on fire?

291
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,740
-Make it stop.

292
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,713
Make it stop!

293
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:14,381
-Help me!

294
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:14,979
-Enough.

295
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:15,617
-Please!

296
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,555
-Enough!

297
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:21,831
All those young
lives thrown away.

298
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:24,837
-Their horror must
never be repeated.

299
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,676
If you think I'll let
you start that again!

300
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,863
-Wait, Natsuhi!

301
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,400
Remember, I still have Sumaru!

302
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,772
[gasp]

303
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,910
You're helpless, aren't you?

304
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,515
As long as I have your
precious little Sumaru,

305
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:47,451
you can't do a thing!

306
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,781
-The shinobi's closing
in on Akahoshi.

307
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,683
-Yeah?

308
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,353
Well I'm about to
close in on him!

309
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:05,389
-Hold on.

310
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:07,394
He's too strong for
a frontal attack.

311
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:08,629
-Don't sweat it!

312
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:09,298
I've got a plan!

313
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,366
-You do?

314
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,669
-I'll neutralize his chakra.

315
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:14,509
You guys take care
of the rest, OK?

316
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,780
-Well, we need to move quickly.

317
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,684
No time to argue.

318
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:20,789
Very well, but be
careful, Naruto.

319
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,759
-Don't worry, I will!

320
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:23,561
OK!

321
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,565
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

322
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,569
All right shinobi!

323
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,543
Let's take him down!

324
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,712
-So, him again.

325
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,540
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
I thought as much.

326
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:50,885
That chakra is too
powerful to get through.

327
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:51,887
-Huh?

328
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,591
Where's the real one?

329
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,004
NEJI (VOICEOVER): I see.

330
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,610
It wasn't a crude frontal
assault after all.

331
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,982
Those clones were
merely a distraction.

332
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:08,589
Not bad, Naruto.

333
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,093
-He did it.

334
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,645
Incredible.

335
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,184
-Huh?

336
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:23,120
A woman?

337
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,498
AKAHOSHI (VOICEOVER): Heh.

338
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:30,435
The Leaf brat actually did it.

339
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:33,041
Plenty of time to
find the star later.

340
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,850
Now it's my chance to finish
Natsuhi once and for all!

341
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,354
I can see she'll be of
no help in fulfilling

342
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,793
my ambitions for our village.

343
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,765
-Ninja Art, Kujaku!

344
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,739
Beast!

345
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:48,373
-Naruto!

346
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,714
Look out!

347
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:55,088
-What the-- Ah!

348
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,058
-Naruto!

349
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:58,662
[scream]

350
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:06,011
-Huh?

351
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:07,648
-What is it, Mizura?

352
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:08,983
Something wrong?

353
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,024
-Uh-- no, it's nothing.

354
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:13,126
MIZURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

355
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:16,700
-Mother.

356
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,680
[scream]

357
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:34,332
[theme music]

358
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:01,823
-Ah!

359
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,960
I have just had an
extraordinary revelation!

360
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,096
-Care to share it with us?

361
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:06,866
LEE: I have had my
doubts about this Lord

362
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,071
Akahoshi and his
suspicious behavior.

363
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,075
And now I have finally
just realized--

364
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,545
TENTEN: What?

365
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:14,783
LEE: I believe that one of the
masked shinobi is Akahoshi!

366
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:17,021
TENTEN: Neji already
said that, remember?

00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,558
LEE: Then you agree
with me, Neji.

368
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:19,828

00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:20,629

370
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:21,965
NEJI: Can we move on, now?

371
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,769
TENTEN: Next time,
Hoshikage, The Buried Truth.
