00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,300
[theme song]

2
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,207
-We've got to hurry.

3
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:58,707
-I know.

4
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,507
-We're close.

5
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,441
-There's only two of them left.

6
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,141
Against the three of us.

7
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,641
I like those odds.

8
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,941
If we play it right, the
next time we meet them we'll

9
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:26,007
be able to wrap things
up once and for all.

10
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,641
-I'll say.

11
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:27,341
Two against three?

12
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:29,041
No sweat.

13
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:32,407
-What do you mean,
it's two against three?

14
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,141
-Oh.

15
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:34,674
Sorry about that, Akamaru.

16
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:35,374
You're right.

17
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,341
It's two against four.

18
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,474
I like those odds even better.

19
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:40,141
-Wait'll they see
our new technique.

20
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,674
These clowns won't
know what hit them.

21
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:42,274
Right, boy?

22
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,874
-Don't worry about a thing.

23
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:48,574
As soon as we catch
up to them all

24
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:52,074
I gotta do is my shadow clone
jutsu and the show's over.

25
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,174
-Well that's comforting to know.

26
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,241
All the same, we're working
as a team here, right?

27
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:00,407
Just stick to the plan.

28
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,974
-Oh-- well, sure.

29
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,641
-The most important thing is
to at least get them in range

30
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:07,841
before the sun goes down.

31
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,874
-Well, what are we waiting for?

32
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:10,841
Let's hit it!

33
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:27,674
-The sun's going down and still
no sign of Jirobo and Kidomaru.

34
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,441
Must have run into more
trouble than they expected.

35
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:31,874
-Who cares about them?

36
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,274
It's Orochimaru
I'm worried about.

37
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,341
It's taken us most of a whole
day, and still only one third

38
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,207
of the transition process
has been completed.

39
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:53,174
MAN (VOICEOVER): They
all have curse marks.

40
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,641
-You might want to
think this over.

41
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:58,507
It won't be like last time, when
you jumped us all by surprise.

42
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,041
-There's been too many delays.

43
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:05,607
-You're right.

44
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:07,341
It's not good.

45
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,741
At this rate we just
might be too late.

46
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:24,341
-Hurry.

47
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,241
They're just ahead.

48
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:25,907
-No.

49
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,274
We're close enough.

50
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,207
We'll stay right on
their tail, but we're

51
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,707
gonna maintain this distance.

52
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,007
-What the heck are
you talking about?

53
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,707
-We'll keep them in
our sights, but we

54
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,774
won't attack until sunrise.

55
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:37,707
-That's crazy!

56
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,807
We can't afford
to wait 'til then.

57
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:40,674
What about Sasuke?

58
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,041
-Yeah, he's right.

59
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,274
And besides, if we're gonna hit
them with a surprise attack,

60
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,574
it'll be an even bigger surprise
if we hit them in the dark.

61
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,141
-The darkness might
give us an edge

62
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,941
at the first moment of contact,
but after that it would only

63
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:54,907
put us at a disadvantage, right?

64
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,807
Don't forget what
we're really after.

65
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,441
We want to keep
them occupied just

66
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:01,007
long enough to get
Sasuke out of there.

67
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,007
That'll take precision
and split-second timing.

68
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,374
We need to be able
to see clearly.

69
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:13,441
We can't risk going in blind,
wandering around in the dark.

70
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:15,941
Once they knew what we were
up to all they'd have to do

71
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:18,207
is fall back and
guard Sasuke's coffin.

72
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,807
They could take up
a defensive position

73
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,574
and wait for us to come to them.

74
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,607
The advantage would
be all on their side.

75
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,241
Course, things would
be a lot different

76
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,674
if we had Neji and his byakugan.

77
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,474
-Aren't you forgetting
about me and Akamaru

78
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:36,474
and our sense of smell?

79
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:38,807
-I didn't forget about those
sensitive noses of yours.

80
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:41,574
But even so, in this
part of the woods,

81
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,074
they've got the
geography in their favor.

82
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:50,107
What's more-- what's the
sense of attacking now

83
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,974
when my jutsu's no help?

84
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,307
The moonlight's too dim,
and there's too many clouds

85
00:05:57,341 --> 00:06:02,241
passing over it for my shadow
possession to be effective.

86
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,507
It's a drag, but to
be completely safe,

87
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,174
we've gotta wait 'til daylight.

88
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,507
-I don't know.

89
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,374
-I agree.

90
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,207
-What?

91
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:12,374
-Shikamaru's our leader.

92
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:15,341
And if he says we wait,
then we're gonna wait.

93
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,441
-I just hope I'm right.

94
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:21,741
NARUTO: The Vessel
Arrives Too Late.

95
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,141
-Hey, Tayuya, do you think we're
still going to make it in time?

96
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:35,974
-We were told to deliver
Sasuke by tomorrow or else,

97
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:38,341
and I don't want to find
out what "or else" means.

98
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,541
-By tomorrow, huh?

99
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,774
Well, it's not like we have
a lot of time to spare.

100
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,307
But we should be
able to make it.

101
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,307
-We better.

102
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,741
[screaming]

103
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,041
-Lord.

104
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:40,507
Orochimaru.

105
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,341
-They're not here yet?

106
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,374
Still no sign of Sasuke?

107
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,607
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Time's running out.

108
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,707
He can't go on like this.

109
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,207
-Please, my lord.

110
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:03,441
There are many other
bodies ready for you.

111
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:08,107
My lord, you may even
use mine, if you want.

112
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,241
-No.

113
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,774
It must be Sasuke.

114
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,774
Why do you think I've
waited this long?

115
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,741
-But you've run out of time!

116
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:21,074
That old man the Third
Hokage, his jutsu

117
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:22,341
was stronger than we thought!

118
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:38,741
-Behold sealing jutsu,
reaper death seal!

119
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,541
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
What is this I feel?

120
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,474
-The seal is set!

121
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,807
-My-- my arms!

122
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,807
-You can't afford
to wait any longer.

123
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:31,241
If you don't take
another body right now

124
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,374
you'll lose everything.

125
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:33,474
Everything!

126
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,907
-Lose everything?

127
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,907
[screaming]

128
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,674
-I've chosen several
suitable vessels.

129
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,607
I'll go get them ready.

130
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:48,807
And then I'll see to Sasuke.

131
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,141
Leave everything to me.

132
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,841
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Shall I use Kimimaro?

133
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,441
-Curse you, old man.

134
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,241
Curse you!

135
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:32,641
-Release.

136
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:49,607
All right.

137
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:50,674
Listen up, all of you.

138
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:57,841
How would you like
to be released

139
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:58,774
from your imprisonment?

140
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,841
Sadly, it's just one of you.

141
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,974
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Now to wake Kimimaro.

142
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,415
-Kabuto-Sensei.

143
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:02,248
It's as I thought, isn't it?

144
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:03,782
I wasn't chosen.

145
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,715
Once again.

146
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:07,948
-Save your strength.

147
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:11,415
You've served your
function well, Kimimaro.

148
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:13,615
It's not the Sound
Ninja Five anymore.

149
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:24,782
-But still, I-- I haven't--

150
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:25,848
-Don't worry.

151
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:28,015
Your replacement has
already been found.

152
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:35,782
He has a mark equal in power
to your Earth Curse Mark.

153
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:39,115
He's been given the
Heaven Curse Mark.

154
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:41,648
On top of that he has
the kekkei genkai.

155
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,382
I wonder which one
of you're stronger.

156
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:00,648
Now, now.

157
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:01,982
Calm down.

158
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,515
No sense in getting agitated.

159
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:23,582
-Ka-- Kabuto-Sensei--
tell me truthfully.

160
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,715
How much time do you
think I have left?

161
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:30,982
-Relax.

162
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:33,415
Don't try and talk.

163
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,482
-I've been wondering.

164
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,182
There must be a
purpose for people

165
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:41,115
being born into this world.

166
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:42,848
Why are we here?

167
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,815
What does it mean?

168
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:47,782
I've been thinking about
that a lot, lately.

169
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:08,515
I realize that finding our
purpose is the meaning.

170
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,682
That's why we're here.

171
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:13,215
And the ones who
find it-- they're

172
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,082
the only ones who
are truly free.

173
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,282
-Yes.

174
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,315
I understand what you're saying.

175
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:23,748
And meanwhile, as we
speak, Lord Orochimaru

176
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:26,148
is suffering horribly.

177
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,182
In fact, if something's
not done soon,

178
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,182
it could be the end of him.

179
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:33,415
You must ask yourself
truthfully, what should you do,

180
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:34,915
Kimimaro?

181
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,748
What's your purpose,
now that you're

182
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:41,015
no longer of any
use as a vessel?

183
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,882
At this moment a new
vessel is on its way.

184
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,182
But unfortunately it
won't arrive in time.

185
00:14:58,948 --> 00:14:59,982
-What are you waiting for?

186
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,615
Open this door.

187
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,582
You said you would
set one of us free.

188
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:06,515
Or was that just your
way of toying with us?

189
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:26,815
And who are you?

190
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,515
I expected the other one.

191
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:30,282
Well, whoever--

192
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,315
What's going on?

193
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,582
I'm about to be eaten alive.

194
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:11,482
[laughter]

195
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:14,515
-Yes, you will be set free.

196
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:17,482
And before that, I will
grant you one wish.

197
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:32,748
-You used my clan
for your experiments.

198
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,548
Let them go.

199
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,482
That's my wish.

200
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,415
-Yes, of course.

201
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,748
You may consider it done.

202
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:44,782
Don't worry.

203
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:47,148
Your strength of spirit
was one of the main reasons

204
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,248
I chose you.

205
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:51,082
And I'd be foolish to
let it go to waste.

206
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,782
Your residual aura
will live on in me.

207
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:58,648
Well, then.

208
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:03,015
I thank you for your body.

209
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,948
[scream]

210
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,015
-So it's done.

211
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:14,548
And now it will be a few years
before he can transfer again.

212
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:15,782
But next time--

213
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,315
-It's as you say.

214
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,615
My damaged body is
of no use to him

215
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:27,782
as a vessel for the
transference jutsu.

216
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,382
That was my purpose.

217
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,915
And it's gone.

218
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:35,282
What is there left to
give my existence meaning?

219
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,015
I see now what I must do.

220
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,782
I was not meant
to be the vessel.

221
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:48,682
I was meant to find the vessel
and bring it safely here,

222
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,248
even at the cost of my life.

223
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:55,815
That is the only way I can repay
Lord Orochimaru for my failure.

224
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:59,848
The only way to give my
worthless existence some value.

225
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:15,815
-Hold on a second.

226
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,048
-Are we almost there?

227
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:17,848
-No.

228
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,615
We still have a ways to go.

229
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:20,415
But take a look.

230
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,582
And, of course, now
that we need them,

231
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:33,715
there's no sign of
Jirobo or Kidomaru.

232
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,515
-Sorry.

233
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:35,248
Just us.

234
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,482
-Who needs those two?

235
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,115
I can handle these guys myself.

236
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:43,615
-Get ready!

237
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,348
-Fist barrage!

238
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:08,415
SAKON (VOICEOVER): Chakra
in the palm of his hand?

239
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,515
-Shadow clone jutsu, huh?

240
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,515
[shouts]

241
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,448
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
He caught my arm.

242
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:18,448
Just when I--

243
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:20,315
-How are you supposed
to hit anyone

244
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,448
with it if you can't throw it?

245
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,415
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Hurry up, Kiba.

246
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:27,915
-Tunneling fang!

247
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:29,915
SAKON (VOICEOVER):
Damn, a shadow clone!

248
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,382
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): They
maneuvered Sakon right

249
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:37,882
in front of me,
blocking my view.

250
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,682
They were aiming for
me the whole time.

251
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:40,682
-So what?

252
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,148
You think that's
gonna do you any good?

253
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:48,548
-What hit me?

254
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:51,082
-It's called a shadow
possession jutsu.

255
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:53,648
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER):
He's got me pinned down.

256
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:54,148
Meanwhile--

257
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,748
-Tayuya, don't just stand there.

258
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,215
Get that guy!

259
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,315
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): No!

260
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:03,682
-What are you doing?

261
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:05,515
Get out of the way!

262
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:06,615
Can't stop in time!

263
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:13,548
-Here, catch.

264
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:14,515
-Good work, Kima.

265
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,882
OK.

266
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:16,648
Got it!

267
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,448
-You heard him, Shikamaru.

268
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,848
Time to pull out.

269
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:19,382
-Don't worry.

270
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,415
I'm coming.

271
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:22,582
-Little punks.

272
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:24,782
-They really think they'll
get away with this.

273
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,382
-Just as I thought.

274
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,515
They left themselves wide open.

275
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,948
Sometimes being so sure
of your own strength

276
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,348
can be a weak spot.

277
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:37,015
-Well, whatever.

278
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:38,382
It worked.

279
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:40,515
-It's about teamwork, Naruto.

280
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:42,948
The whole is greater than
the sum of its parts.

281
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,382
If we just work together,
nothing can stop us.

282
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,182
-You think it's that easy?

283
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:32,836
[music playing]

284
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,170
-What a drag.

285
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,037
Just when I thought we
were out of the woods,

286
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,670
another one of them shows up.

287
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,170
And there's something
different about this guy.

288
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,170
Something seriously creepy.

289
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,937
He definitely wasn't
part of my game plan.

290
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,870
Remember what I said about how
teamwork can beat anything?

291
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:18,804
Well, I may have miscalculated.

292
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:21,170
I wasn't expecting this.

293
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:22,170
Sorry, Naruto.

294
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,637
I let you down.

295
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,104
NARUTO: Next time,
miscalculation-- a new enemy

296
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,304
appears!

297
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:32,837
