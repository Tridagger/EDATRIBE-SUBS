2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,691
-(VOICEOVER) I am not going to
be the only one to lose here.

3
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:50,329
Guy-sensei, please
let this work.

4
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:51,930
It is now or never!

5
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:06,812
To protect and maintain
one's own ninja way.

6
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,381
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The Fifth Gate.

7
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,350
A splendid ninja is born.

8
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:15,389
-His whole body's changing.

9
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:17,358
-[gasps]

10
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,293
-He's turning red!

11
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:19,893
-Ahh!

12
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,301
-What's it mean?

13
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,069
What's happening?

14
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,872
-Ahh!

15
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,075
-He's opened the Third Gate.

16
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,076
The Gate of Life.

17
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:35,477
Now he'll attack.

18
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,478
-Oh, no.

19
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,046
Not yet.

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,964
-Hm?

21
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,052
-The Fourth Gate.

22
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,055
Gate of Pain.

23
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:48,057
Open!

24
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:48,875
Ahh!

25
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,798
-Incredible.

26
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,833
No one can do that through
sheer effort alone.

27
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,036
The boy's truly a genius!

28
00:02:59,069 --> 00:02:59,894
-Ahh!

29
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:05,042
[multiple explosions]

30
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,020
-Unh!

00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:13,418
[cries of strain]

32
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,420
-He's faster than ever!

33
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,022
-Unh.

34
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:17,488
Huh?

35
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:18,189
-Whoa.

36
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:18,824
-Gotta.

37
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,092
-Where'd they go?

38
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:21,593
-Huh?

39
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,063
Up there!

40
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,031
-Unh.

41
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:26,032
Uh.

42
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,133
Hunh.

43
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,368
-There's Gaara, but
what happened to Lee?

44
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,369
-He's just done.

45
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,246
-(VOICEOVER) The sand can't
move fast enough to protect him.

46
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:50,424
-Hiding behind that
sand armor again, eh?

47
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,928
Well, we will see about that.

48
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:54,896
-Unh.

49
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,230
-Ah.

50
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:56,831
Uh!

51
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:06,241
-(VOICEOVER) My armor can't
withstand this pounding.

52
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,513
It's crumbling away.

53
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:16,719
LEE: You are a tough one.

54
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:17,888
Try this!

55
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,395
-(VOICEOVER) His muscles are
tearing themselves apart.

56
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,166
-(VOICEOVER) Is that really Lee?

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,167
But when?

58
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:30,925
How?

59
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,208
-One more, and we are finished!

60
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:42,147
The Big Gate, Gate
of Closing, open!

61
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,483
-(VOICEOVER) No human
can move like this.

62
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,253
Impossible to defend myself.

63
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,655
-Are you watching, Neji?

64
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:53,092
I was saving this ace in the
hole to use you against you!

65
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,428
See what you have
to look forward to?

66
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,173
-Uh-ugh!

67
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,174
Unh.

68
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:07,975
Uh.

69
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,145
[sash creaks and strains]

70
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:19,854
-(VOICEOVER) His sand
shield can't keep up.

71
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,423
-(VOICEOVER) He's in trouble!

72
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:23,825
-Whoa!

73
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,193
-(VOICEOVER) The Hidden Lotus.

74
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,796
A taijutsu combination
of such blinding

75
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,367
speed that no one can
defend himself against it.

76
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,602
Not even Neji.

77
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:36,172
Gaara's sand shield is useless.

78
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,340
-(VOICEOVER) Now, to finish it.

79
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:42,279
[screams]

80
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,646

-Hidden Lotus!

[cries of distress]

83
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,892
-Mm mm!

84
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:55,959
-So fast.

85
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,262
I couldn't see a thing!

86
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,263
-Ya ah!

87
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:09,474
[metallic click]

88
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,809
-(VOICEOVER) What's happening?

89
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,544
-(VOICEOVER) The gourd
is turning into sand.

90
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:16,949
-Ah unh.

91
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:19,485
Unh uh eh ah.

92
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,085
Uh.

93
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,487
Unh.

94
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:22,455
-Unbelievable.

95
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:23,289
He did it!

96
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,925
-Gaara!

97
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,326
-Is it over?

98
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:31,898
-Ah?

99
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:32,933
-What's that?

100
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,735
Down there.

101
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:39,240
-[gasping]

102
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,944

[scoffs]

105
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,518
(VOICEOVER) Unbelievable!

106
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:55,057
He cushioned his fall by
turning that gourd into sand.

107
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,660
[strained breathing]

108
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,601
[blowing sand]

109
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,602
-Unh.

110
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,604
Unh.

111
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,572
Ah.

112
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:10,173
Ah.

113
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:10,952
Unh.

114
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,947
-I know what's coming now.

115
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,115
-Sands takra.

116
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:27,458
-Uh.

117
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,861
Ah.

118
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:30,461
A-ah.

119
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,066
(VOICEOVER) Impossible.

120
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,569
He not only survived
the Hidden Lotus.

121
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:41,573
He is able to go on the attack.

122
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:42,641
Uh.

123
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:49,549
[straining against sand]
Ahh ahh.

124
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,918
-Sand coffin.

125
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,519
-Ahh!

126
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:04,498
(VOICEOVER) I'm not going
to be the who loses.

127
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:08,870
I have my own ninja way.

128
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,072
Uh ah.

129
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,448
-Unh.

130
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,449
-No.

131
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:23,853
-Now you die.

132
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:24,453
Uh?

133
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,802
Unh.

134
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,405
[breathing shakily]

135
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,723
[glass shattering]

136
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,325
Unh uh.

137
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:04,930
But why?

138
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,699
He failed.

139
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,501
Unh.

140
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:09,635
Why save him?

141
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:15,374
-Because he's--

142
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,945
LEE (VOICEOVER):
[laughs] I'm all right.

143
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:21,014
Getting stronger all the time.

144
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,282
The tuning exam.

145
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:25,552
I am going to make
you proud, Guy-sensei.

146
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,956
I want to show I can be as
fine a ninja as well, even if I

147
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,026
do not have ninjutsu
or genjutsu.

148
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,030
I want to prove it
to the whole world!

149
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:42,237
-Because he's, he's my student.

150
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,374
And also because
he's precious to me.

151
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,252
-Hm?

152
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,921
-He's precious to him?

153
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,790
A student?

154
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:03,693
-(VOICEOVER) That's a sentiment
that Gaara couldn't even begin

155
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:04,361
to understand.

156
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,803
-Huh?

157
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,606
-I quit.

158
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,174
-He what?

159
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,275
He quits?

160
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:19,277
-But it's too late for Lee.

161
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,746
He lost the match the
minute Guy intervened.

162
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:28,387
-The winner is-- uh?

163
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,989
-Huh?

164
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:30,622
-Huh!

165
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:31,556
-[gasps]

166
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,558
-Huh?

167
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:33,456
-Unh.

168
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:37,497
-Huh?

169
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,705
[gasp] It can't be!

170
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:05,928
-(VOICEOVER) After all that,
he shouldn't be able to move,

171
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,529
let alone stand up.

172
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:11,900
-No, Lee.

173
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,135
It's all right.

174
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:14,703
It's all over now.

175
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:22,411
Anyway, you're in no
condition to-- Lee.

176
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,849
(VOICE BREAKING) Oh, Lee.

177
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:27,351
[sobs] What have I done?

178
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,695
Look at you.

179
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:41,366
Not even conscious, and
still determined to show

180
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,867
the world what you can do.

181
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,474
-He's out called.

182
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,843
Nothing keeping him up
but sheer will power.

183
00:11:54,946 --> 00:12:00,987
-Lee, you've already proven it.

184
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:07,794
[cries] You are
a splendid ninja.

185
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,702
-The winner is Gaara.

186
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,651
-[scoffs]

187
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,552
-Lee!

188
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,821
-Sakura!

189
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,590
There is nothing you can
do for him right now.

190
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:45,535
There are times when sympathetic
words only make things worse.

191
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:46,213
-Uh.

192
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:58,549
-Hmph.

193
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,384
I knew he couldn't be Gaara.

194
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:09,927
-(VOICEOVER) Still, it was a lot
tougher match than we thought.

195
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,263
-Unh.

196
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:11,863
Uh!

197
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,431
-Naruto.

198
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,679
-(VOICEOVER) I can't
believe it, Lee lost to him?

199
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:30,349
-Hurry!

200
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,350
This boy needs attention.

201
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:38,024
-Uh, uh. [gasp] Bushy-brow!

202
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:45,966
-(VOICEOVER) Lee!

203
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:10,927
- [gasps] You are his
teacher, aren't you?

204
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,461
-I am.

205
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:13,162
What is it?

206
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:14,831
-Will you come with me?

207
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,272
MEDIC 1: Careful with him.

208
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:22,906
That's right.

209
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,507
Easy.

210
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,192
MEDIC 2: The boy's breathing
is faint, but steady.

211
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:41,960
There are bone
fractures and muscle

212
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,096
tears throughout his body.

213
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,166
He's facing a long and
difficult rehabilitation.

214
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,606
But I'm afraid that's
not the worst of it.

215
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,782
His left arm and
leg in particular

216
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,717
have suffered massive damage.

217
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,427
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,196
I know how much it
means to you both,

219
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,365
but he'll never fight again.

220
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,201
His days as a Shinobi are over.

221
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,182
-No.

222
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,783
He's wrong.

223
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:35,384
He's wrong.

224
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,386
It can't be true.

225
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,688
I get him first.

226
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,389
This weirdo is mine.

227
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,791
-No, thank you.

228
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,994
Right now, the only one I
want to fight is Uchiha.

229
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,263
-Ah!

230
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,797
What are you doing?

231
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,968
-Naruto, I get where you
are coming from, believe me.

232
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:54,004
But the rules all fighting
must be done officially

233
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:57,342
in a match, the loser
beating the gifted genius

234
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,709
through sheer will power.

235
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:02,113
Now, would not that make
for an exciting match?

236
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:06,217
Even if I'm the one who
is going to have to Neji.

237
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:09,154
-[crying]

238
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:11,523
GUY (VOICEOVER): Lee.

239
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,860
Oh, forgive me.

240
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:17,429
I couldn't bear the
thought of you losing.

241
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:20,533
I wanted you to
achieve your goal,

242
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,371
to prove that your ninja
way was the right way.

243
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:25,072
-Yes!

244
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,239
I did it!

245
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,908
I finally mastered the jutsu.

246
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:29,609
Yes, yes, yes!

247
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:30,911
GUY (VOICEOVER): This jutsu.

248
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:34,548
In the end, only Lee
could make it his own.

249
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,885
As of today, they
were all genin.

250
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,353
So now, tell me.

251
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,588
Why have you done it?

252
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,090
What are your goals?

253
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,024
Hm?

254
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,926
-How about me, Sensei?

255
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,563
I want to show I can be as
fine a ninja as well, even if I

256
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,666
do not have ninjutsu
or genjutsu.

257
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,603
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

258
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:58,073
GUY (VOICEOVER): Ah,
it was all my fault.

259
00:16:58,107 --> 00:17:00,510
I should've stopped it.

260
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,278
Forgive me.

261
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,181
Lee!

262
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:08,118
-It's not true.

263
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,786
It can't be true!

264
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,221
Easy for you to say it's over!

265
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,389
What about Bushy-brow?

266
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:15,392
What's he supposed to do now?

267
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:16,427
Failure!

268
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,362
I thought you said we could win!

269
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:21,566
I thought you were going
to show how a failure can--

270
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,402
It was a lie, wasn't it?

271
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,303
Eh.

272
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,205
-That's enough, Naruto.

273
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,173
-Eh.

274
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,608
But Sensei, it isn't fair!

275
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:33,178
All he ever wanted
was to prove himself

276
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,947
against Sasuke and Neji.

277
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,983
-And maybe that's what
led to his downfall.

278
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,117
-[sobs]

279
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,121
-He was fixated on that
goal that he sacrificed

280
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:45,258
his body, his
future, to attain it.

281
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,800
And now that goal
is unattainable.

282
00:17:56,536 --> 00:18:00,240
-[sobs]

283
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:03,344
-But you're wrong about
one thing, Naruto.

284
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,614
It wasn't just Sasuke and
Neji he was thinking of.

285
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:09,717
It was you, too.

286
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,952
That's right.

287
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:12,888
He risked everything
just for the hope

288
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,491
of meeting you in combat.

289
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,458
Remember that.

290
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:22,698
Be worthy of his sacrifice.

291
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:33,276
-(VOICEOVER) Lee.

292
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,878
I wonder if he'll be all right?

293
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:45,856
-(VOICEOVER) Lee, you didn't
understand, even at the end.

294
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,525
Fate will never
smile on the fortunes

295
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,963
of a ninja who seeks victory
by falling on his own sword,

296
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,132
or demanding that
others fall on theirs.

297
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,180
-Huh?

298
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:16,056
-(VOICEOVER) So the worst
didn't happen after all.

299
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,791
-Good to have you back, Gaara.

300
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:37,179
-Guy.

301
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:38,313
-Huh?

302
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:41,984
-What I said earlier,
it was out of line.

303
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,887
I was being a
self-righteous fool.

304
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,957
I realize now that if
I'd been in your shoes,

305
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,027
I probably couldn't
have stopped him either.

306
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,399
-Huh?

307
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,134
-Come on, Guy.

308
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,536
Let's go up.

309
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:06,410
They can't start the next match
with us standing here, right?

310
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:15,553
-Now then, the last
two competitors,

311
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,788
will you please step forward?

312
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:24,830
- [chuckling] (VOICEOVER)
So it's finally my turn.

313
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:27,699
-(VOICEOVER) Just keep
your eyes on the prize,

314
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,036
all you can eat barbecue.

315
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,504
-(VOICEOVER) My job is to
survive the main tournament

316
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:37,176
and battle Sasuke, isn't
that right, Lord Orochimaru?

317
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:41,648
I wouldn't to disappoint you.

318
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,217
I begin to see
through your design.

319
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,186
The reason you set
us against Sasuke,

320
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,822
but forbid us from killing him.

321
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,058
The curse you put on him.

322
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,395
We were your pawns,
weren't we, my Lord?

323
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:58,066
Put here merely to test the
limits of his abilities.

324
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,935
It's not Sasuke's life you want.

325
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,639
It's Sasuke himself.

326
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:09,611
You played us all
for fools, even me.

327
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,813
-All right.

328
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,949
The 10th and final
match will begin.

329
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:21,772
[closing theme song]

330
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,003
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hey, Sakura.

331
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:54,738
Where's Kagashi-sensei?

332
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,140
SAKURA (VOICECOVER): Naruto,
have you noticed it's--

333
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,241
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): We've
got to start my training

334
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:57,976
for the main tournament.

335
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:58,943
Where is he?

336
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,178
SAKURA (VOICECOVER):
I don't know.

337
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,245
With Sasuke, probably.

338
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,213
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ah!

339
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:03,181
Figures.

340
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,149
Hey, what's wrong, Sakura?

341
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,285
You seem kind of down.

342
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,386
SAKURA (VOICECOVER):
Just uneasy.

343
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,753
There's something not right.

344
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,322
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Well, whatever.

345
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,612
Next time, "A
Shadow in Darkness".

346
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:13,912
Danger approaches Sasuke.

347
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:17,179
SAKURA (VOICECOVER):
I've got a bad feeling.
