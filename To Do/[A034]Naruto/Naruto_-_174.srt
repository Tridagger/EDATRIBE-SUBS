[theme music]

3
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,840
KUNIHISA: Look, daddy.

4
00:01:57,873 --> 00:01:59,443
Look at this marble.

5
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,312
-Hmm?

6
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,647
What about it, son?

7
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:04,420
KUNIHISA: It's just as pretty
and sparkly as a diamond,

8
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:05,155
isn't it?

9
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:06,257
KUNIJIRO: Why so it is.

10
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,528
You're right.

11
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,766
KUNIHISA: But a
diamond's valuable.

12
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,271
And this is totally worthless.

13
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,106
Why is that?

14
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,475
-Uh.

15
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,381
-Life's funny, isn't it daddy?

16
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:24,260
NARUTO: Impossible celebrity
ninja art money style Jutsu.

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,228
What?

18
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:27,166
You really mean it?

19
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,901
No kidding?

20
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:29,404
-Will you calm down?

21
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:30,138
-OK.

22
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:30,673
Sorry about that.

23
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:31,275
You're right.

24
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:31,742
OK.

25
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:32,677
I'm fine now

26
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:33,512
-Oink.

27
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:34,614
-Uh.

28
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:37,754
--[clearing throat] This
is an important person.

29
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:40,560
And I could think of no one
better for the job than you.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,299
-At last, I'm
finally going to get

31
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:46,405
a mission worthy of
my awesome abilities.

32
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:51,415
It's everything I've dreamed of,
being the escort of a real VIP.

33
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,687
-Will you shut up for
one second and listen?

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,398
--[screaming] Right,
sorry, gotcha.

35
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,605
-Do you want to the details
of your mission or not?

36
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:03,406
Shizune?

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,275
-Yes, milady.

38
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:10,254
TSUNADE: The client's name
is Kunijiro, an old friend.

39
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,924
He started with nothing,
and made himself

40
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:14,963
into one of the richest and
most successful rare gem dealers

41
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:16,232
around.

42
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,303
-You're saying this
guy's a friend of yours.

43
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:19,606
-That's right.

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,677
But he is not your assignment.

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,814
Your mission is to
look after his only son

46
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:26,420
and heir, Kunihisa.

47
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:28,858
-(THINKING) The heir
to a rare gem fortune.

48
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:34,971
KUNIHISA: Daddy?

49
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:35,872
-Hmm?

50
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,544
-Are they all real?

51
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:41,250
-Why of course
they are, Kunihisa.

52
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:44,958
KUNIHISA: And that, and
that, and that, and that?

53
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,260
KUNIJIRO: Yes, Kuni-wooni.

54
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,395
They're all real.

55
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:50,368
-I've never seen
so many ninja ever!

56
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,771
-Ah!

57
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,773
Right!

58
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:57,216
OK, I'm all fired
up and ready to go!

59
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,452
I accept the mission.

60
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,487
And I won't let you down.

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,322
I promise.

62
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,491
So when do we get started?

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,493
Where is he?

64
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,462
[knocking]

65
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:04,430
-Huh?

66
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:06,001
TSUNADE: Come in.

67
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,603
-Ninja!

68
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:08,973
-Whoa, what are you doing?

69
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,578
-Ninja, ninja, ninja, ninja!

70
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,548
You're a ninja?

71
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:16,421
-I don't really like the
way you asked that question.

72
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,591
KUNIJIRO: So you're the one.

73
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,893
-Huh?

74
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,264
-You really don't mind if my
little boy tags along with you,

75
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:22,868
and plays ninja for a day?

76
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,803
Hmm?

77
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,540
Can't tell you
how grateful I am.

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,517
-Uh, did you say he wants
to play ninja for a day?

79
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,652
-It's an obsession.

80
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,423
He's wild about
everything ninja.

81
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,997
You should hear him--
ninja, ninja all day long.

82
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,936
[laughing]

83
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:41,272
-What is this?

84
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:44,646
I thought I was escorting
an important VIP.

85
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,516
-Well that's your problem.

86
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,889
I never told you it was an
important VIP, now did I?

87
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,526
-What a dirty, rotten trick.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,864
TSUNADE: That's enough, Naruto.

89
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:57,705
Your mission is to
play ninja for a day.

90
00:04:57,738 --> 00:04:59,309
-What the?

91
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,046
This is so not fair.

92
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,584
-What's more, on
top of that, you

93
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,387
have your regular
missions to perform.

94
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,793
-What's going on, grandma?

95
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,964
Why are you doing this to me?

96
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:10,564
Why?

97
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,813
I've got to clean the
pond, repair the bridge,

98
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,352
take care of a feral pig.

99
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:21,687
Oh boy.

100
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,393
-[giggling]

101
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:26,731
-(THINKING) Now I get to
add babysitting to my list

102
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,468
of deranked missions.

103
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,872
-When do we start playing ninja?

104
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,787
-Watch closely, Kunihisa.

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,358
I'll show you a little trick
we ninja know how to do.

106
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,103
-Ah!

107
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:49,076
[clapping] Awesome,
Naruto, awesome.

108
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:52,417
--[chuckling] But being a ninja
isn't always fun and games.

109
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,421
So if you want to be
a ninja for a day,

110
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,024
help me clean up this pond.

111
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,393
-OK, I will.

112
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,130
-Oh, but one thing.

113
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:00,433
This pond is tricky.

114
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,903
If you step in the
wrong spot, you

115
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,505
can get stuck,
and never get out.

116
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,409
So stay on the bank, all right?

117
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:05,911
KUNIHISA: Oops.

118
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:06,779
Too late.

119
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,580
-Huh?

120
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,349
-What are we going to do?

121
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:09,351
-Hey, hi, Naruto!

122
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,721
-[screaming] Are you nuts?

123
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:12,491
What are you doing in there?

124
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:13,359
OK, OK, don't move.

125
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,094
Stay right where you are.

126
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,129
I'll come and get you out.

127
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:16,064
-Don't worry.

128
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:17,066
I can handle it.

129
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,570
-What do you mean
you can handle it?

130
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,108
-I've got some
ninjutsu of my own.

131
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:22,745
-Some ninjutsu?

132
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:23,980
-His father's going to kill us!

133
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,584
His father's going to kill us!

134
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,552
-Ah.

135
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,922
Ah!

136
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:34,670
Alligator, snapping turtle,
bunny ears, ninja art.

137
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,074
Come and help me!

138
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:38,076
-Ah!

139
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:40,013
[shouting]

140
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:40,682
-Ah!

141
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,009
-See what I mean, Naruto?

142
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,011
What's going on?

143
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,082
What are you guys
doing down there?

144
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,954
I'll have to increase
the power of my ninjutsu.

145
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:07,837
-Serve them right if I just
left them all here to drown.

146
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,686
So tell me, Kunihisa.

147
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,168
-Huh?

148
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,929
-Who are the big
goons in the suits.

149
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,433
-Never mind them.

150
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:25,005
They're just some people my
daddy hired to look after me,

151
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,443
and stuff like that,
like if I get in trouble,

152
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,745
or I want something.

153
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,850
-Uh huh.

154
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,625
-Here, want to see an example?

155
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:35,107
Fetch.

156
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,643
See?

157
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,047
-You have got to be kidding.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,982
-Ugh.

159
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,986
Are you sure it's safe?

160
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,190
NARUTO: Yeah, it's safe.

161
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,525
It's safe.

162
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,531
-Are you positively
sure it's safe?

163
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,870
-I'm standing on it, aren't I?

164
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,471
Come on.

165
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:57,913
It's OK.

166
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,876
Trust me.

167
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,713
-Cross your heart,
and hope to to die?

168
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:02,648
-I said it's safe.

169
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,019
Now knock it off
and get out here.

170
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,656
-OK, OK.

171
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,794
But first I'm just
going to make sure.

172
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,965
Ninja art substitution Jutsu!

173
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,502
[laughing]

174
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:16,510
-Are you satisfied?

175
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,211
Now come on.

176
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,780
Let's go.

177
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,684
-Hmm.

178
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,023
Yeah, but what if my weight's
enough to make it break?

179
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,927
Let's just try a few more.

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,498
Ha!

181
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:30,504
-Whoa.

182
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,275
-I'm still not convinced!

183
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:33,878
Once more.

184
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,849
Catch!

185
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,753
-Money!

186
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,823
-Huh?

187
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:43,665
[screaming]

188
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:50,178
-So it wasn't safe.

189
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:53,017
[moaning]

190
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,088
-See what you did?

191
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,591
What was that?

192
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:59,965
-Uh, you should be happy
I wasn't on the bridge

193
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,133
when it broke.

194
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,570
-Why you crazy little--

195
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,943
-Gentlemen, you
deserve a nice big tip.

196
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,245
There you go.

197
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,014
-Hey.

198
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,749
Cut it out, will you?

199
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,219
Stop that.

200
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:12,557
THUG: That kid's
throwing around money

201
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,561
like it's going out of style.

202
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:15,630
THUG: Yeah.

203
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:19,137
And he's only got a
single genny with him.

204
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,673
What do you say?

205
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,845
Wanna make some money?

206
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:23,319
-Yeah.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,002
-So what's next?

208
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,073
-I have to deal with
a feral pig that's

209
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:38,175
been bothering some farmers.

210
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,612
-No problem.

211
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,317
I'll get my ninjutsu
ready. [giggling]

212
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,288
-What the heck's that?

213
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,759
That thing's a pig?

214
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,761
-[snarling]

215
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,131
-It's the size of an elephant.

216
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,133
Stay back.

217
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,104
Shadow Call Jutsu!

218
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:54,108
-Whoa, amazing.

219
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:59,118
-[roaring]

220
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:01,690
-Naruto!

221
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:02,257
OK, piggie.

222
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,796
Now you deal with me!

223
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,032
-No, stay away from that thing.

224
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,000
It's too big.

225
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:10,742
You don't know
what you're doing!

226
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:11,376
-Ha!

227
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,716
Here's my cash clone Jutsu.

228
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,324
-Did he say cash clone Jutsu?

229
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:19,726
-[giggling]

230
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,630
-Huh?

231
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,902
-Listen up, you overgrown ham.

232
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:29,346
I'm going to see to it that
you never bother anyone again.

233
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:29,947
Attack!

234
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,323
Give it to him.

235
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:35,259
Let him have it.

236
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,261
That's the way.

237
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:39,901
Go on.

238
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:40,803
Get out of here.

239
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,807
You're not even
good for sausages,

240
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,078
you big fat tub of lard.

241
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,216
-[snarling]

242
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:51,959
-[gulp]

243
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,930
-[growling]

244
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,201
-Wait, it's all his fault.

245
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,036
He made me.

246
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,038
-Huh?

247
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,040
-He made me do it.

248
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,044
I, I don't even eat pork.

249
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,046
-[snarling]

250
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,048
-Whoa.

251
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,050
Now just hold on.

252
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,052
That's not true.

253
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,155
Ah!

254
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:09,026
You're going to believe
that kid instead of me?

255
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:14,404
[screaming]

256
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,408
-You're a brave ninja.

257
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,784
-Why you, you, of
all the selfish,

258
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,989
spoiled, rotten little kids.

259
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,993
-I bed you don't
have a lot of money.

260
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,295
Am I right?

261
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,734
I've found that poor people tend
to lose their tempers a lot.

262
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,042
-Gah!

263
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,913
-Go on, help
yourself, however much

264
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:37,218
it takes to put you
in a good mood again.

265
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:39,122
-Get it out of here.

266
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,726
I told you before
to stop doing that.

267
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,996
-Why?

268
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,432
NARUTO: You can't just buy
your way out of everything.

269
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,469
There are times when
money won't work,

270
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:49,175
when you've got to
do it on your own.

271
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,714
--[sigh] I suppose if I
didn't have any money,

272
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,851
I'd believe that too.

273
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,056
-Man, are you like
this all the time?

274
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,128
How do you even make friends
with an attitude like that?

275
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,365
-How do you think?

276
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,168
It's easy.

277
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,938
-Huh?

278
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:07,045
So what you're saying is
that you buy your friends?

279
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,114
-Sure.

280
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:11,087
And when I lose one,
I just buy another.

281
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,826
-But, Kunihisa?

282
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,464
-That's why I didn't want a
ninja from a little village.

283
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:17,967
You'll never understand.

284
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:22,477
You're too poor and stupid.

285
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,015
-Wait, Master Kunihisa,
where are you going?

286
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:25,916
Don't run off.

287
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,995
[stomach growling]

288
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,298
-Hmm.

289
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:36,004
I guess all that
running made me hungry.

290
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,941
Go find me some lunch, will you?

291
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:41,081
-But sir, there are no
restaurants around here.

292
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:41,816
-Fine.

293
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,218
Just a snack, then.

294
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:44,054
-I'm sorry.

295
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:44,822
But look around you, sir.

296
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:45,556
There's nothing here.

297
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,193
-Well, what good are you then?

298
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,032
This is exactly why
I hate the country.

299
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,903
[stomach growling]

300
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:56,044
-Uh, oh, that stupid Naruto.

301
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,287
[sniffing] What is that?

302
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,226
-Wait, sir, wait.

303
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:08,943
-Ooh, look, someone's
having fish for lunch.

304
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,379
I'm sure they won't mind.

305
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,383
-Look at the way he
swallowed that bait.

306
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,154
He's as dumb as he is rich.

307
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:17,637
-Yeah.

308
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,244
-Whoa!

309
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,212
-Huh?

310
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:30,448
What's going on?

311
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:33,454
-Man, you are one high
maintenance kid, aren't you?

312
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,991
You don't know
how close you came

313
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,162
to having those
two goons grab you.

314
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:40,969
-Oh, it was just another
kidnapping attempt, that's all.

315
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:41,570
-Huh?

316
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,307
Just another wh--

317
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,848
-It happens all the time,
because I'm stinking rich.

318
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:47,482
-All the time?

319
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:48,919
How often is that?

320
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,154
-Oh, a lot.

321
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:52,927
Anyway, do you know where
there's a store around here?

322
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,164
I'm going to need
more to eat than this?

323
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,401
-Listen to you.

324
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,305
You've got it stuck in
your head that money's

325
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,911
going to solve everything.

326
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:02,846
Well, all right then.

327
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,548
Just watch this.

328
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,260
-Oh, wow.

329
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,297
That was awesome, Naruto.

330
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,470
-Ha, see that, that's something
all the money in the world

331
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,573
can't buy you.

332
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,579
It's something you've
got to earn on your own.

333
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:23,923
-Not even all the
money in the world?

334
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:28,099
-Dirty little rat, sneaking up
on us from behind like that.

335
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,169
Next time, I'll wring his neck.

336
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,171
-Hey, take it easy.

337
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,908
We've got to have a plan.

338
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,378
We'll just get clobbered again.

339
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,048
-You got something in mind?

340
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:37,651
-It's right there
in front of is.

341
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:38,352
-It is?

342
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,368
-Watch it closely.

343
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,105
Anticipate its movements.

344
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,076
Then try to hit it
right when it reaches

345
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,313
the high point of its jump.

346
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,454
-There!

347
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,256
Aw.

348
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:57,091
-That's OK.

349
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:58,493
You were close.

350
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,631
-Let me try one more time, OK?

351
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,268
Don't worry about the knife.

352
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,603
I'll go get it.

353
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,341
-Master Kunihisa,
watch your step.

354
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,276
It's deep.

355
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,611
BODYGUARD: Please
be careful, sir.

356
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,180
KUNIHISA: I know.

357
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:08,648
I know.

358
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:09,415
I'm not a child.

359
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,587
Give me a break.

360
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,092
Oh, where did it go?

361
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,628
-I'm sure it's in this area.

362
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,231
-Ah!

363
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:21,374
--[evil chuckle] Oh, you
don't get off that easy.

364
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,110
-What are my men doing?

365
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,415
-We hired their services
with some of that money

366
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,650
you were throwing around.

367
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:28,621
-They're not your men anymore.

368
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:30,425
They're with us now.

369
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,394
-Listen, you guys.

370
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:32,696
I can pay you more.

371
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:36,270
Whatever those kidnappers are
paying you, I'll double it.

372
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,640
Uh, what the?

373
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,176
Don't tell me.

374
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:40,546
-Hmm.

375
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:41,548
THUG: What's the matter?

376
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,986
You finally run out of cash?

377
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,257
-So what's it going
to be you two?

378
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,529
Gonna come on over to our side?

379
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,964
-Why don't you come and get it?

380
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,401
Cash in advance.

381
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,138
-Ha, you're wasting your time.

382
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,407
They've been with me forever.

383
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,511
They'd never betray
me for a few-- ah!

384
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,348
-Never liked working
for you anyway,

385
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,085
you spoiled little brat.

386
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,223
-You, you guys are
going to be sorry.

387
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,461
-[evil laughter]

388
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,062
-Stop it!

389
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,031
Let me go!

390
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:06,472
Let me go!

391
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:07,366
Let me go!

392
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,502
-Shut up, and stop
squirming, kid.

393
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,074
Don't make this any
harder than it has to be.

394
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,413
-Whoa!

395
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,684
-Ah!

396
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,254
[whimpiring]

397
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:19,157
-Kunihisa, are you OK?

398
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:22,029
-Naruto, I thought-- I didn't--

399
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,498
-Never mind.

400
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,702
It's OK.

401
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:27,074
-Hey, you, we'll pay
you double whatever

402
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:28,576
you're getting for this mission.

403
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,447
Just hand over the brat to us.

404
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,752
What do you say?

405
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,054
-Yeah, and don't worry.

406
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,056
He'll be fine.

407
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,225
It's not like we're
going to hurt him,

408
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,497
or anything, just
hold him for ransom.

409
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,204
So, do we have ourselves a deal?

410
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,006
What's the matter?

411
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,607
That not enough?

412
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,278
Look, we'll triple it.

413
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,446
Take it.

414
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,183
-Naruto?

415
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:49,051
-Hurry up.

416
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,586
Get on my back.

417
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:50,187
-OK.

418
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,496
-What, is that still not enough?

419
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,199
Here, look, you can have it all.

420
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:56,641
Take it.

421
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,769
Take it.

422
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,774
-You guys just don't get it.

423
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:00,742
-Huh?

424
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,045
-You'll never learn
that there are

425
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,617
some things in life
you just can't buy.

426
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:05,786
-Oh yeah?

427
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,386
Get him!

428
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,359
Go on!

429
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,731
-Just keep hanging on
tight, no matter what.

430
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,735
-OK.

431
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,305
-(THINKING) Darn it.

432
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,244
I can't outrun them for
long with him on my back.

433
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:29,133
-Oh, I can't even
see the bottom.

434
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:29,615
-Hiya!

435
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:34,544
Now hurry up.

436
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:36,447
You go over first, OK?

437
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:36,931
-What?

438
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,755
Go over?

439
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,325
Whoa. [whimpering]

440
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:42,260
-There they are!

441
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,161
Get them!

442
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:44,564
Yeah!

443
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:46,635
-What are you waiting for,
an engraved invitation?

444
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,406
Hurry up and jump.

445
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,309
-I c-c-can't.

446
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:52,247
I'm sc-cared, Naruto.

447
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,249
-You'll be fine.

448
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,618
Just go on!

449
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,155
-I can't.

450
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,092
-[evil laughter]

451
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,394
-Stay back.

452
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:00,396
-Get him.

453
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,800
-Yah!

454
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,369
-Naruto?

455
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:04,772
[evil laugh, cracking knuckles]

456
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:07,343
-You're coming
with me, pipsqueak.

457
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,147
-Go on, Kunihisa.

458
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:09,816
-I'm afraid.

459
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:11,185
-You can do it.

460
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:12,153
Stop thinking about it.

461
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,557
You can do it.

462
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,563
--[evil laugh] You're
staying right there.

463
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,272
-Whoa!

464
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:22,208
-Way to go!

465
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:23,143
You did it!

466
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,414
-Big brother, are you all right?

467
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:31,032
-[screaming]

468
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,831
-Hey, are you OK?

469
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:37,839
-Ow!

470
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,447
[wailing]

471
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,286
-I'll finish off these
guys, and come on over.

472
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,223
You wait there.

473
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:47,325
-Right.

474
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,696
I'll wait here.

475
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,298
Oh?

476
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,642
Naruto!

477
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,179
Hurry up!

478
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,516
The cliff's collapsing.

479
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,586
-What is this?

480
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,590
You guys planning on
sitting there all day?

481
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,894
Shadow Call Jutsu!

482
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:05,496
-Whoa!

483
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,741
-(THINKING) What should I do?

484
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,512
-There are times when
money won't work,

485
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,616
when you've got to
do it on your own.

486
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,887
-(THINKING) Do it on my own.

487
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:24,601
-That's something all the money
in the wold can't buy you.

488
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:27,506
It's something you've
got to earn on your own.

489
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:30,246
-(THINKING) I can't
buy this with money.

490
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:33,887
I gotta do it on my own.

491
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:34,855
I can do it.

492
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:37,461
I can do it!

493
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:40,500
-(THINKING) Looks like I
came up one step short.

494
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,473
-Naruto!

495
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:43,955
-Kunihisa!

496
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,324
-No!

497
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,665
You can do it.

498
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:58,269
-We did it!

499
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,271
-All right!

500
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,549
-I can't say it was much fun.

501
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:05,518
And I'm still scared.

502
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,889
But at least I did it!

503
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:11,663
--[laughing] Man, you should
see your face right now.

504
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,901
-Yeah, I bet it looks
pretty silly, huh?

505
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:15,404
-Hey, Kunihisa?

506
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:17,275
-Yeah?

507
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:17,843
-Great job.

508
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,947
You saved my life.

509
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:26,326
-[gasp] [sobbing] Naruto!

510
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,263
-Hey, whoa, watch it!

511
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,299
You're dripping on me.

512
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:29,767
-I'm sorry.

513
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,736
I can't help it.

514
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,971
-I'm drowning here.

515
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:34,377
Use a hankie or
something, please?

516
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:40,555
Well, guess this is goodbye.

517
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,426
KUNIHISA: Next time,
you can come play ninja

518
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:43,361
for a day at my house.

519
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:43,963
-You bet.

520
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:45,665
Got yourself a deal.

521
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,571
-You did a fine job of
looking after my son.

522
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:49,808
You have my thanks.

523
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,012
-It was nothing. [chuckling]

524
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,381
-Goodbye, milady.

525
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:53,883
-See you soon.

526
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,003
KUNIHISA: Look, daddy, look.

527
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,440
KUNIJIRO: What is it, son?

528
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,946
KUNIHISA: See how it
sparkles in the sun?

529
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,850
-All that glitters is not gold.

530
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,852
It's just a marble.

531
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:12,988
It has no value.

532
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,726
KUNIHISA: Not in money, no.

533
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:17,698
But, daddy?

534
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:19,635
-Hmm?

535
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,606
-Maybe it has a
different kind of value,

536
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,510
just because it's pretty.

537
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:27,918
[giggling]

538
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:34,465
[music playing]

539
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:02,678
NARUTO: Trecheron, really?

540
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:05,183
Now that's my kind of mission.

541
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,652
I have my doubts.

542
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,756
You haven't been doing too
well on your missions lately.

543
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,625
NARUTO: Don't worry.

544
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:10,828
Anyway, we've got a map.

545
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:11,830
What could go wrong?

546
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,832
With you, plenty.

547
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:13,867
I'm warning you, Naruto.

548
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,136
NARUTO: Aw, come on.

549
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,072
It'll be a cinch.

550
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,140
