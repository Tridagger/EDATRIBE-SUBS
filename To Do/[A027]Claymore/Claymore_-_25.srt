1
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,833
It's been a long time
since my mind has felt

2
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,750
this free and clear.

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,125
I'm awake now.

4
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,541
You will die...

5
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,541
by my...

6
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,291
haaaand...

7
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,458
you bitch...

8
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,375
I swear it!

9
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,083
Your symbol is different...

10
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,500
It's not what you had before.

11
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,041
I'm no longer afraid of you...

12
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,125
Do you hear me?

13
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,750
Die!

14
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to take your life...

15
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,875
I will have my revenge...

16
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,541
for what you've done...

17
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,750
to my mommy and daddy...

18
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,208
I have to murder...

19
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
every last traitorous...

20
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,041
filthy, Yoma.

21
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,833
It looks as though
Priscilla has reverted back

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,875
to the physical form
she had when we first met.

23
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,625
But what I find
especially troubling

24
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,000
is the partially-awakened
Claymore...

25
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,250
The way she harnesses
her Yoma power is peculiar.

26
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,583
I see how it is...

27
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,875
The Organization seems to have
a few tricks up their sleeve.

28
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,416
This should make for
an interesting battle...

29
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,875
which I will be
watching carefully.

30
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,666
Priscilla...

31
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,666
you're dead!

32
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,250
Damn...

33
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,750
Clare's power level
has risen again.

34
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,083
So that's Priscilla...?
Why has she decided

35
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,291
to show her face
after all this time?

36
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,000
It was Priscilla who killed
Teresa of the Faint Smile...

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,333
I'm not surprised
that she's still alive...

38
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,750
The question is...

39
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,500
why is Clare so obsessed
with fighting her...?

40
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,833
It doesn't make sense.

41
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,791
She was prepared to die
a little while ago,

42
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,541
what could possibly
be so important that

43
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,666
she would change her mind?

44
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
Care to shed some light
on this, Miria?

45
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,750
Miria, what do you know?

46
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,333
I did a little snooping
around the Organization...

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,875
and I came across something...

48
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,958
Clare's ranking is at
the absolute bottom

49
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,833
at number forty-seven.

50
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,791
Don't you find it odd
that the weakest warrior

51
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,750
we have can display power
that surpasses all of us?

52
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,541
What do you mean?

53
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,458
Now that you mention it,
it is strange.

54
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,708
Turns out there's
a logical reason...

55
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,416
Clare is not a half-human,
half-Yoma like we are.

56
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,000
She's different...

57
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,708
Implanted inside of her is not
the flesh and blood of a Yoma

58
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,875
but the blood of
a fellow Warrior.

59
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,208
What?!

60
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,041
And the name of
that warrior is...

61
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,833
Teresa of the Faint Smile.

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,791
Are you serious?

63
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,625
Is that even possible?

64
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:51,333
I have a feeling it was
probably her own idea.

65
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,041
She must have had some kind of
bond or connection with Teresa.

66
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,291
Of course we all know the
Organization would never

67
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,208
do something out of sympathy.

68
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,958
There was an incentive for
them since it allowed

69
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,958
for a new kind of experiment,
where a Warrior is made

70
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,875
from one of their own,
rather than the enemy.

71
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,000
Sick bastards...

72
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,583
It sounds like something
they would do.

73
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,208
Makes sense...

74
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,708
It explains why Clare is so
determined to kill Priscilla,

75
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,416
because she wants revenge.

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,375
You're probably right.

77
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,625
Thing is...

78
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,208
In this heightened state
Clare is in right now...

79
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:31,000
she'll be fully awakened before
the fight comes to an end.

80
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,500
Even if she were to awaken,

81
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,583
there's no telling if she'd
be able to defeat Priscilla.

82
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,500
Let's move.

83
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,416
I can't believe this shit...

84
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,666
I promised Clare I wouldn't
let her die a monster-

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,333
she has to die a human...!
Whatever happens I won't

86
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,541
allow her to awaken...

87
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,583
I just hope she doesn't put up
a fight once I get there!

88
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,708
Look-what is that?

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,083
It looks like
some kind of trail...

90
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,166
I guess Miria and the others
must have left it for us.

91
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,708
Do you mind if...

92
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,916
if I ask you something?

93
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:59,125
What is it that makes you care
about Clare as much as you do?

94
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,500
Well, she saved my life.

95
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,916
I was moments away from
becoming something inhuman...

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,416
when Clare swooped
in to rescue me.

97
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,375
That's why I've given
over my life to her...

98
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,250
I am...

99
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,375
now...

100
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,208
in her debt.

101
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,375
I was also...

102
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,625
saved by Clare.

103
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,875
That's why I came here
to find her...

104
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,000
I have to help her
no matter what.

105
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,041
It's the least I can do.

106
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,291
Fighting for the sake
of something or someone

107
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,666
is not a concept
that's ours alone.

108
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,250
It's what Clare's doing now...

109
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,666
What?

110
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,541
The Awakened Being that she's
fighting to withstand...

111
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,041
took the life of someone
very precious to her.

112
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,416
And for those whose
life Clare has saved,

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,916
so too have we saved hers.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,500
That's...

115
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,083
true.

116
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,708
She fights for the sake
of the person she lost...

117
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,083
and for...

118
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,333
the sake of the person
she doesn't want to lose...

119
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,958
Those are Clare's
words, not mine.

120
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,000
I think that's just
part of being human.

121
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,541
Clare...

122
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,916
she won't turn into
a Yoma, will she?

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,958
No...

124
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,750
she won't.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,583
What's the matter...?
Is there something wrong?

126
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
I don't remember...

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,333
you being this weak before...

128
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,833
Miss Teresa.

129
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,041
Teresa.

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
Teresa!

131
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,166
Oh my.

132
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,833
You're not worthy...

133
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,791
of uttering her name!

134
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,250
It's your own fault, really...

135
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
My mommy and daddy,
my big brother,

136
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,416
Miss Illena and all
the other Warriors...

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,333
Committing those horrible
acts on the innocent.

138
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,541
I blame you for everything,
Miss Teresa.

139
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,041
I told you...

140
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,250
don't say her name!

141
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,166
Alright...

142
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,541
It's time we ended this.

143
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,458
I just don't see how I
could have ever been afraid

144
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,125
of you when I can obviously
kill you so easily.

145
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,041
It's only a matter of time until
you breathe your last breath.

146
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,541
So goodbye now...

147
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,500
Miss Teresa.

148
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,958
You know that really hurt.

149
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,083
Damn it...

150
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,375
She better not have awakened...

151
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,958
If she has I will
never forgive her.

152
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:32,000
Helen...? Miria...? Deneve?

153
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,708
So this is the Priscilla
we've heard so much about.

154
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,208
I never thought
she'd be so imposing.

155
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,333
Hello...

156
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,625
It's a real pleasure
to meet you all...

157
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,000
Judging by what
I see before me...

158
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:53,875
the three of you must be
newcomers to the Organization.

159
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,000
I am...

160
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,666
Priscilla,
the Number Two Warrior.

161
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,916
Hold on...

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,750
What the hell
is she talking about?

163
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,500
Her memories are limited
to what happened

164
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,250
before she fully awakened.

165
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,750
Either that or she's
just completely confused

166
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,000
Helen, Deneve, move to the
flanks on either side of her...

167
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,791
I'm going to try
to charge her head on.

168
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,875
Sounds like a plan to me.

169
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,000
No...

170
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,666
don't do it...

171
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,291
Well...

172
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,541
what is this about...? Do
you three honestly think

173
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,833
you'll be able to kill me?

174
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,583
Go now!

175
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,166
You are all a disgrace,

176
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,333
fighting on the
side of the Yoma.

177
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,708
Do you really
think you can touch me?

178
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,208
Damn it!

179
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,166
There's no way, I can't
believe she dodged that!

180
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,750
What do you expect
from a monster?

181
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,333
Just don't let your guard down.

182
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:14,041
I have done nothing wrong- you
are the ones who are monsters.

183
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,583
Committing all
of those atrocities...

184
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,916
against my mommy, my daddy
and my big brother.

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
All I ever did was eat
a bit of worthless flesh

186
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,208
and nothing more.

187
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,916
I am far from being a Yoma.

188
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,500
Those despicable Yoma...

189
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,916
They must die...

190
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,583
I will kill them...

191
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,125
This is...

192
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,708
unreal!

193
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,958
So much power...

194
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,541
Is that...?

195
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,500
Hang on tight.

196
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,416
But Jean...

197
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,875
You can't- you're wounded!

198
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,333
I'll manage.

199
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,666
It's been gradually regenerating
the entire journey.

200
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,791
You still want to
help Clare, don't you?

201
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,166
All I need to do is get
to Clare's location...

202
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,708
I just hope I can
last that long.

203
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,583
Clare...

204
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,083
Impossible.

205
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,208
What the hell?

206
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,041
You mean she wasn't
completely awakened before?

207
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,166
My my...

208
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,541
Your talents are truly
a thing of beauty...

209
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,166
Priscilla...

210
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,000
Now finish her.

211
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,291
I see no reason to prolong
this any further...

212
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,333
Now prepare to die.

213
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,833
So you're a phantom...

214
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,583
A true Warrior would never
depend on one silly trick.

215
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,125
This sword brings back memories.

216
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Helen!

217
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,541
Get out of here...! Helen!

218
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
Bitch!

219
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,041
Damn it, Helen!

220
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,041
So this...

221
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,416
is the power of
a true Awakened Being.

222
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,666
I can see how
you defeated Teresa.

223
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,250
While they may have
been successful

224
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,833
in defeating Rigaldo...

225
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,500
all good things
must come to an end.

226
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,416
What am I doing...

227
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,375
Why am I just sitting here?

228
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,916
I couldn't even
help my friends...

229
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,791
Teresa.

230
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,541
What have I become?

231
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,833
It's Clare.

232
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,666
How does that sound?

233
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,291
Priscilla!

234
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,125
I have to do this...

235
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,375
I have to kill her.

236
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,291
It's why I became a Warrior.

237
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,916
If I can't kill Priscilla...

238
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,250
then this was all for nothing.

239
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,791
Priscilla.

240
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,791
Priscilla.

241
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,166
Priscilla...

242
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,708
I will kill you...

243
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,625
I just need...

244
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,958
More...

245
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,041
Power...

246
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,208
Clare...

247
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,833
Is that you?

248
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,250
Clare!

249
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,375
This is the end...

250
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,666
I will kill you!

251
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,333
I promise you!

252
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,333
It's a Yoma.

253
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,833
Priscilla...

254
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,208
Clare!

255
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,958
Distant horizon,
distant dawn.

256
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,875
Emotions entangled.

257
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,166
Next time on Claymore,
To the Successors.
