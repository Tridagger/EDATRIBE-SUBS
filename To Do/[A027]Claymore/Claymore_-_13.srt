1
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,000
You're so slow...

2
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,416
I really didn't
expect much, but this?

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,208
There are so many unnecessary
movements in your attacks.

4
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,125
Same with your
defensive maneuvers...

5
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,541
I could teach you to move
so much more efficiently.

6
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,916
But I believe
we've passed that point.

7
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,375
I apologize.

8
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,708
I'm still worked
up from fighting

9
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,666
such a strong adversary...

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,125
But killing you should
help me wind down.

11
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,208
Damned Awakened Beings...

12
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll never rest until I've torn
every single one of you apart.

13
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,916
Just what do you
think you're doing?

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,041
You've picked
an interesting time

15
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,958
to suppress your Yoma power...

16
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,291
Have you given up already?

17
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,583
And I came all this way...

18
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,875
Oh, well.

19
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,041
My, you are full of surprises!

20
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,125
Are you reading my Yoki aura
to anticipate my attacks?

21
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,041
That is a fancy little trick.

22
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,333
Maybe this won't be
as boring as I thought.

23
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,250
 You saw it coming.

24
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,291
You are perceptive.

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,875
And right when I was
going to show you

26
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,583
the new move
I've been working on.

27
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,708
What was that...?

28
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,000
I've never felt
anything like it before.

29
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,666
Do me a favor...

30
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,250
And try not to die after
the first blow, all right?

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,416
She's swinging at
my right shoulder from below.

32
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,375
And my left shoulder,
from above!

33
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,750
How...?

34
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,708
I can see the path
of her sword...

35
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,666
Why can't I defend against it?

36
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,625
Impossible...!

37
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,041
Her sword moved...

38
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,791
like a snake!

39
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,208
It's a shame, really.

40
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,875
In combat with
any other opponent,

41
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,333
I bet you would do pretty well.

42
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,000
But against me you're
doomed from the start.

43
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,458
Do you know something, Clare...?

44
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,500
Unlike the rest of you,
I have never been honored

45
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,666
with a, cute,
little nickname...

46
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,666
You know the ones I'm
talking about, don't you,

47
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,958
names like 'Phantom Miria',
or 'Quick Sword Ilena'?

48
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,000
So for years I worked tirelessly
to create the technique

49
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,916
you just witnessed.

50
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,625
I call it the
'Rippling Sword'...

51
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
Like it?

52
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,208
Her sword!

53
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,875
Her arm is vibrating
so quickly it looks

54
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,958
like the blade is alive.

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,958
It's not a bad trick is it...?

56
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,583
I was thinking something
like 'Rippling Ophelia'...

57
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,583
Tell me the truth, now.

58
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,625
Is it catchy enough?

59
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,791
The only problem is that
I can't get the word out

60
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,625
about my new name.

61
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,958
Because nobody
that's seen it...

62
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,416
Has ever lived
to tell anyone else.

63
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,875
Damn it!

64
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,250
I can't stop that attack even if
I can anticipate her moves.

65
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,666
My god...

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,583
You just don't know
when to give up, do you...?

67
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,583
Any chance that you may have
had at winning is long gone.

68
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,458
A chance at winning...?

69
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,416
I never had any such thing...

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,958
Not against that!

71
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:47,958
What...?

72
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,583
A head-on attack, huh?

73
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,958
Such a disappointment.

74
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,583
You look like you're
in pain, Clare.

75
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,250
I'd be happy to end it.

76
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,958
And I had been told
that you had potential...

77
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,416
I guess everyone makes mistakes.

78
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,000
Damn...

79
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,916
I let myself get cut too deeply.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,041
Oh well.

81
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,125
There's nothing I could do...

82
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,041
Any shallower and she would
have suspected something...

83
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,083
I'm going to have to
move quickly if I want

84
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,416
to get my arm reattached.

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
That was quite a display.

86
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,041
And you actually came pretty
close to getting away with it.

87
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,708
Letting me cut off your arm
was an excellent touch.

88
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,875
My last blow even felt
like it was deep enough

89
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,416
to finish you off...

90
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,625
Did you plan to lead me to that
cliff for your little show?

91
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,333
Surely you hadn't been stringing
me along the whole time.

92
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,041
No, that would just be too...

93
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,833
impressive.

94
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,500
But it would have been
more convincing if you'd

95
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,750
given up on that arm of yours.

96
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,916
You never once let go of it...

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,750
And that's what gave you away.

98
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,458
Did you know?

99
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,083
There are offensive fighters...

100
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,291
And those who excel
in tactical defense...

101
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,833
Obviously you belong
in the first category...

102
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,000
An attacker...

103
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,583
Don't you agree?

104
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,250
Unfortunately for you,
Attackers are notoriously

105
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,750
bad at healing...

106
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,416
They can reattach severed limbs,
but they'll never be able

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,583
to regenerate a part of the body
if it's been lost or destroyed.

108
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,083
So when you chose to live
the life of a half-human,

109
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,125
half-monster, were you
thinking about revenge,

110
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,375
or more concerned
with your own survival?

111
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,958
That does tend to be the
deciding factor in producing

112
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,708
an Attacker or a Defender...

113
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,208
Which was it for you?

114
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,416
Well...

115
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,208
Either way, it'd be silly
to let you keep that arm.

116
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,708
You don't really think
I'll let you reattach it...?

117
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,166
Because you'd be
very wrong indeed.

118
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,416
Oh, too bad...

119
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,625
Letting me cut off your dominant
arm wasn't the greatest idea.

120
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,208
Struggling is pointless...

121
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,708
I think you'll realize it,
too- if you think about it.

122
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,333
Hey.

123
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,666
I won't think less
of you if you give up...

124
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,458
I didn't think much
of you to begin with...

125
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,875
Honestly, you're barely more
of a challenge than that boy

126
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,666
you were traveling with.

127
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,625
Alright, why don't you try
to pick up your sword now.

128
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,500
Why are you trying
to stay alive, anyway...?

129
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,583
That one last thing
to do before you die,

130
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,708
or some sort of
survival instinct...?

131
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,625
Really, why won't you
just accept your fate?

132
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,750
Look at me asking like I care.

133
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,500
I was lured here by the presence
of something familiar...

134
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,208
But both of you
are strangers to me.

135
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,041
Who the hell are you?

136
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,250
Well, no matter.

137
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,500
You'll soon find I don't
tolerate interruption...

138
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,833
For your rudeness,
you'll die anyway!

139
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,208
Get away!

140
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,291
She's dangerous...!

141
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,541
Run!

142
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,041
I see...

143
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,333
It's you.

144
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,291
How the...

145
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,041
How the hell did
you just do that?!

146
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,500
Tell me!

147
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
Looks like things
are different now...

148
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,958
Claymores will turn
their swords on anyone.

149
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:03,791
What's wrong...?

150
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,208
I can't even touch her!

151
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,625
I don't get it.

152
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,333
Get back!

153
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:09,916
Quick...!

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Her sword--

155
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,833
Your swordsmanship
has potential...

156
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,958
I imagine your ranking must
be in the single digits.

157
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,875
But numbers and symbols don't
matter out here I'm afraid...

158
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:27,875
What...

159
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,916
is this...?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,125
Her blade is moving
too fast to see.

161
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,291
It can't be her...!

162
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,166
How is she alive?

163
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,416
She was one of the
enforcers sent to kill Teresa!

164
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,583
The former Number Two!

165
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,708
Quick Sword Ilena!

166
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,750
Why are you trying
to stay alive, anyway...?

167
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,875
That one last thing
to do before you die,

168
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,958
or some sort of
survival instinct...?

169
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,041
Really.

170
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,916
Why won't you
just accept your fate?

171
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,375
Where am I?

172
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,875
What's going on?

173
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,250
Your injuries were
substantial and reattaching

174
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,041
your hand was difficult...

175
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,250
I'm sorry but there was no way
you could have regenerated

176
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,458
your other arm
in your condition.

177
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,000
You're Ilena!

178
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,416
Where did you bring me...?

179
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,875
I don't understand...

180
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,416
Why are you doing all this?

181
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,250
No more questions until
you've eaten something...

182
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,541
You've had no food
or water for seven days.

183
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,666
It must be starting
to take its toll.

184
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,666
It's been seven days...?

185
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,000
What the hell
have you done with my sword?

186
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,125
Sit.

187
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,333
I have to get--

188
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,666
If your life really
means that little to you...

189
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,958
I wish I'd never gone
to the trouble of saving you.

190
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,666
Now listen to me carefully,
the Claymore who was chasing you

191
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,000
is still alive.

192
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,666
She's hurt worse than you
were when I found you,

193
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,750
but she is not dead.

194
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,916
Then there's your arm.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,375
Are you listening...?

196
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,791
Your weaker hand has become
your only hand, and if you

197
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,083
want to defend yourself you
must study how to use it.

198
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,375
As you are now, I doubt that
you could even slay a human.

199
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,125
You cannot change things...

200
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,958
So accept them.

201
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,833
Dammit!

202
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,416
Dammit...!

203
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
Dammit!

204
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,166
That little girl
is all grown up.

205
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,583
Did you finish your food?

206
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,166
Yes...

207
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,208
I really had no idea how hungry
I was until I started eating.

208
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,333
Everything was wonderful...

209
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,583
I appreciate it.

210
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,625
You knew my name
as soon as you saw me...

211
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,250
What else do you know?

212
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,041
I know everything...

213
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,833
everything that had
to do with Teresa.

214
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,958
And that would include
Priscilla, am I right?

215
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,375
Yes.

216
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,458
In your time...

217
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,375
a young Priscilla rose
quickly to Number Two.

218
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,125
But she drew too deeply
on her Yoki and awakened

219
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,708
during the mission...

220
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,541
She killed Teresa,
as well as the other enforcers,

221
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,916
and vanished.

222
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,416
I never thought that
Priscilla might have left

223
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,041
any one of you alive.

224
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,666
I was surprised, as well.

225
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,791
Who would have guessed
that scared little girl

226
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,541
would become a warrior?

227
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,833
Whose blood do you
have inside you...?

228
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,625
Teresa's?

229
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,208
You were lucky
to escape with your life...

230
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,416
It was your last chance
to live as a human,

231
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,583
to forget about all of this...

232
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,208
Now you're looking
for Pricilla, aren't you?

233
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,916
Thank you for caring for me...

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,208
Now give me my sword,
and I'll be going.

235
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,250
Forget about vengeance, girl...

236
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,416
Priscilla is more powerful
than any opponent

237
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,083
you have ever encountered...

238
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,458
No living warrior could
ever hope to challenge her.

239
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,500
You're at a greater disadvantage
than those who are half-Yoma...

240
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,208
If you do have Teresa's blood...

241
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,708
You're a quarter...

242
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,958
You are inferior
to her in every way.

243
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,333
If you're finished,
I would like my sword back.

244
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,583
Look at me.

245
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,708
I was a higher rank than you
the time that I tried to defeat

246
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,458
Priscilla and look
what she left me with.

247
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,666
In that fight...

248
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,708
I realized no matter
how we struggled,

249
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,625
Priscilla had awakened
with such power we could

250
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,833
never bring her down.

251
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,666
I ran.

252
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,541
I let everyone
believe I was dead,

253
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,291
and chose a home far from
the Organization...

254
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,833
I have lived here, suppressing
my Yoki aura, ever since.

255
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,000
I've hidden it for so
many years I doubt any

256
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,958
of our comrades
could detect it now.

257
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,833
You've given up fighting?

258
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,041
Why?

259
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,875
Your swordsmanship
is still superb,

260
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,166
even if you do
only have one arm.

261
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,458
I suppose...

262
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,875
I'm afraid.

263
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,083
I have never escaped
the terror I felt that day...

264
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,000
You were there-
you should know.

265
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,000
I was there...

266
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,541
I do know.

267
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,291
Wait.

268
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,375
What is driving you?

269
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,750
Teresa is a part of me...

270
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,125
And not just the
blood flowing in my veins.

271
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,375
I once lost a family,
my ability to speak...

272
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,208
Even the will to live...

273
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,666
Teresa gave those
things back to me.

274
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,916
Everything I've ever
known came from Teresa,

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,916
and what she sacrificed.

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,416
She gave her life so that I
could have the opportunity

277
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
to live a normal,
human existence.

278
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,500
But I wasn't strong enough- I
couldn't just forget everything

279
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,666
that had happened that day
and live the life Teresa

280
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,583
wanted for me to live.

281
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,958
I understand...

282
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,500
And I offer you my help.

283
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,500
If you must go after Priscilla,
your willingness to fight her

284
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,875
is the only thing that will
qualify you to do so.

285
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,291
Now...

286
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,041
You face a
difficult decision...

287
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,291
Seek your revenge or survive.

288
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,500
Forgive me, but I don't believe
I ever asked you your name.

289
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
My name is Clare.

290
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,625
Very well, then, Clare.

291
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,916
Your instruction in the Quick
Sword will begin in the morning.

292
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,458
It hurts...

293
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,875
Oh god...

294
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,875
Brother, where are you?

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,583
Help me, brother...!

296
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,541
Please, I need you...!

297
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,416
You said you'd protect me.

298
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,291
Well, I need you
here with me now!

299
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,583
Where are you...?

300
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,458
Why did you leave me?

301
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,791
You promised.

302
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,000
You promised me.

303
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,333
That bitch!

304
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,375
She won't get away with this!

305
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:41,916
Brother?

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,916
What brother?

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,333
Who the hell am I
talking about?

308
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,291
Like I care about some weakling
human who let himself

309
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,583
get killed with
a fucking smile on his face!

310
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,291
Like I give a damn about that
lousy, worthless son of a bitch!

311
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,250
Fuck you...

312
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,750
Fuck you...

313
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,750
Fuck you!

314
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,875
Fuck you!

315
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,250
That's enough for today.

316
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,541
Stop.

317
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
The key to mastering the
Quick-Sword is isolating

318
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,291
your Yoma power
in just one arm...

319
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,208
You must allow your entire
arm to become awakened.

320
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,166
It requires nothing
less than an iron will.

321
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,208
And it will take
a strong mind...

322
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,291
The amount of concentration
needed to control

323
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,958
an awakened arm is tremendous.

324
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,125
Is that so?

325
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,458
Then how come you
haven't broken a sweat

326
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,458
the whole time
we've been training?

327
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,916
So are you giving up...?

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,666
Have you had all you can take?

329
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,708
Not a chance.

330
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,500
We just started...

331
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,166
I'm ready.

332
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,458
Let's go.

333
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,041
Then get back on your feet...

334
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,500
Only in battle can you discover
your limits, and you must learn

335
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,958
how much power to
release into your arm.

336
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,500
How interesting.

337
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,458
I can't put my finger on it...

338
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,250
But I feel better than
I have in a long time...

339
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:23,833
I can barely even remember
why I was so upset...

340
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,166
And I'm hungry...

341
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,541
Odd...

342
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,625
I'm never hungry...

343
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,708
But somehow...

344
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,791
I'm in the mood for innards.

345
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,250
It was proof...

346
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,250
Proof that once,
she had been alive...

347
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,250
A testament to her existence.

348
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,416
Next time...

349
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,125
"To Be Qualified to Fight."
