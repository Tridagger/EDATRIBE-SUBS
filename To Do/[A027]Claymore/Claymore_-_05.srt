1
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,208
Impossible!

2
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,666
The Yoma didn't stand
a chance against her.

3
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,625
So that's a Claymore.

4
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:55,625
Um...

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,875
Excuse me.

6
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,916
Thank you for all
that you've done for us...

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,291
We have your fee here-

8
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,125
Keep it.

9
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,708
Keep it?

10
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,083
A stranger in black will
arrive soon after I am gone...

11
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,125
Give it to him then.

12
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,291
Our town sees strange
travelers every day

13
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,833
If we were to accidentally give
your fee to the wrong person,

14
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,291
then how would you know?

15
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,833
I wouldn't...

16
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:20,416
But if my associate does not
receive the fee, then know this.

17
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,750
From then on, no matter how many
Yoma plague your village...

18
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,875
or how desperately
you beg for aid...

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,375
we will not respond.

20
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,583
Once there was a small village
that had failed to pay...

21
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,416
They were wiped out by a horde
of Yoma in less than a month.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,083
You hear stories
like that all the time.

23
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,083
W-we'll pay, Claymore...!

24
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,416
We'll pay, I swear it!

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,416
Good.

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,416
Then your town should
have nothing to fear.

27
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,875
The way you make it sound...

28
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,666
one might think
the Yoma do our bidding.

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,041
Do you have my assignment...

30
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,416
Orsay?

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,958
The town of Theo
is two days to the west...

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,000
They are expecting you.

33
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,791
And anything else?

34
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,750
You want to know?

35
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,541
No...

36
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,833
I don't.

37
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,916
You have all the information
that is necessary

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,416
to complete your task.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,666
Find the Yoma...

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,625
Kill them...

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,541
That is all.

42
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,458
Of course...

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,000
sir.

44
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,166
A mixed-breed soldier created
by the Organization...

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,333
Teresa.

46
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,291
The 182nd warrior
of the 77th class.

47
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,833
She slays every Yoma
without ever giving way

48
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,750
to the inhuman
half of her mind.

49
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,250
The twisted Yoma features
never touch her face...

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,958
With unsettling ease,
she destroys her enemies...

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:54,125
And always with
a faint smile on her lips.

52
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,375
And so she is known as
'Teresa of the Faint Smile.'

53
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,666
The most powerful woman
in the Claymore ranks.

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,041
No, not the
most powerful woman...

55
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,750
The most powerful monster.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,208
But the more you purchase,
the cheaper it gets.

57
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,833
A Claymore!

58
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,833
First one down.

59
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,500
Why the hell are
you doing this?!

60
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
You're out of your mind!

61
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,416
That's two.

62
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,250
Run!

63
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,291
The silver-eyed witch
has gone mad!

64
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,125
Found the third.

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,916
She- she's crazy!

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,250
That makes four.

67
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,208
There you are...

68
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,708
Of course, a wiser Yoma would
have shed his human disguise

69
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,875
much sooner and prepared
to face me in combat...

70
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,416
Even so...

71
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,166
Resist all you like, but it will
not save you from your destiny.

72
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,041
The- the bodies!

73
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,208
They're all...

74
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,250
They're Yoma!

75
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,250
You've all been so blind.

76
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,125
Groups of Yoma living
among your village,

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,291
feeding whenever it suits them.

78
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,791
Now, then...

79
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,666
I felt the presence
of seven Yoma

80
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,500
as I approached your town...

81
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,083
Let's see how many
I've already met.

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,291
One...

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,791
Two...

84
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,166
Three...

85
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,666
Four...

86
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,291
Five...

87
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,583
Six.

88
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,458
Ah...

89
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,375
How careless of me.

90
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
I've missed one.

91
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,958
I can sense you...

92
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,375
You are here...

93
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,083
Show me where...

94
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,541
Oh, I see...

95
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,666
Did you think a little girl
could hide you from me?

96
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,958
So naïve.

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,791
I'll never sleep
lying on this thing.

98
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,625
It's hard to believe that this
is more relaxing than a bed.

99
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,375
Lady Teresa!

100
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,541
We would...

101
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
like to offer you your
payment as well as

102
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,375
our gratitude
for all of your help.

103
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,166
A stranger in black
will come for my fee.

104
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,625
You will give the
entire sum to him.

105
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,541
Hey!

106
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,916
That girl...

107
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,625
Who is this child...?

108
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,166
This girl belonged to the
final Yoma I destroyed,

109
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,958
didn't she?

110
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,666
Trying to exact revenge
for your father's death?

111
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,791
No...

112
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,250
She...

113
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,166
She doesn't seem to belong
to any of the townspeople...

114
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,458
And I don't think she belonged
to the Yoma that you killed,

115
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,083
either, although she
was traveling with it.

116
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,708
I don't understand.

117
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,416
Well, she hasn't spoken
to anyone since she arrived.

118
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,041
But I believe that somehow she
knew that the man you killed

119
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,000
was a Yoma, and that
it was keeping her

120
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,166
as some sort of hostage,
traveling with her from

121
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,625
village to village until they
finally arrived here in Theo.

122
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,250
If the girl has
never spoken before,

123
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,333
how can you know all of that?

124
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,666
Well...

125
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,666
Her entire body is covered
in scars and gashes-

126
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,333
mostly likely from her
travels with that Yoma.

127
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:50,500
Ah, so she has spent time
as a Yoma's plaything.

128
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,291
So you must think I'm some kind
of savior, then, don't you?

129
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,875
Don't misunderstand...

130
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,416
I did not kill your Yoma
to save you or anyone else...

131
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,333
I kill Yoma because it is
my job and my purpose...

132
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,500
It's not to save human life.

133
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,208
Now what are you doing?

134
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,666
I have not have
made myself clear...

135
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
The job that I did today does
not make me your savior

136
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,750
or your friend.

137
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,625
What's wrong with her?

138
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Is she not right in the head?

139
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,458
I don't know...

140
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,416
I think we all assumed that
her strange behavior was

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
a result of being a
Yoma's captive for such

142
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,958
a long period of time.

143
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,833
But I just can't say.

144
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,375
Stop.

145
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,000
Take one more step toward me,
and you will wish you had not.

146
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,375
Surely, you aren't
deaf as well as mute.

147
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,291
She's going to
get herself killed.

148
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,791
Someone should do something.

149
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,708
If you mean interfere with
a Claymore, then you're nuts.

150
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,875
With that Yoma of hers gone,
no one's going to take care

151
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,041
of that kid now.

152
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,125
She might even be
a Yoma herself.

153
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,958
If the witch doesn't kick her
to death, someone else might.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,541
Perhaps next time
you'll listen...

155
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,166
My assignment was to
destroy only six Yoma,

156
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
but consider the
seventh a parting gift.

157
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,000
Huh?

158
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,375
Oh...

159
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,375
Be glad...

160
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,708
You've all been
quite fortunate.

161
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,291
I commend you for
keeping up with me

162
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,500
for as long as you have...

163
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,500
But I can't have you
following me any more.

164
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,125
I've already told you once.

165
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,416
I didn't kill those
Yoma to rescue you.

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,458
I did it because
it is simply my duty.

167
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,916
I tolerated you in the village,
but you've begun to annoy me.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,583
So if you wish, I can help
you join your precious Yoma.

169
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,791
A Yoma!

170
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,833
Why didn't I sense
their presence earlier?

171
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,541
Humans?!

172
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,583
Don't you dare touch her...

173
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,375
Claymore...

174
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,333
A silver-eyed witch!

175
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,666
Bandits, is it?

176
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,458
You'll find that I have no
possessions worth stealing...

177
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,375
Now you should attend
to this man's injury...

178
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,208
He has very
little time left to live.

179
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,916
His death would create a real
problem for you, am I right?

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,666
Imagine my surprise at finding a
Claymore so deep in my forest.

181
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,083
And such an
attractive one, at that.

182
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,333
Boss, this is a silver-eyed
witch that we're dealing with.

183
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,708
You had better
watch your step...

184
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,916
I'm not concerned...

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,666
This witch will
do no more harm...

186
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,708
You'll see.

187
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,041
Huh?

188
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,625
All Claymores are forbidden
from killing humans,

189
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,875
accidentally or otherwise.

190
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,750
So don't mistake her
concern for our friend.

191
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,791
She is simply afraid of
being punished for breaking

192
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,083
their most important law.

193
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,333
For such a crime,
she would be beheaded

194
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,708
by one of her fellow witches.

195
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,666
Very little separates these
mixed-breeds from the Yoma.

196
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,166
It benefits them to appear to
have respect for human life.

197
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,708
Without it, who's to say that
they're on our side at all?

198
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,541
Oh, really?

199
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
Well...

200
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,583
why should we be afraid of
a such pretty little thing?

201
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,791
If she were to
attack any of us,

202
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,125
she'd be signing
her own death warrant.

203
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,000
And with a body like that...

204
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,000
Sure would be a
shame to waste it...

205
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,875
Is that all you wanted...?

206
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,833
You should have
asked sooner...

207
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,708
we could have avoided
the loss of limbs.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,791
Now will likely be your
only chance to possess

209
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:07,375
the body of a Claymore.

210
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,000
If it pleases you,
I will travel with your party

211
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,458
until each and every one
of you is satisfied...

212
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,416
Any takers?

213
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,125
I think I'll...

214
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,458
pass.

215
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,041
Damn...

216
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,416
Let's go...

217
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,916
Get Lig back on his feet
and we'll move out.

218
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,250
Come on, now.

219
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,958
You won't get away
with this, Claymore.

220
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,791
I'd run if I were you...

221
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,500
Now go.

222
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,125
For once, you should find a
guardian that isn't a monster.

223
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,958
Don't let me catch you
following me again.

224
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,083
I admire your determination.

225
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,750
But, even so...

226
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,833
Everyone has their limits.

227
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,541
Time to find someone else
to bother, child...

228
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,375
This is goodbye.

229
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,750
I didn't intend to
leave you unconscious

230
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,125
in a strange place...

231
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,000
But you have left me
with very little choice.

232
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,083
What a foolish little human...

233
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,500
If the child dies,
those bandits could easily

234
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,041
trace her back to me.

235
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,666
And I would have
to accept the blame.

236
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,916
Damn...

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,458
Even when asleep
the child's a nuisance.

238
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,416
You're lucky to be alive.

239
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,458
The water seems
clean enough for drinking.

240
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,750
Dehydration was as much
the reason for your collapse

241
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,708
as your little
tumble back there.

242
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,125
You're starting
to smell like a corpse...

243
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,250
The scent of Yoma blood
is thick on your body.

244
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,875
It's been making me gag ever
since we left the village.

245
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,125
So scrub your skin
and clothes clean.

246
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,958
I want you smelling like
a flower when you're done.

247
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,625
Look at that...

248
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,750
The villagers were so afraid of
the Yoma that they wouldn't

249
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,416
even wash the poor girl it had
been holding as its captive...

250
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,875
They even feared
the cuts the Yoma left...

251
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,083
And now she will carry the scars
for the rest of her life...

252
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,000
Small reminders of
where trust can lead you.

253
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,000
There's food, as well...

254
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,333
When you're finished,
you can have some of it.

255
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,875
This must be what
owning a pet feels like.

256
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,541
What?

257
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,125
What do you want?

258
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,333
This food is all for you...

259
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,958
I rarely eat that much...

260
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,375
So go ahead.

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,291
Don't worry...

262
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,875
I would never allow myself to go
hungry, just for your benefit.

263
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,333
Well...

264
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,708
I suppose I could
do worse for a pet.

265
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,708
Here's the plan...

266
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,958
I can take you with me
as far as the next village.

267
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,625
It's clear that you
would die on your own,

268
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,291
and I cannot be held
responsible for that.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
Now get some rest
for the journey tomorrow...

270
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,958
We've got quite
a long hike ahead of us.

271
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,958
You can relax.

272
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,083
I promise not to leave you
while you're sleeping.

273
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,916
I caught a little something
for your breakfast...

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,333
Hungry?

275
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,125
I forgot how much of
a pain being human could be.

276
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,416
Having to eat two or three
times every single day

277
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,041
just to function.

278
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
What's this...?

279
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,750
Stop that.

280
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,458
Silly girl.

281
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,041
Didn't you hear me say
that I wouldn't leave you

282
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,583
while you were sleeping?

283
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm always truthful because I
have no need for deception...

284
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,875
So you can trust me
to speak honestly with you.

285
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
Got that?

286
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,041
Why did that laugh
come out of my mouth?

287
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,083
Watch your step.

288
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,708
You'll get yourself killed.

289
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,291
This girl sleeps like the dead.

290
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,000
Not surprising...

291
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,458
The pace we've been keeping is
hardly fit for a small child.

292
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,541
A very unusual girl...

293
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,875
And what remarkable
endurance for one so young.

294
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,458
What is it that
drives her to follow me

295
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,166
with such
stubbornness and resolve?

296
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,916
She could certainly have chosen
a more suitable companion...

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,375
Following me will
only bring her grief.

298
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,333
You have chosen poorly, child...

299
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:56,083
A human would have provided
you with a proper bed, at least.

300
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,958
I can give you
nothing that you need.

301
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,541
But if I am all you have,
then I have to try.

302
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,333
Girl.

303
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,833
It's time to go.

304
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,375
Are you ready?

305
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,083
I can't keep
calling you 'girl...

306
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,750
If you could only speak,
then you could tell me

307
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,750
what your real name is.

308
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,583
Don't strain yourself...

309
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,750
You aren't able speak and
I doubt you know how to write.

310
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,958
So I'll have to come up
with something myself.

311
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,166
Let's see...

312
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,375
I know what your new name is...

313
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,125
-its Clare.

314
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
How does that sound?

315
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,041
What?

316
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,333
Are you telling me
that Clare is your name?

317
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,541
It is?

318
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,541
Then it's settled.

319
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,083
From now on, you're Clare.

320
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,416
Clare was one of
the twin goddesses.

321
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,000
She was beautiful,
virtuous, and good.

322
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,708
And her goddess-twin
was named Teresa.

323
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,958
Just like me.

324
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,958
Your parents probably
wanted you to grow up

325
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,833
with the goddess' traits.

326
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,583
I'm sure they
loved you very much.

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,166
Don't cry.

328
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,166
Although your parents
are no longer with you,

329
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,583
it doesn't mean their wishes
for you have to die as well.

330
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,375
Now let's move.

331
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,041
Clare.

332
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,583
A woman with a lonely heart...

333
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,250
And a girl with
nowhere to turn...

334
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,083
Two souls become one...

335
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,541
Next time, "Teresa and Clare."
