1
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,708
So you've been unsuccessful in
contacting Number Forty-Seven,

2
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,291
is that correct?

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,916
How long has
this been going on?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,250
Three months, ever since
the Awakened Being

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,250
hunt began in Gonahl.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,625
That was the mission that
included Number Four, right...?

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,666
So I assume you've
entertained the possibility

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,166
that she is deceased.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,000
I wouldn't dream
of it until a body's found.

10
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,833
The body of
Number Four, Ophelia,

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,250
was discovered recently
as an Awakened Being...

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,833
Is there any chance it was by
Number Forty-Seven's doing?

13
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,333
Considering the vast
difference in their abilities,

14
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,041
I'd say the chances are slim.

15
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,583
I guess that's one way
of looking at it...

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,250
However I believe
Number Forty-Seven

17
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,166
is much more powerful than we
imagined and when you consider

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,166
the fact that she
is using Teresa's blood,

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,375
it should come as no surprise.

20
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,500
We handed over the
flesh and blood of one of

21
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,875
the most successful
half-breeds to date...

22
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:13,083
The only reason to do that is to
build a more powerful warrior.

23
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,458
However...

24
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,958
I understood the experiment
was a disappointment.

25
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,083
If you look at their rankings
it was a disaster...

26
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,875
but there are some
unanswered questions

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,875
about Number Forty-seven
that we still haven't

28
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,125
taken into account.

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,000
Either way, til we
determine her status

30
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,125
we can't let this
issue escape our focus.

31
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,291
If she is alive then it
is only a matter of time

32
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,041
until we find her.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,750
Ermita.

34
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,375
Yes.

35
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,000
Due to the importance and high
priority of this mission,

36
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,208
I would like for you
to take command...

37
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,166
This supercedes
all other business.

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,875
Understood.

39
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,833
Ermita's involvement means
it must be her turn...

40
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,958
Your fate is
as good as sealed...

41
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,958
Clare.

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,250
Excuse me, sir.

43
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,583
Yes?

44
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,291
I'm looking for my brother...

45
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,625
Have you seen a boy come
through here wearing a sword

46
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,250
on his back in
the last few days?

47
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:36,750
No.

48
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,708
I'm sorry...

49
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,375
Yeah...

50
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,708
We haven't seen him.

51
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,958
Is that right?

52
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,250
Look uh...

53
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,541
you may want to check out
the city of Hamel...

54
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,208
It's a big market town
just up the road.

55
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,458
You'll probably have
a much better chance

56
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,166
of finding someone there.

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,791
Thank you.

58
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,291
I will try there.

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,333
No problem.

60
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,166
Good luck.

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,083
I hope you find him, sir.

62
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,208
What is wrong with you?

63
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,125
That was so rude!

64
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,041
You just called
that woman sir.

65
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:02,750
No way.

66
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,875
That wasn't a woman!

67
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:04,916
What woman do you
know of who carries

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,333
a big sword around with her.

69
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,000
He's got to be a man.

70
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,083
I need to deepen my voice more.

71
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,208
That woman didn't
buy me for a second.

72
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,166
Elongate my vocal chords...

73
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,791
Pardon me...

74
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,458
I'm looking for
my little brother.

75
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,000
So you think your brother may
have passed through here, eh?

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,125
We got separated
a few weeks ago.

77
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,083
Well I hope everything
works out for you...

78
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,166
This city's bigger
than you think...

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,916
Give it time and you'll
find someone who can help.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Thanks.

81
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,875
Raki.

82
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,875
Come in.

83
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,125
Would you like some dinner?

84
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,500
Sure.

85
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,375
You really must care
an awful lot about him.

86
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,375
Oh, I'm talking about
your brother...

87
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,791
You know, nowadays, if a
family member goes missing,

88
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,625
people are content
to assume the worst...

89
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,458
Yet here you are, braving
the country on your own...

90
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:46,000
It's just not what
you expect anymore.

91
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,708
Yes, I find it
a little strange myself.

92
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,875
It's nothing...

93
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:52,833
Well...

94
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,541
make yourself at home.

95
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,208
Oh, I almost forgot.

96
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,666
There's a bit of
a situation in town.

97
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,208
A few days ago a group of
Claymore's came into town

98
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,041
and they've been
here ever since.

99
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,375
Claymores?

100
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,083
The rumor going around is
there's a gigantic Yoma

101
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,833
somewhere up in the
Zakol Mountains,

102
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,500
but that's all I've heard...

103
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,375
I think they've sent in
four Claymores so far.

104
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,083
Four of them...?

105
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,166
An Awakened Being.

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,750
Anyway, hope I
didn't scare you.

107
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,375
I just thought
you'd want to know.

108
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,750
Well thank you.

109
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,875
I never expected
to run into them here.

110
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,958
The pills that suppress
my Yoki aura are both

111
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,583
helping and hurting.

112
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,208
I can't be detected by other
Warriors, but I can also

113
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,875
unknowingly end up in towns
occupied by my comrades.

114
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,125
I can't allow the
Organization to find me now,

115
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,916
not before I'm finished.

116
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,500
There they are...

117
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,291
If they're hunting
for an Awakened Being,

118
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,500
then at least one of them should
be ranked in the single digits.

119
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,791
But which one?

120
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,458
Jean...

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,708
What's the matter?

122
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,458
Nothing...

123
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,833
don't worry...

124
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,541
Just my imagination.

125
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,583
That's her...

126
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,250
She's the one.

127
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,375
You're up early...

128
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,541
Good morning.

129
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,000
And good morning to you...

130
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,083
I'm heading to
the morning market...

131
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,333
I'm hoping someone
there has seen my brother.

132
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,958
Well good luck to you.

133
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,541
Oh, and about the Claymores
I mentioned yesterday...

134
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,666
It seems they left
sometime last night.

135
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,875
If you ask me, it's a relief
they're gone, though...

136
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,083
Sure they may be fighting
on the side of humans,

137
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,708
but it doesn't change
the fact they're half Yoma...

138
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,625
If it is an Awakened Being
hunt, no matter how skilled

139
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,375
the warriors are, it will take
at least a day to kill it.

140
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,333
Not having to deal with them
will save me a lot of trouble.

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,500
A boy carrying a sword?

142
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,083
No. I'm afraid I haven't.

143
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,333
Thank you.

144
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,458
No one knows anything...

145
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,583
Raki, where the hell are you?

146
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,958
Brother, look, here it is!

147
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,250
I told you!

148
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,958
It's the statue
of Teresa and Clare...

149
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,375
Isn't it pretty?

150
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,291
The statue of Teresa and Clare?

151
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,000
Clare was one of
the twin goddesses.

152
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,708
She was beautiful,
virtuous, and good...

153
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,458
Your parents probably
wanted you to grow up

154
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,541
with the goddess' traits.

155
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,291
See, that one on
the end is Clare,

156
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,000
and the other one's Teresa.

157
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,541
Stop acting like you
know everything.

158
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,333
I'm the one who told you that.

159
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,583
No you didn't!

160
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,083
I did so!

161
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,708
And then the other day you told
that stranger all about it

162
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,541
like you sculpted it yourself.

163
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,083
That isn't true
and you know it.

164
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,375
He kept on asking me
which one is Clare.

165
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,125
What was I supposed to do,
ignore him?

166
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,416
Show off.

167
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,916
I am not!

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,625
Oh shut up.

169
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,375
Excuse me, Miss.

170
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,375
This stranger you spoke to...

171
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,500
Can you tell me
anything more about him?

172
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,625
Huh...?

173
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,541
It was just some guy.

174
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,541
I dunno.

175
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,333
He sure wasn't
from around here.

176
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
What did he look like...?

177
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,708
Did he wear a sword
on his back?

178
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,166
Yeah...

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,875
I think I remember him
carrying something on his back.

180
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,708
Did he happen
to tell you his name?

181
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,791
No...

182
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,541
But he was all beat up
and injured...

183
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,125
He was creepy looking.

184
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,083
You still talked to him
for like twenty minutes!

185
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,250
Yeah, I know...!

186
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,958
I already explained
that didn't I;

187
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,041
he kept asking me
about this statue...!

188
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,958
When I told him about Clare,
he got a big smile on his face

189
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,041
and actually started
acting kinda normal.

190
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,250
And from that point on,
I wasn't scared of him.

191
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,333
Okay.

192
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,375
Did you see where he went?

193
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,625
Uh uh.

194
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,500
Well, this all happened
about ten days ago,

195
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,000
and we haven't seen
him around since then,

196
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,791
so I'd say he's
probably left town by now.

197
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,250
I see...

198
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,875
Thank you.

199
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,125
So, who is this guy anyway?

200
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,000
Is he a friend of yours
or something?

201
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,333
He is...

202
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,250
more than that.

203
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,875
Look, I know I can't really be
of any use to you...

204
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,000
But that doesn't
change the fact

205
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,875
that I want to be with you...

206
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,458
I don't care when
I die just so long

207
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,791
as we're together until than.

208
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,791
Please, I only wanna
be where you are.

209
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,041
What is he to me...?

210
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,041
Damn it...

211
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,916
I refuse to die...

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,083
If I can survive
a while longer...

213
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,416
I'll see Clare again.

214
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,000
Who the hell is that?

215
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,458
Oh my God!

216
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,833
What should we do?

217
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,083
Someone...

218
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,541
Please help.

219
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,541
Please I'm begging you...

220
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,208
My friends are...

221
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,625
Hang in there...

222
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,750
Hey!

223
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:56,875
Please...

224
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,000
you...

225
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,375
must contact the
Organization for me...

226
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,500
It was too strong and...

227
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,958
Can you tell me
what happened...?

228
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Did an Awakened Being do this?

229
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,833
Are you one of...

230
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,333
are you one of us?

231
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,500
Promise me...

232
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,250
You'll try to save my friends!

233
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,291
They're...

234
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,416
still alive...

235
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,625
They're alive.

236
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,750
There's...

237
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,500
something different
about this one...

238
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,833
The Yoma are plotting something.

239
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,708
Please...

240
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,291
just save them.

241
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,958
Hold on!

242
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,666
Could someone please
take care of her body?

243
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,583
She's gone now,
so you have nothing to fear.

244
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,375
Give her a human burial.

245
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,041
Uh...

246
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,458
Excuse me, Mister.

247
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,125
I hope you don't intend
to go into those mountains

248
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,416
by yourself.

249
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,875
It's suicide!

250
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,208
Raki.

251
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,666
I will find you again someday...

252
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,958
Now...

253
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,041
Time to return to my mission...

254
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,708
killing Yoma.

255
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,500
Alright, Dear...

256
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,666
Almost there...

257
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,875
Let's just try one more.

258
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,083
Number six!

259
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,458
This is unexpected...

260
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,875
I thought for sure she
would have awakened by now.

261
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,458
Why are you so stubborn...?

262
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,583
If you don't awaken soon,
we'll just have to throw

263
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,750
your body with
your friend's over there...

264
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,916
Is that what you want?

265
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,250
Go to hell!

266
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,250
Fight it...!

267
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,666
You can't let them win, Katea!

268
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,250
Oh, this one is
coming along nicely...

269
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,916
Pretty soon the pain
will be all gone.

270
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,875
Don't give in to it!

271
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,333
You don't want to
become a monster, do you?!

272
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
You better watch out who
you're calling monsters

273
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,333
you stupid bitch!

274
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,041
Open that mouth again and I'm
gonna make you hurt even worse.

275
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Hey, now don't get ahead
of yourself, you silly...

276
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,291
Don't you add
another til I say so.

277
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,375
She called us bad names.

278
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,625
Ooh yay!

279
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,333
Katea, no!

280
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,166
Okay ready or not, Dauf.

281
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,125
My god...

282
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,666
What's going on?

283
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,458
So, Dauf what do you think?

284
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,541
This one no good...

285
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,750
is not strong enough.

286
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,750
Disappointing...

287
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,833
But I guess that's to be
expected from a Claymore

288
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,875
that's ranked
in the thirties...

289
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,833
Go ahead and dispose of her.

290
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,541
Don't do it!!!

291
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,458
How could you.

292
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,375
Well it looks like
we'll need to find someone

293
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,208
in the single digits
to have any success.

294
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,083
You better hurry up
and awaken, Jean.

295
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,958
At number nine you might be
the best hope we have.

296
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,541
Fuck you!

297
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,375
Hey you.

298
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,291
Hold on a minute.

299
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,333
Are you alone?

300
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,875
If you're thinking about
going up into the mountains

301
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
by yourself you might
want to think again...

302
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,625
There's a nasty horde of Yoma
swarming all over the place.

303
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,000
If you want to get
to the other side,

304
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,000
your best bet is to go around.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,458
You're an interesting group.

306
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,333
Normally you prefer to work
alone, not like a pack of dogs.

307
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,375
That dirty son-of-a-bitch
is a Claymore!

308
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,083
It worked!

309
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,625
If we attack the feet
and chest at the same time,

310
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,916
you Claymores always jump
you're all so predictable!

311
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,291
You're extremely knowledgeable
of how we like to operate...

312
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,208
And your attacks are
very well coordinated,

313
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,125
which is not normal...

314
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,708
How did you get this way?

315
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,125
You'll find out more than
you bargained for soon enough.

316
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,041
Somebody's outside.

317
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,708
Oh I think you're right...

318
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,458
But it's too soon for
the one who escaped

319
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,708
to have found help...

320
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,583
I...

321
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,166
am sensing a faint Yoki aura.

322
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,875
Whoever it is she's
a very low rank...

323
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,500
No point in expecting much out
of her, even if she does awaken.

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,416
I'll just give her to you...

325
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,875
You can do what
you want with her.

326
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,458
Really?

327
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,833
You mean it?

328
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,125
Born human, die human...

329
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,500
My truth...

330
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,375
Next time,
The Witch's Maw Part Two.
