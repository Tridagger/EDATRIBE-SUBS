1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,291
She focused her
energy completely

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,875
on trying to defeat me.

3
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,208
She even allowed
her legs to awaken.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,666
She's amazing.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,333
Well...

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,833
I guess that means
you're dead, Rigaldo.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,833
No!

8
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,625
Clare you...

9
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,250
you actually did it!

10
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,666
Amazing.

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,958
I knew she could kill him.

12
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,000
She did it...! Deneve!

13
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,458
Miria...! Clare just
defeated Rigaldo!

14
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,750
You're really something...

15
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,583
Always seem to have
a trick up your sleeve.

16
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,666
You guys...

17
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,875
we are gonna be okay!

18
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,708
Come on, this is no time
to be sleeping!

19
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,416
So'd you hear the good news?

20
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,041
Clare just killed that
son-of-a-bitch lion outside!

21
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,166
--Yes!
--She did it!

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah Clare, I knew
you had it in you!

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,291
So this means it's all over!

24
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,083
Something's wrong.

25
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,083
How in the world did
they manage to defeat

26
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,958
the Silver Eyed Lion
King...? Amazing...

27
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,916
What Priscilla...?
Is everything alright?

28
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,708
Oh children...

29
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,500
such a nuisance.

30
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,125
Clare, stop it...!

31
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,666
That's enough!

32
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,583
I can't...

33
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,083
I can't stop it.

34
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,416
Don't come near me...

35
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,833
I can't control
my own body anymore.

36
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,458
No matter how hard I try,
it just won't let me...

37
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,750
take it back.

38
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,416
Just hang on!

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,208
Helen...

40
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,916
I need you to do me...

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
a favor.

42
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,958
Please, Helen, you have to
behead me, before it's too late.

43
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,041
My body has awakened too far...

44
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,083
There's nothing
I can do about it...

45
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,708
I can't revert...

46
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,583
Please...

47
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,916
Give me an honorable death.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,416
Wait...

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,750
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

50
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,625
There's nothing
to think about.

51
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,125
Just do it.

52
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,958
With what little strength I have
left, I will hold my sword

53
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,875
still so you can
finish the job unharmed...

54
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,291
Please Helen.

55
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,125
Clare, listen...

56
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm sorry...

57
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,250
that you have to be
the one to end it.

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,833
This is bullshit...! You
can't expect me to do this

59
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,500
when we don't even know
if you'll fully awaken!

60
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,666
Do it now...

61
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,916
I'm almost out of time.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,708
God damn it...!
Don't give up yet!

63
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,291
You still have time to revert!

64
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,416
I know my body
better than you...

65
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,750
You have to believe me.

66
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,250
There's no time
for me to revert back!

67
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,083
Fight it.

68
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,291
Brother...

69
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,708
Daddy?!

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,541
Don't be so naïve!

71
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,958
If it weren't
for our assistance,

72
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,625
your head would no longer
be attached to your body.

73
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,916
Now Priscilla,
focus all of your power...

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,625
and take the life of
this murderous Claymore.

75
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:37,500
Teresa...? Who is Teresa?

76
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,666
Now then...

77
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,000
Daddy was always
so kind to me...

78
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:03,583
I loved him so much...

79
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,958
And he ate them.

80
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,166
He made me watch it...

81
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,208
He ate their innards...

82
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,875
right in front of me!

83
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,625
That's when I had
to kill my daddy...

84
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,125
While he was
eating my big sister...

85
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,291
I chopped off his head!

86
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,375
He made me do it!

87
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,041
I can't go back...

88
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,625
Help me please...

89
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,375
You have to...

90
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,416
I don't...

91
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,708
About the best
I can give you...

92
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,416
is a swift beheading...

93
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,833
before you are completely
taken over by your Yoma side.

94
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,125
That can't be...

95
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,958
That can't be me!

96
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,541
Is that it...? All that
fuss--there was no reason

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,208
for me to hold back.

98
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,750
And I never realized...

99
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,583
it would feel this good.

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,416
I just...

101
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,416
wanted...

102
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,208
to save my sister...

103
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,375
and to...

104
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,333
avenge my daddy!

105
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,250
No!

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,166
Now I see...

107
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,250
It's her...

108
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,666
It's all because of her.

109
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,500
God no...

110
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,083
Please, hurry up Helen...

111
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,500
Can't you see I'm
running out of time?

112
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,125
I need you to behead me while
I still have my human mind!

113
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Raki...

114
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry I can't
keep my promise...

115
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,250
Of all the people in the world,
I wish I could have seen you

116
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,250
one more time before my death.

117
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,041
Clare...

118
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
Fight it...

119
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,583
God dammit Clare...

120
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,416
I can't believe you're making
me do this...! No matter what,

121
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,875
I'm gonna hold this against
you for the rest of my life!

122
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,583
I'm sorry...

123
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,333
Helen.

124
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,000
Helen...

125
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,750
don't listen to her!

126
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,500
Shit!

127
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,083
What is that?!

128
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,583
What...

129
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,375
what's happening?

130
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,208
It can't be!

131
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,833
How is it possible
that you're still alive?

132
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,666
I have a firm memory
of killing you before...

133
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,625
of seeing your head
fly through the air.

134
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,166
Forgiveness is out
of the question...

135
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,166
Not after you defied
the Organization...

136
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,208
And most definitely
not after the hell

137
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,666
you have put me through.

138
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,708
There's no mistaking...

139
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,291
It's her!

140
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,541
That is why I have no choice
but to take your life again...

141
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,708
just as I did before.

142
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,125
You...

143
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,125
you killed Teresa...

144
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,583
I will never forgive you!

145
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,208
Clare, don't go!

146
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,041
Where are you off to?

147
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,750
What the hell
are you doing here?

148
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,666
Due to circumstances...

149
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,583
We are a bit
shorthanded as of now...

150
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,083
The expeditionary force
is in a bind...

151
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,166
Head to the
northern lands at once.

152
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,125
However I want no
intervention on your part.

153
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,916
Reconnaissance only.

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If you get involved it will be
seen as an act of betrayal

155
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,708
to the Organization.

156
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,583
It appears as if she
has become awakened...

157
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,416
I assume you know who it is
I am referring to?

158
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,875
Your talents have
never gone unnoticed...

159
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,041
for only you could
know that, Galataea.

160
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,583
Priscilla...

161
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,375
Looks like your
memory has returned...

162
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,875
Today is shaping up
to be monumental...

163
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,666
how fantastic.

164
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,000
You have served me
well my friend...

165
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,625
you may go now.

166
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,375
Save your energy for battle...

167
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,833
I'm having too much fun watching
to join the action just yet.

168
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,916
There's no need for us to put
our lives on the line.

169
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,791
We can enjoy the fireworks
from here a little longer...

170
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,583
I've left the care of our
injured Warriors in the hands

171
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,708
of Cynthia and Tabitha.

172
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,916
What about Clare?

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We'll have to try and
follow her Yoki aura...

174
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,833
It may not be
the best approach...

175
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,000
But at this point...

176
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,958
it's all we can do.

177
00:14:56,041 --> 00:15:00,416
Do you really think we have a
chance of catching up to her?

178
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,291
Helen how would you feel if I
told you it was impossible?

179
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,666
I don't care...!

180
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,416
She's our comrade, we can't
just forget about her!

181
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,666
Well it looks like there's
someone else in our group

182
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,666
that agrees
with your sentiment.

183
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,666
I've always been told...

184
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,708
a friend's sword can
act as a grave marker

185
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,000
when the deceased's
is unavailable.

186
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,416
Captain Undine...

187
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,125
Forgive me...

188
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,333
But I have a better use
for your sword.

189
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,750
That's yours, isn't it?

190
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,833
Time to move, Helen.

191
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,375
Right, coming...

192
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't try to follow us again.

193
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,125
Are you sure we're
going the right way?

194
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,166
I think...

195
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,000
It feels right.

196
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,750
Damn...

197
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,708
Where are you Clare?

198
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,083
Her Yoki aura almost
feels like its pulsing.

199
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,791
Is it the snowstorm?

200
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,625
Or has Clare awakened...

201
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,833
Look...! Who is that?

202
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,541
It's number three...

203
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
Galatea!

204
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,041
I mean no offense, but I think
you three have bitten off

205
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,583
more than you can chew.

206
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,041
So have you come to spy on us?

207
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,041
Perhaps.

208
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,541
Is that a problem?

209
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry Galatea but
we're looking for Clare...

210
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,000
we'll fight through you
if we have to.

211
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,000
My...

212
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,375
I can understand one of
you having a death wish,

213
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,916
but all three?

214
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,166
Use your time wisely.

215
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:27,125
She is at a level where
defeat will not come easily.

216
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,708
Sure she's there?

217
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,791
We don't have time
to be wrong, Galatea.

218
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,666
Getting an accurate
assessment from a Yoki aura...

219
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,708
is something only I can do...

220
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,916
You should know that...

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,083
Miria.

222
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,416
And Clare...?

223
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,541
Do you think she can
make it out alive?

224
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,291
Who knows...? I'm only
certain it will be tough

225
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,708
no matter what the outcome.

226
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,208
Well who's she
going up against?

227
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,208
Can you at least tell us that?

228
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,041
Her name is Priscilla...

229
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,583
Teresa of the Faint Smile
was number one...

230
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,041
But she was dethroned from
that ranking when Priscilla

231
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,541
sliced off her head.

232
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,375
What...?! I had no idea.

233
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,625
I would hurry...

234
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,916
if you want to
save your friend.

235
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,541
Understood...

236
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,208
Thanks Galatea.

237
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,583
Let's go!

238
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,041
I know you want
to help your friend,

239
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,250
but crying isn't
going to solve anything.

240
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,625
If we don't hurry, Claire
will most certainly die...

241
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:37,000
and that's something
neither of us want.

242
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,125
At the end of the day I...

243
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,875
I was all talk and no action.

244
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,625
She saved my life
so many times...

245
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,041
Took care of me
when I couldn't...

246
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:52,000
but when it came
to helping her, I failed.

247
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,208
Because I was afraid...

248
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:58,125
I was too scared at the thought
of losing my own life...

249
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,041
I just didn't want to die...

250
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,625
I'm such a terrible,
selfish person.

251
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,875
What's wrong with that?

252
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,166
I'm going...

253
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,708
and I don't care what
the consequences may be.

254
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,250
Why are you doing this?

255
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,666
Because I...

256
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,833
I just want to help her.

257
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,250
Okay...

258
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,250
I'm in.

259
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,875
Wait!

260
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,041
Clare...

261
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,583
Don't go getting yourself killed
before we have a chance to help!

262
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,708
I'm excited to see
what you can do...

263
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,375
Priscilla.

264
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,250
You there...

265
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,416
Standing right
in front of me...

266
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,083
I will never forgive you...

267
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,208
Mark my words...

268
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,416
Priscilla!

269
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,458
Living and dying...

270
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,958
It's all in the past...

271
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,000
with a beautiful faint smile.

272
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,708
Next time on Claymore...

273
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,083
For Whose Sake.
