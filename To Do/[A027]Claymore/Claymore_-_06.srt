1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,041
I know what your new name is...

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,833
It's Clare.

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,833
How does that sound?

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,791
Clare was one of
the twin goddesses.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,541
She was beautiful,
virtuous, and good.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,541
Your parents probably
wanted you to grow up

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,250
with the goddess's traits.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,750
Now let's move.

9
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,208
Come over here...

10
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,958
I want you to see this.

11
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,208
That is Rokut.

12
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,583
We'll be there by tomorrow...

13
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,291
That is where we go
our separate ways...

14
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,291
Now don't be like that...

15
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,541
You'll be happier in that town
than you'll ever be with me.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,583
Please don't be worried.

17
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,750
I won't abandon you
right when we get to town...

18
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,125
We'll find someone there
who will look after you...

19
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,166
I won't leave you until
I know that you're safe.

20
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,291
So rest easy.

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,125
So she cried herself to sleep.

22
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,583
What an unusual girl...

23
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,958
All those tears
over leaving me...

24
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,291
I could never be
the family she needs.

25
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm sure that whatever family
she ends up with in Rokut...

26
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,958
will give her a far
better life than I ever could.

27
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,750
She'll be fine...

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,500
She'll finally have
the life she deserves.

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,541
Now then.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,083
So what can I do for you?

31
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,666
I'm...

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm gonna...

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm gonna...

34
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,833
Of course I knew
you were following us...

35
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,208
But if you'd seen to your
injury instead of stalking us

36
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,875
this entire time, your
new stump might not have

37
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,875
gotten so infected.

38
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,666
If you've come to take
your revenge on me,

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,125
I suggest you reconsider...

40
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,583
I am forbidden from killing
humans, but I can think

41
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,166
of several other ways
to get rid of you.

42
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,291
I know that you can't kill me...

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,291
But I didn't
come here for a fight.

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,708
I really came here for this.

45
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,291
I'm glad I found you...

46
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,125
Don't worry, this get
together is gonna be

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,958
painful and bloody...

48
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,875
You'll get no pleasure
from raping me.

49
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,916
You saw my body...

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,875
Do you really think I care?

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,583
This is about your humiliation!

52
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,375
I'll make you live with your
shame like you've forced me

53
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,125
to live with this deformity.

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,666
Go ahead then.

55
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,250
It's humans like this one
that I am sworn to protect...

56
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,166
And die for.

57
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,041
Such a superior little smile you
had when you butchered me...

58
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,250
But I think I know a way to wipe
it off of your pretty mouth!

59
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,375
You're so damn sure
of yourself...

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,541
But I'll teach you how to
feel like the monster you are!

61
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,833
You little brat!

62
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,458
So you wanna fight?

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,333
Now let's say
goodnight, sweetie.

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,375
Huh...?

65
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,083
What do you plan on doing
with my sword Claymore?

66
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,333
You had better be careful.

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,583
This is a deadly game
you're playing...

68
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,041
It wouldn't be wise
to break your own rule...

69
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,625
You'd be
slaughtered for sure...

70
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,875
Then allow me to enlighten you
about the 'rules,' you idiot...

71
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,291
Whether I choose to
follow a rule or break it

72
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,291
is entirely up to me
and no one else.

73
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
I could kill you
where you stand...

74
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,250
then I'd gladly accept the
consequences for my actions...

75
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,875
Or you can
vanish from my sight.

76
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,791
Leave this place...

77
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,541
the stink of your wound
is making me feel sick.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,583
Worthless bandit scum.

79
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,333
Are you all right...?

80
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,875
Come on.

81
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,375
Wait, What's wrong?

82
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,041
Clare?

83
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,166
Doesn't it...

84
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,125
it hurt?

85
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,375
So you can...

86
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,375
You can talk?

87
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,541
It looks...

88
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,750
like it hurts you so much.

89
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,166
I see...

90
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,166
You mean this scar...?

91
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,833
It does look bad...

92
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,666
But it doesn't hurt me
as much as it might seem...

93
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,291
Don't worry about me.

94
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,666
But it does hurt you, Teresa...

95
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,208
I know it does because I see it
on your face all the time...

96
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,375
Even when you're smiling, I can
see it still hurting you inside.

97
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,458
Your eyes...

98
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,541
They look just
like my eyes do...

99
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,750
Like you're scared and
alone and you hurt so much

100
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,958
you can't stand it, but you
don't want anyone to know it...

101
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,125
I know...

102
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,000
That was why...

103
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,375
So I was the one that
she was comforting that day.

104
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,291
She didn't cling to me because
I saved her from that Yoma...

105
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,000
But because she knew that we
shared the same kind of pain.

106
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,208
Everything she had was
taken away from her

107
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,416
and she could sense that I had
suffered in the same way.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,458
She could feel our kinship...

109
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,916
even when I couldn't.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,541
She comforted me in a way
that no one in the village

111
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
would do for her...

112
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,666
She gave me what she wanted
so badly for herself...

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,375
Understanding...

114
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,625
And unconditional love.

115
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:23,541
The same love that Clare
has never known for herself.

116
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,916
I kicked this tiny
girl over and over...

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,375
When all she wanted
was to be held.

118
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,875
She taught me something
I thought I'd never learn...

119
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:40,000
That even silver eyes like
these can still shed tears.

120
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,416
It looks good on you.

121
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,291
It's all yours.

122
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,041
But it's too-

123
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,666
If you are concerned
about the expense, don't be...

124
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,500
I have too much money
and its rarely spent

125
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,875
on anything worthwhile.

126
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,291
Now then...

127
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,791
Let's go.

128
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,458
Incredible!

129
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,375
That Yoma didn't
even stand a chance!

130
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,666
So that must be a Claymore.

131
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,666
Our village is in your debt.

132
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,458
I wouldn't ever have imagined
that you would rid us of

133
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,583
that monster so quickly.

134
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,916
It's my job...

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,541
Save your gratitude.

136
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,791
Rokut is so secluded by the
mountains that we were sure

137
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,208
no one would come out
here to help us...

138
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,375
So...

139
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,583
Please accept this
payment and our thanks

140
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,791
for all of your assistance.

141
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,041
A man dressed in black will
come to retrieve my fee

142
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,708
when I'm gone...

143
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,250
I'm not allowed to accept
the money on my own.

144
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
Oh- Whatever you say.

145
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,750
Teresa.

146
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,250
I have a favor to ask you.

147
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,250
This child...

148
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,250
Give her a home in your town.

149
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,000
But...

150
00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,875
who is she.

151
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,416
Why is she traveling with you?

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,875
Theo was were
I first encountered her...

153
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,625
And she's not a Yoma,
I assure you...

154
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,000
Her parents are both dead and
she has no other family ties.

155
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,583
I hope you'll grant my request
and give this child a home.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,208
Well I'm sure we could find
someone who would be willing

157
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,875
to take her in, after all it's
the least we could do for you.

158
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,083
You are very generous indeed...

159
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,625
thank you.

160
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,500
What's this?

161
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,958
I don't-

162
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,458
I don't need any of this.

163
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,833
I don't want clothes or shoes...

164
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,375
I only want to stay with you.

165
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,875
Let me come with you, Teresa...

166
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,125
Oh, please...

167
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,833
Don't go away and
leave me all alone again!

168
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,958
I want to stay
with you forever!

169
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,458
Just please don't
leave me here please.

170
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,791
But Clare...

171
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,250
You know what my duty is and
why it's far too dangerous

172
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,583
for you to come...

173
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,916
This is the life I lead,
and I can't be responsible

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,708
for a young girl...

175
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,416
Why not?

176
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,583
You'd find yourself
in harm's way...

177
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,583
I don't ever want to put
your life in danger...

178
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,500
Please understand...

179
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,333
You and I live
in very different worlds.

180
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,458
Stay here and
live a human life.

181
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,125
I'm glad we met...

182
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,500
I won't ever forget about you.

183
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,083
No...

184
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,208
Don't go...

185
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,208
Please...

186
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,083
no!

187
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,750
Listen, these people can
give you a good life,...

188
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,541
just go.

189
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,458
It simply won't do for a pretty
young girl like yourself

190
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,750
to be walking around town
without a stitch of clothes on,

191
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,041
now will it...?

192
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,625
Come, and we'll find you
something nice to wear.

193
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,375
My thanks to you...

194
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,583
for everything.

195
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,916
She'll be safe here...

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,916
And we promise to look
after her as if she were

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,416
one of our very own.

198
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,541
I'm sorry...

199
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,250
I wish I could
take you with me...

200
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,750
But, you will find a
childhood among your own kind

201
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,541
that I never
could have provided.

202
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,125
Live as a human...

203
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,041
Grow as a human...

204
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,000
Die a human death.

205
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:35,291
This is the greatest gift that
I can possibly give to you...

206
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,708
So use it well.

207
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,958
Farewell, Clare.

208
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,041
Oh, no!

209
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,666
What was I thinking...?

210
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,291
I should have known when
I ran into bandits

211
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,708
so deep in the woods...

212
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,250
They've been after
that town from the start!

213
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,541
Tucked away in the mountains,
no one would ever know

214
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,416
if they were under attack.

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,750
But with a Yoma living
somewhere inside the town,

216
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,625
the thieves weren't able
to make their move.

217
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,000
That Yoma was the only thing
keeping them at bay.

218
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,291
And then I interfered
and destroyed it.

219
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,166
I'm too late...

220
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,208
Clare!

221
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,458
Kill all of the men...!

222
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,166
And take the women...!

223
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,500
c'mon!

224
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,833
With that Yoma dead and gone,
we can do as we please

225
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,625
without fear of
interference from anyone!

226
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,833
So give thanks to
the half-breed witch...!

227
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,416
We'll come back
for the rest later!

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,416
Damn you bastards!

229
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,708
I'll kill you!

230
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,500
How could he...

231
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,333
How could he reach me
from that far aw-

232
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,833
You got to witness
my Falcon Sword...

233
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,291
It's an honor to be
killed with this blade.

234
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,041
Look what I found...

235
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,875
Such a young scent...

236
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,125
Boys, look who we have here?

237
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,750
This is quite the coincidence...

238
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,583
isn't it?

239
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,541
Now that that Yoma
has been destroyed,

240
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,708
it looks like
you're not needed.

241
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,000
And since Claymores know
better than to get involved

242
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,958
in human affairs, what
we're doing here should be

243
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,916
of no concern to you...

244
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,583
So what is it that brings you
before us, Claymore?

245
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,041
Sight seeing...?

246
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,250
It's not like you can do
anything about our fun here...

247
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,875
Think we deserve a spanking?

248
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,083
Clare.

249
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,625
Hey...

250
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,708
So nice to see you.

251
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you forget something
the last time you were here?

252
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,833
Finders, keepers...

253
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,916
But don't worry, I promise to
take real good care of her...

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,083
I mean, we're already such
good friends, aren't we...?

255
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,458
My new pet.

256
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,416
I love watching the veins in her
neck when she's screaming...

257
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,750
She kept crying,
'Teresa, Teresa!'...

258
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,666
You hurt me, witch...

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,708
Now how am I going to
caress your filthy body...?

260
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,375
I'm tired...

261
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,000
Damn you, you rotten bastards.

262
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,125
You are worse than the Yoma
and you all deserve to die

263
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,083
for what you've done.

264
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,333
There will be no survivors...

265
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,541
Each of you dies tonight.

266
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,333
So she's finally lost it...

267
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,458
They'll be coming for your
head now when word gets out

268
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,083
you killed a human!

269
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,291
You'll be slaughtering us...

270
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,000
That could be...

271
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,625
But you shouldn't underestimate
my friends and me...

272
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,125
You aren't the only one
that can handle a weapon.

273
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,458
I don't care that
you're a Claymore...

274
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,333
I wouldn't give a damn if you
were a full-blooded Yoma...

275
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,833
I'm still going
to take off your head!

276
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,958
You're the only one that's ever
deflected my first attack,

277
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,416
which gives me an opportunity
to try out a new move

278
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,791
that I've been working on.

279
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,041
See how well you do with this.

280
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,541
This is what my Falcon Sword
is capable of...

281
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,125
But you can
barely see it, can you?

282
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,416
Where's that pretty
smile of yours now...?

283
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,750
Are you realizing just
how outmatched you are

284
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,041
in this fight?

285
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,875
You can't fight what
you can't see, half-breed.

286
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,083
Do your worst if you even
think you can get close to me.

287
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,958
But I know that your
kind's not made of steel.

288
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,333
So now...

289
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,333
What does the big, bad
Claymore want to do with me?

290
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,041
What the-?

291
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,500
She- she murdered the Boss!

292
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,041
What the hell did we think
we were doing taking on

293
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,625
a monster like her?

294
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,916
I haven't seen anybody move as
fast as that in my entire life!

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,041
R-Run!

296
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,416
That thing is a monster!

297
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,791
She's gonna kill us all...!

298
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,375
Get out of here!

299
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,500
Clare, wake up...

300
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,375
You're safe.

301
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,500
Thank you.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,958
I sensed that something
like this might happen.

303
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,708
And it appears that
the day has arrived at last.

304
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,583
The rules allow
for no exceptions.

305
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,541
Even our finest are not
exempt from the consequences

306
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,208
of taking human life.

307
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,833
I'm sorry that
it's come to this...

308
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,500
Teresa of the Faint Smile.

309
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:34,125
You have betrayed
the Organization-Teresa.

310
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,250
Yes, yes...

311
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,458
get on with it.

312
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,291
You can't do this--
she saved my life!

313
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,958
This is not the
fate I envisioned.

314
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,708
But I am willing to do
what must be done here...

315
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,666
Please would you just
spare me the hypocrisy...?

316
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,708
I disobeyed...

317
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,583
And human lives were lost due
to my lack of control.

318
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,166
Teresa...!

319
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,625
Teresa!

320
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,791
Just tell me one thing first.

321
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,791
As for her...

322
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,750
Who will provide for the girl?

323
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,875
That is no longer
your concern...

324
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:12,083
She will be dealt with by the
Organization from this point on.

325
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,750
I see...

326
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,083
Thank you.

327
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,333
Why won't they listen...?!

328
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,916
Don't you hurt her...!

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,583
Stop!

330
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,791
I can't, Clare...

331
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,791
Goodbye.

332
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,875
Teresa!

333
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,125
The wounds aren't deep.

334
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,458
Your Yoki powers will be more
than enough to close them...

335
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,583
You'll be all right.

336
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,666
Sorry, but...

337
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,833
I'm not quite ready to die.

338
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,916
Teresa!

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,666
You're alive!

340
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,083
Never.

341
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:19,750
Leave.

342
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,416
Me.

343
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,333
please...

344
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,333
please.

345
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,833
There, there...

346
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,083
Stop your crying...

347
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
What have you done now...

348
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,500
Teresa?

349
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,625
Only what I have always done...

350
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,125
I've kept myself alive...

351
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,250
The only way I know how.

352
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,916
But it's all different now...

353
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,250
This little girl has
given me a greater purpose

354
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,708
in my life than
I have ever known.

355
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,125
You will regret this.

356
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,666
We'll see.

357
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,166
But not right now.

358
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,375
This new development
is troubling indeed.

359
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,500
For Teresa of the Faint Smile,
the greatest living Claymore,

360
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,375
to desert us-

361
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,666
It is a problem to be handled
just like any other...

362
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
The Organization
need not worry.

363
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,000
Please bring Number's two
through five to me immediately.

364
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,083
Teresa must be reckoned with.

365
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,291
Betrayal requires motive...

366
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,666
a price...

367
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,500
and a determined will.

368
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,125
Next time, Marked for Death.
