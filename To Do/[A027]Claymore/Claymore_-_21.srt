1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,083
Let me ask you this...

2
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,708
What are the odds that
we'll actually accomplish

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,416
our goal here?

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,291
This operation...

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,166
has absolutely
no chance of success.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,625
And without fail...

7
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,375
I will take the head of the
Awakened Being Priscilla.

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,666
What do you say Clare...?

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,416
Let's stand together
and survive as a team.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,791
You are among friends here...

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,916
Anything you can't do alone,
we'll be right there

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,166
to help you with...

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,958
So...

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,791
don't try to bite off
more than you can chew...

15
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,458
Captain Undine.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,750
You've come face to
face with one of

17
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,291
the Creatures of the Abyss...

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,541
so you should know.

19
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,416
The last few days
have been nothing...

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,125
If this Isley of the North...

21
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,791
The ultimate Creature of
the Abyss, decides to act,

22
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,458
it will get ugly.

23
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,833
They're coming!

24
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,500
It's time...

25
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,125
Let us head south.

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,958
To the town of Pieta.

27
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,583
If everything goes as
planned, it should all be

28
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,333
over with by the
time we arrive.

29
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,208
Are you in Pieta...

30
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,833
Clare?

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,875
I can feel them approaching...

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,375
They're very different.

33
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,916
Yes...

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,250
In their yoki...

35
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,625
their numbers...

36
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,416
their size...

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,375
completely different.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,250
The three I sent ahead,
I can no longer sense them.

39
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,666
I assume that means
they didn't survive.

40
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,083
I believe I told you before
that they were never suited

41
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,458
for a reconnaissance
mission of any kind.

42
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,666
If you had just left
the matter in my hands

43
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,041
we could have
avoided their deaths.

44
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,083
What you don't see is
their deaths mean nothing

45
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,375
in the grand scheme of things.

46
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,166
I gave them that mission
because they were expendable.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,291
I never expected much from
them in the first place.

48
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,958
They tested the waters...

49
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,708
I can now say with confidence
that the force in Pieta

50
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,791
is strong enough to defeat
three Awakened Beings...

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,833
but can they handle more?

52
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,833
Rigaldo...

53
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,000
you want more
responsibility...

54
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,791
yet you cannot
remain in control,

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,791
once your fuse has been lit
there is no stopping you...

56
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,791
Am I wrong?

57
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,833
Silver Eyed Lion King.

58
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,833
I would prefer it if you
didn't call me by that name.

59
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,916
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,041
I don't mean to
dredge up your past...

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,875
If the force
assembled in Pieta...

62
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,541
is indeed as strong
as I believe it to be...

63
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,041
all we need to do
is proceed as planned.

64
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,125
Now is the time...

65
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,291
I want you to assemble
the Awakened Beings.

66
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,916
Soon we will secure
the road to the south.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,208
Yes.

68
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,000
The Northern Army...

69
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,125
now at twenty-seven strong...

70
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,541
will totally
annihilate Pieta...

71
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,958
the first town of Alfons.

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,125
Once our army is
finished with that town,

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,916
not a single hint
of life will remain.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,583
In the name
of the Silver King...

75
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,666
Eradicate all life, down to
the very last rat and insect!

76
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,958
Have we evacuated all citizens?

77
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,375
The townspeople
are safe and sound.

78
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,416
And what's the
status on our injured?

79
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,875
Uma's arm is improving but it
isn't completely healed yet...

80
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,208
There should be enough
mobility for her

81
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,000
to be effective in battle.

82
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,458
That's good.

83
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,500
How many of us will
actually survive this...?

84
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,958
No, I can't think that way...

85
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,500
We'll do whatever it takes.

86
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,583
We will survive!

87
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,291
Pamela!

88
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,041
There they are!

89
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,375
I see them!

90
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,083
Yuliana!

91
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,541
I will make it through this,
no matter what it takes...

92
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
I will survive.

93
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,458
What's wrong Isley?

94
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,750
Far away from here, fleeting
lives are being extinguished

95
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,416
one by one.

96
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,541
If only I could see it
with my own eyes.

97
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:49,958
Come now...

98
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,166
Let's go...

99
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,083
We still have
a long journey ahead of us.

100
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,250
Now!

101
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,666
Captain!

102
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,583
Come on, is that
all you've got...?

103
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,333
I never thought an
Awakened Being could have

104
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,041
the strength of a child!

105
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,583
Damn you!

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,291
Now, Deneve, now!

107
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,708
Right!

108
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,458
Twenty-one.

109
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,000
Come back here...!
You two can't run forever!

110
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,875
Where the hell'd she go?

111
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,541
This is taking much longer
than I had anticipated...

112
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,583
We've lost three so far,
but they've only lost five.

113
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,041
Unbelievable...

114
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,625
Our army's power supersedes
anything the Organization

115
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,375
could muster up, yet somehow
they are holding their own.

116
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,041
One.

117
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,458
Two.

118
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
Three.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,458
Four.

120
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,333
Five.

121
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
Five strong warriors...

122
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,250
They must be leading small
squads into battle,

123
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,041
each independent
but working together.

124
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,208
Isley...

125
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,666
Priscilla's gone!

126
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,875
Where is she?

127
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,541
Priscilla...

128
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,916
Priscilla!

129
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,791
It's a monster!!!

130
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,291
There's a monster out there?

131
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,916
Priscilla!

132
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,833
What's that?

133
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,416
Priscilla...

134
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,083
Thank God you're okay,
I was starting to worry...

135
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,416
Uh...

136
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,083
Uh...

137
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:48,916
Your clothes...

138
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,750
I brought them for you.

139
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,875
Priscilla...

140
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,625
I...

141
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,416
I'm sorry about that Miria.

142
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,625
There's too many of them...

143
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
At this rate
we'll never make it...

144
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,208
--What happened?
--Where did they go?

145
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,083
Did they quit fighting!

146
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,291
What's going on?

147
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,708
What the hell?

148
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,333
So what was that all about?

149
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,041
What is it,
do you sense something?

150
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,791
I think so...

151
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,458
it feels like
someone's coming this way...

152
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,958
Oh no!

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,708
Impressive performance...

154
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,750
Here you are in an
impossible situation...

155
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,750
and yet you've come up
with a way to dig yourself

156
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,041
out of sure annihilation.

157
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,416
However I can no longer watch
my forces be destroyed...

158
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,208
without taking matters
into my own hands.

159
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,708
There's...

160
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,083
no way!

161
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,500
It can't be...

162
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,791
Rigaldo!

163
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,291
The Silver-Eyed Lion King!

164
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,208
But why...

165
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,833
Why's he here?

166
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,833
You will be the first!

167
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,625
Veronica, no!

168
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,125
Behind you, Captain!!

169
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,791
You're a quick one.

170
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,833
And you're a strong one too.

171
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,666
But not strong enough.

172
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,541
You bastard!

173
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,875
Goodbye.

174
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,750
Undine!!

175
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,625
She's a Yoma.

176
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,333
Yoma?!

177
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,958
Mommy...

178
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,916
Daddy...

179
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,416
Brother...

180
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,791
Sister...

181
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
No...

182
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,625
What are you talking
about...? Your mommy and daddy?

183
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,666
Why are you saying
those things?!

184
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,416
What's wrong with you?

185
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,125
No...

186
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,708
what's happened
to you Priscilla?

187
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,625
Why are you
doing this...? Why...

188
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,250
What's wrong with her...

189
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,791
Isley...

190
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,458
I was wondering where
you'd gone, Priscilla.

191
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,875
Wandering off
whenever you please.

192
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,791
So like you.

193
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,500
You knew about this,
didn't you Isley...?

194
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,125
You knew that
Priscilla was a Yoma!

195
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,625
Not a Yoma.

196
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,166
She's an Awakened Being.

197
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,791
At one time she was human.

198
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,000
Stop it, Priscilla...

199
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,541
You've got to stop
doing that...! Stop!

200
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,083
Please Priscilla...

201
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,375
Don't you see what
you're doing is wrong?

202
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,083
Can't you fight the urge?!

203
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:15,916
Priscilla...

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,916
Please...

205
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,541
Stop, you're just
a little girl!

206
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,875
Don't cry...

207
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,666
Just put it down...

208
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,708
Please Priscilla, stop eating.

209
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,750
It's not right.

210
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,375
It's not right!!

211
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,791
Please...

212
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,333
Priscilla!!

213
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,041
Jean!

214
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,458
Stay back...! Protect Flora!

215
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,708
He's trying to eliminate all
of the team leaders first!

216
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,291
Nineteen.

217
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,500
I've failed you, Captain.

218
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,500
Twenty-one.

219
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
My, that's unfortunate.

220
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Jean...

221
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,250
damn you...

222
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,541
You bastard!!!

223
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,291
Scattered light
vanishes into nothing...

224
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,125
and impatience mounts...

225
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,916
Next time on Claymore,
Invasion of Pieta, Part Two.
