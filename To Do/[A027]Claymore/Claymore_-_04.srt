1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,958
Your cathedral is infested
with a Voracious Eater.

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,833
What is a Voracious Eater?

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,458
You two don't stand
a chance against it!

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,708
You'll die if you stay!

5
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,875
Stop right there!

6
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,208
She put up a helluva fight...

7
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,291
she's gotta be dead.

8
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,291
No...

9
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,500
I can still hear
her heart beating.

10
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
Galk, what are you doing...?

11
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,791
Put her down...

12
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,666
she's just a monster...

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,750
Look, she may be a claymore...

14
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,500
But she saved my life...

15
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,708
I at least owe her this much.

16
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,041
Clare!

17
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,416
Clare!

18
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,750
Tell me!
Is she going to be alright?

19
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,958
Unfortunately that
remains to be seen ...

20
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,958
we just don't know where
to begin to treat a claymore.

21
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,291
What are you saying...?

22
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,500
You can't mean that
Clare's just going to...

23
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,125
Die?

24
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,833
I don't see what
the fuss is about.

25
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,500
A couple of monsters just
tried to kill each other...

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not something
to waste your tears over.

27
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,083
--Bastard!
--I'm warning you...

28
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,458
Watch what you say about Clare.

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,708
She took me in...

30
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,375
and she's always willing
to sacrifice herself!

31
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,083
You have no clue what
she's done for me...

32
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,291
Clare has made me happier
than I've ever hoped to be...

33
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,625
She's pure of heart and she's
certainly a hell of a lot nicer

34
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,333
than any miserable
human I've ever known.

35
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,625
Ya big baby...

36
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,958
Guess I'll go back to my post.

37
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,875
Are you alright?

38
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,916
Damn...

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,041
that...

40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:23,666
bastard...

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,333
Stop crying.

42
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,791
I believe there is
great power in faith...

43
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,500
At this point, all you
can do is pray for her...

44
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,166
Do you understand?

45
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,666
It's not over yet...

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,958
She will live.

47
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,250
You're awake.

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
Well thank goodness for that.

49
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,541
I'm sorry Father...

50
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,875
I must have been
so much trouble.

51
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:12,708
Oh no...

52
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,250
no trouble at all.

53
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,208
How long have
I been unconscious?

54
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,041
Since...

55
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,875
the day before yesterday...

56
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,875
Raki stayed by your
side the entire time...

57
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,708
He kept constant
vigil in the hopes that

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,083
you would open your eyes.

59
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,500
Forgive me, Father...

60
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,958
but I need a favor.

61
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,708
Huh?

62
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,083
I am sorry to have called all
of you so late in the night...

63
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,875
But I am afraid I'm going
to have to insist that you

64
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,666
trust me for a while.

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,958
Father Vincent...

66
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,291
What is this about Vincent?

67
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,000
A Yoma investigation.

68
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,708
What?

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,583
A Yoma investigation...?

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,750
You mean that thing is hiding
somewhere amongst us?

71
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,291
It's quite possible...

72
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,000
and considering what we've all
been through I don't believe

73
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,458
that we can afford
to take any chances.

74
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,708
Her eyes!

75
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,291
Those are the eyes of a witch!

76
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,833
Outrageous...!

77
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,375
Vincent, are you responsible
for bringing that demon here?

78
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,000
Unfortunately
I didn't have a choice.

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,500
Would somebody please tell me
what is going on here?

80
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,083
Vincent...

81
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,458
how dare you...!

82
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
You're including the archbishop

83
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,666
in this investigation
of yours...?

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,958
You're insane...!

85
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,666
Do you hear me--

86
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,750
Why Vincent?!

87
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,541
Please...

88
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,750
we need your cooperation.

89
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,625
I don't like this...

90
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,500
She's a damned
monster for God's sake.

91
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,666
It's Father Vincent's orders.

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,125
I know.

93
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,083
Good...

94
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,166
next...

95
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,708
I can't believe
what she expects of us.

96
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,500
This is crazy.

97
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,125
Are you really
going through with it?

98
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,708
It's simple enough...

99
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,375
She locates the Yoma and traps
it in a vulnerable place...

100
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,000
and we spear it and
her at the same time.

101
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,208
It's so unfortunate...

102
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,333
But, then again, she's able
to heal herself so quickly...

103
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,875
I just don't see any other
options at this point.

104
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
This is our fight.

105
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,041
We can't fight
this thing alone...

106
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,666
we need all the help
we can get even with her...

107
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,333
don't let your
pride get to you.

108
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not about pride.

109
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,375
Enlighten me.

110
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,333
Humans should defend
humans; that's it...

111
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,916
damn!

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,458
You're fine.

113
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,875
Thank you.

114
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,291
I don't understand.

115
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,166
I can't sense
a Yoma anywhere...

116
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,541
If it were here, it would
be missing its right eye,

117
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,041
but everyone checks out.

118
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,083
Good. You're okay.

119
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,416
Perfect...

120
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,250
Why in the world do I
have to wait out here...?

121
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,625
This baptism chamber
is really creepy.

122
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,375
Especially...

123
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,500
with that guy in here.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,750
You're fine.

125
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,333
Only two left.

126
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,291
He's not a Yoma either!

127
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,750
Tell me...

128
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,208
do I pass?

129
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,416
Yes.

130
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,791
Only one left.

131
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,291
Wait...

132
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,791
what are you doing?

133
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,750
I apologize Father...

134
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,333
but I can't afford
to make exceptions.

135
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,958
But I'm not---

136
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,833
This will only take a moment.

137
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,500
What...?

138
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,958
It's not him...

139
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,500
He's human!

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,041
This can't be right...

141
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,208
It has to be
in the cathedral...

142
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,916
why can't I find it?

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
Did I miss something?

144
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,291
What am I not thinking of?

145
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,250
Stop...

146
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,333
think...

147
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,333
think like a Yoma.

148
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,458
It doesn't care who it uses to
hide so long as it stays hidden.

149
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,458
Man.

150
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,166
Woman.

151
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,916
The elders.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,666
Even a child.

153
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,000
Or the body of corpse!

154
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,916
You are disgusting...

155
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,666
They gotta be done with
the investigation by now.

156
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,583
Raki!

157
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,875
Clare should be fine...

158
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,250
I hope...

159
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,041
What the hell was that...?

160
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,000
Clare...?

161
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,875
You're here...

162
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,916
Did it hurt you...?

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
You alright?

164
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,125
I'm fine.

165
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:36,875
Don't worry Raki.

166
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,208
I won't let him get you...

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,375
Just get out of here...

168
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,833
now.

169
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,000
Watch out---!

170
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,083
Raki!

171
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,416
Stay back!

172
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,458
It's time to run, brat!

173
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,250
Stay back...!

174
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,000
I've got him!

175
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,833
We'll take over from here...

176
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,416
why don't you stop trying
to save everybody yourself?

177
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,250
I think you've done enough
besides I doubt you could even

178
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,458
save this boy
with your injuries.

179
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,500
This is our city, claymore...!

180
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,083
And we have sworn to
protect it with our lives!

181
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,958
Look, you just take care
of the boy and yourself!

182
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,083
We'll take down this monster...!

183
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,208
Sid is right!

184
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,833
This is our city!

185
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,666
And this Yoma has defiled our
sacred grounds for far too long.

186
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,958
Let's go!

187
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,291
Damn!

188
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,500
Hey!

189
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,625
Hey get back here, boy!

190
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,041
There's nothing you can do!

191
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,583
I have to!

192
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Clare needs this!

193
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,500
What is that thing?

194
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,041
Just make sure she gets it!

195
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,166
Here...

196
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,708
catch!

197
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,166
Claymore!

198
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,000
Now Yoma...

199
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,458
your reign of
terror ends tonight.

200
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,541
That's it!

201
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,291
Damn you, bitch...

202
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,041
Amazing.

203
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,208
It's incredible what
she can do with a sword...

204
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,041
I've never seen anyone do what
this claymore is capable of.

205
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,875
We've got to help her...

206
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,625
Clare's pushing it...

207
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,041
she's hurting...

208
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,000
she doesn't have much left.

209
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,458
You're not looking
very good, Claymore.

210
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,500
Now I understand...

211
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,416
You were only pretending
to have the advantage.

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,250
Weren't you?

213
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,875
I thought you were toying
with me but you really didn't

214
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,875
want to prolong this.

215
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,750
You were trying to end it
with one blow...

216
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:27,416
Instead of getting my arm you
wanted to take off my head.

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,250
Sorry to disappoint you!

218
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,541
But this fight
is mine now, Claymore!

219
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,416
Be careful!

220
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
You can do much
better than this...

221
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,000
I believe you might,
be running out of blood...

222
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,708
I didn't realize that you
Claymores were so light...!

223
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,458
Time to come down... now!

224
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,750
Die!

225
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,166
Galk!

226
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,625
Are you alright...?

227
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,083
Can you stand?

228
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,750
Sorry...

229
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,458
It doesn't look like there's
much more we can do to help...

230
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,458
You were right about us.

231
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,708
We're no match for this thing.

232
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,666
We're not even close.

233
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,625
This is your show now,
but we're behind you

234
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,083
and you can use us
anyway you need...

235
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,166
you just better
bring that thing down...

236
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,875
Take this!

237
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,791
Why would you do such
a stupid thing like that

238
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,166
you foolish human?

239
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,750
Now you die!

240
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,875
What are you waiting for...?

241
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
Now!

242
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,166
How do you like that,
monster...?

243
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,291
A little gift from
a couple of fools.

244
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,875
Bastards...

245
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,458
What's he doing?

246
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,291
You can swing your sword from
any direction down there

247
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,291
and you won't
hit anything vital.

248
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,958
Watch out, Clare!

249
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,041
So you don't consider
your head vital...

250
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,291
Yes...!

251
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,750
You killed the Yoma!

252
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,458
Wow...

253
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,875
that Claymore did it...

254
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,083
she really is amazing.

255
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,125
You're right
about that, Sid...

256
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,208
She's truly incredible.

257
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,708
Are you alright?

258
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,500
How can I help you?

259
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,708
What's going on?

260
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,500
It's no use...

261
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
I've gone too far.

262
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,875
Just tell me what's wrong!

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,333
What in the hell do you
think you're doing?!

264
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,875
It wasn't safe to use
so much Yoma power.

265
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,375
I've sustained too much injury.

266
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,416
I have reached my Yoki limit.

267
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,791
I will soon become
a danger to everyone here.

268
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,375
There's no choice.

269
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,458
I have to do this while my human
mind is still in control...

270
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,958
I must take my own life
while I still can.

271
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
No. Don't. You can't...!

272
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,250
Please just stop!

273
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,208
I must do this.

274
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,541
We'll fix it!

275
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,625
--We'll help you!
--Stay away from me...!

276
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,666
Galk now...

277
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,583
do it!

278
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,666
Please, Galk...

279
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,250
hurry!

280
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,666
Stop...

281
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,666
this isn't right...

282
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
you can't do this...!

283
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,166
Raki. Listen to me!

284
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,333
I'm beyond saving...

285
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,083
Clare!

286
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,000
The more we use our Yoki...

287
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:55,208
the closer we get
to becoming full Yoma.

288
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,541
But this transformation
doesn't happen gradually...

289
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,125
it can hit suddenly,
without any warning.

290
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,750
No, No!

291
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,208
My body is already changing.

292
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,083
I can barely hold on as it is.

293
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,291
Please.

294
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,166
What are you doing...?

295
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,750
You'll die!

296
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,708
Stop...

297
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,125
Please Raki...

298
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,041
You have to let go of me...

299
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,583
I won't-

300
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,916
Please don't...

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,750
traveling with you was the best
thing that ever happened...

302
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,666
you made me so happy.

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,333
After my family was killed
the village pushed me aside...

304
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,708
I lost every single
thing that I had...!

305
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,208
But then you came
and you found me!

306
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,416
You let me travel with you
and for the first time

307
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,041
I allowed myself
to be happy again...

308
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,333
more than anything, I had
someone back in my life.

309
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,250
You said that you weren't kind,

310
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,500
but I know
that's not the truth...

311
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,583
You were nicer to me than anyone
I had known in my entire life...

312
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,333
And that...

313
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,500
that's why...

314
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,750
I need you to live
and just stay with me...

315
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,541
I don't know what I would do
without you by my side...

316
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,166
If you're going to die,
if this is it Clare...

317
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,166
take me with you!

318
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,125
My Yoki's under control...

319
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,916
I didn't transform...

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,958
You're still alive!

321
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,166
Wow, can't believe it's over...

322
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
What do you know?

323
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,291
She didn't become
a Yoma after all...

324
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,750
So do you think
that's the end of it?

325
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, one thing's for sure...

326
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,625
that boy just saved her life.

327
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,125
I owe you so much, Father.

328
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,833
What are you
talking about, Clare...?

329
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,541
We're the ones who
should be indebted to you

330
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,958
for saving our lives.

331
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,125
I was simply doing my duty.

332
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,500
I want you to know...

333
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,500
the bishop has given his
full consent to taking Raki

334
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,375
under our wing here
in the cathedral.

335
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,625
We'll look after him
as one of our own.

336
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,750
Huh...?

337
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,416
Clare?

338
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,208
Or you could stay with me...

339
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,250
your choice.

340
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,208
Yeah.

341
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,750
Hey brat!

342
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:58,875
Here...

343
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,875
a souvenir.

344
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,208
Huh?

345
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,166
And Claymore...

346
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,250
you take care of yourself.

347
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,875
Time to go, Raki.

348
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,041
Wait a minute, kid!

349
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
Just one more thing...

350
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,750
I need you to grow
big and strong got it...?

351
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,958
Strong enough so
you can help out Clare!

352
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:22,875
Okay I will...

353
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,000
you can count on it, bye!

354
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,458
Despair and screaming.

355
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,666
In a sea of blood a smile
floats to the surface.

356
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,791
Next time, "Teresa
of the Faint Smile."
