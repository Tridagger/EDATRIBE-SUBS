1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,125
Get out of my way...

2
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,416
I don't waste my time
on weaklings.

3
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,125
Stay where you are...!
You're the only captain left,

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,750
we can't afford to lose you...

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,375
He killed them all...

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,166
And he'll pay for it.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,708
Damn you...

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,625
You will die tonight.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,458
All I know is that
somewhere along the way

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,458
she lost control and
went over her limit...

11
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,458
It's a fate that is all but
inevitable for a Claymore.

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,250
Wait. What did you just say?

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,333
Priscilla was a Claymore.

14
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,583
Yes...

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,333
And awakening is one of
many cruel eventualities

16
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,166
for their kind.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,500
You son of a bitch.

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,875
I'll kill you for this!

19
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,625
The Claymores are doing their
best to keep them back, but...

20
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,291
Even the lowest
ranked ones are there...

21
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,208
But it's hopeless.

22
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,708
What, the lowest
ranked Claymores...?

23
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,750
Wait, are you sure about that?

24
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,250
Clare is there...

25
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,458
I have to go and find her.

26
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,583
We swore we'd live
to see each other again...!

27
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,708
I've kept my end
of the bargain.

28
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,958
This time, I'm going
to protect you!

29
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,625
If I just had more speed...

30
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,250
more power...

31
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:39,083
I could have saved Flora
and protected Jean...

32
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:45,916
I need more...! More
speed...! I need more...!

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,875
More...! More...! More...!

34
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:02,458
What...? What the hell...?
What happened?!

35
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,791
Clare!

36
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,541
All I need...

37
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,416
is more.

38
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,166
What's wrong with her?

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,875
I don't believe it.

40
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,333
You just appeared out of
nowhere and took my arm off...

41
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,333
I never even saw you coming.

42
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,458
But now...

43
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,833
it's my turn...

44
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,500
You've earned my
undivided attention.

45
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,250
What the hell...

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,041
what happened to her legs?!

47
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,000
You allowed only
your lower half to awaken...

48
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,208
If anything, I have to give
you credit for originality.

49
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,958
Clare, no!

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,958
I'm worthless...

51
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,875
They need my help...

52
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,250
and I can't even stand.

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,166
Damn...

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,458
Missing an arm makes
this much more difficult.

55
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,625
I'm sorry were you
looking for this?

56
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,083
You may have awakened...

57
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,041
But I bet regeneration
didn't get any easier.

58
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
You bitch.

59
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,083
Clare, behind you!

60
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,208
You think you've got me
beaten just because

61
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,250
you've cut off one measly arm?

62
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,541
What good is being able
to move so fast...

63
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,666
when you don't even have the
skill to maintain control?

64
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,000
When you start moving
it's hard to make even

65
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,333
small changes in direction.

66
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,875
Once you've
committed to your move,

67
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,583
I'll just alter my attack
at the last second...

68
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,583
Your lack of control destroys
any chance your speed

69
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,833
may have given you.

70
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,291
Not to mention-

71
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,750
You forced your lower half
to awaken independently...

72
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,250
That's tricky...

73
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,166
And it's causing a major strain
on the rest of your body.

74
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,541
Damn you!

75
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,958
You'll never win...

76
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,000
You're as weak
as the rest of them.

77
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:53,958
He's right...

78
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,875
I need more...

79
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,250
I can't defeat him like this!

80
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,250
Whether attacking or defending,
your moves are too extreme...

81
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,833
You've lost your
former precision.

82
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,541
Besides, your pathetic
little body just isn't built

83
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,333
for that kind of abuse...

84
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,166
What makes you think
you can battle against

85
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,291
an Awakened Being and
come out of it alive...?

86
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,583
You're simply not equipped.

87
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,833
Raki should arrive in Pieta
soon if he hasn't already...

88
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,583
I wonder if he's found
the person he's looking for.

89
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,583
If he intends to find her
before she falls to Rigaldo,

90
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,375
he doesn't have much time...

91
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,416
Tell me, Priscilla.

92
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,625
Are you concerned
for his safety?

93
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,333
Don't be...

94
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,458
You'll see your
new friend soon enough.

95
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,208
No.

96
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,916
Don't think I'll fall
for the same trick twice.

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,791
You and your friend are both...

98
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,500
dead.

99
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,791
What the -?!

100
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,833
I don't understand...

101
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,916
How does she suddenly have the
power to control her speed?

102
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,666
So strong...

103
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,000
I need more...

104
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,583
He has to die!

105
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,875
I need more!

106
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,083
This one's good.

107
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,833
Watch out, Clare!

108
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,041
Not bad at all.

109
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,083
This could be
quite entertaining...

110
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't even remember the last
time I had to fight this hard.

111
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,166
Not since
my battle with Isley...

112
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,958
That was ages ago...

113
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,791
Since then I've fought
nothing but weaklings...

114
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,458
How quickly I forgot.

115
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,291
This sensation...

116
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,125
The fire in my blood!

117
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,708
I finally feel alive again!

118
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,583
All I want-

119
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,791
Is to kill this one!

120
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,166
I am Rigaldo!

121
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,375
On my honor as the
Silver-Eyed Lion King-

122
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,666
I will kill you!

123
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,125
Yes...

124
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,833
The smell of a Yoma...

125
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,458
It certainly takes me back...

126
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,250
The Claymores fighting in
Pieta must be tougher than

127
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,666
the ones I remember.

128
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,416
They've succeeded in forcing
the Silver-Eyed Lion King

129
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,333
to take them seriously.

130
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,125
But still...

131
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,958
Their chances of
surviving are slim.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,125
Begin!

133
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,916
Unbelievable...

134
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,875
I think Clare is
beginning to gain control

135
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,875
over her awakened half.

136
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,250
Damn...

137
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:19,958
You're kidding me.

138
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,708
There're still civilians here?

139
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,166
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

140
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Let go of me!

141
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,416
If you want to stay alive,
you won't leave this room...

142
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,833
Understand?

143
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,041
Just leave me alone...!
There's someone I have to find

144
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,583
and you can't stop me!

145
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,666
Hold on...

146
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,291
I remember you.

147
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,333
The brat Clare
was traveling with!

148
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,416
I'm not a brat!

149
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
My name's Raki and
there's something

150
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,208
I have to take care of!

151
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,500
Whatever it is
you came here for, Raki...

152
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,708
Forget it...

153
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,958
You have to leave
Pieta at once.

154
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,041
But Clare's here.

155
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,500
You mean you came
all this way to see her?

156
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,666
Listen, you can't
handle what Clare

157
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,541
is going through right now.

158
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,125
Leave while you still can!

159
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,208
I won't leave without her...! I
made a promise I have to keep!

160
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,291
Because I promise...

161
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll be trying my
hardest to survive...

162
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,125
and come back to you.

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,916
Helen.

164
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,125
Fine, I'll go after him.

165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,333
Is that really Clare...?

166
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,583
I found her!

167
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,291
Her body is
continuing to awaken.

168
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,875
She's awakening?

169
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,458
Yes.

170
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,000
Awakening is one of many cruel
eventualities for their kind.

171
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,250
So unless she can stop...

172
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,083
I can't let that happen...

173
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,291
She can't...

174
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,625
no...

175
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,833
Do you understand now?

176
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,541
There's nothing you
can do to help her...

177
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,291
So just go home.

178
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,000
That's not true...

179
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,625
It can't be!

180
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,250
Mommy...

181
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,166
Daddy...

182
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,666
Brother...

183
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,166
Sister...

184
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,541
I can't let
that happen to her!

185
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't you get it...?
Clare needs more help

186
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,500
than you can give her...

187
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,416
You should just go home.

188
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,250
Damn it...

189
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,625
What a pain.

190
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,750
C'mon...

191
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,375
If you're going to stay,
stick with me.

192
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,041
It's not enough...

193
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,375
I need more!

194
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,750
More speed...

195
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,375
More power!

196
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:54,041
I have to admit you're
better than I thought...

197
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,750
That's too bad.

198
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,333
It's time I ended this!

199
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,125
This is the end.

200
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,500
Good luck using
that speed of yours

201
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,583
while you're holed up in there.

202
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,875
You're out of places
to run...! It's over.

203
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,083
You're head is mine.

204
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,875
That's impossible...!
How did she do that?

205
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,333
No way...

206
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,083
This isn't happening.

207
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,541
You killed my comrades...

208
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,375
My friends!

209
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,666
I feel it...

210
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,666
A new Yoki aura.

211
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,875
What's the matter?

212
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,166
Priscilla?

213
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,208
This still isn't enough
to defeat this monster.

214
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,875
I need more!

215
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,916
Stop, Clare...! You're
pushing yourself too far!

216
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,833
I need more...!
I have...

217
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:01,708
to have...

218
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,083
more!

219
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,166
She focused her
energy completely

220
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,375
on trying to defeat me...

221
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,250
She even allowed
her legs to awaken...

222
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,875
And in a matter of minutes was
able to learn to control them!

223
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,208
She's amazing!

224
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,625
Unforgettable emotions...

225
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,208
Unimaginable tragedy...

226
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,333
And rage that will not die.

227
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,625
Next Claymore.

228
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,333
"Critical Point, Two."
