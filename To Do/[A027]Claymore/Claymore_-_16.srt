1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,708
There's something strange
about this Yoki aura.

2
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:30,333
I sense so many distorted
Yoki inside this castle.

3
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,208
It's pulsating...

4
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,666
So these are
the auras I'm feeling.

5
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:55,791
Damn...!

6
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,666
I'm surrounded by Yoma...

7
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,166
And to think I didn't even
notice them approaching!

8
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,666
How could I fall for this?

9
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,958
No running...

10
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,916
That's bad.

11
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,166
What is this?

12
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,416
I've never felt
a Yoki aura of this size!

13
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,750
Oh no...

14
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,583
You're not a woman...!

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,416
I didn't expect you
to be a man.

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
More fun to torture woman.

17
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,333
Men die too easy.

18
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,250
Which one are you?

19
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,583
You don't have to tell...

20
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,541
I'll just rip
your clothes off and see...

21
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,833
Uh oh...!

22
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,666
The tunnel is too
little Dauf is stuck!

23
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,500
I can't move!

24
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,916
What do you think
you're doing,...?

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,791
That, kinda hurt.

26
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,041
Hey! That really stings!

27
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,583
What did I ever do to you?

28
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,958
Stop it!

29
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,458
Too bad...

30
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,250
You're weak...

31
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,500
my turn.

32
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,541
Damn!

33
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,333
Lost your sword fast.

34
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
You're not much of a fighter

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,666
It's a trap...

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,916
Gotcha.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,333
Same to you.

38
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,375
She's actually not bad.

39
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
Maybe it would have been
better to have Dauf bring her

40
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,458
to me instead of letting
him toy with the poor thing.

41
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,291
You little bitch...

42
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,166
What the hell are you after?

43
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,833
Well...

44
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,750
I'll be happy to tell you
when you awaken and join us.

45
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,458
Are you insane...?

46
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,458
I would...

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,791
rather die than
join you monsters!

48
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,291
What in the hell
are you laughing about?

49
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,833
Oh it's...

50
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:42,333
just that most people would
consider you a monster, too.

51
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,791
To normal people, there isn't
much difference between

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,916
a Claymore and
an Awakened Being...

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,833
Really, it's only
a matter of what side

54
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,583
we let ourselves be aware of.

55
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,583
See, in the eyes of the world,
we are both monsters.

56
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,666
We're not that
different after all.

57
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,708
Maybe you're right...

58
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,833
Maybe I am a monster...

59
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,708
But you're wrong to think
I'm anything like you.

60
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,958
I came into this world
as a human...

61
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,625
And that's how
I plan to die...

62
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,750
With my human side
in control...

63
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,875
Do what you like but
I'll never awaken for you.

64
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
I wouldn't be so sure...

65
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,291
You intrigue me...

66
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,000
So much so that I've decided
I'm going to make you

67
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,958
my very own little project.

68
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,625
You know, I'm really
starting to get, angry.

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,208
Impossible...!

70
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,333
His skin is so tough that the
Quick Sword barely affects him.

71
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,500
One.

72
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,416
Here comes two!

73
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,666
My leg...

74
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,666
The bone!

75
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,083
Pretty good, huh?

76
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,208
If I cut your leg off,
you'll only reattach it.

77
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,166
But if I shatter the bone,
it's harder to heal.

78
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,708
Now let's get those clothes off

79
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,916
and see what
we're dealing with...

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,416
Are you a little boy...?

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,833
Or a pretty girl?

82
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,458
This is a dilemma.

83
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,250
I'm glad I found you
so easily...

84
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,375
but I'm not sure
what I should do next.

85
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,208
You must admit...

86
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,458
This situation isn't one that
you encounter every day,

87
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,875
now is it?

88
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,791
I've come this far...

89
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,833
I can't just go back without
anything to show for it.

90
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,000
Who the hell are you...?

91
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,666
And why haven't
you drawn your sword,

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,833
do you have some
kind of death wish?

93
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,083
That emblem!

94
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,708
She's Number Three...

95
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,333
Galatea!

96
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,833
What is she doing...?

97
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,166
Why is she here?!

98
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,250
Wait.

99
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,125
It seems that we've been joined
by someone truly powerful.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't worry little Claymore,

101
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,708
I'll get to you-- I just have to
finish up with this one first.

102
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey!

103
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,208
Wow...

104
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
You're much lighter
than you look...

105
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,875
You really should eat more.

106
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,833
My business here
is with this one...

107
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,333
So if you'll excuse me.

108
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,750
Don't underestimate him!

109
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,166
He's--

110
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,291
Now hold on...!

111
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,416
What was that little trick
you just pulled on me?

112
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,416
Don't you ignore me!

113
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,750
Hey, what the hell...?!

114
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,541
Why can't I hit her?

115
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,791
All of his attacks are
veering away from us...

116
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,666
How is that possible?

117
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,750
Who'd have thought...?

118
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,500
It appears that our little
playmate has a brain

119
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,458
in his head after all.

120
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,333
You bitch!

121
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,875
Where you goin'?

122
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,166
I'm not done with
my new friend!

123
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,625
I'm gonna kill you...

124
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,000
But, before I do,
I'm gonna strip you naked,

125
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,708
yank out your limbs, then
pull your steaming guts out

126
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,041
while you're still twitching.

127
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,333
Stay right here...

128
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,250
Do your best to mend that leg.

129
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,708
Oh, ok.

130
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,333
You're lucky...

131
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,083
If I hadn't come along
at the right moment,

132
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,958
you could have easily fallen
prey to that evil creature.

133
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,333
You have to be careful...!

134
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,375
His skin is too tough.

135
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,791
Our swords can't penetrate it.

136
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,166
I wasn't referring
to your giant friend.

137
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,541
I meant the evil creature
who's down below us now...

138
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,375
You have no idea what
trouble you're in, do you?

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,416
Her Yoki aura is immense,

140
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,875
but she's tremendously
skilled at hiding it...

141
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,583
If you're able to
match her wavelength,

142
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,750
you should be able
to locate her as well.

143
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,458
I wasn't able to hit you
with all my other attacks,

144
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,958
but this time I won't miss!

145
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,500
I thought you wanted to strip
me down, tear off my limbs,

146
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,250
and pull out my guts
while I watched?

147
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,291
That's right...

148
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,291
But I think
I'll smash you first.

149
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,833
Galatea!

150
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,875
That's what you get for
that cocky little attitude

151
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:09,625
of yours...

152
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,958
Loser!

153
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,083
You're actually dumber
than you look.

154
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
I never would have thought
such a feat was possible.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
So it's true.

156
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,500
His outer skin is too
thick to penetrate

157
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,875
with ordinary attacks...

158
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,791
Huh.

159
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,416
Why you-!

160
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,500
It's just as I thought.

161
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,583
Your skin is tough, but there
seem to be some cracks

162
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,916
in your armor.

163
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,208
You bitch!

164
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,333
That hurt!

165
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,333
Mind if I borrow your idea...?

166
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,666
Ripping your arms off
sounds like fun.

167
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,291
So this is what
Number Three is capable of...

168
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,833
It's almost as
if she can control

169
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,958
her opponent's every move!

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,375
Damn Bitch...!

171
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,375
You bitch...!

172
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,250
Stupid bitch!

173
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,083
Oh, please.

174
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,416
Don't cry...

175
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,750
It's just as embarrassing
for me as it is for you.

176
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,750
He is an idiot isn't he?

177
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,958
I really must
apologize for that.

178
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,208
Well, look who finally
decided to come out of hiding.

179
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,291
What are you
doing up here, Dauf?

180
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,708
I gave you one simple
task and you can't even

181
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,250
accomplish that...

182
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,166
This is why I'm embarrassed
to tell people you're my man.

183
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
I've really been
trying to hit her,

184
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,958
but she's got some
kind of force field...

185
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,916
Promise!

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,708
Don't be stupid, Daufy.

187
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,041
She does not have
a magical force field.

188
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,208
But it's true...!

189
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,333
That's why I haven't
been able to-

190
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,791
Listen...

191
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,041
I'll tell you how to make
sure you land your attacks,

192
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,458
but you're not allowed to
miss this time, understand?

193
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

194
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,291
I want you to hit her
with everything you've got.

195
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,833
Don't hold back.

196
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,000
But I have been attacking her
with everything I've got,

197
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,083
and I haven't been
holding back...

198
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,125
Nothing hits her, I swear!

199
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,208
Quit your whining
and just do it...

200
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,166
Keep in mind if
you miss one more time,

201
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,916
I'm breaking up with you.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,708
No...

203
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,375
Please don't!

204
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,125
Damn you...

205
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,708
All of this is your fault...!

206
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,416
I'll kill you for this!

207
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
Huh...?

208
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,375
It didn't veer off
course that time.

209
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,541
Be careful!

210
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,583
That's it.

211
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,333
Good, Dauf.

212
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,583
You're closer...

213
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,625
If you had started with
that kind of intensity,

214
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,625
she would have been
dead a long time ago.

215
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,583
What happened...?

216
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,958
What did you just do?

217
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,416
Me...? I did nothing at all...

218
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,375
Your friend there
has the rare ability

219
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,958
to control her
opponent's aura.

220
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,375
That's not quite true.

221
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,041
At best she's able
to tweak it a bit.

222
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,416
She can't actually
stop them from attacking.

223
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,041
So when Dauf unleashes
all of his rage and power

224
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,541
into his strikes, there
isn't anything she can do

225
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,291
to prevent them from landing.

226
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:32,958
Look out!

227
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,041
Dodge it!

228
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,625
Hey, I finally got her...!

229
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,458
So what do you want me
to aim for this time?

230
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,833
It looks like
we have a winner.

231
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,250
Oh! Goodness...

232
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,375
Healing yourself so
quickly has caused you

233
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,458
to surpass your limit.

234
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,750
What an unexpected bonus!

235
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,333
I think I'll go
straight for your head!

236
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,291
What the-?

237
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:07,708
Hey...

238
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,875
You okay?

239
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,333
Come on...

240
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,875
Please hurry...

241
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,083
Revert back.

242
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:17,875
Damn it.

243
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Stop, Dauf!

244
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,666
Have to...

245
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
suppress it...!

246
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,458
Concentrate!

247
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,291
Almost there.

248
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,041
I...

249
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,166
can't do it...

250
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,458
I can't!

251
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,583
What do you know?

252
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,125
You were able to
reverse the process.

253
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,250
Was that...

254
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
Did you just do that?

255
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,750
All I did was pull you
back over to our side.

256
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,875
I believe I'm starting to
see why the Organization

257
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,125
wanted you found so badly...

258
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
You are very...

259
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,625
unique.

260
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,125
Hey, what was that
all about...?

261
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,333
I was looking forward
to seeing her awaken!

262
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,000
A high ranking warrior...

263
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,083
who can control Yoki aura...

264
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,458
and a mystery fighter...

265
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,166
who can surpass her limit...

266
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,541
I'm impressed.

267
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,416
I think I'll
let you join me...

268
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,125
I'm sure I can find
a use for both of you.

269
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,833
She's so...

270
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,875
...powerful, and her Yoki aura
is dark and menacing.

271
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,208
What is she...?

272
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,750
How can a small child
control a Yoki that size?

273
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,166
In the history of the
Organization there have been

274
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
only three like her.

275
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,333
Only three times that a
Number One has awakened

276
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,875
and created such
an incredible power.

277
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,166
One during the era of men...

278
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,458
And two since
they began using women.

279
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,416
The Powerful Three,
were unbelievably strong...

280
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,541
And to avoid conflict
they separated.

281
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:10,041
One to the North, one to the
South, and one to the West...

282
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,291
And that is where
they have stayed.

283
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,041
Since then, they have remained
out of the public eye...

284
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,416
And they've come to be
known by a new name...

285
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,375
The Creatures of the Abyss.

286
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,125
Creatures of the Abyss?

287
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,541
Am I right?

288
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,416
Or did I leave
something out...

289
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,875
Riful of the West!

290
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,125
Riful...

291
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,708
That's her name?!

292
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,750
She was the first female Number
One warrior in the Organization.

293
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,375
And she reached that status
at a younger age than anyone

294
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,916
thought possible before
succumbing to her Yoma side.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,583
You're very young
to know about all that...

296
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:48,000
But I'm afraid
it's not quite accurate.

297
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,916
The three of us didn't
go separate ways

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,208
to "avoid conflict,"
as you put it...

299
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,833
It was by complete coincidence
that the territories

300
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,916
we chose didn't overlap.

301
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,416
So why have you
suddenly reemerged...?

302
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,208
And you're not
the only one...!

303
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,916
Activity from the other two
has been reported, as well.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,583
Each of you has begun to draw
all of the Awakened Beings

305
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,250
in your respective vicinities
into your lair...

306
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,375
What I can't
understand though is why?

307
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,541
What is it you're
trying to achieve.

308
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,000
You see, the thing is...

309
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,541
The man to the north
is picking fights.

310
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,083
He's been getting really
carried away lately...

311
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,375
If you ask me, this is all
because of that woman

312
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,916
he got his hands on.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,708
What woman?

314
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,166
Some Awakened Being
he discovered

315
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,208
going on a rampage in
the northern territory...

316
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,541
A woman with one horn.

317
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,875
Priscilla!

318
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,041
And it's not like I had
anything better to do,

319
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,708
so I decided to take him on.

320
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,958
Uh-huh.

321
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,875
So that's why I've been
collecting subordinates

322
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,666
to use in our war.

323
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,625
The man in the north...

324
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,625
Where can I find him?

325
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,416
Huh...?

326
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,750
What's that...?

327
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,333
You're speaking so softly
I can barely hear you.

328
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,250
Tell me how to find the Creature
of the Abyss in the north...

329
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,625
I'm going to hunt that
woman down and destroy her.

330
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,791
Well, then...

331
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,375
I suppose that means
you know this girl.

332
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,291
Shut the hell up
and answer me...

333
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,750
I want to know his name.

334
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,291
Tell me exactly
where to find the man

335
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,166
in the northern territory.

336
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,333
That's not a very
polite way to talk...

337
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,958
Let me think.

338
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,250
How about we do this?

339
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,125
If you can land
even one blow on me,

340
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,125
I'll tell you what
you want to know.

341
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,250
Too bad...

342
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,000
and you were so close.

343
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,666
Look up.

344
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,125
Damn you!

345
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,125
Come on, Dauf.

346
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,666
This isn't the best time
to stop and whine, you know.

347
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,625
Hey...

348
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,500
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

349
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,500
I think I'm beginning
to understand.

350
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,708
It seems intentionally
surpassing your limit,

351
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,458
as opposed to doing
so accidentally,

352
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,166
enhances your power and speed.

353
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,041
An interesting side effect,
but it hasn't helped you.

354
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,833
It's over...

355
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,750
Why don't you turn around
and answer my question?

356
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,541
I would...

357
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,916
But you haven't cut me...

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,166
We did have a bargain,
didn't we?

359
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,291
If you really
wanna die that badly.

360
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,625
I'll be happy
to grant your request!

361
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,666
I swear, you need more
looking after than a child.

362
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,833
Aw...

363
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,833
And right when you
were getting so close...

364
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,125
Too bad.

365
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,916
What...

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,750
What just happened

367
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,750
You came close-
you almost awakened...

368
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,500
You were allowing her all
cheap taunts to get to you...

369
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,541
That's exactly what they want.

370
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,500
We have to destroy
this monster.

371
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,125
If the Creature of the Abyss
doesn't intend to get involved,

372
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,083
then we may still have
a chance of escaping alive...

373
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,125
But in order to do that,
you and I are going to need

374
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,375
the assistance of
the other warrior here.

375
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,791
The other warrior?

376
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,583
Someone with the
ability to drive a sword

377
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,958
into this beast's armor.

378
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,333
And she can.

379
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,375
She's down on
the lower level now...

380
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,791
Jean, the Number Nine
ranked warrior.

381
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,208
The Number Nine...?

382
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,708
Here?

383
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,583
She's here, but she's in an
extremely unstable state...

384
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,291
I believe at any moment,
she could awaken.

385
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,250
There is no doubt in my
mind that Riful has been

386
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,791
having her severely tortured,

387
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,916
both physically
and psychologically...

388
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,875
And given what I know
about Jean, she would choose

389
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,958
to die rather than awaken
and join these creatures...

390
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,916
If she's still alive,
it's because the choice

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,583
no longer belongs to her.

392
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,125
Get to the lower level
and find Jean...

393
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,458
I can handle things here.

394
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,125
But if she's gone too far-
if she's beyond your help.

395
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,541
Then it's up to you
to take Jean's life.

396
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,250
Quickly...!

397
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,625
We don't have much time!

398
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,625
Get back here!

399
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,041
I'll get you!

400
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,625
This hurts way worse
than before!

401
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,791
Stop it!

402
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,208
Where is she?

403
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,666
That hurt!

404
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,000
This goes against
my sense of aesthetics,

405
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,000
so I don't do it
all that often.

406
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,208
When I unleash my Yoma power...

407
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,166
my strength increases at a
rate that is unmatched by any

408
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,208
of the other
forty-seven warriors.

409
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,833
I apologize, but I believe
you'll just have to put up

410
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,000
with my new face
until we can settle this.

411
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,125
Oh please...

412
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,208
What do you take me for...?

413
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,291
You think I'm scared of you?

414
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,291
You're gonna die!

415
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,291
I'm gonna kill you!

416
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,250
Smart girl...

417
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,291
Buy yourself some time.

418
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,333
I'm...

419
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,541
too late...

420
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,291
She's gone

421
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,416
Kill me!

422
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,083
Approaching the limit-
and surpassing it.

423
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,291
A foe from far beyond.

424
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,375
Next time...

425
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,500
The Witch's Maw...

426
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,666
Part Three.
