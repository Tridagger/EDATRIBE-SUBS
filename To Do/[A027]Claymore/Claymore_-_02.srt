1
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:26,083
You'll never kill
us all, Claymore...

2
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,333
You shouldn't be out here.
It's too dangerous.

3
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,833
Get back inside and I'll let
you know when it's safe again.

4
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,041
Come on.

5
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,083
A winged Yoma.

6
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,291
The job is finished.

7
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,416
A man will stop by later
to collect the money.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,916
You'll give it to him.

9
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,583
Wait!

10
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,291
Clare.

11
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,208
Wouldn't it be a good idea if
you took just some of the money

12
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,750
for yourself?

13
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,916
A representative from the
Organization is the one

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,875
who collects the money.

15
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:46,708
Why?

16
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,083
Is there something you need?

17
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,291
No but...

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,625
what happens if you
have an emergency...?

19
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,583
Or if you need new clothes,
like you do right now?

20
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,583
The Organization will
bring me new clothes soon...

21
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,833
Just like they do
when money is needed.

22
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,791
So do all of the Claymores
work for someone in particular?

23
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,333
We've been a part
of the Organization

24
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,916
since we were very young.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,541
Really?

26
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,875
How young?

27
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,125
That's irrelevant...

28
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,708
Age differs for us...

29
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,750
We cease the aging process
once are infected with Yoma

30
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,416
and become a Claymore
within the Organization...

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,333
Claymores are half Yoma...

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,083
Which means Clare
is half Yoma...

33
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,625
But she's still human too.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,625
Half human, half monster.

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Hold on...

36
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,750
Are you becoming hungry?

37
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,125
Yeah...

38
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,500
I mean we haven't eaten
anything since this morning.

39
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,708
Aren't you even
a little hungry?

40
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,291
Can you cook lizard?

41
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,208
Alright...

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,250
It should be cooked by now.

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,375
Here you go...

44
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,041
--Thanks.
--take it.

45
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,958
It may be ugly but
it sure does smell good.

46
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,916
I wish I had some
of my seasonings...

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,375
oh, well.

48
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,291
Clare...?

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,125
What's wrong?
Do you not like my cooking?

50
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:55,916
No...

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,166
it tasted good...

52
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,833
It's just that I'm
already full, that's all.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,500
Wait, how can you be full...?

54
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,291
You only took
a couple of small bites.

55
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,000
It has to do with
the way our bodies work...

56
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,416
A small amount of food
eaten every two days or so

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,958
is sufficient for us...

58
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,083
It's not uncommon for
Claymores to go a week

59
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,250
without any food
or water intake.

60
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,916
A whole week?

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,416
Watching you eat
like that is invigorating.

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,416
When your appetite is
non-existent you tend to

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,875
not enjoy the act
of eating all that much.

64
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,916
Well...

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,791
that just means
more for me, right?

66
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,041
I suppose...

67
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,833
Food is a luxury
reserved for humans.

68
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,625
Sorry...

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,708
why did you become a Claymore?

70
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,083
Joining with the Organization
was my only option.

71
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:39,875
Huh.

72
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,125
Is it hard to become one?

73
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
Yes.

74
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,458
Then why would you...

75
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,500
I guess I shouldn't
be prying like this...

76
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,416
But she seems so lonely.

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,166
I wonder if she has
a family or any friends.

78
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,375
What's that...

79
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
on your chest?

80
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,333
Once we reach a certain
skill level, we are able

81
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,333
to take on solo assignments
and receive a personal emblem.

82
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,541
It's a unique
representation of our name

83
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,583
and is used to distinguish
us from each other.

84
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,666
So, when was
your emblem given to you?

85
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,666
Where you going?

86
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,708
Don't follow me.

87
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,375
Bathroom break?

88
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,708
Over here.

89
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,583
You're very sweet...

90
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,166
Letting that child tag along...

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,541
He'll soon interfere
with your work.

92
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,375
The boy's only a cook...

93
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,041
He won't get in my way.

94
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,583
Your cook, huh...?

95
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,250
You almost sound human
when you talk like that.

96
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,208
Does the boy conjure up
a distant but pleasant memory

97
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,291
from a previous era...?

98
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,875
How sentimental.

99
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,666
Did you bring the change
of clothes I requested?

100
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,208
Turn around.

101
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,916
You're becoming reckless.

102
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,708
The wound may have
healed up this time...

103
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,250
but don't let that blind you to
the fact that you're vulnerable

104
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,625
in certain places
just like anyone.

105
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,083
You are healing up
nicely though...

106
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,750
You shouldn't have
to address it after tonight.

107
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,333
I wonder what the boy would
think if he saw your body...

108
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,958
Try to keep the
conversations to a minimum.

109
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,500
If you let yourself
become attached,

110
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,250
you're the one who will suffer.

111
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,333
Oh, I almost forgot.

112
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,125
I was asked to
give you something...

113
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,458
here it is...

114
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,625
A black card...?

115
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,916
It must be a mistake.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
There's no way I could...

117
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,625
Feel free to read it
at your leisure.

118
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,250
Who could it be?

119
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,041
What's taking her so long...?

120
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,166
She must've really had to go.

121
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,541
Hello.

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,625
What's wrong...?

123
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,458
Is everything okay?

124
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,958
Hey, look...

125
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,000
I dried all the leftover meat,
so whenever you get hungry

126
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,291
just let me know
and I'll have it ready.

127
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,541
Clare?

128
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,208
Tomorrow we head for Schiele...

129
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,291
We'll leave at dawn so
be ready to move, understood?

130
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:13,916
Oh...

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,625
Sure.

132
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
It's gonna be okay...

133
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,750
Just stay with me
and we'll be fine.

134
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't cry...

135
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,541
Get out of their way...

136
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,333
Hey is...

137
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,166
that a...

138
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,083
Well I'll be damned.

139
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,041
It's a silver-eyed witch!

140
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,458
Why did she come here?

141
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,916
Did we send for her?

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,458
There's no way.

143
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,000
No one's been attacked by a Yoma
within twenty miles of here.

144
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,250
Just seeing her
gives me the creeps.

145
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,625
I don't like this one bit.

146
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
I don't care if
they mean well or not,

147
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,125
those witches are trouble.

148
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,500
How rude...

149
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,375
You know if a Yoma had
eaten some of their families

150
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,708
they would all be
begging you to stay.

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,041
Yeah?

152
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,791
Uh, good morning!

153
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,875
Do you have any rooms ready?

154
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,791
Well, uhhh...

155
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
It's for the boy only...

156
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,000
I won't be staying.

157
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,958
You're not...?

158
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,208
Where you going?

159
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,000
You'll stay here until
I finish my assignment.

160
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,666
I wanna go!

161
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,750
Just wait for me in the room.

162
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,458
Um...

163
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,291
so...

164
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,666
Are you hunting a Yoma here?

165
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,333
When will you be coming back?

166
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,416
Later...

167
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,750
Your village is
clear of any Yoma...

168
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,875
--You have my word.
--Wait...

169
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,833
If there's no Yoma to kill
then why aren't you staying?

170
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,833
Don't worry.

171
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,916
Yeah, right...

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,750
You're ditching me,
aren't you?

173
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,250
I'm not.

174
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
So, there is
a Yoma after all...

175
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,208
That reminds me,
I saw another Claymore

176
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,625
just outside of town
a few days ago.

177
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,000
On Schiele Mountain?

178
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,166
Uh... yeah.

179
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,958
I'll be back.

180
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,541
Thank God.

181
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,250
But Clare.

182
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,083
Poor boy...

183
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,083
With all the time you've
been spending with a Claymore,

184
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,708
you don't seem to know much.

185
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,041
Huh?

186
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,333
Is it possible you're
not even aware of the fact

187
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,958
that a Claymore is
half-human, half-monster?

188
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,875
I know about that...

189
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,375
But...

190
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,041
Clare is no monster.

191
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,791
She's no human...

192
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,500
They take the flesh and blood
of Yoma into their bodies.

193
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,125
Yoma's flesh and blood?

194
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,208
That's what makes
them mixed-breeds.

195
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,708
They're equal parts
human and Yoma...

196
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,916
Our organization created them
to fight the Yoma epidemic.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,541
But for some unknown
reason they were

198
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,791
only successful
in modifying the women.

199
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,041
You should know that
since you're buddies with one.

200
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,583
Hold on...

201
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,750
You're saying Claymore's
were human to start with?

202
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,791
Who knows?

203
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,958
History isn't clear on that.

204
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,375
Then how do they take
in the flesh and blood

205
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,041
of Yoma and survive?

206
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,416
Survive...? They don't
'survive.' But, they do fight

207
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,166
the Yoma inside themselves
with what little humanity

208
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,750
remains after
their transformation.

209
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,583
That's the reason they remain
an ally to your race.

210
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,750
Before, humans were
helpless against the Yoma,

211
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,666
making Claymores
the ideal weapon.

212
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,166
The ideal weapon?

213
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,041
But there is one fatal flaw
that affects all Claymores.

214
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,708
No matter how much they fight...

215
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,125
they eventually become Yoma.

216
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,375
Huh?

217
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,458
The more power they utilize...

218
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,208
the closer their bodies
inch towards becoming a monster.

219
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,208
Such is the way of things,
I'm afraid.

220
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,666
Those who are no longer
capable of suppressing it

221
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,041
and become Yoma...

222
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,958
are euthanized
by the Organization.

223
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,041
Then...

224
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,041
that means...

225
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,083
Clare will become a Yoma...?

226
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,291
You're lying...

227
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,916
It can't be...

228
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,791
No...

229
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,458
it hurts...

230
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,541
it burns me...

231
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,875
Clare!!!

232
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,375
Raki...?

233
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,958
Didn't I tell you
to stay behind?

234
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,291
Please Clare...

235
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,583
What's the real reason
you're out here - tell me.

236
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,875
You didn't come all the way out
here to become a Yoma, did you?

237
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,000
It was unwise for you
to follow me.

238
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,666
Your safety is in danger...

239
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,833
I've told you -
there is no Yoma here.

240
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,458
However.

241
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,583
There is someone who
has reached their Yoki limit.

242
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,375
Yoki...

243
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,250
I saw another Claymore just
outside of town a few days ago.

244
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,375
It's the other Claymore, right?

245
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,541
Correct...

246
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,875
I'm going to kill her.

247
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,166
Wait you are...?

248
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,375
But she's on your side.

249
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,791
There's no choice.

250
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,291
A Black Card...?

251
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,958
What's it mean?

252
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,750
On the day of our inauguration,
each of us is given a single

253
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,333
black card to store
within our swords.

254
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,583
For every battle we fight,
the line is blurred between

255
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,833
our awareness as humans
and our awareness as Yoma.

256
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,333
In time, we reach the limits
of our human mind...

257
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,791
And transform into
something that we hate...

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,208
Yoma.

259
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,625
Then, death is a gift...

260
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,375
a release from this...

261
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,250
curse.

262
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,208
We then send our black card...

263
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:34,166
to the one person that we would
like the most to kill us.

264
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,375
So then...

265
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,916
Which Claymore is it that
sent you her black card?

266
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,333
She joined the organization
around the same time I did.

267
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,750
We always comforted
each other through the worst

268
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,958
of experiences.

269
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,791
On the path to becoming
mixed-breed warriors...

270
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,125
The pain is utterly
devastating...

271
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,583
We were only able to sleep
while huddled together.

272
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,791
It's gonna be okay...

273
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,541
Just stay with me
and we'll be fine.

274
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,583
It's been too long...

275
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,458
my friend.

276
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,333
Elena.

277
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,833
You haven't changed.

278
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,625
You look the same
as I remember you.

279
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,375
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these conditions.

280
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,583
I wanted to see you.

281
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,583
It's been an eternity, yet it
only seems like yesterday...

282
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,250
Those days were filled
with nothing but pain.

283
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,375
Luckily, the only memories
I still carry with me

284
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
are the happy ones we shared.

285
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,333
I actually began
hunting later than you,

286
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,375
but I reached my Yoki limit
sooner and now await my death...

287
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,750
How pitiful of me.

288
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,625
I really believed
the power of Yoma would

289
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,125
bring us greater strength.

290
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,250
But now...

291
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,291
Now I see that the power
of the human heart...

292
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:53,041
has to be stronger than the Yoma
constantly churning within us.

293
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,458
Uh...

294
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,291
No...

295
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,250
Please Clare...

296
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,708
save me...

297
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,291
Do it quickly...

298
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,125
While my heart is still human
and my soul is my own.

299
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,166
Clare, please don't do it...!

300
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,750
She's your friend!

301
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,833
There has to be another option!

302
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,333
Do it.

303
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,250
Clare.

304
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Don't go...

305
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,708
Clare don't!

306
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,333
Thank you...

307
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,125
my friend.

308
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
Now...

309
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,708
I can die as a human being.

310
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,291
Elena and I...

311
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:41,708
Joined the organization
around the same time.

312
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,875
We always comforted each other
through the worst of it.

313
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,666
She was a skilled warrior.

314
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,750
It's a tragedy that we
were forced to meet again

315
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,666
under such circumstances.

316
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,625
I will always
cherish our memories.

317
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,208
And...

318
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,541
Having joined the Organization
when I was still very young...

319
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,458
Elena was the only friend
I've ever had in my life.

320
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,541
Why...

321
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,833
I just don't get it...!

322
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,333
Why fight Yoma when you have
to endure so much suffering?

323
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,291
Why Clare?

324
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,000
Because...

325
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,000
it's the reason why we exist.

326
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,041
Evil lurks within the shadows.

327
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,333
A darkness so profound,
it swallows the night.

328
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,041
Next time,
The Darkness In Paradise.
