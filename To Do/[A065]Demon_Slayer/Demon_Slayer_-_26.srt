Zenitsu: Incredible.

00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,152

Tanjiro: I'm still up for more.

13
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,627
Let's go for a run.

14
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,162
Wanna join me?

15
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,831
Zenitsu: Doing
total concentration, constant?

16
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,832
Tanjiro: Yeah.

( Grunts )

18
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,236
Zenitsu: I gotta keep this up?

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,437
Inosuke: Do me next!

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,639
Zenitsu: How's this?

21
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,174
Inosuke: That's nothin'!

22
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,242
Zenitsu: More brawn than brain.

23
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,178

( Structure creaking )

30
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,479
Is this her blood demon art?

31
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,081
It looks like the whole space

32
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,817
is distorted around that woman.

33

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,500
( Structure creaking )

35
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,506
Only the lower ranks
of the twelve kizuki

36
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,973
have been summoned.

37
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,110
That's never happened before.

38
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,247
Lower five isn't here yet.

39
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,915
- ( Gasps )
- ( All gasping )

40
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,818

Is this her doing?

ｶ

42
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,328
what is it with this woman?

43
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,464
Who is she?

44
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,335
Kibutsuji: Lower your heads,
and kneel down.

45
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,537
( Lower six gasps )

46
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,773
Kibutsuji: Prostrate yourselves.

47
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,547
Lower six:
That's Master Muzan's voice.

48
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,349
- I didn't recognize him at all!
- ( Sweat pattering )

49
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,419
Even his aura
is completely different.

50
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,122
His disguise is astounding.

51
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,825
( Lower four gasps )
Please forgive us, Master!

52
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,627
Since you've assumed
a different form, we--

53
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,897
Kibutsuji: Who gave you
permission to speak?

54
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,500
Don't presume your thoughts
are of any worth to me.

55
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,437
All you are allowed to do
is answer my questions.

56
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,239
( Singers vocalizing )

57
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,441
The lower five was killed.

58
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,143
His name was Rui.

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,647
This is my single question
for all of you.

60
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,517
Why is it you demons
in the lower ranks

61
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,386
are so utterly weak?

62
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,187
You shouldn't be satisfied

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,790
merely being
among the twelve kizuki.

64
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,592
That is only the start.

65
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,462
You must devour more humans,
gain more power.

66
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,532
That is the path
to becoming useful to me.

67
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,268
For over a century,

68
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,337
the upper members
of the twelve kizuki

69
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,140
have remained unchanged,

70
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,142
and it has always
been those members

71
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,544
who have disposed
of the hashira.

72
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,548
Meanwhile, how many times
have you been replaced?

73
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,617
Lower six:
You make it sound so easy,

74
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,884
but the fact is--

75
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,820
Kibutsuji:
"You make it sound so easy,

76
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,156
but the fact is..."

77
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,425
What? Say it.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,394
Lower six: He can read my mind?

79
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,763
This is bad.

80
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,831
Kibutsuji: What is bad?

81
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,633
Finish your thought.

82
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,369
( Lower six shuddering )

83
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,305
Forgive me, Master Kibutsuji!

84
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:04,376
Please! Please show me mercy!

85
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,313
I'm sorry!
I'm so very, very sorry!

86
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,248
( Shrieks )

87
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,718
( Mouth burps )

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,421
Lower three:
Why is this happening?

89
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,523
Am I next?

90
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,794
After all I went through
to become a twelve kizuki,

91
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,262
why? Why this?

92
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,332
I thought I was
going to do so much more!

93
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,470
Kibutsuji: Are you more afraid
of the demon slayers than of me?

94
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,271
Lower four: No!

95
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,673
Kibutsuji: I'm sure every time

96
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,476
you run into
a hashira-level Demon Slayer,

97
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,344
your only thoughts
are of escaping.

98
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,613
Lower four:
No, I'd never do that!

99
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,548
I would put
my own life on the line

100
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,417
in order to fight for you!

101
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,285
Kibutsuji:
You're not contradicting

102
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,421
what I just said, are you?

103
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,755
( Lower four sobs )

104
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,224

( Gurgling )

107
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,699
Lower three: It's all hopeless.

108
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,235
Whether we agree
or disagree with him,

109
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,603
he's going to kill us.

110
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,140
We can't beat him
in a fight, either.

111
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,243
In that case...

112
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,046
( Lower two gasps )

113
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,113

lower one: What a fool.

116
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,191
Lower three: I just need
to make it out of here somehow.

117
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,659
Now that I'm far away...

118
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,598
Kibutsuji: The twelve kizuki
are better off

119
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,134
consisting of just
the upper ranks.

120
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,871
I will be dismantling
the others.

121
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,639
Lower three: He got me?

122
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,208
How?

123
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,944
Was it
that fute player's technique?

124
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,413
No, I didn't hear it
make any sounds.

125
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,614
( Groans )

126
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,385
I can't regenerate my body. Why?

Kibutsuji: Do either of you
have any last words to share?

131
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,572
( Lower two gasps )

132
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,507
I can still be of use to you!

133
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,642
If you could just give me
a little bit of time,

134
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,444
I swear you won't regret it!

135
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,581
Kibutsuji: Exactly how long
are you asking for?

136
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,718
How do you intend
to be useful to me,

137
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,186
and what precisely
can you accomplish

138
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,555
with your meager skills?

139
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,857
Lower two: Your blood!

140
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,260
If you could give me
a portion of your blood,

141
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,130
I will surely rise
to meet your expectations!

142
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,532
I will fight for you
stronger than before!

143
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,468
Kibutsuji: Do you actually
believe you're in any position

144
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,670
to order me
to give you my blood?

145
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,739
Shameless is an understatement.

146
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,874
You will remember your place.

147
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,209
( Lower two gasping )

148
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,745
You misunderstand me!

149
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,279
I only said...

150
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,282
Kibutsuji: Silence.
I misunderstood nothing.

151
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,418
I am never mistaken.

152
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,755
I am the one
who calls the shots.

153
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,557
My word is absolute.

154
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,828
What I say
is correct by default.

155
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,497
It is not for you to refute.

156
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,101
And yet you try
to give me instructions?

157
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,137
You deserve to die for that.

158
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,146
Do you have any last words?

159
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,784
Lower three:
He'll be next to go.

160
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,121
Everything hinges
on the Master's mood.

161
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,691
I'll be dead soon myself.

162
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,127
Well, let me see.

163
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,796
( Sighs )

164
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,200
This is all
like a wonderful dream for me.

165
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,270
For me to be able to perish
by your very hand in the flesh.

166
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,605
And I so enjoyed hearing

167
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,608
the other demons's
dying breaths.

168
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,744
How truly fortunate am I.

169
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,014
I do so love to see others

170
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,616
in the throes
of despair and agony.

171
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,352
It's like a dream
come true for me.

172
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,256
You have my profound gratitude
for saving me for the end.

173

( Gagging )

174
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,108
Kibutsuji: That's more like it.

175
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,777
I'll give you
a generous amount of my blood,

176
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,548
although you may not be able
to handle its magnitude and die.

177
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,252
If you do manage to acclimate,

178
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,721
you are certain
to become stronger.

179
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,090
Then you are
to make yourself useful...

180
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,294
By killing hashira
of the demon slayers.

181
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,531
If you are able to kill

182
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,333
the Demon Slayer
wearing hanafuda earrings,

183
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,536
I will give you
even more of my blood.

184
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,804
( Lower one coughs )

185
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,673
( Sighs )

186
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,411
( Chords playing )

187
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,156
- ( Chords stop )
- ( Wind blowing )

188
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,092
( Gasps )

189
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,760
What's this?

190
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,495
I see something.

191
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,332
It's pouring into me
along with Master Muzan's blood.

192
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,634
ｶ

193
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,570
( gasping )

194
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,106
If I kill a hashira
and this kid,

195
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,508
I can get even more blood.

196
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,544
It's like a dream.

197
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,715
Kasugai: It is now morning!

198
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,783
Wake up, everyone!

199
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,384
Inosuke: The hell?

200
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,787
Zenitsu: Uh, what's going on?

201
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,790
Kasugai: The casualties
of the mugen train--

202
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:55,594
more than 40 are missing
as it currently stands.

203
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,797
You are to join
Kyojuro Rengoku on-site.

204
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,401
Head west at once!
Head west at once!

205
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,269
( Wind blowing )

206
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,173
Sion,

207
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,376
I've decided to send
Tanjiro and the others.

208
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,311
Might I ask what caused you

209
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,381
to recommend him
in the first place, Shinobu?

210
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,516
Shinobu: Tanjiro has a pure soul

211
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,453
and will work diligently
toward all his goals,

212
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,390
and the potential he showed
exceeded my expectations.

213
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,326
And perhaps
most importantly of all,

214
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,128
he has a clear path in mind

215
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,664
in regards
to defeating Kibutsuji.

216
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,866
Ubuyashiki: I am
in complete agreement with you

217
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,602
on those counts.

218
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,004
Shinobu: On another matter,

219
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,208
Tanjiro told me that his father
had used fire breathing.

220
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,010
Ubuyashiki: Ah.

221
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,145
Shinobu: As of now,
there's no denying

222
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,481
that he still
has quite a way to go,

223
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,618
but I think that Rengoku,
our flame hashira,

224
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,753
could give him assistance.

225
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,755
Ubuyashiki: Fair enough.

226
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,425
Considering that his sister
is not a danger to humans,

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,562
as well as the fact
he came face to face with Muzan,

228
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,364
these signs
may very well point

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,134
towards this being
Tanjiro's destiny.

230
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,971
Tanjiro: All right,
it's time to go!

231
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,476
Hmm? Someone's coming.

232
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,179
( Grunts )

233
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,449
He was really intent
on bumping into me.

234
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,185
Wait. This guy...

235
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,788
Was he at final selection?

236
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,690
ｶ

237
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,527
he bulked up a lot
in such a short time...

238
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,264
But there's something else...

239
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,066
His scent.

240
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,334
It's been awhile!

241
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,969
Glad to see you're doing well!

242
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,474
( Groans )

243
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,741
Aoi: Oh, really?

244
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,477
You're heading out now?

245
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,345
It was only for a short time,

246
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,014
but I'm glad
we got to spend it together.

247
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,415
Good luck out there.

248
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,018
You take care now.

249
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,354
Tanjiro: Thanks for everything.
You looked after us,

250
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,089
even though
you were busy yourself,

251
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,325
and now we can
get back into battle.

252
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,497
Aoi: No need to thank me.

253
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,500
It was by chance
I got through final selection,

254
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,835
and after that,
I was too cowardly

255
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,637
to even step foot into battle.

256
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,442
- Tanjiro: None of that matters.
- ( Aoi sighs )

257
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,245
Tanjiro: Because you
kindly helped me out, aoi,

258
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,381
you're a part of me now.

259
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,851
All your emotions, I'll carry
them into the battlefield.

260
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,586
( Aoi gasps )

261
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:37,989
Tanjiro: If I get hurt, I hope
you'll look after me again!

262
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,958
ｶ

263
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,265
There you are!

264
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,600
( Running footsteps )

265
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,336
Hey, Kanao!

266
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,137
We're heading out now.

267
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,539
Thanks for everything.

268
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,411
Uh...

269
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,679
Hmm? What's that?

270
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:14,092
Kanao: All I did was follow
the teacher's orders,

271
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,095
and so there's no need
for you to thank me.

272
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,630
Farewell.

273
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,033
Tanjiro:
She actually talked to me!

274
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,768
What was that you just flipped?

275
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:23,969
Kanao: Bye for now.

276
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,170
Tanjiro: Money?

277
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,972
It says "heads"
and "tails," huh?

278
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,173
Why did you flip it?

279
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,375
Kanao: Goodbye.

280
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,443
Tanjiro: You sure
made that thing spin.

281
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,645
Kanao: I flip this
to help me decide

282
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,713
things that weren't ordered.

283
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,184
Just now, I decided
whether to speak to you or not.

284
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,454
Don't speak was heads,
and do speak was tails,

285
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,057
and tails is what it landed on.

286
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,059
Farewell.

287
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,328
Tanjiro: Why don't you
choose for yourself?

288
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,464
Which do you wanna do?

289
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,199
Kanao: It doesn't matter.

290
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,669
Nothing matters to me,
so I can't decide for myself.

291
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,005
Tanjiro: I don't think
there's anything in this world

292
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,240
that doesn't matter.

293
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,009
I guess...

294
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,478
The voice in your heart
is just really tiny.

295
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,414
( Groans )

296
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,451
Following orders is important
to an extent, but...

297
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,153
( Grunts )

298
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,755
Hey, can I borrow that?

299
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,556
Kanao: Uh, sure.

300
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,025
Tanjiro: Thank you.

301
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,363
Okay, we're gonna
use this to decide!

302
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,365
Kanao: Decide?

303
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,303
Tanjiro: Whether you'll listen
to your own heart

304
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,971
from this point on!

305
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,242
Whoa!

306
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,110
I flipped it way too high!

307
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,313
Heads! Let's make it heads!

308
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,648
If it comes up as heads,

309
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,350
you're going
to follow your heart!

310
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,052
- ( Wind blows )
- ( Kanao winces )

311
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,253
Tanjiro: Huh? Hey!

312
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,788
Where did it go?

313
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,723
( Stammers )

314
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,058
Oh, is that it?

315
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:57,929
You see that, Kanao? I got it!

316
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,264
( Kanao gasps )

317
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,535
Tanjiro: Are you ready?

318
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,604
Kanao: Which will it be?

319
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,206
His back was blocking it,

320
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,142
so I couldn't see
which way it fell.

321
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,347
Tanjiro: It came up as heads!

322
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,349
Here you go!

323
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,618
ｶ

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,087
- remember...
- ( Kanao gasps )

325
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,422
Tanjiro: It's the heart
that drives people,

326
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,225
so it can grow
as strong as you need it to.

327
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,227
( Kanao whimpers )

328
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,196
Tanjiro: All right.
See you later!

329
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,434
Kanao: How--how did it
come up heads?!

330
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,638
I saw his hand
when he flipped it.

331
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,308
I'm sure he didn't cheat,
but still...

332
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,111
Tanjiro: Just by chance.

333
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,381
Although, if it were tails,
I was gonna keep tossing it

334
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,250
until it finally
came up as heads.

335
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,318
( Laughs )

336
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,654
( Kanao gasps )

337
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,656
Tanjiro: Take care of yourself!

338
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,492
( Footsteps receding )

339
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,539
( All blowing and grunting )

340
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,075
Girls: You can do it!
You can do it! You can do it!

341
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,547
Great job, everyone!

342
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,148
Kiyo: Here!

343
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,482
- Inosuke: Ahh.
- Tanjiro: Thanks, girls.

344
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,151
Zenitsu: Don't eat it now.

345
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,154
Girls: We hope you all
defeat a lot of demons.

346
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,422
Tanjiro: We'll do our best.

347
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,490
Zenitsu: Hey, I told you
not to eat it now!

348
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,759
Inosuke: Shut up!

349
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,360
Zenitsu: Someone should
teach you some manners!

350
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,628
Tanjiro: Tomioka!

351
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,165
Tomioka:
Heading into battle now?

352
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,567
Tanjiro: Yes, sir.

353
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,569
Tomioka: I hear
that you've mastered

354
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,703
total concentration, constant.

355
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,172
Tanjiro: I have.

356
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,174
Tomioka: You should keep at it.

357
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,275
Tanjiro: Yes, sir.

358
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,444
Tomioka...

359
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,247
About Nezuko...

360
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,515
Thank you very much.

361
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,252
The fact that you put
your life on the line,

362
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,987
I had no idea.

363
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,656
I don't know
how to ever repay you.

364
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:08,460
Tomioka: You can thank me
by doing your best work.

365
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,396
Our mission is to kill demons.

366
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,631
That is all. Got it?

367
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,533
Tanjiro: Got it!

368
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,469
( Girls moan )

369
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,671
Kiyo: Be safe, you guys.

370
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:23,475
Zenitsu: Oh, no! Saying goodbye
has broken your little hearts.

371
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,210
I can stay behind if you like.

372
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,146
Kiyo: Zenitsu,
while you're on your journey,

373
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:32,017
please learn to be considerate
and respectful of girls, okay?

374
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,018
Zenitsu: Yes.

375
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,753
Inosuke: I'm feeling happy.

376
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,422
Zenitsu: You do
feel a little sad

377
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,023
that I'm leaving, though, right?

378
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,591
Girls: We're not sad!

379
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,160
Tanjiro: All right, everyone!

380
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,428
( Footstep echoes )

381
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,763
We're heading out now!

382
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,699
( Singers vocalizing )

383
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,504
Inosuke: Hey,
wait a damn minute!

384
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,105
( Whistle blowing )

385
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,175
Wh-what the...

386
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:00,111
What the hell is this creature?!

387
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,647
Wait. Could it be?

388
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,315
I've heard of such a being,

389
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,250
the Master and ruler
of this land!

390
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,253
At such an intimidating size,

391
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,188
there's no mistaking it!

392
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,191
It looks like it's asleep,
but don't let that fool you!

393
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,461
Zenitsu: It's a train.
You've never seen one?

394
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,395
Inosuke: Pipe down,
or you'll wake it!

395
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,065
I'll lead the charge
to take it down!

396
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,534
- Tanjiro: Inosuke, stop!
- Inosuke: Huh?

397
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,671
Tanjiro: This might be the
guardian spirit of this land,

398
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,340
so we shouldn't
be attacking it carelessly.

399
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:31,076
Zenitsu: Uh,
I said it's a train.

400
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,610
You've never seen one, either?

401
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,147
A vehicle for transportation?

402
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,682
Man, you're sheltered.

403
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,550
Tanjiro: Huh? A train?

404
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:41,086
That's what the crow
was talking about?

405
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,154
- Eh?
- Zenitsu: Huh?

406
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,957
What is he doing?

407
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,494
( Inosuke shrieks )

408
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,296
Ready or not,
I'm comin' through!

409
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,964
Zenitsu: Stop embarrassing us!

410
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,432
( Conductor blows whistle )

411
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,168
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

412
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,369
- ( Zenitsu shrieks )
- Conductor: Look!

413
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,304
These three have swords!

414
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,907
The police! Call the police!

415
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,309
Zenitsu: Not good!
Not good! Not good!

416
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,377
Run for it!

417
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,313
We went through hell

418
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,182
'cause of you, Inosuke!
Say you're sorry!

419
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,250
Inosuke: Oh, yeah?!
Explain to me

420
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,520
why we had to run from
those guys in the first place?!

421
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,121
Zenitsu: 'Cause demon slayers

422
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,590
aren't officially recognized
by the government,

423
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,459
so we can't just have our swords
out in public like that.

424
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,529
If we told them
about the demons,

425
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,331
it's not like they would
believe us, anyway, you know?

426
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,401
Tanjiro: But we're
trying hard to help everyone.

427
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,203
Zenitsu: It's the way things go.

428
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,272
For now,
let's hide our swords away.

429
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,807
( Inosuke laughs )

430
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,009
( Chuckling )

431
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,612
Zenitsu: We can see them.
Put something on.

432
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,047
( Whistle blowing )

433
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,683
Oh, no! The train's leaving!

434
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,152
Are the police still around?

435
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,686
Tanjiro: We have to go,
either way!

436
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,155
Inosuke: Hah hah!

437
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,758
Here I come, Master of the land!

438
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,359
Zenitsu: What are you doing?!

439
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,627
Tanjiro: We should go, too!

440
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,963
Conductor: Hey! You three!

441
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,699
Zenitsu: Tanjiro! Inosuke!

442
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,101
Tanjiro: Zenitsu!

443
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,503
( All grunt )

444
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,439
( Singers vocalizing )

445
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,310
( Inosuke whoops )

446
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,612
This thing's fast!

447
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,649
- Zenitsu: Hey, Tanjiro...
- Tanjiro: Eh?

448
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:21,719
Zenitsu: You sure
about bringing Nezuko along?

449
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,122
Wouldn't
the safest place for her

450
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,724
be back at headquarters?

451
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,794
( Tanjiro grunts )

452
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,528
This is fine.

453
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:34,333
Wherever we go,
we will always be together.

454
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,604
We're never
going to be apart again.

455
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,605
ｶ

456
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,507
( singing in Japanese )

457
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,517
( Zenitsu chuckles )

458
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,691
Tanjiro: No matter
what it takes,

459
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,427
your big brother will save you!

460
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:04,696
Muzan Kibutsuji,

461
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,165
no matter where you go,

462
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,435
I promise you won't escape me!

463
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,370
Nezuko's staying with me.

464
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,640
Nothing's gonna break us apart.

465
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,443
The bond
between Nezuko and I...

466
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,445
Cannot be severed...

467
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,380
Not by anyone!

468
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,319
Nezuko...

469
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,323
I swear to you...

470
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:33,192
