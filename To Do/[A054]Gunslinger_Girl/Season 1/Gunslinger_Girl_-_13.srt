1
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,666
I never realized you had such
a sweet tooth, Henrietta.

2
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,916
Well lately... the tea has
been tasting kind of bitter,

3
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,791
so I've been
adding... more sugar.

4
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,666
It tastes better that way.

5
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,666
I know... From here on out your
nickname is gonna be Sweetie.

6
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,291
Hehe, come on, Triela.

7
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,875
Haha, I'm just
kidding around.

8
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,666
I think you all
know the truth.

9
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,500
What?

10
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,666
We're all going to die!

11
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,416
We'll all die empty and
alone! It's the truth!

12
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,916
Marco's so angry at me
that I wish I could die now

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,666
and get it over with... 
Why can't I just die?!

14
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,416
If you want to die
then kill yourself!

15
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,625
I should never have
bothered saving you!

16
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,000
Henrietta.

17
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,458
Did you ever find
anyone to take us?

18
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,416
Huh?

19
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Remember... You wanted to
watch the meteor shower tonight

20
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
but thought
it'd be better

21
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,750
to watch from the
training grounds.

22
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,416
You said all the light
pollution from Rome

23
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,333
would make it harder to
see anything from here.

24
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,791
Oh, that's right.

25
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,708
Sorry! I
have to go.

26
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,916
So who's
gonna take us?

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,625
Oh... I took
care of it.

28
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,291
I already asked
Jose to take us.

29
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,250
Here.
Look at this.

30
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:29,958
Okay.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,916
See the double star? That's
the Rigel binary system.

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,583
It's known as the
'Left Leg of the Giant.'

33
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,125
Jose. Do you
think Angelica

34
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,958
will be in the
hospital for awhile?

35
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,083
Yeah.

36
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,458
Everyone's...
worried about her.

37
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,541
Why don't you go
visit her tomorrow?

38
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,875
Okay.

39
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,416
Must be all the light
pollution coming from Rome...

40
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,625
A hundred years ago I'm sure
you could see every star

41
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,916
in the sky
from here.

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll be at the training
grounds tomorrow.

43
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:22,208
We should have a great view of
the meteor shower from there.

44
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,166
Uh, Henrietta.

45
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,666
Yes, Jose?

46
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,416
I'm sorry... Some... some
urgent work just came up.

47
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,166
I won't be able to
take you tomorrow.

48
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,125
Oh that's...
That's okay.

49
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,333
Don't worry about it.

50
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,166
I'm sure I can find
someone else to take us.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,333
See, I told you.

52
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,166
But everything was planned
out until yesterday.

53
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,791
We're not watching the
meteor shower tomorrow?

54
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,541
Hmm, If worse comes to worse,
we could go up on the roof

55
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,916
and see at least
a few of them.

56
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,750
Alright then.

57
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,125
Tomorrow I'll
find someone else

58
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,041
to take us to the
training grounds.

59
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,333
Really?

60
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,333
We have been looking
forward to it for awhile.

61
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,500
Hear that?

62
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,916
Yeah.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Good night.

64
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,875
Night.

65
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,666
Don't worry.

66
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sure Triela will figure
something out for us.

67
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:45,791
Yeah.

68
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,916
But all I wanted...

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,958
was to watch the shooting
stars with Jose.

70
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,666
I think you all
know the truth.

71
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,916
What?

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,208
We're all going to die!

73
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,000
We'll all die empty and
alone! It's the truth!

74
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,875
Marco's so angry at me
that I wish I could die now

75
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,291
and get it over with... 
Why can't I just die?!

76
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:51,166
I tell ya... the things I
do for Henrietta sometimes.

77
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,750
You spoil her too much.

78
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,125
She seems to think you
can fix anything Triela.

79
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,250
I don't mind really. I'll
just have to make it happen.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,666
Is she visiting
Angelica?

81
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,541
Nice shooting.

82
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,500
Thank you.

83
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,541
Hey, Jean.

84
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,541
What's up?

85
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:34,000
Is Angelica... do you
think she's gonna die?

86
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,625
I doubt she has
long to live.

87
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,208
A cyborg's life
span is limited.

88
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:46,000
The question is how to best
utilize the time you have.

89
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,416
Don't worry. You still
have a long while to go.

90
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,333
Okay.

91
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,791
Angelica?

92
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Henrietta.

93
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:12,166
Thanks for visiting me.

94
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,291
The flowers are beautiful.

95
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,250
How do you feel?

96
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,916
My body feels heavy...

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,625
I've been having a hard time
concentrating on anything...

98
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,833
But other than
that, I feel okay...

99
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,750
I'm sure in a few
days I'll feel better

100
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,791
and be back at work.

101
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,416
We can't wait for
you to come back.

102
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,083
Thanks.

103
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:42,041
I think that's the Chief's
dog... I saw him earlier.

104
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,750
Angelica.

105
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:55,500
Is there something
wrong...? Are you okay?

106
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,208
Pero.

107
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,500
What Angelica?

108
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:05,916
The name of... the
dog I used to have.

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Angelica.

110
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,958
Pero.

111
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,750
Henrietta... When
did you get here?

112
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
Huh?

113
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,000
What beautiful flowers.

114
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:30,583
Thanks so much.

115
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,750
Where's Marco?
Is he not here?

116
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:39,083
No, he's not here yet.
He must be busy with work.

117
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,750
Claes.

118
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,541
Hospitals really
aren't so bad...

119
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,041
I mean sometimes it
gets really boring,

120
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,458
but I do get
visitors everyday.

121
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:16,583
Someone just came
by... It was...

122
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,375
Angelica...

123
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,625
Angelica... I just
want to say I'm sorry

124
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,083
for what I said
to you earlier.

125
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,833
No, I should apologize...

126
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,916
After all you did save
my life back there...

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,916
If only I could
have been stronger

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,125
like the rest of you girls.

129
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,958
I'm not as strong
as you may think...

130
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,750
I am afraid to die...
and I don't like pain.

131
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,666
I think I probably draw
pictures and read books

132
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
everyday because I
don't want to feel like

133
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,583
I'm wasting my life...

134
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,916
I'm afraid, and I don't want to
have any regrets before I die.

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,375
Know what I mean?

136
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,000
So are you going
to stay up tonight?

137
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,541
Should I?

138
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,958
Yeah. There's a meteor shower,
and you'll probably be able

139
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,916
to see it from
your window here.

140
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,708
Really?

141
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,041
If you can,

142
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:24,083
listen to this song while
you watch it... 'Kay?

143
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,375
Sure.

144
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,666
Excuse me, sir.

145
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,916
Huh...? Oh,
hello, Triela.

146
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,041
What's up?

147
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,458
I was hoping you
could supervise us

148
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,916
while we watch
the meteor shower

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,583
at the training
grounds tonight.

150
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,750
Eh?

151
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,208
Jose backed out.
Said he's busy.

152
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,666
Sorry, but as you can
see, we're swamped today.

153
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,416
We have to translate all these
EU public safety documents

154
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,750
into Italian by
tomorrow morning.

155
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,083
Then why don't you let me
help you translate them?

156
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,875
I'm fluent in 3
languages you know.

157
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,583
Marco.

158
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,583
I, uh...

159
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,583
What is it?

160
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,708
I went to visit Angelica
this morning and...

161
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,750
she suddenly...

162
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:40,625
she remembered a dog she
used to have named Pero.

163
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,625
I see... I'll
notify the engineers.

164
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,166
They'll come by to
run some tests on her

165
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,291
and see what's
going on.

166
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,666
Uh... Do you know
where her dog is now?

167
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,583
No, I don't.

168
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,208
Maybe we could go
looking for it.

169
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,166
There'd be no point in that.

170
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,583
Marco!

171
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,666
Is there something
else, Henrietta?

172
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,166
You have to see her... 
Just go visit Angelica.

173
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,625
The doctors have taken
all the necessary precautions.

174
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
If something happens,
they'll notify me.

175
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,125
Please just
visit her.

176
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,541
It's pointless,
Henrietta.

177
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,541
There's nothing I
can do for her now.

178
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,833
You don't have
to do anything.

179
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:54,791
Just be by her side.
She wants that.

180
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,791
Please, Marco.

181
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:06,166
Henrietta... Are
you afraid of dying?

182
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm not afraid
of anything.

183
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,708
Especially if it means
fighting to protect Jose.

184
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,250
You don't resent what these
doctors have done to you?

185
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,833
Giving you nothing
but a mechanical body,

186
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,208
a handful of bullets and a
life too short to enjoy?

187
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,458
All of us girls have accepted
what we've been made to do.

188
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,791
So if you at all pity
or feel sorry for us...

189
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:35,208
then you're
mistaken.

190
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,166
I realize this may be the
conditioning saying this...

191
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,250
but I don't
mind... Even so.

192
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,791
I'm not
afraid to die.

193
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,458
And I'm certain Angelica
feels the same way!

194
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,541
Hi Marco.

195
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,041
Did I wake you?

196
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,166
No. It's alright...

197
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,791
I'm... gonna try
really hard next time.

198
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,416
Lay down.

199
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,041
Yes, sir.

200
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,375
I don't see any.

201
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,083
Maybe it's just
not time yet.

202
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,083
It'll be soon...
Keep watching.

203
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,458
We'd have been better off
if we were further away

204
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,291
from the lights of Rome.

205
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,708
But I guess our eyesight is
the best it can possibly be.

206
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,166
I saw one!

207
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,083
Really? Where?

208
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,333
It was right over
there. Oh! Another one!

209
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,625
Look Triela! Up there!
You're missing it!

210
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,291
Alright, Rico...
Calm down.

211
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,041
I'm sorry but this
is the first time

212
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,875
I've ever seen
a shooting star!

213
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,125
Marco.

214
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm glad you're
here with me.

215
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,500
Did you know there's supposed
to be a meteor shower tonight?

216
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,791
Claes said I should be
able to see some of them

217
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,041
from the window here.

218
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,083
Watching it all by myself
wouldn't be much fun.

219
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,000
That's true.

220
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,125
It's so quiet.

221
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,541
As the world gets more
and more complicated...

222
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,500
and there's so much
to think about...

223
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,541
it's good to let your
mind empty like this

224
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,125
every once in a while.

225
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,250
I wish Angelica
could see this too.

226
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,750
Oh she is... I wonder
if she's listening

227
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,250
to the Ninth while
she watches it.

228
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,083
Wait, do you mean
Beethoven's Ninth?

229
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,083
Yeah, that's right.

230
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,125
Well, it's definitely
the perfect symphony

231
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,833
for such a
beautiful night.

232
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
Is this
it...?

233
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,875
[Humming Beethoven]

234
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,833
Like that?

235
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:34,750
♪ Freude, schöner Götterfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium... ♪

236
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,416
Like that.

237
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay!

238
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:44,250
♪ Wir betreten feuertrunken,

240
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,125
I saw one!

241
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,291
Me too.

242
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,750
So beautiful.

243
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,083
Yes it is.

244
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,833
Hey Marco.

245
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,083
Yeah?

246
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
The pasta story.

247
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,375
Hmm?

248
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,166
Will you please read me
the Pasta story again?

249
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,958
Sure. Just
a minute.

250
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,791
Once upon a time, there
was a kingdom made of pasta.

251
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,083
In this kingdom there lived
a prince who loved pasta,

252
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,791
and would eat it for
every meal of every day.

253
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,541
Alphonso,
what's so funny?

254
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,000
It's just the thought
of these little girls

255
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,416
who can kill terrorists
and speak three languages.

256
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,916
And here they are singing
Beethoven in the bitter cold.

257
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,750
It's a shame they
have to be cyborgs.

258
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,333
Then Prince Pasta
said to Princess Pizza,

259
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,625
This dragon is...

260
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,500
A-Angelica?

261
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
A-Are you asleep? Angelica?
