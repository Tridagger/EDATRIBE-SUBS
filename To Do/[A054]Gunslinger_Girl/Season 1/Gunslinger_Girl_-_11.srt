1
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,333
Hey, Elenora... Do You
suppose they'll let us

2
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,791
drive this car
onto Sicily Island?

3
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,333
Let me check my
little book here...

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,833
And yes - There's a
ferry that takes cars

5
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,125
leaving out of
Reggio Di Calabria.

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,666
Without you, I'd probably
have to swim across.

7
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,666
And just if you're interested,
this road we're on

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,208
was the same road
the ancient Romans

9
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,625
used to attack the
Greeks in Sicily.

10
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,958
Please tell me you don't
have the color of my boxers

11
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,208
in that book too...

12
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,541
We'll be staying in a
hotel just by the port.

13
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,291
If anything happens,
we can be here quick.

14
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,958
Anyone ever told you you
worry too much, Ferro?

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,583
You know what
happened to Elsa...

16
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,291
We could all stand to
be more cautious...

17
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,625
Henrietta...

18
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,791
I want you to make sure
nothing happens to Jose.

19
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,875
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,125
This house is nice.

21
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,125
I hope. My parents
spent a fortune on it.

22
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,625
We used to vacation
here in the summers.

23
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,500
Your family?
Even Jean?

24
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, he was here, too.

25
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:35,083
But Right now, I'm
spending time with you...

26
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,875
Step out onto the terrace.

27
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,291
We should come back here
after the seasons change.

28
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,541
Sicily in summer
is breathtaking.

29
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:00,000
You mean you would bring me
back for another holiday?

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,125
As often
as you like.

31
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,166
Henrietta... I want
you to give me your case

32
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
and the SIG
on your belt.

33
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,916
Come on.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,625
I can't. These
are things I need

35
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,041
if I'm going to protect
you like I was ordered.

36
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,250
We're here
under the guise

37
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,458
that I am a reporter
and you are my neice.

38
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,750
A normal girl
shouldn't be carrying

39
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,583
these kinds of
things with her.

40
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,125
A normal
girl... normal?

41
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,291
That's right.

42
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:51,125
Gimme a break

43
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,708
Lucky dogs.
What kind of work

44
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,125
do they think they
can get done here?

45
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,125
Living here, you could
begin to believe

46
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,208
that the world ends
where the water begins.

47
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,166
You should quit Section One
and become a tour guide.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,833
I guess I'm the one who gets
to point out the irony here.

49
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,166
The cyborgs were
designed to protect us...

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,125
and now we're
protecting them.

51
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,458
Stunning observation.
But it's hardly the time.

52
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,791
Perhaps we should focus on
why we're here and not how.

53
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, yeah. I've
heard it before.

54
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,791
I thought they...
They're from Section Two...

55
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,291
Why are we hiding
from our own?

56
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,750
Just avoiding
trouble.

57
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,916
It comes in all
shapes and sizes.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Okay....

59
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,416
Maybe they're
not home.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,625
Hey, there...

61
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
Please, don't go
for your gun...

62
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,666
We're also from the
Social Welfare Agency...

63
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,416
I'm Pietro Fermi and Elenora
Gabrielli from Section One...

64
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,708
Triela told us about you.

65
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,458
Section One, huh?

66
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,166
That's right,
reporter on vacation.

67
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,000
The vacation part's
real. What do you want?

68
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,250
Nothing big, I'm handling
a certain incident

69
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,875
for our section...
May we come inside...?

70
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,875
I'm getting a
bit of a chill.

71
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,333
Sure. Come on in.

72
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,875
Henrietta...

73
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,625
But... There are no weapons
allowed in this house.

74
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,333
I'll take them for you.

75
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,333
We're on holiday and
the smell of gun oil

76
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,833
puts us both
in a work mood.

77
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,333
What next?

78
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,791
You gonna unstrap my family
jewels and confiscate them?

79
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,125
And leave your mouth at the
door, if you don't mind.

80
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,333
I thought that the Elsa case
had already been closed.

81
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,500
It was.

82
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,333
So basically, you're
just waiting to find

83
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,500
the terrorists that
did this and grab 'em.

84
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,625
That's the official word.
But there's something...

85
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,666
Something doesn't feel
right about this case.

86
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,166
Our superior didn't
order us out here.

87
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,875
Pietro... Why
didn't you tell me-

88
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,666
so the director
didn't send us?

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,916
No, I told him that my
grandmother in Naples

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,750
fell ill... So this is half
personal, half business.

91
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,750
Why did you follow us?

92
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,166
Triela told us that if
we wanted to learn more

93
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,125
about fratello relationships,
then we should look to you.

94
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,458
Okay...

95
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,916
Henrietta?

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,791
Would you mind making us
up some dinner for everyone?

97
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,541
Okay.

98
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,791
That's great. She does all
the housework, too, I see.

99
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,583
Yeah. But She practices
cooking in her dorm room.

100
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,875
I wouldn't expect
anything tasty.

101
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,375
Elenora...

102
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,750
Oh, right... I'll
supervise the cooking.

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,291
I assume that the
respect she has for you

104
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,666
is due to your
conditioning of her.

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,125
Every cyborg requires
conditioning to be usable...

106
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,250
and Henrietta is
no exception.

107
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,500
But I don't increase her
conditioning to make her loyal.

108
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:19,500
I have never forced any of the
affection she feels for me.

109
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,125
Tell me, what difference
does that make...?

110
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,333
Just because it's not
you don't it as much

111
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,083
doesn't make it all
sunshine you know.

112
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,833
Believe me, I agree...

113
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,916
I realize that we're
only using these girls

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,500
to further our own agenda...
I do realize that.

115
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,791
So, what's for dinner?

116
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:45,416
Just, uh...
Tomato soup pasta.

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,166
Is that it?

118
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,666
Yes.

119
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,000
Maybe we could add a
few more ingredients.

120
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,208
But I can't--

121
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
I don't know how to
cook without a recipe.

122
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,625
It's no problem.

123
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,833
I have some cooking notes
somewhere. Here they are!

124
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,333
Tomato soup but with tuna
in place of the pasta...

125
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,625
and on the side,
marinated seafood

126
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,291
with vegetable caponata...
and some olives and cheese...

127
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,916
How's
that sound?

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,833
That's great... It's
like a magical notebook.

129
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,500
No magic
here, sorry...

130
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,583
I just happen to have one
of the worst memories

131
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,166
of anyone I know...

132
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,833
And As we know, all
successful jobs are--

133
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,666
Are all comprised of many
smaller and much simpler tasks.

134
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,500
Right... But, uh...
Where'd you hear that?

135
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:37,791
Oh, I... I can't remember...
We should go to the market.

136
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,500
Yeah, you're right...

137
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,333
We've got some hungry men
waiting in the other room.

138
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,291
Yeah.

139
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,500
You really like him. But
what kind of feeling is it?

140
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,958
Is it the love
for a brother?

141
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,625
Or does the agency determine
how you feel about things?

142
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,083
It doesn't matter to me. I
just know that I feel good.

143
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,916
That's kind of normal.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,875
But I still have to do what
they want. The agency.

145
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,375
What I do for Jose though,
is what I want to do for him.

146
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,208
It sounds to me like
you're in love with him.

147
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:13,375
I guess. I mean, you're in
love with Pietro, aren't you?

148
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,500
Uh, no. I'm not.

149
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,041
You understand,
a man and a woman

150
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,166
don't have to be in
love to work together.

151
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,875
They can just be partners.

152
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,333
But you're tall and beautiful
and you have pretty hair.

153
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,000
I think he
suits you well.

154
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,541
He's better off with a tougher
woman of sorts. Trust me.

155
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,291
I don't think so.

156
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,666
Sorry, it's true.

157
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,958
Henrietta!

158
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,666
You gotta keep in mind how
vulnerable you girls are

159
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,625
when you're not
concentrating.

160
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,541
Here.

161
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,041
Thank you.

162
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,541
Uh, didn't you
have a purse?

163
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll go get it.

164
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,416
Wait...

165
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,416
There he is.

166
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,375
Give it back.

167
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,375
How did you get here?

168
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,958
Give me back my purse... 
and you won't get hurt.

169
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,208
I don't think so, missy... 
Now get outta here!

170
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,708
Wait... How did you--

171
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,708
Let... Let go-

172
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,416
Police!

173
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,916
Give that girl back her
things or I'm taking you in.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,625
I don't have
her stuff...

175
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,166
Just tell this
freak to let me go!

176
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,958
Henrietta.
Drop him.

177
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,750
Now, give it
back to her.

178
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,916
What are you
talking about?

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Playing dumb...? 
I said I would let you go

180
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,125
if you gave the girl
her purse back.

181
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,000
You stink of whiskey, which
puts you at DUI already.

182
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,333
I guess I'll let the
boys downtown know

183
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,875
just how thorough
they need to search you.

184
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,708
Was it really
that important?

185
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,083
The camera that Jose
gave me is inside.

186
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,000
I couldn't just
let it go.

187
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh.

188
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,500
Elenora? The badge that you
pulled out, was that the, uh...

189
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,750
The magical
notebook, yeah.

190
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:59,083
Back there, you were the
toughest woman ever.

191
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,375
Back there, you were
the scariest girl ever.

192
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,833
So You don't have any
suspicions about Elsa's death?

193
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:34,416
The question is, do
you have suspicions?

194
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,833
Yeah.
I do.

195
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:43,875
The whole story sounds... just
way too convenient for me.

196
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,000
You thinking... What?
A conspiracy?

197
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,125
An agency trained man
and his cyborg are killed.

198
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,000
No investigation, but they
suddenly know who did it.

199
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,958
What do you think?

200
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,666
As enhanced as the cyborgs
are in their abilities

201
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
and their senses,
they're useless

202
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,791
if they aren't concentrating.

203
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,500
The fratello was ambushed
at night in the park.

204
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,166
It's not out of the
realm of possibility

205
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,541
that this happened the
way they say it did.

206
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,583
Jean told me the girls
are highly sensitive

207
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,083
to any danger that their
handler might be exposed to...

208
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,250
When I met Rico yesterday
she was the Aegis shield.

209
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,333
Nothing was
getting past her.

210
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,333
Each handler conditions
his own cyborg...

211
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,000
Elsa reacted, only
not fast enough.

212
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,541
I don't
like it.

213
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,833
Everyone in your department
is so quick to say

214
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,041
the cyborg did the
right thing...

215
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,125
And while I'm sure you
believe that...

216
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,500
Something about
this feels wrong.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,375
I admit, the idea of cyborgs
disgusted me at first...

218
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,375
More than half of their
bodies are carbon framing,

219
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,333
fiber-optics, and artificially
bioengineered muscle...

220
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,958
But in the end, every
last one of them

221
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,500
is just a regular
adolescent girl...

222
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,916
And they come with the
whole gambit of emotions...

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,291
They seek approval, they can't
understand their feelings,

224
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,500
and they can't
cook worth a damn.

225
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,500
It seems like they
really liked the food.

226
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,833
After the all effort
you put into the meal,

227
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,625
how could they not...?
But Henrietta...

228
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,833
I want to tell you not to
run off like you did earlier.

229
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,250
Normally, little girls aren't
supposed to be violent

230
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,083
like that...
You understand?

231
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,875
You, too,
Elenora.

232
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,625
You're trying to make me into
more of a normal girl, too.

233
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,750
I can tell.

234
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,375
You are normal.

235
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,041
When we got here, Jose
took my weapons away.

236
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,833
He said that normal
girls don't carry them.

237
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:45,625
I know that he's right.
So are you. But am I...

238
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,875
Am I normal...?
I have strength...

239
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,375
I can kill with
my bare hands...

240
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,291
I bleed red, but the pain
always goes away quickly...

241
00:15:55,375 --> 00:16:00,041
Sometimes I see things in my
head that have never happened.

242
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,083
I am a
cyborg...

243
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,666
I'll never be useful
as anything else...

244
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,125
To Jose I'll never be a
normal girl no matter--

245
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,541
No! You're wrong!

246
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,791
He thinks the
world of you...

247
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:16,666
He wants you to smile and to
enjoy everything that you can.

248
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,625
Elenora...

249
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,833
I understand now
how Elsa died.

250
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,875
Could you get Jose and
Pietro and meet me outside?

251
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,916
Please bring my
sidearm, too.

252
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,750
Can I please
hold my gun?

253
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,625
Wait.

254
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,458
Explain yourself first.

255
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:59,041
Pietro... Would you say
that Elsa loved Lauro?

256
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,666
I'd say so.

257
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,083
Jose, did you ever see
Lauro being nice to Elsa?

258
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:09,041
Not really. With him,
everything was always business.

259
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,833
That's how it all started...

260
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,541
What would happen if
you loved someone...

261
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,125
Loved them with
all your heart,

262
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,416
like you never
thought you could...

263
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,375
but you realized one
day that they would never,

264
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,625
ever feel that way for you?

265
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,000
If it were me...

266
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,500
I would kill that
person. And then...

267
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,333
I'd do this.

268
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,500
You can calm down now.
I wouldn't shoot.

269
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,708
How could I
kill myself

270
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,833
while you're this
wonderful, Jose?

271
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,208
You know that no one has
ever been this good to me.

272
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:28,125
I had
no idea.

273
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,500
She was serious when
she said she knew.

274
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,291
Talk about
a scare.

275
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,833
Jose, you knew the whole
time how Elsa died

276
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,625
and kept it
to yourself.

277
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:48,333
Explains your reaction when
I went to give her the gun.

278
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,375
So that was the secret behind
the two bullets they found.

279
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,458
It's worse than
that little girl

280
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,916
taking a bullet
for her handler.

281
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,708
You gonna
report this?

282
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,500
Oh c'mon...

283
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,083
You know Section
Two had to have

284
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,250
destroyed the
evidence by now...

285
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,791
This'll never be
more than a theory.

286
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,458
But the way Henrietta
acted with the gun--

287
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,125
She was responding to an
unconscious threat...

288
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,250
She knew why Elsa did
what she did.

289
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
Henrietta just
wanted us to know.

290
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,791
She seemed so innocent
this afternoon.

291
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,666
That's why it's hard to
wrap your mind around it.

292
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,625
Oh, yeah I forgot
to show you.

293
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,333
I did find something
interesting in Elsa's room.

294
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,125
A photo of Lauro.

295
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:41,000
All she ever got from him was
her name and his picture.

296
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,791
Must've been hard
for him to deal with,

297
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,375
all of that affection.

298
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,958
Your average Joe
couldn't stomach it.

299
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,208
Above all things,

300
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,500
you have to be someone the
girls can look up to...

301
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,875
In fact that's the
absolute least you can do.

302
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,041
What is it you wanted to
show me out here again?

303
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,208
But Lauro... Don't
you remember this park?

304
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,083
You brought me
here, to this park

305
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,875
and this is where you named
me... 'Elsa De Sica'.

306
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,208
Oh... You're
serious...?

307
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,333
I can't believe you'd
remember something like that.

308
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,583
It's such an important
day, I'd never forget it...

309
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,208
I'd never forget the beautiful
gift you have given me.

310
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,541
Are you done? Let's go.
We have an early morning.

311
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,875
I can't believe you
dragged me out here...

312
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,791
This is... where
you gave me life.

313
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,041
So long, Henrietta.

314
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,583
Yes, goodbye.

315
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,708
See ya.

316
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,041
Yeah.

317
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,750
So... Where would
you like to go first?

318
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,375
Sicily is full of
beautiful places.

319
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,375
Oh, really?

320
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,333
We'll leave whenever
you're ready...

321
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,833
And don't forget
your camera.

322
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,458
Okay!
