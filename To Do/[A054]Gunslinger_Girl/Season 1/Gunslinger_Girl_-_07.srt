1
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,625
Pardon me.

2
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,708
Excuse me... sir?

3
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,708
Oh, uh...

4
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,791
Can I help you?

5
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,958
Yes. Where is the entrance
to the Uffizi Gallery?

6
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,166
Yeah... You go right
through that archway

7
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,791
and through the doors.

8
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,666
Thanks. I appreciate your help.

9
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,416
Okay. Let's go.

10
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,458
That's the Neptune Fountain.
It was by Ammannati.

11
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,333
Ammannati?

12
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,291
Yup.

13
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,125
It's a marvelous
piece of work.

14
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,500
Nah...

15
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,750
Personally, I think
Ammannati was just better off

16
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,875
being Michelangelo's
assistant.

17
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,250
My name is Jean
Louis Bataille...

18
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,750
I sell cosmetics out of
Paris. What about you?

19
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:36,250
Oh, I'm Filippo Adani...
I work in, uh... finances.

20
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,916
Are you on
vacation?

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,208
Well, I'm on a
business trip and...

22
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,666
I figured it would
be a good idea

23
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,625
to bring my sister Florence
with me to see the city.

24
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,958
I thought she would
enjoy Firenze.

25
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,208
Huh... Florence,
eh? Tell me, Jean...

26
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,666
Was one of your parents
born here in Italy?

27
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,875
Well... Actually, my
mother was born here...

28
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,291
How did... How
did you know that?

29
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,500
Florence comes from
the name Firenze.

30
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,000
And the name Jean
can be traced

31
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,125
all the way back
to John the Baptist.

32
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,708
He's Firenze's
guardian saint.

33
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,958
Wow... So, did you come
to Florence on business?

34
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:18,083
Me? No. I'm on
vacation too...

35
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,583
I've worked solid for
the past three years

36
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,000
without a
day off...

37
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,291
so I drove from Milan to spend
a week at the galleries.

38
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,333
That statue there is
Giovanni da Bologna's

39
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,750
Rape of the
Sabine Woman.

40
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,791
All three of those
figures in the statue

41
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,708
were carved out of one
gigantic piece of marble.

42
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,916
As legend has it,
when Rome was being built,

43
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,083
the city was overflowing
with rowdy men

44
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,541
and there weren't enough
women to go around.

45
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,250
So the men would invite
people from neighboring towns

46
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,583
to a feast,

47
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,666
and in turn would steal
the women for themselves.

48
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
[Rico] They would
really steal the women?

49
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,583
This isn't a good story
for a young girl.

50
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,416
You sure do
know your art...

51
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,583
Not really.

52
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,291
Since we're both
at the gallery,

53
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,166
would you be interested in
spending the afternoon with us?

54
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,833
Oh... you don't want to
spend the day with me...

55
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,666
I'd like
that a lot.

56
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,000
[Jean] So, Filippo... You
seem well versed in art.

57
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,541
Did you
ever study it?

58
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,958
Actually, yes. I used to be an
art student here in Firenze.

59
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,166
[Jean] Ahh, I
figured that.

60
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,875
So did you ever grow
tired of this gallery?

61
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
[Filippo] No,
not at all.

62
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,250
I would visit
here quite often

63
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,666
while I was
attending art school.

64
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,500
The beauty of this gallery...
as for art in general,

65
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,583
is that your
mood for that day

66
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,750
can affect your
overall experience...

67
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,708
Making you see and feel
things you haven't before.

68
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,958
Florence... Are you enjoying
this? You look a little bored.

69
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,291
No. I'm not
bored at all.

70
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,458
Some of the more
difficult things

71
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,208
I have a hard
time understanding.

72
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,375
But when I look at
paintings or sculptures...

73
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,833
It gives me goose bumps.
I get lost in the artwork.

74
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,416
You're a very perceptive
little girl, Florence.

75
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,250
You must get ecstatic
when you hear the names

76
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,125
Botticelli or Lippi.

77
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,291
Lippi?

78
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,166
Well, you know who
Botticelli is, right?

79
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,583
His very first instructor
was named Filippo Lippi.

80
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,541
Filippo?

81
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,750
Yeah.

82
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,958
It's starting to
get crowded in here.

83
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,250
We are at the Uffizi. Would
you expect anything else?

84
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,666
Want to
move on?

85
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,083
So what do
you think?

86
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,333
Are those
two tourists?

87
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,500
Maybe. Though they could be
from the Social Welfare Agency.

88
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,708
Oh, you mean
that order

89
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,458
to keep our eye out
for little girls, huh?

90
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,708
Yeah.

91
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,291
If we're supposed to be
worried about children,

92
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,375
then forget walking
around outside.

93
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,041
They're all
over the place.

94
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,458
I got near her earlier.
It looked like she was trying

95
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,208
to hide something
in her coat.

96
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,541
Really? It was probably just
a stuffed animal or something.

97
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,958
Hmm, Maybe.

98
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,500
I can't see her
being a threat.

99
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,166
Take a look at her
hands, they're like silk.

100
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,000
Not what one would expect
from a trained assassin.

101
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,083
Should we wait until
he's alone tonight?

102
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,125
It can't wait
that long...

103
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,291
Tell the guys
to grab him

104
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,958
if he wanders off
somewhere by himself,

105
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
but to be
conspicuous.

106
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,000
Of course,
Christiano.

107
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,250
This is an art
gallery, Guglielmo.

108
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,541
Are you trying to insult
Italy's treasures on purpose?

109
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,833
No, I...
I didn't...

110
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,083
Tell them there
will be no gunfire

111
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,708
in any galleries
or churches...

112
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you understand?

113
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:13,875
Yes, sir.

114
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,041
Hey,
Filippo...

115
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,458
Yeah?

116
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,250
I just remembered
something and I have to go

117
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,333
make a phone
call for business.

118
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,750
While I'm gone, would you mind
keeping an eye on her for me?

119
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,416
Maybe show her
around some more?

120
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Sure... I'd
be delighted.

121
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,500
I may be awhile, so
please take your time.

122
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,250
I'll meet up with
you guys at the exit.

123
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,333
Florence... You stay
with Filippo, okay?

124
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,125
'Kay.

125
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,958
[Guglielmo] Yes, I realize
this whole city is filled

126
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,000
with churches
and galleries,

127
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,375
but it's what he said.

128
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,708
Look, it was an order
straight from Christiano...

129
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Alright...
Don't forget...

130
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,333
Where the hell in
this godforsaken town

131
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,958
are we supposed
to attack?

132
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,833
Don't move...
Drop the phone.

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,083
Alright.

134
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,208
Listen... Who are
you working for?

135
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,208
Bigliazzi? Or are you
with the R.F. scumbags?

136
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,291
Don't try
anything stupid...

137
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,208
Unless you want me to cut
your neck from ear to ear.

138
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,500
No... You wouldn't dare
do something like that.

139
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,750
Why's
that?

140
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,875
You police
have your rules.

141
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,375
You can't just go
around slicing necks.

142
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,791
I can kill you
for two reasons.

143
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,041
First off, I'm
no police officer.

144
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:40,208
And second... I can't
stand terrorists.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,875
You used to study art in
school, right, Filippo?

146
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,625
Yep...
I sure did.

147
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,916
Then why didn't you
become an artist yourself?

148
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,291
There's quite
a few reasons

149
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,291
The main ones being I had no
artistic talent to begin with,

150
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,791
and because I had to
take on my father's work.

151
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,333
You see, I was born with
a knack for mathematics.

152
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,833
So, that's the
path that I chose.

153
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,916
You obviously
really love art...

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,458
so what's stopping
you from painting now?

155
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,041
I'm not getting
any younger,

156
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,041
and opportunities can be
difficult to come by at my age.

157
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,541
There's just
no time.

158
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,958
But what about you? What do you
want to be when you grow up?

159
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,250
Gee, I...

160
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,208
Think about it all
you want, Florence.

161
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,625
Huh?

162
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,666
You're young. The possibilities
before you are endless.

163
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,750
Your brother seems like
a really great guy.

164
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,125
I'm sure he'll let you
experience all sorts of things

165
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,208
while you're
still young.

166
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,833
Yeah... My brother...
He really is a great guy.

167
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,083
Ready to
talk now?

168
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,166
I'll ask
again...

169
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,500
Who are you
working for?

170
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,125
The Republican
Faction.

171
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,250
Why are you
following Filippo?

172
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,708
To recover Mr. Bigliazzi's
private ledger,

173
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,541
and then
take Adani out.

174
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,500
See, that
wasn't so hard.

175
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,625
Up.

176
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:32,500
[phone ringing]

177
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,500
[Operator] Ministry of
Tourism. Firenze Office.

178
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,541
It's Jean from
Section Two.

179
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,708
I'm currently
in the Uffizi.

180
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,166
There's a man taking a nap
in an off-limits bathroom

181
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,000
on the east
side, last stall.

182
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,333
Get him out
of here ASAP.

183
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,208
There will likely
be one more incident,

184
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,000
so prepare a car and
keep the police busy.

185
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,416
Sorry I
took so long.

186
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,541
No worries.

187
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,791
Hi, Florence.

188
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,208
Did you
behave yourself?

189
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,250
Yes.

190
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,791
So. Where would you
like to go next?

191
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm getting a
little tired...

192
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,791
How about we go somewhere
quiet to relax.

193
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,791
Good idea.

194
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,708
Come.

195
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,166
We're dealing with the
R.F. Exterminate them all.

196
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,500
I understand.

197
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
[Jean] These back
alleys are nice.

198
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,458
It's a side of Italy tourists
don't always get to see.

199
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,958
Yeah.

200
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,875
Hello there,
Mr. Adani.

201
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,708
Is the ledger
inside the case?

202
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,625
Hand it
over quietly

203
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,708
and Mr. Bigliazzi will look
past this little episode.

204
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,083
And come back with
us to Milan...

205
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,000
Otherwise...

206
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,833
Some innocent people
will have to pay.

207
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,958
You wouldn't!

208
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
Filippo.

209
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,833
You're gonna be fine.

210
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,916
Damn it!

211
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,500
Filippo! Run!

212
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
You take that way.

213
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:05,958
Right.

214
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,875
Rico,
quick!

215
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,916
What's going on?
Who are you people?

216
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,750
I'll spare you the
lengthy explanation.

217
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,958
We're with an
intelligence agency...

218
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,166
And you...

219
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,375
You're Mr. Bigliazzi's
personal accountant.

220
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,125
So you knew.

221
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,541
[Jean] The ledger
you took...

222
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,583
It proves that he's
funneling money into the R.F.?

223
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,708
That's right.

224
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,916
Is there...
anything else?

225
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,208
I wanna know...
why they're so eager

226
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,291
to put a bullet
into your head.

227
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,875
A few days ago I
overheard them planning

228
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
a terrorist attack on Rome...

229
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,916
I'm sure they're trying to stop
me from going to the police.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,541
Is that right?
Don't worry.

231
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,375
We'll have plenty of time
later to talk about that.

232
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,000
[Jean] What made you
betray your employer?

233
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,333
[Filippo] I'm what you'd
call a goody-two-shoes.

234
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,625
I've never got a
parking ticket

235
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,500
or even jumped on a
train without paying.

236
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,166
When I quit art school
and went into accounting

237
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,833
like my father wanted,

238
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,083
I got more than
I bargained for.

239
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,875
I soon became
aware that my father

240
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,125
had been evading his taxes
for the past 20 years,

241
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,583
and was putting that money back
into various terrorist groups.

242
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,333
I didn't want any part of it,
so I ran off with the ledger.

243
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,041
I knew Bigliazzi was in cahoots
with the police and that...

244
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,125
if I was going to
be assassinated...

245
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,833
I wanted to
see Firenze

246
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,375
just one more time
before it happened.

247
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,458
Jean.

248
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,458
Multiple footsteps
coming this way.

249
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,583
Filippo... I assume you
avoided military service?

250
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,958
Conscription is the
duty of all citizens...

251
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,541
I was with the border
patrol for 13 months.

252
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,958
Then you know
how to use this.

253
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:04,791
You see
him?

254
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,708
No.

255
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,166
Jose.
Where are you?

256
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,666
[Jose] We're standing
by near your location.

257
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,125
Okay... We're heading
to the Grazie Bridge...

258
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,041
Let's meet
up there.

259
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,083
[Jose]
Copy that.

260
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,458
Rico... You and Filippo
head through the courtyard

261
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,083
and make your way
to the Arno River.

262
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,291
Grazie Bridge will
be on your left.

263
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,208
Yes.

264
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,125
Here.
Grab my hand.

265
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,833
[Filippo] Florence.
Was what you said

266
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,916
at the Uffizi
a lie, too?

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,958
[Rico] I'm no good at lying,
so I let Jean do it for me.

268
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,916
That's good.

269
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,375
I see them.

270
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,500
Go.

271
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,250
[Jean]
Hurry.

272
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,375
Come on... You
have to keep up.

273
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,541
We can't let them get away.
Christiano will kill us!

274
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,916
I know!

275
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,583
I don't want any tourists
getting involved with this...

276
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,125
Let's lure them to a
deserted part of town.

277
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,000
No problem.

278
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,291
Jose... Can I have
permission to open fire?

279
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,166
Just a few
more seconds.

280
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,333
How about now?

281
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah...
Go ahead.

282
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,916
Hang in there... We'll have
you at a doctor in 10 minutes.

283
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,375
I was...
prepared for this...

284
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,750
I'm satisfied to die in
such a beautiful city...

285
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:52,166
I even got to say goodbye
to Botticelli and Lippi.

286
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,500
I've... I've grown
tired of this life.

287
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,416
Filippo.

288
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,833
I won't stop you if you
want to die that much...

289
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,375
but I think you dying
would be a waste.

290
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,166
I think Botticelli and Lippi
would want you to live...

291
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,541
They'd want you
to draw and paint

292
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:22,041
for the whole world
to see... And...

293
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,541
Besides, Firenze is
such a beautiful city.

294
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,083
[Filippo] Yes.
That it is.
