1
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,541
So, eighty-six
the cop, too?

2
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes. It's a
perfect opportunity.

3
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,500
Nobody knows
you're here.

4
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,958
But don't get careless
out there, okay?

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,666
Be sure and get photos
when the job's done.

6
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,458
Got it.

7
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,916
Lauro, this is Elsa.

8
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,375
Right, what's
the set-up?

9
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,750
The same as
yesterday...

10
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,666
There's one guard positioned
outside the front door.

11
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,083
Okay, take them out, all
of them. And Elsa...

12
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:09,833
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,583
Don't forget the photos.

14
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,791
You know, as chief
of police...

15
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,625
You really should
start thinking about

16
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,291
who you'd rather
be working with,

17
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,666
the government or
the terrorists.

18
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,875
If you keep getting
in our way,

19
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,958
I won't hesitate
to eliminate you.

20
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,750
You see, we have a
job to do as well.

21
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,000
Lauro.

22
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,583
Are you
finished?

23
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,458
Yes, sir. Everything inside
went just as you planned.

24
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,250
You got
the photos?

25
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,666
Oh, yes.

26
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,375
There's still one exposure
left... Next time,

27
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,916
shoot the
whole roll.

28
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,916
There.

29
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,500
Get it developed as
soon as we get back.

30
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,791
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,791
Alright, let's
get outta here.

32
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,583
Zweihundert,
zwanzig, drei...

33
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,958
Euro?

34
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,166
Oiro--

35
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,833
In German "e-u"
sounds like oy.

36
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,250
Oh.

37
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,125
And, remember, you always
read from the last digit,

38
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:39,125
so twenty-three would
be "drei und zwanzig".

39
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,541
You really need to
study the numbers more.

40
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,250
Five point five six is
"fuenf komma juenf sechs"

41
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,541
and seven point six two is
"sieben komma sechs zwei".

42
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,166
Elsa?

43
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,041
Are you understanding
all of this okay?

44
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,041
Yes, ma'am.

45
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,416
Well-

46
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,541
Kids are just
like adults,

47
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,791
get them together in a big room
and not everybody gets along.

48
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:14,041
It's the same with us
"conditioned" girls.

49
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
Elsa has a room
to herself

50
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,875
and doesn't have much to
do with the rest of us.

51
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,000
Of course, it's not like we
try to make her feel welcome.

52
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,208
I've never even
spoke to her.

53
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,250
Triela, you talk
with Elsa, don't you?

54
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,333
No, not really. I suppose
not any more than I have to.

55
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm...

56
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,083
...not good
at talking.

57
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,541
Why bother? Elsa only
cares about Lauro.

58
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:50,541
Actually, to be honest with
you, Henrietta... I hate her.

59
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,083
You hate her but you
still try to help her?

60
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,958
Oh, I don't know...

61
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,791
I think it's just too
easy to ignore people

62
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,625
you don't really
like, you know?

63
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,875
I guess I like
the challenge.

64
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,541
And you know, speaking of
people I don't like...

65
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,791
You and Claes used to
be just like Elsa

66
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,875
when you first came
to the agency.

67
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,666
So, you helped us
change, Triela?

68
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,041
I wouldn't give
myself all the credit.

69
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,916
It also depends on the
Handler and the conditioning.

70
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,708
What do you mean?
The Handler?

71
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,583
So, you get along fine with
Claes but not with Elsa?

72
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,083
You realize Claes is
pretty unsociable too.

73
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,583
Yeah...
I don't know.

74
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,041
Claes is just
different somehow.

75
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,916
So, you think I'm
unsociable... huh, Triela?

76
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,041
Here...

77
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:59,208
Dessert today is a Ricotta
Tart... they're pretty good.

78
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,041
Thank you,
Madame Claes.

79
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,833
You're welcome, and
don't call me Madame.

80
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,875
Marco.

81
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,416
Hey, Jose.

82
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,208
A little
target practice?

83
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,708
Sure, why not?

84
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,541
How's Angelica doing?

85
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,333
Oh... I'm getting
better everyday!

86
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,666
That's good.

87
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,375
Just don't push
yourself too hard.

88
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,708
I won't.

89
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,291
Henrietta, you should be a
sharper shot than me by now.

90
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,333
I know. But I just can't
seem to get any better.

91
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,958
You have to understand there
aren't any big secrets to it.

92
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,583
The only way you can
improve is with dedication

93
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,083
and constant
practice.

94
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:03,833
Yes, sir.

95
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,875
Hey, Jose!

96
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,208
Lauro--

97
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,958
I thought you were in
Tuscany hunting the R.F..

98
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,125
The primary
mission's completed.

99
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,875
But the local cops have
become a problem...

100
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,708
...hiding terrorists, so,
we'll have to deal with them.

101
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,625
I see.

102
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,250
So, I saw that you're
off duty this week

103
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,333
and I need you're help,
if you can swing it.

104
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,166
Let's meet up and
we can discuss it.

105
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,041
Sounds good.

106
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,458
Well, gotta run.

107
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,375
Am I going to
work with Elsa?

108
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,416
Maybe.
We'll see.

109
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,541
Let's go.

110
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,666
Okay.

111
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,375
Who's there?

112
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,125
What do
you want?

113
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:46,333
I thought... I thought
that maybe we could talk.

114
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,708
So, the local
police chief

115
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,166
is on the take and
harboring terrorists.

116
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,291
I killed one of his
Captains last week

117
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,750
to send him
a message...

118
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,625
But, he's still
holding out.

119
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,500
And yesterday, he actually
threatened to go public

120
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,583
with everything he
knows about the Agency.

121
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,541
Our superiors have finally
authorized his elimination.

122
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,333
The Chief of Police, huh? So
what kind of plan you got?

123
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,875
Everything's
worked out.

124
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,041
It's actually going to
be very simple.

125
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,875
The church towers around
the police station

126
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,500
are perfect
for sniping.

127
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,541
With two shooters,
it's a piece of cake.

128
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,916
That's the plan?

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,041
Yeah, why? Is Henrietta
a bad shot or something?

130
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,291
No... she's an
accurate shot.

131
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,833
It's just... Well, I kinda
wonder if she'll be in top form

132
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,666
in front of people she's
not used to working with.

133
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,166
We'll do it.
If nothing else,

134
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,541
this will help boost
Henrietta's confidence.

135
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,083
Hey, Jose?

136
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,666
Tell me... Do you always worry
about the cyborgs like that?

137
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,125
Yeah.

138
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,958
So, I guess all the rumors
I've heard are true.

139
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,000
What rumors are those?

140
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,208
Oh, you know...

141
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,500
Yeah, I know. You believe
everything you hear?

142
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,500
Here.

143
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Listen, I've seen the
way you treat your cyborg.

144
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,208
I just can't stand guys

145
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,875
who let themselves
get too attached.

146
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,583
Well then... Why did you invite
one them out for drinks?

147
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,041
Because...

148
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,333
I hate guys
like you.

149
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,166
But I am
curious...

150
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,333
curious as to what makes
someone like you tick.

151
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,166
It's easier to figure
out what's going on

152
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,333
in someone's head

153
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,500
after they've had
a few drinks.

154
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,333
Then I can decide if the person
has any redeemable qualities.

155
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:48,083
I believe everyone is of value
somehow, even if you hate them.

156
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,708
Even if I don't
think like you,

157
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,333
you seem like an
okay guy, Jose.

158
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, at least
there's that.

159
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,958
It's like Kennedy
once said...

160
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,208
Let us not be blind to
our differences. Okay?

161
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,500
We have nothing
to talk about.

162
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,458
But... it sounds like
we might be working

163
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,458
together
someday soon.

164
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,875
Well, then I'll
warn you now--

165
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,291
If you even think about
getting in Lauro's way...

166
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,666
you'll regret it.

167
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,458
Elsa?

168
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,208
Why do you push
us all away?

169
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,166
Tell me, who's more
important to you,

170
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,583
your Handler or
the other cyborgs?

171
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,250
My handler's the most
important thing to me.

172
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,625
Nothing else
matters. Nothing.

173
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,791
Everything I do... is for
the sake of our fratello.

174
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,916
When Lauro's gone and I'm left
here alone, I think about him.

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,333
What he's
doing...

176
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,875
Even though I know tomorrow may
be the last day of our lives.

177
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,166
Don't talk to
me about us!

178
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,125
We have our handlers
and that's it!

179
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,125
That's not...

180
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,583
You know that's
not true!

181
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,458
I like Jose, I
like him a lot...

182
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,416
But there's got to be more
for us than just that!

183
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,541
Well...

184
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,208
I don't think there's
anything left to talk about.

185
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,875
Would you
just leave?

186
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,125
So, Lauro?

187
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,375
Yeah, what?

188
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,000
Obviously, it's
important to you

189
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,375
to get along with
your colleagues,

190
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,958
or we wouldn't
be here.

191
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,250
Yeah, it is.

192
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,458
I think it's good
that guys like us

193
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,291
can get together
and hang out.

194
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,125
But, don't you think you're
pretty hard on Elsa?

195
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,083
Look, Jose... Don't confuse
cyborgs for colleagues.

196
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,541
You'll never see
me getting hung up

197
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,625
on those things
like you are.

198
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,916
I just don't think
of them like that.

199
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,625
I mean, they're
definitely cool.

200
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,583
They can clean your
guns for you...

201
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,416
They'll even bring you
lunch if you tell them to.

202
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,625
But, that's as far
as it goes for me.

203
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,958
To be honest,
though,

204
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,416
if it weren't for the
cyborgs in Section Two...

205
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,666
I wouldn't even
have a job.

206
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,208
Ahh! Listen to me rambling
on like I know everything...

207
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,416
You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

208
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,166
I'm curious, Lauro.

209
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,041
Huh?

210
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,166
Why did you join
the agency?

211
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,125
Well, the pay
isn't too bad.

212
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,666
But, I can't keep
doing this forever.

213
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,083
I guess the cyborgs
have it pretty tough...

214
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,291
but then so do
us handlers.

215
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,666
Yeah, we don't have anybody
around to take care of us.

216
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,416
Cheers to that.

217
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,083
You ready, Jose?

218
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:46,791
We're set.

219
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,750
I took the liberty of sending
the heavy stuff ahead.

220
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
You're smarter
than I thought.

221
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,333
Well, I have
done this before.

222
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,000
Henrietta.

223
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,166
Yes?

224
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,625
Is this your first
time here in Tuscany?

225
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,500
Yes, it is.

226
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,041
When we finish with
the job tomorrow,

227
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,833
I thought we might take
a little look around town.

228
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,416
Does a vacation
sound good to you?

229
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,208
Yeah!

230
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,375
Lauro?

231
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,625
Hmm?

232
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,625
I want you to
know... that I'll...

233
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,083
I'll do
my best.

234
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,750
Oh, well...
that's good.

235
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,416
If we shoot the
police chief

236
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,875
right in front of
his headquarters...

237
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,458
It'll send a clear message
to the other small town cops.

238
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,791
How'd you manage to score
such a perfect location?

239
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,958
You know, I have
my connections.

240
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,458
These old churches
and museums

241
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,375
are all under
government control.

242
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,333
Lauro?

243
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,791
What should I do
with the Hecate?

244
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,333
Get it ready next
to your SIG for now.

245
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,375
But, I don't want to use
it unless we have to.

246
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,541
Right.

247
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,666
Lauro... Is Elsa
doing all right today?

248
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,791
Huh?

249
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
I don't know... She
seems fine to me.

250
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,208
No... She... she
seems a little uneasy.

251
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,166
Sometimes they get careless
when they're like that.

252
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,375
I wouldn't
worry about it.

253
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,791
Elsa's never let
me down before.

254
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,750
She's been well trained.

255
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,875
I think maybe you're
a little too sensitive

256
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,791
for your own good, man.

257
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,791
Maybe...

258
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,208
Okay...

259
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,166
Everyone ready? The chief
should be in the second car.

260
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,583
Wait until you see him on
the steps before you shoot.

261
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,166
The timing has
to be perfect.

262
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,875
Have you been practicing 
your sharp-shooting?

263
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,916
Yes, Jose.

264
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,333
Elsa!

265
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,708
Pay attention!

266
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,125
Yes!

267
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,541
Elsa, the safety's still on!

268
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm sorry!

269
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,583
Alright... Jose, switch with
Elsa. She's not concentrating.

270
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,375
Got it.

271
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,625
No, Lauro!
I'm fine.

272
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,000
I can do it!

273
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,708
Sorry, Elsa.

274
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,458
Hurry, he's getting
out of the car!

275
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,000
Wait...

276
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,250
Perfect, good work.

277
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,083
Let's get out of here!

278
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,708
Elsa! Let's go!

279
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,791
Useless...

280
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,125
Henrietta!

281
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,125
Yes!
