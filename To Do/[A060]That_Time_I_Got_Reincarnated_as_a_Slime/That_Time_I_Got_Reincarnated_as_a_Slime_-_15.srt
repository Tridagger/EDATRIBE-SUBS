351
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,000
[RIMURU]
The next strike is above!

352
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,791
[grunting]

353
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,666
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

354
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,125
[chuckles]

355
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,375
[laughs]

356
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,458
I can't believe
you blocked my attack.

357
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,750
Huh?

358
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,500
Enough.

359
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,041
The winner is Rimuru Tempest.

360
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,541
Uh...

361
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,291
Now that we've battled,
I know the truth.

362
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,750
It's obvious that you are not
a malicious being.

363
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,000
-[ALL] Mm-hmm.
-[RIMURU sighs]

364
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,750
No flipping duh.

365
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,208
I have to admit it,

366
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,125
I'm impressed that you
saw through my Haze:

367
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,458
Thunder of Heaven
and Earth attack.

368
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,791
You're an excellent fighter,
Rimuru.

369
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,833
It was more luck than anything.

370
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,041
It just so happens
my master uses that move

371
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,125
all the time in training,
so I'm used to it.

372
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,541
Pretty crazy, huh?

373
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,000
He does?

374
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,750
Hold on.
Who did you say your master was?

375
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,833
[gasps]

376
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,208
[laughs]

377
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,791
That was excellent work,
Lord Rimuru.

378
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,541
You're the Savant.

379
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,750
You don't look anything
like the little boy

380
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,666
I found lost in the forest,
you're much bigger now.

381
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,208
Oh. Do forgive me, King Gazel.

382
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,875
I have to admit I'm overjoyed

383
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,625
to see that you have surpassed
my own skill with the sword.

384
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,666
It's an honor to receive
such a huge compliment.

385
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,166
[RIMURU]
Hakurou was his master?

386
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,708
I'm pretty surprised at how
connected everyone can be,

387
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,583
even in a world like this one.

388
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,958
-[indistinct conversations]
-[laughter]

389
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,541
I see.
This was about the Orc Lord.

390
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,083
You wanted to know
who was behind his downfall.

391
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,416
Yes, and to see whether
they were friends or enemies.

392
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,875
Now you understand.

393
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,333
Rimuru, may I ask something?

394
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,875
Sure.

395
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,583
Would you be interested
in entering a treaty with me?

396
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,625
Huh?

397
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,333
[GAZEL]
If you were to gain control

398
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,916
of everything in this forest
and its surrounding areas,

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,625
it's possible you could obtain
wealth and power surpassing

400
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,416
that of my own nation.

401
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,791
And that's why,

402
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,708
it's imperative
that you gain support

403
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,125
from another country.

404
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,458
Don't get me wrong,
that'd be awesome, but...

405
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,708
It's just...

406
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,291
Are you really okay
with acknowledging

407
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,875
our monster town
as its own nation?

408
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,875
That's a pretty big deal,
you know?

409
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,500
I do, and I accept it.

410
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,625
This deal would benefit
both our parties.

411
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,833
In this event,
we all stand to profit.

412
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,791
[RIMURU sighs]

413
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,333
Not like I can really refuse.

414
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
Right, consider it a deal.

415
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,958
Thank you.

416
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,250
So, all that's left is for you
to pick a name for your nation.

417
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,291
[gasps]

418
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,208
[RIMURU]
Cool, I'm just naming a nation.

419
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,583
No pressure or anything!

420
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,041
Let's see.

421
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,166
Maybe I can combine
the "Forest of Jura"

422
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,791
and "Rimuru Tempest" somehow.

423
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,541
It's the
Jura Tempest Federation.

424
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,291
Ah, that's an excellent choice
for a name.

425
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,041
-[BENIMARU chuckles]
-That's our Lord Rimuru.

426
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,250
Hold on.

427
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,666
If this is the
Jura Tempest Federation,

428
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,583
then we have to name our town
Rimuru after our lord.

429
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,833
[gasps]

430
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,833
It'll be the nation's capital.

431
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,750
[RIMURU]
Hang on.

432
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,125
That's kinda embarrassi--

433
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,041
What a fantastic idea.
No other name would do.

434
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,458
Right, I agree.

435
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,375
No one here could possibly
object to that name.

436
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,250
[RIMURU]
Except me.

437
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,000
It sounds like it's settled.

438
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,208
[RIMURU]
Yeah.

439
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,041
In that moment,
A new nation was born,

440
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,291
and the names
"Jura Tempest Federation"

441
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,833
and "Capital City Rimuru"

442
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,750
were engraved into history
for the first time.

443
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,000
[GREAT SAGE] Next time,
"Demon Lord Milim Attacks."
