1
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,875
[RIMURU]
The Jura Tempest Federation

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,458
and the Armed Nation of Dwargon

3
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,291
formed an official alliance.

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,083
And that's how the newly
established nation of monsters

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,000
managed to gain
powerful support.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,250
I've returned once more, Rimuru.

7
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,500
Obviously, but why are you back?

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
[GAZEL] Ah, to bring you a gift,
of course.

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,291
What is it?

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,333
[GAZEL]
Hmm.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,541
[RIMURU]
A body?!

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,916
Wait, isn't that Vesta?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,958
[VESTA groaning]

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,708
It's wasteful to let
a gifted man like Vesta

15
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,750
sit around and do nothing.

16
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,541
You see, he hasn't been allowed
to work for me since the trial.

17
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,791
Give him a job.

18
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,166
But, my king,

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,291
you should think about
the needs of Dwargon.

20
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,708
The dwarves will surely suffer
without his knowledge.

21
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,083
Bold words from someone who left
Dwargon behind himself.

22
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,416
-[KAIJIN gasps]
-Our nations are allies now.

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,833
Sharing resources is what we do.

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,625
This is your chance to develop
your country even further.

25
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,875
Vesta.

26
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,125
Uh, yes?

27
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,041
I want you to study here.

28
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,833
Devote yourself to it.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,375
I shall.

30
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
This time,

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,625
I promise.

32
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,166
I promise I'll live up
to your expectations, my king.

33
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,875
Lord Rimuru.

34
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,375
Kaijin.

35
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,666
I am truly sorry.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,500
If you would allow it,

37
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,166
then it would be my honor
to work here and serve you.

38
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,708
Well, having another
talented researcher around

39
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,250
would be a big help.

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,375
Listen, Rimuru,
if anything should happen,

41
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,875
I'll take responsibility.

42
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,875
I'll supervise Vesta.

43
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,958
So, please, say yes.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,083
Thank you, Kaijin.

45
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,541
If this is what you really want,
Kaijin, then I trust you.

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,416
Vesta, you're hired.

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,625
[VESTA]
Thank you.

48
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,333
And I promise I will
give you nothing

49
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,833
but my best efforts, sir.

50
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,500
Well, then, I take my leave.

51
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,375
[applause]

52
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,833
[sighs]

53
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,125
Okay, then.

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,041
Now, why are you here?

55
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,833
Uh... [laughing]

56
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,875
I, the illustrious Gabiru,
have traveled here

57
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,500
hoping I might
be able to assist you.

58
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,166
You're the greatest, Sir Gabiru.

59
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,125
It's true, you know.

60
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,416
I'll get rid of him.

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,583
Please just hear me out!

62
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,250
Okay, the real reason
we came here

63
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,916
is because we want to
join your ranks.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,375
On my honor, I swear

65
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,375
that we'll prove to be
useful to you, so please.

66
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,583
[ALL]
Please, my lord.

67
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,875
Like he said,
we just wanna help you.

68
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,166
My brother knows he was wrong.

69
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
All he wants to do
is repay his debt.

70
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,291
Aren't you captain
of the guard?

71
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,875
Yes, and unlike my brother,
I was not cast into exile.

72
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,875
[GABIRU]
Hey!

73
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,250
Instead, my father sent me here

74
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,916
hoping that I'd learn
more about the world.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,458
Wait, so you didn't come
because you missed me?

76
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,916
-Ew, no.
-[GABIRU screams]

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,416
Yeah, that makes sense.

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,125
[RIMURU] And that's how
Vesta, Gabiru, his sister

79
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,083
and their brethren
joined our nation.

80
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,625
[GABIRU] You've always been
kind of a brat.

81
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,250
[RIMURU]
Since they were now our allies,

82
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,000
I decided to give
Gabiru's sister

83
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,833
and her servants some names.

84
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,333
Okay, let's go with

85
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:56,125
Soka, Toka, Saika,
Nanso, and Hokuso.

86
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,833
Thank you for this honor.

87
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,291
-[GABIRU whines]
-[RIMURU gasps]

88
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,708
-Gabiru.
-[GABIRU] Huh?

89
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,333
Don't give me
those puppy dog eyes.

90
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,958
Don't be jealous, you've already
got a name, it's Gabiru.

91
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,208
[gasps]
What the...

92
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,541
[yelling]

93
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,208
[RIMURU]
Gabiru's shining?

94
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,416
Wait.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Can I override
someone else's name?

96
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,750
[GABIRU]
Wow, thank you so much!

97
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,458
I'll follow you
as long as I live!

98
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,000
[groans]

99
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,750
[RIMURU]
Naturally, after that,

100
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,333
I had to give names
to all of Gabiru's friends.

101
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,375
Which caused the lizardmen
to evolve into dragonewts.

102
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,166
So they want to join us?

103
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,000
And may I use them
however I wish?

104
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,208
[RIMURU]
Sure.

105
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,291
I'm trusting you
to train them, Souei.

106
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,541
Right, as you command,
Lord Rimuru.

107
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,958
Thank you, sir,
I promise we'll work hard.

108
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,125
[RIMURU] I left Soka
and the others in Souei's care,

109
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,208
and found some work
for Gabiru and his men.

110
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,166
Well, that's weird.

111
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,708
After they evolved,

112
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,208
some of the lizardmen
ended up looking almost human.

113
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,416
I sent Gabiru's crew
to cultivate

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,166
the valuable hipokute herbs
in Veldora's cave.

115
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,625
Since it's a damp place,

116
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,208
it ended up being
the perfect home for them.

117
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,416
[RIMURU]
'Sup, Gabiru?

118
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,541
How's the growin' goin'?

119
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,375
[laughs]
I'm so happy you asked.

120
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,000
It's going swimmingly.

121
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,375
Feast your eyes on the fruits
of my labor, Lord Rimuru.

122
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,000
[RIMURU]
Let's see.

123
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,000
[GABIRU screams]

124
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,208
[RIMURU]
That's just a weed!

125
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,333
What? Really?

126
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,791
Forgive me, my lord.

127
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,166
In my haste to produce results,

128
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,708
it seems I've only
disappointed you.

129
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,041
[RIMURU]
Come on, man.

130
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,875
If anything, weeds should be
harder to grow

131
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,625
in a place
dripping with magicules.

132
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
[RIMURU]
In the back of the cave,

133
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,000
we set up a place

134
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,333
where Vesta
could conduct his research.

135
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,250
Currently he's focusing
on creating new healing potions

136
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,875
from the hipokute herbs.

137
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,791
If we can somehow
mass-produce potions

138
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,333
that are as effective
as the ones that I make,

139
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,125
it would really give us
an advantage.

140
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,625
A lot has happened.

141
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,208
But it looks like we can finally
take things easy.

142
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,416
[inaudible]

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,083
[MILIM]
Interesting! Very interesting!

144
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,166
I'd like to go investigate
this new toy, personally.

145
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,083
Now, now, Milim.

146
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,291
Don't forget about our pact
with the Forest of Jura.

147
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,541
What? But it's so dumb.

148
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,125
I mean, with Veldora gone,

149
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,291
can't we just ditch
the whole non-aggression pact?

150
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,958
There's an idea.

151
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,083
I don't see why not.

152
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,500
Right, then it's decided.

153
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,916
But promise we won't interfere
with each other.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,291
-Fair enough?
-Seems reasonable.

155
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,750
Well, okay.

156
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,791
As long as everyone's
in agreement.

157
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,875
I'm off to go play
with my new toy.

158
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,125
Make sure you stay outta my way,
Clayman, Carrion and Frey.

159
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,125
[RIMURU gasps]
I just sensed something.

160
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,208
It almost feels like
there's a magical meteor

161
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,083
barreling straight towards us.

162
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,666
[whooshing]

163
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,166
[indistinct chatter]

164
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,958
[explosion]

165
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,666
[grunting]

166
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,333
[MILIM]
Nice to meet you.

167
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,625
I'm the one and only dragonoid,
known as the Destroyer.

168
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,958
People call me

169
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,875
the Demon Lord Milim Nava.

170
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,875
[RIMURU]
She's a Demon Lord?

171
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,833
I heard that you're
the strongest monster

172
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,958
in the forest now.

173
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,416
So I came to say hello.

174
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,750
[RIMURU] Holy crap,
I think her power level

175
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,750
might actually be on par
with Veldora's.

176
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,208
She's definitely the real deal.

177
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,916
[RIMURU gasping]

355
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,875
In fact, I wanna go see
your village right now!

356
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,208
[RIMURU]
That's enough!

357
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,375
Okay, fine.

358
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,875
But on one condition.

359
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,250
You must always refer to me
as Mister Rimuru.

360
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,458
Screw that. I'm stronger.

361
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,208
You should respect me
and call me Lady Milim.

362
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,875
[RIMURU]
Let's compromise.

363
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,083
I'll call you Milim,

364
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,333
and in turn,
you can call me Rimuru.

365
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,125
How's that?

366
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,458
Okay, but only you, nobody else.

367
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,958
Normally I would only allow
another Demon Lord

368
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,791
to address me
in such a causal manner.

369
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,583
[RIMURU]
Awesome, thanks a bunch.

370
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,916
So, I guess that means
you and I are friends?

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
Uh, right.

372
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
[RIMURU]
I'll show you my village,

373
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,958
but you have to promise me
you won't cause any trouble.

374
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,000
You got that, Milim?

375
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,166
Don't worry about me, I promise
to be on my best behavior.

376
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,416
[BENIMARU]
That's Lord Rimuru for you.

377
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,166
He made taming Demon Lord Milim
look easy.

378
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,458
[RANGA]
Indeed.

379
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,750
[SHION]
I never doubted him.

380
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,083
[SOUEI]
I shall go tell Rigurd

381
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,291
about our new visitor
right away.

382
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,333
[MILIM laughing]

383
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,708
-[GABIRU] Oh?
-[MILIM] Huh?

384
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,541
[GABIRU]
Who might this be?

385
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,083
Hi there, little runt.

386
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,666
-[MILIM grunts]
-[GABIRU screaming]

387
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,875
[gulps]

388
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,875
[groaning]

389
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,958
Do you have a death wish?

390
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,416
Call me a runt again.

391
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,375
[RIMURU]
This is her best behavior?

392
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,625
Listen.

393
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,000
I promised Rimuru
that I would behave.

394
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,875
So I only used
a bit of my power.

395
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,375
But next time
I won't be so generous.

396
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,125
[GABIRU screams]

397
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,041
Look, there's Father,
he's waving at me

398
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,041
from across the river
to the Great Beyond.

399
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,916
[RIMURU] Your father's
still alive, you dork.

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,041
[GABIRU]
Huh?

401
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,791
By the way,
who is this little--

402
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,916
[MILIM growls]

403
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,500
[GABIRU]
Uh, grown-up-looking lady?

404
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,833
[RIMURU]
This is Milim.

405
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,625
Word is that she's a Demon Lord.

406
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,541
Whoa, seriously?!

407
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,083
[RIMURU]
I get it, but be chill, dude.

408
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,791
Listen, Milim,

409
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,375
you can't go slugging the crap
outta people when you get mad.

410
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,666
[MILIM]
Hmm.

411
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,708
Well, then, he shouldn't
have insulted me.

412
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,333
It's not my fault
he can't handle how I say hello.

413
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,041
[RIMURU] Nobody can handle
how you say hello.

414
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,041
So, don't do it.

415
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,041
[whimpers]

416
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,166
[RIMURU] Allow me to introduce
our new ally.

417
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,291
She's visiting here
as a special guest,

418
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,208
so please treat her
with respect.

419
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,166
Hi, I'm Milim Nava.

420
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,500
No way.

421
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,375
Milim as in the Demon Lord?

422
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,916
I never thought there'd
come a day

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,375
where I'd get
to meet her in person.

424
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,625
You're the greatest,
Lord Rimuru!

425
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,625
Wow, to think he befriended
such a tyrant.

426
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,000
Thanks to his efforts,

427
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,125
Tempest might be able
to exist in peace now.

428
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,625
[RIMURU]
Who knew Milim was so famous?

429
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,916
Everyone's excited
that she's here.

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,375
I'll be living here
starting today.

431
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,916
-Thank you.
-[RIMURU] What?!

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,833
[CROWD cheering]

433
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,083
You mean like live "here"
live here?

434
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,416
Yeah, what else would I mean?

435
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
I'm excited to live
in your monster town.

436
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,833
[RIMURU]
Uh...

437
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,833
Well, right, what she said.

438
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,750
Starting today, we have
a brand-new resident.

439
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,583
[CROWD cheering]

440
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,708
[RIMURU]
She sure is popular.

441
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,958
[MILIM] And if you need anything
at all, I'm happy to help.

442
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,958
[RIMURU]
I can't believe we're friends.

443
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,958
Yeah, I know.

444
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,541
It doesn't feel quite right.

445
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,541
[RIMURU]
Oh, you could hear me?

446
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
And I think...

447
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,958
we aren't actually friends.

448
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,458
-We are best friends!
-[CROWD cheering]

449
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,000
[RIMURU]
Best friends? Ah!

450
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,041
We are, right?

451
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,541
[MILIM whimpering]

452
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,666
[RIMURU]
We're definitely besties!

453
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,958
Hey, everyone,
we're besties for resties!

454
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,458
[CROWD cheering]

455
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,708
[CROWD chanting]
Besties for resties!

456
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,625
Besties for resties!

457
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,750
Besties for resties...

458
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,291
Meanie.

459
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,416
You really had me going there
for a second, Rimuru.

460
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,875
[RIMURU] And that's how
the Demon Lord, Milim,

461
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,166
a powder keg disguised
as a little girl,

462
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,500
came to live in
the Jura Tempest Federation.

463
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,416
[sighs]

464
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,333
What is this place?

465
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,541
It's so warm and relaxing.

466
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,583
[RIMURU]
One of the dwarf brothers, Myrd,

467
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,041
made it for me.

468
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,500
It's a bath that utilizes
the local hot springs.

469
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,291
Wow, it's so big!

470
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,791
You can even swim.

471
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,333
[SHION chuckles softly]

472
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,375
You shouldn't be swimming
in the bath.

473
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,333
[SHION gasps]

474
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,333
You either.

475
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,250
[SHION sighs]

476
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,791
[RIMURU]
Okay, then.

477
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,250
I think I've cooked enough,

478
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,166
I'm ready to get out
for the night.

479
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,875
I wish we could make
coffee milk.

480
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,083
The milk part is easy enough,
but the coffee part...

481
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,125
Then again, we've managed
to plant other things.

482
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,750
-[RIGURD] Lord Rimuru.
-[RIMURU] Huh?

483
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,666
[RIMURU]
What's up, my guy?

484
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,250
It's about Lady Milim.

485
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,333
I never imagined a Demon Lord

486
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,583
would take the initiative
to come here.

487
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,291
[RIMURU]
Yeah, but it should be fine,

488
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,291
after all she did promise not
to cause trouble or anything.

489
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,625
While true,

490
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,500
there is some concern
about whether or not

491
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
the other Demon Lords
have noticed us.

492
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,833
[ALL]
Hmm.

493
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,541
[RIMURU]
What do you mean?

494
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,458
Naturally, there are
several Demon Lords.

495
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,500
And they usually keep
a close eye on each other.

496
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,708
You see, by bringing Lady Milim
to our village,

497
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,541
and then declaring that you have
a close friendship with her,

498
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,791
it places our town
under her protection.

499
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,000
Under normal circumstances,

500
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,416
that would probably
be a good thing, but...

501
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,375
What he's trying to say,
Lord Rimuru,

502
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
is that you're the leader
of this village.

503
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,583
You have to realize that when
the other Demon Lords find out

504
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,750
that you've personally
befriended Lady Milim,

505
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,250
it will appear to them as though
the Great Forest of Jura

506
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,208
has entered into
an alliance with her.

507
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,041
Which also means that Lady Milim
would gain more influence.

508
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,416
Upsetting the balance
between the Demon Lords.

509
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,625
[RIMURU]
Oh, I see.

510
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,458
Still though,
what choice did we have?

511
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,916
It's not like we could
have refused

512
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,625
a Demon Lord of her power.

513
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,833
Yes, her abilities
are on a different level.

514
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,416
Thanks to Lord Rimuru,

515
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Souei and I
are still sitting here.

516
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,125
Exactly.

517
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,041
And if the other Demon Lords
were to become hostile,

518
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,458
I doubt that we'd fare
any better against them.

519
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,208
But thankfully,

520
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,500
we can just leave everything
up to Lord Rimuru

521
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,000
seeing as he and Lady Milim
are besties for resties.

522
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,625
[ALL]
That's true.

523
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,125
[RIMURU]
You jerks!

524
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,208
Lady Milim is one of the most
powerful Demon Lords

525
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,375
of all of them.

526
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,125
And as far as Demon Lords go,

527
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,875
she's one you want to avoid
making an enemy out of.

528
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,583
So we have no choice

529
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,125
but to leave everything in your
capable "hands," Lord Rimuru.

530
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,416
[HAKUROU laughs]

531
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,833
[RIMURU] In the end,
I just rolled with it,

532
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,166
but I had no idea
that the whirlwind

533
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,750
Milim had managed to stir up,

534
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,416
was only just beginning
to gain traction.

535
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,208
[chuckling]

536
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,583
Splash battle!

537
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,875
Hyah!

538
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,750
Please stop, Lady Milim,

539
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,458
I thought I told you
not to play.

540
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,791
[SHION grunting]

541
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,875
Fine!

542
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,708
[MILIM]
Oh, it's on!

543
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,833
-Prepare for war!
-[SHUNA] I said no playing!

544
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,208
[MILIM chuckling]

545
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,375
[GREAT SAGE]
Next time, "The Gathering."
