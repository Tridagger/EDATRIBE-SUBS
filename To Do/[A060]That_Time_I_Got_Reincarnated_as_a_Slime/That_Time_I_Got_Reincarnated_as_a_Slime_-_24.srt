I swear you'll regret this.

Who dares to summon me
from such a lowly station?

Is it you?

13
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,875
Yes, I called you here
to grant my request.

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,875
I don't care if you're a demon.

15

You can have my soul
if you want.

Very well.

19
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,500
I suppose granting your wish

20
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,000

relieve me of my boredom.

Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,750

Mm-mm!

00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,625
Nice.

25
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,333
That does complete our contract.

26

Your emotions were
absolutely tantalizing.

And for that, I shall do you
a great service.

28

That said,

29
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,583

will only cover

30
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,625

Shizu traveled there in response
to an urgent request.

39
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,625
The request was to defeat
a demon who had been revived.

[KNIGHT] Hello and welcome
to Filtwood Castle.

I can't tell you
what an honor it is

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,875
to meet the famous
Conqueror of Flames in person.

43
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,375
Follow me inside.

00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,583

[SHIZU]
Wow.

51
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,541
They've managed to gather
quite a few adventurers.

52
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,291
Hey. Long time no see.

53
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,333
[SHIZU]
It's been a while, Cougar.

54
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,625
Guess this means
you answered the request.

55
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,416
[SHIZU]
It's not as if I could refuse.

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,666
[COUGAR chuckles] Come on,
you're always so serious, Shizu.

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,541
I'm sure if you wanted you could
have found a reason to ditch it.

58
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,416
[SHIZU] And yet, here you are,
talking to me.

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,916
[COUGAR] Whatever. We both know
I'm only here for the money.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,333
Although, I'm already
starting to regret it.

61
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,333
Supposedly, there have been
ten adventurers

62
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,750
who've already died.

How unfortunate.

64

But, hey, now that we've got
a champion on our side,

65
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,083
there's nothing to worry about.

66
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,458

I wouldn't go that far.

It's the minister.

Thank you all for coming.

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,916
I have some unsettling news.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,375
We have just received word
that our champions,

73
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,291
the two Silver Wings,
have passed away.

74
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,958
-[ADVENTURER 1] What?
-[ADVENTURER 2] Impossible.

00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,500
[ADVENTURER 3]
Are you serious?

76
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,208
[MINISTER] It appears
that their bodies were devoured,

77
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,958
leaving behind
only their clothes.

78
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,541
The request given to you is to
defeat the resurrected demon.

79
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,916
A similar account was found
in a century-old text.

80
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,916
The champion, Orthos.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
[MINISTER]
Unfortunately, all we were able

82
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,416
to learn from this passage

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,791
is that the demon
was successfully sealed away

84
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,625
by the knight, Orthos.

85
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,083
And it does not mention
how he sealed it.

86
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,125
We have no choice
but to rely on you

87
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,708
if we hope
to defeat this demon.

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,250

That's not enough information.

[ADVENTURER 2] We're not
throwin' our lives away.

90
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,333
Listen, the Silver Wings

91
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,541
were heroes strong enough
to have titles.

92
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,125
If they failed,
there aren't enough lives

93
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,333
between us to survive this mess.

94
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,458
[SHIZU]
He's right.

00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,875

is too dangerous.

We're going to need help
from every person in this room

if we're going to
defeat this demon.

Let's try to keep a cool head.

106

Besides, we do have
some good news,

107
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,708
and it's that we happen to know
what the demon is after.

108
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,000
And what's that?

109
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,750
There are remains that have been
laid to rest here,

110
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,875
in the castle's underground
reception hall.

111
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,291
Those remains are not human,
but the demon's body.

112
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,625
We believe his objective is to
recover what's left of his body

113
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,833
and complete his resurrection.

114
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,125

Huh?

Ah! Is that
the famous Shizue Izawa I see?

118

I will gladly answer
your questions.

119
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,958
[SHIZU]
If it's true that the demon

120
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,416
nearly drove this kingdom
to the brink of ruin

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
and defeated
the two Silver Wings,

122
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,500
it's possible that we might be
dealing with an Archdemon.

123
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,708
[MINISTER]
Uh...

124
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,375
[SHIZU]
Which brings me to my question.

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,833
[MINISTER]
Huh?

126
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,958
[SHIZU] I was wondering
if this demon has a name.

[ADVENTURERS murmuring]

128
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,875
[RIMURU] When a monster
is granted a name,

it becomes more powerful.

their next move accordingly.

had a name.

[SHIZU]
If he doesn't have a name,

136
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,833
then he can't be an Archdemon.

137
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,708
Still, it's hard to imagine

138
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,666
the Silver Wings
losing otherwise.

139
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,666
So what is your intention?

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,666
Gather all
the adventurers together

for the demon to arrive?

Yes.

of defeating the creature.

The reason we've isolated

is because there's a possibility
