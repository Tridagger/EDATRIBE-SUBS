I shall give you a name.

That's what he told me,
but he seemed untrustworthy.

Naturally I refused,

352
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,083

as he left our village.

is mad at you

I didn't have a choice.

357
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,666
I'd never want a gift
from such an unsuitable master.

I am rather particular.

359

from just anyone.

Maybe Gela? Or Gelo?

Hey, Rigur.

I was wondering, who was it
that named your brother?

371
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,791
Sir. I'm told
that he received his name

372
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,291
from a passing demon
called Lord Gelmud.

-[RIMURU] Gel what?

Oh, Lord Gelmud.
He's from the Demon Lord's army.

I bet it's the same guy.

-I have news.
-[RIMURU] Sure.

379
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,041
I saw a group of Lizardmen
not far from here.

Lizardmen? Not orcs?

Correct. Typically, they make
their home in the marshlands.

It seemed unnatural
for them to stray so far away.

you should know.
