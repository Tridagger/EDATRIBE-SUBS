1
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,416
[SATORU]
So, what are we gonna do?

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,125
[VELDORA]
Hmm?

3
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,833
[SATORU] You know, about this
Unlimited Imprisonment thing.

4
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,333
Now that we're buddies,
I feel bad

5
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,750
that you've been
stuck here alone

6
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,208
for the past 300 years.

7
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,000
"Buddies"?

8
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,875
Is that a dragon version
of puppy dog eyes?

9
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,166
Come on, man, that look's
only cute coming from a girl.

10
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,666
I'm willing to listen
to any ideas you have.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,208
As it stands now,

12
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,625
I probably only have
100 years or so

13
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,250
before my magic
completely runs out.

14
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,375
My magicules have been
leaking out of me.

15
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,291
That explains why this cave
is magicule central.

16
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,958
No wonder there's valuable herbs
and ore galore.

17
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,500
What happens when
you run outta juice?

18
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,000
[VELDORA]
Nothing really.

19
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,833
[SATORU]
What do you mean by "nothing"?

20
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,666
[scoffs]
I'll probably just die.

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,833
Oh. That's rough.

22
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,791
Three hundred years
of complete solitude

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,500
followed by dying alone?

24
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,958
[sighs]

25
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,375
Uh, well, it's worth a try.

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,541
[VELDORA]
Hmm.

27
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,416
[SATORU]
Great Sage,

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,666
use Predator on
the Unlimited Imprisonment.

29
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,000
[GREAT SAGE]
The attempt has failed.

30
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,041
[SATORU] Should've known
it wouldn't be that easy.

31
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,416
It's hopeless.

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
[SATORU sighs]

33
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,541
Isn't there anything we can do?

34
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,708
[GREAT SAGE]
Examining possibilities.

35
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,875
Hey! It's rude to ignore me
to just talk to your own skill.

36
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,750
[SATORU]
Jealous?

37
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,291
[GREAT SAGE]
Survey completed.

38
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,833
Possibilities include...

39
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,208
-[VELDORA] Hmm.
-[SATORU] Uh-huh.

40
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,041
Yeah, that makes sense.

41
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,166
So, here's what
I've got for you.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,541
We have to analyze
the Unlimited Imprisonment

43
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,458
from both sides, then we might
be able to remove it.

44
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,458
[VELDORA]
Oh? Hold on.

45
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,750
I can't analyze it from my side.

46
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,458
The hero also sealed my skills,
so I won't be much help.

47
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,958
Then just give me the data

48
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,791
and I'll analyze it
from my side.

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,333
[VELDORA] Okay, but that could
take quite a while.

50
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,208
I wouldn't want you to have to
wait around that whole time.

51
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,375
Uh, not that it would
bother me or anything.

52
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,708
[SATORU]
That's a good point.

53
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,541
I was thinking that maybe
I'd like to try

54
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,041
and find others from my world.

55
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,833
[VELDORA]
Of course.

56
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,500
There is one thing we could try.

57
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,375
Uh, wh-what is it?

58
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,375
How's about you get
in my stomach?

59
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,958
[dings]

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,291
See, I can use my skills,
Great Sage and Predator

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,166
to analyze
Unlimited Imprisonment.

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,208
Meanwhile you can try to
destroy it from the inside.

63
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,166
You'll be safe and sound
inside my slime tummy

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,541
and probably won't
disappear permanently.

65
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,708
What do you think?

66
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,750
[VELDORA laughing]

67
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,666
[laughing menacingly]

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,708
[shrieks]

69
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,791
Now that sounds like
it could be interesting.

70
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,583
Let's do it! I'm willing.

71
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,583
I trust you completely, friend.

72
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,416
Just like that, huh?

73
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
No questions asked?

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,916
Well, sure.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
Breaking through
Unlimited Imprisonment together

76
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,500
sounds like it could be fun.

77
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,791
And my only other choice is to
wait here for you to come back.

78
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,000
Alone.

79
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
I guess, and two
is better than one.

80
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,791
Let's do this thing!

81
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,625
[VELDORA]
Yes!

82
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,916
-[SATORU laughs]
-[VELDORA] Hmm?

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,208
Okay.

84
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,833
So I'll use Predator and--

85
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,666
-Hold on a moment.
-Huh?

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,458
Before you proceed, I'd like
to give you a proper name.

87
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,750
I think you should
give me one, too.

88
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,958
[SATORU]
Huh?

89
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,250
By doing so, it engraves
onto our souls

90
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,916
the fact that we are equals.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,708
It's what humans often refer
to as a "family name,"

92
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,958
but the name I give you
will offer my divine protection.

93
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,208
Currently, you are nameless.

94
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,458
So, this will mark you
as a monster with power.

95
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,500
[SATORU]
A monster with a name, huh?

96
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,333
Sounds cool.

97
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,083
[VELDORA]
Indeed it does.

98
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,000
Now give me a good name.

99
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,541
[SATORU]
I'll try.

100
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,958
Let's see, something cool.

101
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,750
Veldora the Storm Dragon...

102
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,166
Hmm. Storm...

103
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,541
I feel like if nothing else

104
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,125
it should at least be related
to that somehow.

105
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,708
And storm seems kinda obvious.

106
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,750
Oh!

107
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,250
How about "Tempest"?

108
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,708
That's a cool name, right?

109
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,375
"Tempest"?
That's what you chose?!

110
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,625
[groans]

111
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it dumb?

112
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,333
It sounds fantastic!

113
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,750
From this day onward,
I am Veldora Tempest!

114
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,208
Yeesh, you scared me
for a second there.

115
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,875
Now I shall give you a name.

116
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,083
How about "Rimuru"?

117
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,208
[SATORU] Rimuru.
Yeah, sounds good.

118
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,666
Then you are now Rimuru Tempest!

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,250
[RIMURU]
At that moment,

120
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,041
I felt something shift
deep within my very soul.

121
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,791
It was as if the name itself

122
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,833
became permanently
engraved upon it.

123
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,541
I am Rimuru Tempest!

124
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,583
Rimuru.

125
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,375
Veldora Tempest.

126
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,083
Okay, well, I'm gonna
eat you now.

127
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,541
It's time to bust out
of that Unlimited Imprisonment!

128
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,041
[laughs]
Let's do it.

129
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,041
I'm sure we'll meet face-to-face
again in the near future.

130
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,375
We will.

131
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,875
Unique Skill: Predator!

132
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,166
[gasps]

133
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,166
That was easier
than I thought it would be.

134
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,000
Things are gonna be quiet
without Veldora.

135
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,333
[GREAT SAGE]
Would you like to analyze

136
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,333
the Unique Skill:
Unlimited Imprisonment?

137
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,625
Yes. Analyze away.

138
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,083
On that day,
a great tremor rocked the world.

139
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,833
The disappearance of Veldora
the Storm Dragon,

140
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,750
a Catastrophe-class monster,
was confirmed.

141
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,625
The cave where Veldora
had been sealed for so long

142
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,541
was located within
the Great Forest of Jura.

143
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,541
And on the outskirts
of that same forest

144
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,625
existed several
different countries.

145
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,041
One of those
aforementioned countries

146
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,791
was the Kingdom
of Blumund.

147
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,708
Have you heard about
the Storm Dragon yet?

148
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,958
Certainly you have.

149
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,291
I've heard a rumor or two.

150
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,083
[chuckles]
That's not surprising,

151
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,250
you are a Guild Master
after all.

152
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,625
Well, then, can you tell me
what measures the guild

153
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,041
intends to take
regarding this matter?

154
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,750
We hadn't intended to take
any sort of measures.

155
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,041
The disappearance of Veldora
will only serve

156
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,333
to galvanize the monsters,

157
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,083
which will be a problem
for everyone.

158
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,541
[sighs]

159
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,291
Honestly, I think
the real problem

160
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,041
you need to be worrying about
is the Eastern Kingdom.

161
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,333
With the dragon gone,

162
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,708
it's likely
they'll invade that region.

163
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,916
Yes, and if the Eastern Kingdom
does manage

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
to get through
the Great Forest of Jura,

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,291
the provinces
around it will fall

166
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,291
before we can even retaliate.

167
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,666
You look kind of tired.

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,666
Are you sleeping okay?

169
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,708
[chuckles]

170
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,125
As a favor to an old friend,

171
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,541
I suppose I could do
some investigating.

172
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,791
I will look into the state
of the forest,

173
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
and things
concerning the Kingdom.

174
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,125
Sounds good.
Thank you, Fuze.

175
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,041
[RIMURU] Veldora's disappearance
brought about chaos

176
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,708
in the surrounding countries,

177
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,875
causing quite a bit trouble

00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,500
Our god, who has always
protected us,

357
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,666
suddenly disappeared without
a trace about a month ago.

358
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,916
As a result, the monsters
around this area

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,083
have started to continually
harass our poor village.

360
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,375
[RIMURU]
Their god?

361
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,291
Does he mean Veldora?

362
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,916
The timing fits.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,041
He must have been keeping
the monsters at bay.

364
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,291
We tried to fight them
off ourselves,

365
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,291
but we simply
lack the numbers.

366
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,500
And that's why we asked you
to come here.

367
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,416
[RIMURU]
They think I can help them?

368
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,125
I don't know,
I'm just a lowly slime.

369
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,250
I'm really not that strong,
so I doubt I'd be too much help.

370
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,291
[laughs]
You're so modest.

371
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,625
And funny, too.

372
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,791
Oh?

373
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,666
There's no way
that a mere slime

374
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,666
would emit
such an overwhelming aura,

375
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,791
it's quite obvious that you're
a very powerful monster.

376
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Aura?

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,291
What's he talking about?

378
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,083
Is that like power BO?

379
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,958
Yo, Great Sage.

380
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,125
Change Magic Sense's
perspective.

381
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,625
I'd like to look at myself.

382
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
[GREAT SAGE]
Changing perspective.

383
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,333
Whoa! Is that seriously
the aura around me?

384
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,833
I feel like I've been walking
around with my fly wide open.

385
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,458
This is so bad!

386
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,083
No wonder the goblins were
groveling back in the forest.

387
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,333
[chuckles]
You noticed, huh?

388
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,666
How wise of you.

389
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,083
But of course, Strong One,
there's no hiding

390
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,541
the rather formidable air
that surrounds you.

391
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,166
[RIMURU] I should have known
I wouldn't be able

392
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,541
to fool the village elder,

393
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,416
you've all shown a great deal
of potential.

394
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,708
Congratulations!

395
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,083
[grunts]

396
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,791
Whew, managed to suck it in.

397
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,000
Ah.

398
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,416
I understand now,
you were testing us.

399
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,958
Hopefully enough of our people

400
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,708
were appropriately frightened
at your powerful aura.

401
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,416
Uh, yeah, totally.

402
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,333
I'm actually impressed
you were brave enough

403
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,583
to speak to me at all.

404
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,541
What am I even talking about?

405
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,250
Come to think of it,
how did those humans

406
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,791
back in the cave not see me?

407
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,166
Maybe they're dumb?

408
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,541
[ELDER] You honor us
with your kind words.

409
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,708
Now, regarding the favor
we wished to ask you.

410
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,875
[RIMURU]
According to the goblins,

411
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,333
they've been having problems
with some nearby monsters

412
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,208
called Direwolves,
who attacked them from the east.

413
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,625
Many goblins lost their lives
in the battle against them.

414
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,083
These monsters are said to be
much stronger than the goblins.

415
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,750
And it takes ten of them
to have a chance

416
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,166
at beating one Direwolf.

417
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,958
There was a named warrior
among them

418
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,750
who served as the guardian
for their village.

419
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,125
Unfortunately, he was
killed in battle,

420
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,375
and his people
were left defenseless.

421
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,750
They were out of options.

422
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,375
Altogether, there are
about 100 Direwolves.

423
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,250
How many people do you have?

424
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,416
[ELDER]
Including women,

425
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,958
we have about 60
who can still fight.

426
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,791
[RIMURU]
Those aren't very good odds.

427
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,375
It's like a boss level
in a video game.

428
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,541
So that goblin warrior
went and fought against wolves

429
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,041
even though he knew
he couldn't possibly win?

430
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,916
Yes, even though he knew
the odds were against him.

431
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,750
He gave his life
so he could bring us

432
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,291
information on our foes.

433
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,916
You see, that warrior
was my son.

434
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,458
And his older brother.

435
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,791
[sobbing quietly]

436
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,625
[RIMURU]
Oh, man.

437
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,416
I'm sorry I brought it up.

438
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,333
Elder.

439
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,625
I do have a question.

440
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,958
Uh, yes, sir?

441
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,708
What's in it for me,
like what would I get in return

442
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,375
if I decide to help you?

443
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,416
There has to be something
you guys can offer.

444
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,333
[shuddering]

445
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,125
[gasping softly]

446
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,958
It's not that I actually
want compensation.

447
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,500
But it also probably wouldn't
hurt to put on a bit of a show.

448
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,583
We, we could offer
our unfaltering loyalty.

449
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,125
Please, Strong One,

450
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,125
I'm begging you to grant us
your divine protection,

451
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,000
and in return our whole village
will swear to you.

452
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,208
We promise.

453
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,833
[RIMURU]
This brings back memories.

454
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,333
[TAMURA]
Please help me and I swear

455
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,083
I'll never ask you
for anything again.

456
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,833
All right already,
just calm down.

457
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,458
When it's all said and done,

458
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,125
I'm terrible at saying no.

459
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,833
-[wolf howling]
-[screaming]

460
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,958
[all gasp]

461
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,083
[gasps]
It's the Direwolves!

462
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, no, we're all gonna die!

463
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,250
What are we gonna do?!

464
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,375
They're going to eat
the whole village!

465
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,958
[FEMALE GOBLIN]
Should we run?

466
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,333
[MALE GOBLIN]
Where can we go?

467
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,541
[ELDER] Now, now, everyone,
just remain calm.

468
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,208
[RIMURU]
You have nothing to fear.

469
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,666
[GOBLINS gasp]

470
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,625
Because we're going to
defeat them.

471
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,916
[gasps]
So, you...

472
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,333
[scoffs]

473
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,666
In lieu of Veldora
the Storm Dragon,

474
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,541
I, Rimuru Tempest,
will protect you!

475
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,208
I've decided
to grant you your wish.

476
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,250
[gasps]

477
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,541
[ELDER]
Thank you so much, Lord Rimuru.

478
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
We are eternally grateful to you

479
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,583
and from this day forward
we are your loyal servants.

480
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,125
You can count on me!

481
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,875
And that's the story
of how I became

482
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,875
the leader of the Goblins,
and their guardian.

483
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,666
[GREAT SAGE] Next time:
"Battle at the Goblin Village."
