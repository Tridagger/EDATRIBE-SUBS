Against Charybdis, who's known

00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,833
waging a war on land is futile.

The monster known as Charybdis

was born a long time ago.

It is the violent
Ruler of the Skies.

397
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,291
However, based on its lineage,
that's to be expected.

398
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,750
It hails from Veldora,
the guardian of the forest.

399
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,750
[RIMURU]
Like it's Veldora's child?

[TRYA]
Yes, in a way.

401
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,500
You see Charybdis was generated

402
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,750
from a cloud
of Veldora's magicules.

the fish thing and I

are kind of like siblings?

Wait.

406
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,291
I wonder if that's why
it's heading to our village.

407
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,625
Maybe it knows that I've got
Veldora stashed in my stomach.

408
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,041
If Charybdis has truly revived,

409
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,833
then it's far more dangerous
than a Demon Lord.

410
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,791
Because unlike most enemies,

we have no way of speaking
with this opponent.

True, it's a monster
with zero intelligence.

It's said to have the ability to
summon floating shark creatures,

come from the spirit world

the Megalodons
that it's summoned,

they've possessed

is that you reason

She and I are

That's why she entrusted
everything to me.

for inheriting her will.
