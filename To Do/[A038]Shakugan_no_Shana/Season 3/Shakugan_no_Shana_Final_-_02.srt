1
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,208
It's been a long
time, Chi You...

2
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,375
Or rather...

3
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,833
Thousand Changes Sydonay.

4
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,583
You've done well
for yourself...

5
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,583
Besting our forces
as you have.

6
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,708
Shame having to lose
two of the last

7
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,166
who still call me
by that name...

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,708
The Pennant of
Offering, Di Hong...

9
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,750
and Annihilator of
Bladed Flowers, Yu Xuan.

10
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,000
Fear not.

11
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,583
It's Bal Masqué who will
suffer this loss...

12
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,583
while sorrow and torment
befall the rest of the Trinity.

13
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,083
Shall we, Di Hong?!

14
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,291
Let's!

15
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,958
Yu Xuan...

16
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,833
Fortune smiles
on you today...

17
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,708
You get to witness
the Divine Metal

18
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,416
at Will's full power!

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,541
I do? Well Chi You...

20
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,708
I shall counter with my
Sacrificial Sword-Awakening!

21
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,333
Engage!

22
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,916
A beautiful technique...

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,583
But it neither moves nor
stops my beating heart.

24
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,666
Impossible!

25
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,083
He's unharmed?

26
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,125
You underestimate the
power of my Treasure Tool...

27
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,583
Divine Metal at Will
won't bend or break,

28
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,791
unless I will it so...

29
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,666
And my will is strong.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,083
A trap?!

31
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,958
Beauty must die young...

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,416
Like a rose's petals fall...

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,250
Ever entrancing.

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,250
Splendid work, as
always, General...

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,125
Outlaw's Shanghai post has
been completely obliterated.

36
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,666
You should be proud...

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,916
Our illustrious leader

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,708
will be pleased to
hear of this victory.

39
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,250
I'm not so sure...

40
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,666
Of all the Outlaw posts,

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,708
Shanghai is was considered
the most autonomous...

42
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,708
Now that it's gone,

43
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,833
they'll simply
unite in Europe...

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,208
Under the leadership
of Sophie Sawallisch.

45
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,125
This is no cause
for celebration.

46
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:42,958
[Music]

47
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,125
I'm back.

48
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,625
What's this?

49
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,916
It's from the Braider
of Trembling Might.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,375
Sophie Sawallisch.

51
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,791
She wrote me back?

52
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,500
Greetings, Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter.

53
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,458
I'm sorry, it's Shana
now, isn't it...?

54
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,875
Give my regards to the
Specialist of Everything...

55
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,708
I'm pleased to
learn you are well.

56
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,166
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news...

57
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,041
but Outlaw's Shanghai post

58
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,916
was recently destroyed
by an enemy attack...

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,625
We mourn the loss of the
Annihilator of Bladed Flowers,

60
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,541
as well as many
other comrades...

61
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,250
If there is a benefit
to this tragedy,

62
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,541
it's that it has brought
our allies together.

63
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,916
A threat, greater than any we
have ever known, is upon us...

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,291
I need you to be strong...

65
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,416
Now, in regard to
your own problem...

66
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,291
You've got to stop
fooling yourself, child.

67
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,041
The time has come...

68
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,958
to unite you
with yourself.

69
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,416
Unite me with myself?

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,666
What's that mean?

71
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,375
That bending means you
can't handle it at that size.

72
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,208
It might help if you
visualize yourself

73
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,500
at the size you're
trying to control.

74
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,625
You'll get it!

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,916
As they say,
practice makes perfect!

76
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,708
I don't understand...

77
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,708
What was Sophie
talking about...?

78
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,500
Why did she say
I'm fooling myself?

79
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,541
I didn't even
ask about me...

80
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,375
All I wrote
about was Yuji...

81
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,541
Pay attention, midget!

82
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
Come at me again!

83
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
Lord Stolas!

84
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,000
Ah, Pirsoyn, the Cup of
Corrupting Indulgence.

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,875
I heard that you
accompanied the General

86
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,833
on his mission in Shanghai...

87
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,916
Can't believe you're
back already...

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,458
So, was it a
secret operation?

89
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,916
No...

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the General simply
required a messenger...

91
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,083
That is all.

92
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,291
I thought that it
might have something

93
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,166
to do with our leader...

94
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm excited to meet him.

95
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,125
Where is...

96
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,416
the Dashing Earthly Fiend?

97
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,250
Why isn't
Ribesal with you?

98
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,208
Well... he was mad

99
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,083
so I gave him some
time to cool off.

100
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,291
Herald Stolas!

101
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,791
Greetings, Lord Ribesal...

102
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,708
Pirsoyn tells me you're
not in good spirits today.

103
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,875
What troubles you?

104
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,708
Don't play dumb with me...!

105
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,125
You know why I'm angry...!

106
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,958
We're expected to recognize
that boy as our leader?!

107
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,416
It's ridiculous...!

108
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,583
He's just a Mystes...!

109
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,125
Regardless of what
Treasure Tool he holds,

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,500
he's nothing more than the
husk of a devoured human,

111
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,375
dispelled by a Denizen!

112
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,375
Ribesal...! You're overst...

113
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,291
We know nothing about him!

114
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,625
Yet both the Strategist
and the Priestess

115
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,041
have chosen to
blindly follow him.

116
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,041
Why?!

117
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,833
How do we even know he's
qualified to be our leader...?!

118
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,583
Is he a better manipulator
than the Strategist...?

119
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,500
Can he lead us in a
more effective manner

120
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,208
than the Priestess...?

121
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,583
Is he even a more
formidable warrior

122
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,583
than the General himself?

123
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,666
Please, try to calm down...

124
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,041
I understand that
you have concerns...

125
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,333
I could always use my
position as Herald

126
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,833
to inform the Strategist...

127
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,708
that her men are apprehensive
of their new leader.

128
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,458
Yeah that's a great idea...

129
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,833
Dontcha think?

130
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,666
The last thing she
wants right now

131
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,541
is discontent
among the ranks.

132
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,833
I appreciate your offer...

133
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,708
However...

134
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,708
Uh?!

135
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,750
I have a better idea.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,416
I find it unfortunate...

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,166
the wintertime is upon us.

138
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,208
If it were spring...

139
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,541
the flowers would all be
abloom to entrance us.

140
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,708
Wintertime holds
its own pleasures...

141
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,916
For instance, now I'm able to
hear your voice directly...

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,875
instead of divining
it from beyond.

143
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,916
That alone is a blessing.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,041
"Wintertime holds
its own pleasures?"

145
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,750
That optimism must be how
you've endured my absence.

146
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,708
Winter is long,
yet it fades...

147
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,208
Spring is distant,
yet it draws near...

148
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,958
Is everything
mere illusion...?

149
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,583
A prank played
upon the lost soul?

150
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,208
We can only know
each other's hearts.

151
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,666
Bel Peol...

152
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,041
That Denizen,
was he a Herald?

153
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,375
Yes...

154
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,583
He brought a message from
Thousand Changes Sydonay.

155
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,666
He said the Outlaw
post in Shanghai

156
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,583
has been dealt with, sir...

157
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,541
Thanks to his success...

158
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
we're one step
closer to our goal.

159
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,291
Excellent...

160
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,708
I am relieved to hear...

161
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:44,291
Sydonay's skills have
not waned in my absence.

162
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,541
This loss will have an
adverse affect on

163
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,541
Outlaw's information network...

164
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,916
And, in turn, facilitate
my upcoming journey...

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,208
I can speak to her
without interference.

166
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,125
Then you are
going back there?

167
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,416
Of course.

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,458
As we proudly march
toward our noble goal...

169
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,208
there is only one thing
that could stop me...

170
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,791
the Flame of Heaven...

171
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,416
the God of Atonement.

172
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,916
It has to be done...

173
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,708
He is our rightful leader...

174
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,166
therefore, I cannot
doubt his words....

175
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,208
However... Why did he choose
the Mystes and not the Silver,

176
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,875
as his vessel?

177
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,916
He seems obsessed with
the Flame of Heaven

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,458
and the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter...

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,583
Does some part of the
boy's own will remain?

180
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,125
You must have faith,
Bel-Peol...

181
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,166
We will succeed...

182
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,125
I promise you.

183
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,666
Sir.

184
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,041
I must apologize...

185
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,708
I have caused you such
grief over the years...

186
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,791
You spoil me with
your service,

187
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,083
and in the end,
I only disappoint you.

188
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,583
You honor me ...

189
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,791
But it will never
happen again...

190
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,208
I swear, I shall
not fail you.

191
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,166
There are benefits...

192
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,833
to being in
this human form.

193
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,333
I can once again stand by
your side and feel your touch.

194
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,083
Yes. Indeed.

195
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,833
Forgive me for calling you
to the world of the humans...

196
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,041
I realize we have
no cause to be here

197
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,250
but I wanted to
experience it for myself.

198
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,166
This vast expanse...

199
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,166
the real world...

200
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,416
This place brings
me great solace.

201
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,458
The breathtaking
vista brings tears...

202
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,875
as it brings hearts
together anew...

203
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,250
This... this is the world.

204
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,791
Tempest Hoof...

205
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,000
-do you bring news?
-Yes...

206
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,375
My honored masters...

207
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,041
all is now ready...

208
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,125
for our esteemed leader's
ceremonial audience.

209
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,583
Well done... Fecor.

210
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,833
Let the games begin.

211
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,541
No don't do it, Ribesal...

212
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,333
It's a really bad idea!

213
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,666
It's not our place!

214
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,333
"Not our place"...?!

215
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,958
We have the right to
question anyone's authority

216
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,750
regardless of rank!

217
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,750
Especially when
they're endangering

218
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,333
the very establishment
we hold dear.

219
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,041
Look there.

220
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,083
And there...

221
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,500
He's invited
questionable characters

222
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,708
into the Palace of the Stars

223
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
and given them free reign!

224
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,666
Why was this allowed?!

225
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,541
But if you challenge
our leader

226
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,000
you're flirting
with disaster!

227
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,291
You're gonna
get in trouble.

228
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,666
BIG trouble!

229
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,583
Well, then you
will be, too...

230
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,791
because now that
you know my plan...

231
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,125
I'm not letting
you get away.

232
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,541
No way...!

233
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,125
C'mon, Ribesal, lemme go!

234
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
You're crazy...! Dangit!

235
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,291
Your name?

236
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,750
Told ya...! The leader
knows everything.

237
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:44,416
Wanderer Ribesal,
the Dashing Earthly Fiend.

238
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
You will prove to me

239
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,750
whether you possess the
power to be our master!

240
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,750
You have grown...

241
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,708
into a powerful warrior.

242
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,500
The glory of
battle is yours,

243
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,750
Dashing Earthly Fiend Ribesal.

244
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,125
Master.

245
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,750
Now rise, my
loyal subjects!

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,458
Take heed...!

247
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,625
Members of Bal Masqué...
your orders are thus...!

248
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,000
Hello? Can you hear me...?

249
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,916
Hope so 'cause it's
time for orders...!

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,125
Now is everyone ready...?!

251
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,583
Here's goes nothin'...!

252
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,041
As you know,
we're at the beginning

253
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
of an exciting
new experiment!

254
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,750
Now, this particular experiment

255
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,958
is the result of years upon
years of meticulous research,

256
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,208
and if it's successful it will
forever alter the repute of you,

257
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,250
our beloved Crimson Denizens,
for the better!

258
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,291
Would you get
to the point?!

259
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,333
Everyone's waiting!

260
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,041
Domino!

261
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,833
Thanks...

262
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,750
I'll take it from
here, Professor.

263
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,750
Dammit midget!

264
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,750
Have you heard a
word I've said?!

265
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,750
Kinda like you
don't even care...

266
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,625
This isn't like you,
little miss.

267
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,458
kay, we're done here...

268
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,083
I got some drinkin' to do,

269
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,083
since it's evident
you're not interested.

270
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,416
No, I am.

271
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,666
Then focus your attack
instead of flailing it around.

272
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,208
Perhaps bestowing
a name upon it...

273
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,250
will aid in the internalization
of your technique.

274
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,583
Names have power.

275
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,000
That's not a bad idea...

276
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,458
But to ensure its
effectiveness,

277
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,750
the user should select it.

278
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,125
A name...

279
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh man... here on the spot?

280
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,833
Here is an
example for you...

281
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,500
your predecessor found
it helpful indeed...

282
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,333
to call her
power "Knights".

283
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,708
She would always visualize

284
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,333
a legion of knights
clad in armor,

285
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,041
plunging themselves
into battle.

286
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,500
It will take time but as
you continue to train,

287
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,833
you will indeed
come to discover...

288
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,916
Your true self.

289
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,291
You've got to stop
fooling yourself, child...

290
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,125
The time has come...

291
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,291
to unite you with yourself.

292
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,708
Me, myself...

293
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,500
Whoa.

294
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,250
"Whoa" is right,
looks like she's got it!

295
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,416
Won't know 'til she
tries it for real!

296
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,833
C'mon, Midget!

297
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,125
It's been a while, Decarabia.

298
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,333
I wasn't expecting
to see you so soon...

299
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,041
Is it that bad already?

300
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,791
I suppose it must be if
they're calling me in.

301
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,666
As my representative,

302
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,208
I need you to do
exactly as I say.

303
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,875
Right.

304
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,375
Remember, it's not the length
of the journey that matters...

305
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,625
Okay, kid?

306
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,916
So long.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,166
Take this.

308
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,333
As a human working
at an Outlaw post,

309
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,500
you're gonna need some help
avoiding Crimson Denizens...

310
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,333
'Specially when there's
no Flame Haze around

311
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,333
to save your butt.

312
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,875
This is a little
something for those times.

313
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,208
In simpler terms,
it's a Denizen detector...

314
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,791
Although, we did throw in a few
extra bells n' whistles for ya!

315
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,458
Long story short, if you
sense a Denizen with it...

316
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,958
do whatever it takes

317
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,666
to get as far away from
it as you possibly can...

318
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,208
Don't be brave and
try to investigate.

319
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,958
I'm sure you know this,

320
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,333
but if you even think
about fighting it...

321
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,250
I would never forgive you.

322
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,375
Yeah...

323
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,791
I know.

324
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,583
I know too well.

325
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,541
If I ever tried
to face a Denizen

326
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
without Margery's help...

327
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,833
I'd be a goner.

328
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,625
So this is the
real world, huh?

329
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,375
Right now, someone's
soul is being devoured

330
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,625
and no one will even notice.

331
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,375
Nobody'll remember that
'someone' once existed...

332
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,750
or realize they
could be next.

333
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,541
I have to do this...

334
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,666
for Margery...

335
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,791
This feeling...?

336
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
What is it?

337
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,000
Something's approaching,
really fast!

338
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,166
A Denizen?

339
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,833
What the hell...?!
Why now...?!

340
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,791
If it knows I'm here
I'm totally screwed.

341
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,666
Is it that way?
Crap!

342
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,791
What should I do?!

343
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,666
If you sense a
Denizen with it...

344
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,708
do whatever it takes to
get as far away as you can.

345
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,416
That's right...
I've gotta run...!

346
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,833
But where to...?

347
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey...! What are you doing?

348
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,208
Let go of me!

349
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,458
Please...! Leggo!

350
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,375
Calm down! Take a seat!

351
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,625
No... Am I gonna die...?

352
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,666
Is it all over before
it's even started?!

353
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,708
Margery!

354
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,666
It's fine...

355
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,875
The Denizen wasn't
on my train...

356
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,083
It was on the passing one.

357
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,625
I'm safe...

358
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
They didn't know
I was here...

359
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,250
Man, this is nuts.

360
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,000
Wait...

361
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,625
Wait!

362
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,208
If it's on the
other train...

363
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,416
That means...

364
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,416
We've received
another summons...

365
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,208
but indeed, we cannot
leave Misaki City unattended.

366
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,791
From all the evidence
we've amassed,

367
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,250
it appears this city is a...

368
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,875
Maelstrom of Warfare.

369
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,958
Is something the matter?

370
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,958
Nuh-uh... It's nothing.

371
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:31,750
[Music]

372
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,916
Upon my arrival
in Misaki City...

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,458
memories of happier times
and friends I've made

374
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,750
come rushing back...

375
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,416
but that's not the
reason I've returned.

376
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,583
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

377
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,625
"To Embark Upon a Journey."
