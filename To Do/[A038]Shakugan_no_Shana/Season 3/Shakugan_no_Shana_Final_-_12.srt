1
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,541
Like so many before you,

2
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,333
your existence was lost
in a futile battle...

3
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,166
It seems that is
the way of this world.

4
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,208
You were such
a helpless fool,

5
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,208
worthy of little
more than pity.

6
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,166
You coveted vast power.

7
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,625
You gave your life for it.

8
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,416
However...

9
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,125
I still don't understand.

10
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,750
What is this mysterious
power you desired...?

11
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,541
And why did you choose to take
flight to go in search of it?

12
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,375
Perhaps avenging your death...

13
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,666
Will reveal the
answer to me...

14
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,125
Mare, the Keeper
of Jestful Slumber.

15
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:03,875
[Music]

16
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,333
You should go on
ahead, Nietono;

17
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,916
we can handle this loser!

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,666
Agreed... Good luck.

19
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,958
Will you be okay?

20
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,833
Synchronization.

21
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,583
Let's go!

22
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,916
She's safe!

23
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,166
The Destructive Blade, Sabrac,
is a terrifying foe indeed.

24
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,083
I thought we were rid of him

25
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,250
after our last battle
in Misaki City.

26
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
He was drawing strength
from Power of Existence

27
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,625
emanating from the city.

28
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,166
When we cut his supply,
it indeed weakened him,

29
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,083
allowing us to defeat him.

30
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,208
Or so we thought...

31
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,250
His survival is a threat.

32
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,875
The Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

33
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,666
escaped my grasp...

34
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,083
She somehow broke
free from captivity,

35
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,166
reunited with her comrades
and warned them of our plans.

36
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,708
Since they were
expecting me,

37
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,083
my well-thought-out plan

38
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,416
resulted in little
more than a scratch.

39
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,833
As I've said before,

40
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,083
nothing ever works
out the way you plan.

41
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,083
We have arrived,
my servants...

42
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,916
This is the shrine
that holds my body!

43
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,666
It appears everything's
already been set in motion.

44
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
Because the General's
in a hurry,

45
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
though I don't know why...

46
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,791
You haven't forgotten
about the war

47
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,958
that's ragin' outside,
have you?

48
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,875
I'd like to wrap this up
so I can join my men in battle.

49
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,583
What...?! You've got...
to be... kidding?!

50
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,041
I don't understand

51
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,708
why anyone would rush such
a titillating experience!

52
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,125
I mean, just look at the
magnificence surrounding us!

53
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,833
It's amazing!

54
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,291
Ah...

55
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,875
Now we won't have to waste
any more of our time talking.

56
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,583
Sabrac's speeches are
unexpectedly verbose for someone

57
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,416
so sparse with his words.

58
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,583
You underestimate me,
Aged Tuner...

59
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,416
but I guess that's to
be expected seeing

60
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,375
as we've never faced one
another on the battlefield.

61
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,958
I look forward to
witnessing the power

62
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,375
of your Ceremonial
Equipment firsthand.

63
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,541
Jeez, I'm seriously
havin' a hard time

64
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,833
keepin' up with
you old timers...

65
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,250
Way to blow my confidence!

66
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,875
Don't worry you'll get a
chance to redeem yourself.

67
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,500
I realize this may not be the
best time to bring this up

68
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,500
but... my Ceremonial Equipment
seems to be useless here.

69
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,958
Well, we don't need it...

70
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,250
Wait, yeah we do!

71
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,375
How can you be sure?

72
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,791
Request demonstration.

73
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,458
Considering it took
all my strength

74
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,416
just to break off that
small piece of rock,

75
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,916
and propel it
towards Sabrac...

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
I doubt I'd have enough power

77
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,125
to construct the
Ceremonial Equipment.

78
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,416
The Destructive Blade

79
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,416
must have diffused his
power through this area

80
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,833
to weaken our attacks.

81
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,500
So beatin' this guy
ain't gonna be easy, huh?

82
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,125
Your wound concerns
me, Specialist...

83
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,666
It's worsening because of his
Unrestricted Spell, Stigma.

84
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,458
What? But I thought that's why
we were using the bandages...

85
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,791
to keep this
from happening?!

86
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,666
Indeed, but it seems
Sabrac has altered Stigma

87
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
since I last faced him...

88
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,791
thereby rendering the spell

89
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,041
placed on these
bandages obsolete.

90
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,333
I am currently
analyzing my catalog

91
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,833
of Unrestricted Spells

92
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,416
to determine whether any
will have an effect.

93
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,125
Thankfully, the
bandages have indeed

94
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,500
kept the wound
from spreading.

95
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,000
However, we must
be cautious

96
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,958
not to incur any
further injuries.

97
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,416
Avoid at all costs.

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,625
I get what you're sayin'

99
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
but it's not like we
can just keep dodging

100
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,291
that monster's attacks,

101
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,541
we've gotta fight back, too!

102
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,208
She's right...

103
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,500
The question is whether we
can carry out our original plan

104
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,416
without using the
Ceremonial Equipment.

105
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,125
We should deploy Qadesh's
Blood Seal regardless.

106
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,958
He found us...
Spread out!

107
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,291
A dream?

108
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,166
As I walked the path,

109
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,833
I often wondered whether
everything before me

110
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,125
would disappear
should I wake.

111
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,083
I would ask myself
if this was reality

112
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,750
or nothing more than
an ephemeral illusion,

113
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,708
dreamt over my
millennia of slumber.

114
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,708
But now, as I stand
before this shrine...

115
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,875
I have no doubt that
this is reality!

116
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,875
I promised I would return...

117
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,250
and, you waited
patiently for me...

118
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,333
Now... your wait's over

119
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,083
Please awaken my body
from its slumber.

120
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,250
Yes sir!

121
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,333
Return the Insignia to me.

122
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,666
I'm sorry, Supreme Commander!

123
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,291
I never expected the
enemy's reinforcements

124
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,208
to get here so
quickly, ma'am!

125
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,166
There is no need for you
to apologize, Francois.

126
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,583
You are not at fault.

127
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,000
Not even a
seasoned general

128
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,750
could have predicted
this outcome.

129
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,875
That's true; we had
no way of knowing

130
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,083
their western forces
would get here so soon.

131
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:10,375
Unfortunately, war never
goes as one might expect.

132
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,166
In the hopes of avoiding
such an attack,

133
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,583
I ordered our pursuit forces
to keep the enemy at bay...

134
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,625
However, it seems they
were unable to do so,

135
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,916
despite their best efforts.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,708
I thought the deployment
of Sale and Chiara alone

137
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,250
would be enough
to stop them...

138
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,500
But apparently
Bal Masque's Denizen Army

139
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,541
has a few tricks
up its sleeve

140
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,000
All we have left
are the troops

141
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,708
sent to delay their
forces to the East

142
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,375
and they're holed up
on Mount Tanigawa.

143
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,083
If the enemy breaks
through those lines,

144
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,083
I'm afraid we'll
have nowhere to run.

145
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,333
What are our
chances of victory

146
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,083
if we're already worrying
about our escape route...?

147
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,375
We cannot give up.

148
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,708
Damn it! What now?!

149
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,625
We can't afford to be
stuck in this blizzard

150
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,750
while the war rages on!

151
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,958
We would have no problem
breaking through their lines

152
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,000
if we weren't dealing with
that madman, Mikalojus!

153
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,208
I bet that's exactly why
they've stationed him here.

154
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,333
If only this blizzard
would let up a little,

155
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,958
I could probably take 'em
out with my Daimon spell.

156
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
I remember the Strategist
mentioning something

157
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,416
about creating a
natural disaster.

158
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,125
She said we should "be
cautious but hopeful".

159
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,416
If it happened now,

160
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,208
it might be enough
to distract them.

161
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,500
I am the Supreme Throne Hecate,

162
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,500
a loyal servant
of our master...

163
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,333
With my great staff, Trigon,

164
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,791
I will break the bonds

165
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,708
that have held him
captive for so long.

166
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,791
Let them be broken.

167
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,250
Let them be broken.

168
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,875
Let them be broken.

169
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
Let them be broken!

170
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,333
I commend you my loyal
servants, the Trinity!

171
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,916
My pride and joy!

172
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,250
God of Creation,

173
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,416
my comrade and
fellow deity...

174
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,000
now that you have been
reunited with your body...

175
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,000
I shall return to the hands
of my contractor Shana,

176
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,750
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter.

177
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,041
Yuji Sakai...

178
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,833
I sincerely hope this
isn't our last meeting.

179
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,666
I can assure you...

180
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,041
that isn't the
case, Alastor...

181
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,416
We will meet again.

182
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,333
It won't be long, until our
separate paths become one.

183
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,500
Now join Shana at the
Palace of the Stars.

184
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
We've accomplished
our goal...

185
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,750
Our work here is done.

186
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,750
Let us return
to the Palace!

187
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,166
Alastor, you're back?!

188
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,458
This is where
I'm meant to be.

189
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,666
You've made it farther
than I thought you would!

190
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,791
Are you ready?

191
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,750
You know it!

192
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,333
As usual, nothing ever works
out the way I've planned...

193
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,375
Perhaps it's a sign...

194
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,375
It's time to
switch strategies.

195
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,708
Got ya!

196
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,291
Ya better run, chump!

197
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
Your strength and
fighting spirit

198
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,083
makes me think you'd
be a worthy opponent...

199
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,541
but your brutish technique
leads me to believe otherwise.

200
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,166
I'll show you brutish!

201
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,458
How do you still
have such power?

202
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,000
That's enough out of you!

203
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,708
Activate.

204
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,375
Deploying Qadesh's
Blood Seal.

205
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,375
There we go...

206
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,833
I may not be able
to pull off anything

207
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,375
as crazy as the
Chanter of Elegies

208
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,333
but this should hold him.

209
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,833
Though our powers
are weakened,

210
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,541
it should hold as
long as we isolate

211
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,666
the inside of the circle.

212
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,250
One explosion...

213
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,125
Comin' at ya!

214
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,625
I cannot believe you honestly
think you can defeat me

215
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,208
using the same tactic
you've already employed.

216
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,416
It is said that loss causes
such unpleasant fruit

217
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,958
to later ripen.

218
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,416
Jeez, shut up already!

219
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,166
Wait, Rebecca!
Take a look around!

220
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,958
What the hell is he doin'?!

221
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,875
Now that you have
separated my physical body

222
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,416
from the power I have
spread across the area,

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,041
I am no longer able
to maintain control.

224
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,666
That power is now dispersing,
destroying the land...

225
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,583
If you continue
to hold me here,

226
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,791
the Path of Pilgrimage
will disintegrate.

227
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,500
You gotta hurry and

228
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,083
call off your Unrestricted
Spell, old man!

229
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,541
Even if we
sacrificed ourselves

230
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,958
to make sure the
path's destroyed,

231
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,833
there's no guarantee the
Snake of the Festival

232
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,416
would end up
getting stuck here!

233
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,708
It's a shame I had
to foil your plan.

234
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,750
I must commend you
on your effort.

235
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,250
I guess you'll have to
come up with a new one...

236
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,583
I wonder who's going
to die in the meantime.

237
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,916
You, buddy!

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't think so.

239
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,291
Now Wilhelmina!

240
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,750
I've had enough of you!

241
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,083
Blow him up, Balar!

242
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,708
Take that, sucker!

243
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,333
What the hell?!

244
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,291
Where did he come from?!

245
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,708
No way...

246
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,958
How did he do that?

247
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,208
The three-eyed woman was
kind enough to provide me

248
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,083
with a Rinne for
this very occasion...

249
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,708
Her predictions are usually
unpleasantly accurate.

250
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,208
Only one of you remains...

251
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,666
-Master!
-No need to worry...

252
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,333
She is my invited guest.

253
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,166
Yuji Sakai...

254
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,291
We meet again.

255
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,583
I'll fight the body containing
the Snake of the Festival,

256
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,291
while you hold
back the others.

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,333
Emblaze!

258
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,583
I'll stop her...

259
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,833
Thank you, General...

260
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,250
but let me handle this.

261
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,291
Shana...

262
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,041
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

263
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,041
Why are you so
intent to fight me?

264
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,583
I've told you I want to
live my life with you...

265
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,625
and I have vowed to
always protect you...

266
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,708
You know that I would never
lie to you about such things.

267
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,833
Nonetheless, you're so
strongly tied to your duty

268
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,875
as a Flame Haze,

269
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,250
you would dare to
stand in my way?

270
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,125
Of course!

271
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,166
The Grand Order you're
trying to bring about

272
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,708
is not going to benefit
anyone but the Crimson Denizens

273
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,416
and the power
hungry god they serve.

274
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,958
If it is successfully
achieved,

275
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,208
the God of Creation will
be granted the ability

276
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,166
to manipulate the world
however he sees fit...

277
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,833
Forever changing it...

278
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,250
Can't you see that if you
allow him to materialize,

279
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
he'll pose a threat to
the world as we know it?!

280
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,750
You're not going
to convince me

281
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,208
he should be destroyed.

282
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,458
I was a mess when
you left Misaki City,

283
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,125
until a friend
reached out to me...

284
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,375
She warned me to stop
fooling myself...

285
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,416
She said the time had come
to unite me with myself.

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,208
At first, I thought I
knew what she meant...

287
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,750
Shana and the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

288
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,958
had somehow become
two different entities.

289
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,000
But when I thought about it,
I realized I was wrong...

290
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,875
And when I spoke to
someone else about it

291
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,083
they clarified it for me.

292
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,666
They said, "There
are not two of you-

293
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,125
there is only one."

294
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,375
At the time, I
didn't understand

295
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,708
what they were
trying to say.

296
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,666
And ever since
I met you, Yuji,

297
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,250
I've subconsciously
pretended not to understand.

298
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,125
I didn't want
to fight you...

299
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,083
And, for some reason,
I couldn't accept that fact.

300
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,916
My denial caused there to
be a rift in my personality,

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,416
between the me
who had to fight,

302
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,750
and the me who
didn't want to.

303
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,458
I was afraid that I
would be forced to choose

304
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,708
between them someday.

305
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,333
But now...

306
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,916
I've overcome that fear

307
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,333
because I have found the
strongest Unrestricted Spell.

308
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,375
You see, I'm no
longer afraid to fight

309
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,375
because I've gained
an amazing power...

310
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,041
It's because I met you,

311
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,125
that I have the strength to
settle this once and for all.

312
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,833
Are you sure
about that, Shana?

313
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,458
There is something...

314
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,083
you need to know...

315
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,500
I love you, Yuji!

316
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,791
The love I feel for you...

317
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,000
is the strongest
Unrestricted Spell!

318
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,583
To learn this while
wielding a deadly blade...

319
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,041
it must've have been
a lesson from the man

320
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,208
who raised you.

321
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,708
I challenge you,

322
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,958
and with the strongest
Unrestricted Spell on my side,

323
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,291
I will defeat you!

324
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,666
-Is that so?
-It is...

325
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,875
and although I have the
power to kill you...

326
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,375
my only goal is to
conquer you because...

327
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,875
then you will be
forced to do as I say!

328
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,000
If the Snake of the
Festival possesses you,

329
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,666
I swear I'll take
him down, too.

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,041
I've never seen
her like this...

331
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,583
Once I've
defeated you both,

332
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,000
I will be the
one to determine

333
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,541
what should be done with
the God of Creation's power.

334
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,416
I'll find a purpose that's
sure to satisfy the others...

335
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,250
I will... and not just because

336
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,666
it's part of my sworn
duty as a Flame Haze...

337
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,041
But because I'm Shana,

338
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,708
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter!

339
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,166
Let's see you try!

340
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,458
You are mistaken if you
think you can tie up

341
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,083
these loose ends so easily...

342
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,583
You dare mock the desire

343
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,541
I've held for millennia
with your childish fantasy?!

344
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,541
I can assure you that this
is no "childish fantasy"...

345
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
This is the path
I have chosen

346
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,333
that we will walk together
someday, Yuji Sakai.

347
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,625
I will strive to
make it a reality...

348
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,666
Until the day
we're finally able

349
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,458
to share the strongest
Unrestricted Spell

350
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,000
just like everyone else!

351
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,708
It looks as though
you've found yourself

352
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,708
in the same situation as me.

353
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,416
Perhaps I should
refresh your memory...?

354
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,750
You once said that

355
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,958
as long as you were able
to keep me restricted,

356
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,041
it meant that you had
effectively put a leash

357
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750
on the God of
Atonement as well.

358
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,833
So what?!

359
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,791
I'm gonna give you a taste
of your own medicine...

360
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,041
If you try to do
away with Yuji...

361
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,625
and you become the God
of Creation alone...

362
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,791
I'll use the Tenpa
Jyosai against you!

363
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,833
Normally I would be
forced to destroy you

364
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,708
for disrupting the
world's balance,

365
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,875
as that is my duty
as a Flame Haze.

366
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,541
However, I've
allowed you to live

367
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,875
because I know that Yuji
is in there somewhere

368
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,791
and I want him to walk
the path with me...

369
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,625
We can make it
whatever we want,

370
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,708
even a "childish fantasy"!

371
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,166
Oh no!

372
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,625
We've got trouble.

373
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,250
Which one of
you is laughing?

374
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,416
Does it matter...?

375
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,750
In this situation...

376
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,583
one can't help but laugh.

377
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,333
I'll admit, you never
cease to amaze me...

378
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,083
Just when I thought
I knew exactly

379
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,458
what to expect from you...

380
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,250
You suddenly
appear before me

381
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,166
and present this taunting,
boastful side of yourself.

382
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,791
I'm not boasting,
I'm being honest...

383
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,958
We will walk my
path together...

384
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,291
However, there is one
thing that concerns me.

385
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,208
I wanna know what you're
hoping to accomplish

386
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,208
by bringing about
the Grand Order!

387
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,083
I'm sorry, I can't say...

388
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,666
I understand your curiosity

389
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,791
but I'm not ready
to reveal that yet.

390
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,041
I promise the answer will
come to you in time...

391
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,708
However, if you insist on
badgering me about it...

392
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,416
The only way you
will find out

393
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,000
is if you can "conquer"
me as you said you would!

394
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,166
Very well then...!

395
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,541
I'll do just that!

396
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,041
Sabrac and Wilhelmina...

397
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,333
Khamsin and Rebecca...

398
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,958
Shana and Yuji...

399
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,791
Emotions clash
on the battlefield

400
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,708
as the Snake of the Festival
leaves the Path of Pilgrimage.

401
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,125
Next time, on
Shakugan no Shana Final,

402
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,000
"From Rift to Rift."
