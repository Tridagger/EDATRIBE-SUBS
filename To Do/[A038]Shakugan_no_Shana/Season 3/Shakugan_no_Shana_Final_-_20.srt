1
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,708
No, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,833
Once again, I find myself
helpless and rejected.

3
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,833
I always try to do
everything myself

4
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,375
yet somehow I never
accomplish anything.

5
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,291
Now no one will
even let me try,

6
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,958
they simply leave me behind.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,208
Indeed, I reached out to her.

8
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,041
I wanted to fight for her.

9
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,458
Yet she chose to reject me
just as everyone else does.

10
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,750
You're free.

11
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,958
Relieved of duty.

12
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,333
Indeed.

13
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,708
She's right.

14
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,750
Now that I've lost my
duty as a Flame Haze,

15
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,000
I suppose that means I'm free.

16
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,833
But here I stand,
terrified at the thought.

17
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,750
What's got you all
upset, Specialist?

18
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,916
We wrapped up our business!

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So you can turn that
frown upside down!

20
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,750
I see what's
goin' on here.

21
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,583
You thought your friends,
the Engaged Link,

22
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,041
were gonna ask
you for help,

23
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,625
but instead,
they ditched you

24
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,000
and now you're
feelin' blue about it.

25
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,583
So your buddies didn't
need your help, huh?

26
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,041
Whoa, touchy subject.

27
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,583
I'm upset that nothing is
happening as it should.

28
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,208
Yeah, me too.

29
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,041
But standin' around here
isn't gonna fix anything.

30
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,666
Thousand Changes is bound
to show up any minute now.

31
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,166
You know, you're not gonna
be much help to anyone

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,333
if ya don't snap outta
this funk you're in.

33
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,041
Just focus on
what's important

34
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,166
and don't let rejection
get the best of you.

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,708
Did you notice
the Engaged Link

36
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,750
took off with the
Hyakki Yakou?

37
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,125
They grabbed Kazumi
and the geezers

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,833
and they drove
off into the sky.

39
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,416
That means, there's only
one thing for you to do.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,833
You must take action.

41
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,458
I would get a move
on if I were you.

42
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,833
I'd hate for you
to lose them

43
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,875
'cause you were
wallowing in self-pity.

44
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,916
Indeed, Chanter.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,458
I don't want to lose them.

46
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,791
I cannot hesitate
any longer.

47
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,166
I must act!

48
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,875
Advice from a hunter who
lost her purpose a while back,

49
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,625
the only way to get over it
is to get back in action!

50
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,750
Never thought I'd see the day
you'd be givin' others advice!

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,750
[Music]

52
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,375
I know not the road ahead,

53
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,833
however, I still walk it.

54
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,666
As the world changes,

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,791
humans and Denizens
change with it.

56
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,958
Is this some
sort of illusion?

57
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,333
We've been looking for you,

58
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,666
Invitation of Cheerful Playing,
Rofocale.

59
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,083
And we've found you.

60
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,166
I must say, you're not an
easy Crimson Denizen to catch.

61
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,833
We were forced to
surround you slowly

62
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,791
to lure you into our trap.

63
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,166
Hello, Transposer of
Corpses and Bodies,

64
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,416
and the Arts and Crafts
of Application.

65
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,125
I can't imagine why you
would go to all this trouble.

66
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,916
Is there a song
you'd like to hear?

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,083
No thanks, I'm not a fan.

68
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,583
I don't understand.

69
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,333
I am but a humble musician.

70
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,708
There's nothing else
I have to offer.

71
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,125
Don't try to play dumb!

72
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,000
You know exactly
what we want!

73
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,500
Out of all the god's disciples

74
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,958
you're by far the
easiest to find!

75
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,333
Disciples?

76
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,500
Ah.

77
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,000
You're using your
clairvoyance

78
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,541
to monitor the situation
in Misaki City, right?

79
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,083
We have come to
you with a request.

80
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,708
And that is?

81
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,708
We want an oracle from
the God of Guidance.

82
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,250
I had no idea seeing
the flow of power

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,750
would be so
difficult on my own.

84
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,791
It's not going to
take her very long

85
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,083
to figure out the
Silver's attack patterns.

86
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,750
I need new tactics.

87
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,750
Comin' through!

88
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,375
Sorry we're late.

89
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,875
Thanks, Sydonay.

90
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
You're here just in time.

91
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,500
All of a sudden, the boy's
personality has become dominant.

92
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,958
This could be a bad sign.

93
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,625
I've completed a
thorough assessment

94
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,541
of the battlefield, Master.

95
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,375
And I believe those three
are our biggest threat.

96
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn't expect Margery to make
an appearance, that's for sure.

97
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,833
What did Bel-Peol say?

98
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,000
She thinks the Chanter

99
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,958
and the Mobilizer of
Ceremonial Equipment

100
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,250
planted something
in the tower.

101
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,416
She's investigating
it right now.

102
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,708
I see.

103
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,375
Since you're here with us,

104
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,875
I assume you did
what we asked?

105
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,041
Yep, all done.

106
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,500
No need to worry
about a thing.

107
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,833
Unless you think Lamies

108
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,541
and his little pal
might cause us trouble.

109
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,958
The Spiral Organ

110
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,458
has given us a great deal
of information, indeed,

111
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,166
and has provided
the necessary data

112
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,833
to analyze the Psalm
of the Grand Order.

113
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,750
While she does not wish
to aid us further,

114
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,791
I do not think she
wishes us harm.

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,125
Trust for now.

116
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,958
She was gettin' all
caught up in her head.

117
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,500
We practically had to drag
her broodin' butt out here.

118
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,333
We did our best,
as her friends,

119
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,666
to shake her out of it.

120
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,333
but I'm afraid the
rest is up to you.

121
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,041
You ready, Wilhelmina?

122
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,208
Indeed, I am.

123
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,416
A major explosion

124
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,708
has been reported in central
block twenty-four!

125
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
The Flame's color is pink.

126
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,875
So far, no intruders
have been sighted.

127
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,500
Interesting.

128
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,166
Purple lightning was recently
detected in block four.

129
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,541
This could be the work of the
Scatterer of Sparkling Light

130
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,375
or the Braider of
Trembling Might

131
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,333
but for some reason,
it feels too deliberate.

132
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,958
I suppose I'll have
to divert some men

133
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,250
to find out the truth.

134
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,208
At this point, we shall
assume the first report

135
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,875
was a diversion.

136
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,250
Thus, your primary task
is recon, not combat.

137
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,583
Yes, ma'am!

138
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,875
I'm impressed
with the enemy.

139
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,166
They'll keep us guessing
till the very end.

140
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,000
Excuse me, Strategist.

141
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,875
I would like to
make a suggestion.

142
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,250
Oh? And what is that?

143
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,125
For your safety, we should order
members of our defensive forces

144
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,916
to stand guard in the
central control room.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,666
I appreciate your concern
but that's not necessary.

146
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,000
But Strategist,
are you sure?

147
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,125
I've already completed
all of the preparations

148
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,875
the master ordered.

149
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,375
There's no need to
protect me any longer.

150
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,708
It's far too late now.

151
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,875
There's nothing they
can do to stop us.

152
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,500
Flieder and Brigid
successfully captured Rofocale?

153
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,166
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,083
Apparently, they're trying to
negotiate with him right now.

155
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,083
And if all goes well,

156
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,125
the oracle will
happen in time.

157
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,125
We need it to come before the
Midnight Lost Child regenerates,

158
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,000
which is only an
hour from now.

159
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,291
Indeed.

160
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,875
All we can do now is wait.

161
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,583
I sincerely hope the God
of Guidance's influence

162
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,291
will somehow
persuade the Denizens

163
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,541
to change their ways
once and for all.

164
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
We have done everything
we possibly can.

165
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,041
As you said, all we
can do now is wait.

166
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,125
What will constitute
a victory in this war?

167
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,625
I wonder whose approval
we're ultimately seeking.

168
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,666
I see.

169
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,625
So, you want to
use my god's power

170
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,333
to spread the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter's plan

171
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,375
across the entire world?

172
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,958
Uh yeah, that's right.

173
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:42,958
Impossible.

174
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,291
Impossible?

175
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,083
But you're her
disciple, aren't you?

176
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,958
We were told the only way
to receive an oracle

177
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,041
from the God of Guidance

178
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,083
was to contact one
of her followers!

179
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,791
Technically, you are correct.

180
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,708
but I'm afraid
it's not that easy.

181
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,958
Would you stop making
excuses and...

182
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,500
That's enough, Brigid,
thank you.

183
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,333
After we've come
all this way,

184
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,166
the least that you can do is
tell us why it's not possible.

185
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,083
Very well, then.

186
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:11,958
I will.

187
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,041
Why, you ask?

188
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,208
What you seek is the
reason it cannot be done.

189
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,708
It is simple.

190
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,291
So very simple.

191
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,750
That which will be,
even if left alone.

192
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,541
That which is already
on such a path.

193
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,541
Needs no guidance.

194
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:44,458
Without reason we cannot
summon our God of Guidance,

195
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,791
the Thunderous Chant
of Awakening, Shaher.

196
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,875
It is more than simple.

197
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,875
It is natural.

198
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't understand.

199
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:03,291
When that which we disciples
see and hear is like a flame,

200
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,000
at risk of fading away
without guidance.

201
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,333
Only then are we
granted the ability

202
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,333
to summon the divine
power of our God, Shaher,

203
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,791
and act as her vessel.

204
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,708
We're gonna make it
through this, Sale!

205
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,125
They certainly aren't gonna make
this easy on us, are they?

206
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,500
Stop!

207
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,708
It hurts.

208
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,125
I wish I didn't
have to be so cruel.

209
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,125
There's no need
to feel guilty.

210
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,791
It is our duty
to kill them.

211
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,500
We're coming for you,
Grim Reaper!

212
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,041
Whenever I face a foe
without the good sense

213
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,916
to fear my beautiful dead,

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,791
I find it to be an
exhilarating experience.

215
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,875
Wouldn't you agree,
my god, Tezcatlipoca?

216
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,916
Yes indeed, I do.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,708
This is almost too easy!

218
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,000
Just look how quickly
they multiply!

219
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,375
As long as our comrades
continue to feast

220
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,208
there is no stopping us!

221
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,708
On this day, we are birds.

222
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,583
We take flight in the
face of difficult winds.

223
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,083
We look down from the
heavens and the stars above.

224
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,625
And see, in our hearts,

225
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,916
how small our world truly is.

226
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,708
The plan of the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter

227
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,208
is not enough to merit the
summoning of our god.

228
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,291
It doesn't
require guidance.

229
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,791
To invoke her divine
power would be pointless.

230
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,333
Will you please tell us
what conditions must be met

231
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,875
in order to successfully
summon the God of Guidance?

232
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,208
The first is reality.

233
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,666
If something in Misaki City

234
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,666
happens to catch my god's eye,

235
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,500
then perhaps
there is a chance.

236
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,250
Isn't the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter's

237
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,125
plan enough?

238
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,916
No, I'm afraid it's not.

239
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,625
A theatre of war is
unfolding on the stage

240
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,750
where the new world
will be created.

241
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,625
No one can know what
the outcome will be.

242
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,000
If you're fortunate.

243
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,333
Something unexpected
may occur.

244
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,625
How is this possible?

245
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,041
Jeez, would ya
cool it, Khamsin?

246
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,833
Try not to stand
out so much!

247
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,416
You're freakin'
me out, man!

248
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,125
Quit your whinin', Gyuuki.

249
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,208
If he hadn't knocked those
fireballs outta the way,

250
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,541
they would've hit us.

251
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,291
Sorry, I got
bent outta shape

252
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,916
but I'm worried
about the girl.

253
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,250
I'm tryin' to
drive safely.

254
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,625
Just do whatcha can
to help me out, okay?

255
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,458
Huh? The master wants me
to attack the Hyakki Yakou?

256
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,458
Does that mean I
gotta go after them?

257
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,041
Yes, that's what
it would entail.

258
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,083
Aw man, that sucks.

259
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,375
And I just set everything
up to take him down, too.

260
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,083
I can handle Eastedge.

261
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,625
You need to follow
the master's orders.

262
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,166
Yeah, why should I?

263
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,750
I don't think that he
should have the right

264
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,958
to order us around anymore.

265
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,416
Watch what you say.

266
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,666
Just because the master
isn't as present at the moment

267
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,500
doesn't mean
he's not with us.

268
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,708
We simply have to deal
with the boy for now.

269
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,625
Yeah, I get it;
I'll see you soon.

270
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,625
Don't go get yourself
killed, Ribesal.

271
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,583
I'll try not to but I
can't make any promises.

272
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,958
They're trying to separate
me from the master!

273
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,916
Hello, Margery.

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,083
I'm sorry about what
happened earlier.

275
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,500
I didn't take
it personally.

276
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,875
After all, this is war.

277
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,416
But don't think
you're gonna get off

278
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
without one good
punch to the face!

279
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,875
Won't let me land
a punch, huh?

280
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,083
Then how about this?

281
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,875
The time is indeed now.

282
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,208
We cannot fail.

283
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,750
Dickery, dickery, dare!

284
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,833
The pig flew
up in the air!

285
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,625
The man in brown,
soon brought him down!

286
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,166
Dickery, dickery,
dickery, dare!

287
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,166
No!

288
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,833
We shall not let
you interfere.

289
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,291
It's no use.

290
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,708
I can't stop it!

291
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,291
No, it can't be.

292
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,166
Yuji's Unrestricted Spell?

293
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,791
No way.

294
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,875
How is this possible?

295
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,625
It's not the Snake of
the Festival's spell,

296
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,458
it's mine!

297
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,708
I don't have much time!

298
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,875
I've got to finish this

299
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,291
before he's able to
master the spell!

300
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,791
More rings?

301
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,833
She's going to attack the
World Egg with the Psalm again?

302
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,750
Damn it! This time she
might actually do it!

303
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,000
I have to cast my
Unrestricted Spell.

304
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,041
I did it!

305
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:19,166
[Music]

306
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,458
With the use of her
Unrestricted Spell,

307
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,750
Shana makes her true
intentions clear.

308
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,500
Meanwhile, the others continue
their assault on the enemy.

309
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,791
Everyone gives their all,

310
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,875
filling the battlefield
with flames and chaos.

311
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,166
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

312
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,208
"One Reason."
