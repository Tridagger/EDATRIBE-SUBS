1
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,625
Sale. It looks like
everyone's really sad.

2
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,666
I've never seen such a
miserable looking group.

3
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,458
They've completely
lost morale.

4
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,583
I guess this is the end
of the pursuit squad.

5
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,708
This is seriously
messed up!

6
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, we can't just
sit here and cry.

7
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,708
We're gonna have to find a
way to get back up on our feet.

8
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,500
But we should wait and see
what the commander has to say.

9
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,041
Chiara!

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,708
You don't reek
of booze today.

11
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,583
-Why is that?
-Jeez, kid.

12
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,666
Ya make me sound
like an alchie.

13
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, when the
going gets tough

14
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,291
you're usually drinking.

15
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,833
She hit the nail
on the head!

16
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,750
Although, anyone would
be driven to drink after

17
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,625
hearing the Declaration
of the Grand Order.

18
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,208
Every Flame Haze
around the world heard

19
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,958
what that despicable
bastard had to say,

20
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,500
which means they're
probably in the same shape

21
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,958
as everyone here...
utterly depressed.

22
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,250
It's gonna be hard to
go back into battle

23
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,958
knowing that's the case.

24
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,333
I have faith in you.

25
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,000
I know it's rough.

26
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,250
I felt the same way once,
but I'm here today

27
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,875
because I refused
to give up.

28
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,500
Please, don't be sad.

29
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,416
As long as you
stay positive,

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,458
you'll inspire the
others to cheer up.

31
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,125
That's our little Chiara!


32
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,458
Always looking on
the bright side!


33
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,625
I wish we could say the
same for her mentors.

34
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,208
Are you going to
keep fighting?

35
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,791
I'm in, but Sale's gonna
need a stiff drink.

36
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,291
Shut up.

37
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,291
Sure. I might as well.

38
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,125
Not like I was destined
to be a Flame Haze;

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,083
I was forced into a contract.

40
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,666
So I guess that "Grand Order"
crap shouldn't affect me.

41
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,583
Do you read me? Sale?

42
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,791
Chiara?

43
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,708
Just in the nick of time!

44
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,916
Please don't tell me
these are all the troops

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,375
we have left, Francois.

46
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,708
Oh no, ma'am.

47
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,333
Many of our allies are
still in the mountains.

48
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,708
They've completely
splintered off

49
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,583
and refuse to regroup.

50
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,208
I'm afraid we're going
to have to abandon

51
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,291
our original plan.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,541
Seriously?

53
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,375
You mean, we aren't going
to head towards

54
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,708
Heaven's Road Palace?

55
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,250
No.

56
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,000
"We" are not.

57
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,708
In other words, those
of us whose thoughts

58
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,750
are not clouded
by depression

59
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,250
have a greater responsibility
than retreating.

60
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,750
That is correct.

61
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,250
We shall halt our enemy
pursuit and focus our efforts

62
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,000
on getting our less
fortunate allies

63
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,208
to Heaven's Road
Palace safely.

64
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,583
I gotta say, it's gonna
be tough to pull that off.

65
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,000
Supreme Commander, it
would be a grave mistake

66
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,083
to lead them straight
to the Palace.

67
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
The enemy would undoubtedly
learn of its location.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,708
They'll never find it.

69
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,041
I've some tricks
up my sleeve.

70
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,791
We all do but it makes no
difference at this point.

71
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,833
The reality of the
situation is we simply

72
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,875
do not have the manpower
necessary to take action.

73
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,166
I know, but we must save
as many lives as we can.

74
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,583
Pardon me.

75
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,666
I hate to interrupt but
may I say something?

76
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,166
And what about the enemy
forces on the plains?

77
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,625
They've been eliminated.

78
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,791
The few survivors managed to
flee into the mountains.

79
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,000
Attention pursuit squads!

80
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,041
Expand your search radius
to include the mountains.

81
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,208
Your primary target is the
enemy's mobile fortress,

82
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,916
Heaven's Road Palace.

83
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,833
They were clearly headed east
before they scattered.

84
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,958
After mulling over their
choice of direction,

85
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,958
I came to a realization.

86
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,000
The only explanation
is there must have been

87
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,708
something there that was
meant to aid in their escape.

88
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,791
And you think it
was the Palace?

89
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,541
I've ordered our
reinforcements in the

90
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,541
north and south to surround
the mountains at a distance.

91
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,625
They're in hiding now but we'll
draw them out eventually.

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,625
Is that snow?

93
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,500
No, it's rain.

94
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,791
My Burning Field has
been rendered powerless.

95
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,166
That's Sirotci's
Unrestricted Spell

96
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,958
but the lapis lazuli
colored flame--

97
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,000
could this rain be the
great barrier, Tlalocan?

98
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,166
That means the Four Gods of the
Earth are aiding the enemy!

99
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,666
We don't stand a chance
against those monsters, sir!

100
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,333
Even as a last resort,

101
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,208
why would Sirotci build such
a tower in plain sight?

102
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,791
And then to light a flame
to ensure we see it.

103
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,791
It must be a decoy.

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,208
Please stand.

105
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,291
You have to stay strong.

106
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,166
You mustn't give
up the fight.

107
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,958
You see that tower?

108
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,416
I want you to keep running
until you reach it.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
There you will find
a means of escape.

110
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,666
I found them!

111
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
Over there! Attack, men!

112
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,541
Amazing.

113
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,541
This is the power
of Tlalocan.

114
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,958
The transformation
of energy.

115
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,791
Like a beacon of light
piercing the darkness,

116
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,208
you must persevere
against your foes.

117
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,916
A Flame Haze remembers the
sorrows of the past

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,041
but always looks
to the future.

119
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,833
Allied forces are
currently headed towards

120
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,416
the tower, sir.

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,791
And the rain has blocked
all long-distance communication.

122
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,291
My Burning Field has
been disabled as well.

123
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,541
We know the
tower's a decoy

124
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,833
yet we've no way
of stopping them.

125
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,166
Perhaps this was
their plan all along.

126
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,083
Send a messenger to
the rear forces

127
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,000
telling them to hold
their position.

128
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,208
Contact the
advancing squads

129
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,708
and order them to withdraw.

130
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,833
If our encirclement
collapses--

131
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,541
Now we've got you!

132
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,208
If you make an
attempt to advance,

133
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,916
we will indeed stop you!

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,625
Have they come
to draw me out?

135
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,125
If that's the case.

136
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,625
How could you let the
pursuit squad walk

137
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,916
right into their
trap, Commander?

138
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,416
It's the General!

139
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,291
He has decided
to show himself.

140
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,208
Thousand Changes Sydonay!

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,083
He has arrived.

142
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,333
Apparently.

143
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,250
Come on, we're
almost there!

144
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,041
We gotta keep
going, you guys!

145
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,250
We haven't much time!

146
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,375
Hurry, comrades.

147
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,125
Into the tower!

148
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,291
Watch out!

149
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,583
Ah. The Beckoner
of Brightened Dew

150
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,541
and the Guardian
of Steady Passage

151
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,375
have made our job in this
operation quite easy.

152
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,041
You care to tell
me how, exactly?

153
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,666
Ah.

154
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,208
We just have to wait here.

155
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,250
And we'll have an unlimited
supply of things to destroy.

156
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,208
Now I get it!

157
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,708
It's unscathed?

158
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,583
No! Fire now!

159
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,083
We made them believe
the tower's a decoy

160
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,250
but we're actually
gathering our forces here,

161
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,625
in order to carry out
our true objective.

162
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,750
Yes. We are relying on a
tactician's greatest trick,

163
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,250
the manipulation of
perceived reality.

164
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,333
I bet you weren't expecting
me to show up, were you?

165
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,166
To be honest, I've grown
tired of the games, ladies.

166
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,291
I tried to play nice,

167
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,708
but if there's one
thing you're good at,

168
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,291
it's making me angry.

169
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,291
I'll take care of
these two, Commander.

170
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,666
While I do that,

171
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,208
please try to get our
surrounding forces

172
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,125
under control.

173
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,708
Yes, sir.

174
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,416
Now then.

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,125
The master's never
given an order

176
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,333
that would prohibit
me from killing you.

177
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,750
What a shame for you.

178
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,708
-Wilhelmina!
-Right behind you, milady!

179
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,541
All forces within the
encirclement are now safe.

180
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,750
Thanks to your plan to
draw the enemy here,

181
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,041
the process went much
faster than anticipated.

182
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,458
That's good news

183
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,958
but it wouldn't have been
possible without your help.

184
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,916
Gentlemen, this is not
the time to rejoice

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for there is still
more work to be done.

186
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,333
True.

187
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,500
The worst is yet to come.

188
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,583
I hope we can
make this work.

189
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,708
Me, too.

190
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,625
There are so many
lives on the line.

191
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,125
What's the matter?

192
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,541
Hero of the Great War?

193
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,291
Blazing eyed hunter?

194
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,666
I thought the two of you were
going to present a challenge.

195
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,208
Good, I was hoping
you'd do that.

196
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,375
Emblaze!

197
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,375
Okay, now we're talking.

198
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,375
I was wondering when you'd take
off the kid gloves and fight.

199
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,375
Consider this
your last warning.

200
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,000
Do not attack unless you're
prepared to burn to death

201
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:54,875
amidst the flames.

202
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,250
You have been warned.

203
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,708
That's quite a threat.

204
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,500
You really think
you can kill me?

205
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,791
We'll see about that.

206
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,916
Interesting.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,541
Their attacks aren't nearly
as vicious as their threat.

208
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,166
And why do they keep returning
to the same positions?

209
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,541
Keep firing and
we'll take it down!

210
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
You heard him!

211
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,791
All troops, fire away!

212
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,541
Now, into the fray!

213
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,083
Our forces will not stop

214
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,500
until they've completely
destroyed the tower.

215
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,333
I can't believe we
were foolish enough

216
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,666
to fall for my
rival's gambit.

217
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,583
Well played, Sirotci.

218
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,458
When I was human I was
taught to fight for

219
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,166
what I care about.

220
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,291
Now, here I am,
centuries later,

221
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,375
still fighting for
the same cause.

222
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
But this time,

223
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
no one is forcing my hand.

224
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,000
I chose to fight
this battle.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The decoy's served
its purpose

226
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,458
which means Heaven's Road Palace
is probably already gone.

227
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,958
Even though I know the
retreating soldiers are injured

228
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,250
and likely won't have any
effect on the battle.

229
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,375
I still don't want
them getting away.

230
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,125
One of the Four
Gods of the Earth?

231
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,750
This should be fun!

232
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,250
I hate to interrupt

233
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,125
but may I say
something?

234
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,583
After much deliberation,

235
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,125
the Beckoner of
Brightened Dew

236
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,791
has finally reached
a decision.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We will join you, our fellow
Flame Haze, in battle.

238
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,958
He who Walks with Rain
speaks not only for himself,

239
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,625
but the other three
Gods of the Earth.

240
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,083
He came to this decision

241
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,625
after hearing the Snake of
the Festival's declaration.

242
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,333
What did he say
that got to ya?

243
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,916
He claimed that
creating a new world

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,750
would not have an adverse
effect on this one.

245
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,041
I remember many
centuries ago,

246
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,541
our wise former teacher,

247
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,625
known as the
Heart of the Sky,

248
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
shared something with
us that unfortunately

249
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,083
most Flame Haze
do not know.

250
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,750
The cause of the
storm in the rift

251
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,208
which foretells the
great disaster.

252
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,958
Basically, the devouring of
human souls by Crimson Denizens

253
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,458
creates an unstable energy

254
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,791
that is called the
Power of Existence.

255
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,083
Each time this happens,
the world shakes.

256
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,666
Eventually these small
vibrations combine to form waves

257
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,250
which then grow
to become a storm.

258
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,000
If the God of Creation
takes his Crimson Denizens

259
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,083
to the new world
he creates,

260
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,833
the Earth will regain its
lost Power of Existence

261
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,625
and the storm that has
been brewing in the rift

262
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,166
will subside.

263
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,041
Yes, but if they don't
change their ways,

264
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,541
and they act in the new
world as they did here,

265
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,125
it's a matter of time.

266
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,458
Until disaster strikes.

267
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,666
That's true.

268
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,958
However, if that
were to happen,

269
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,791
it wouldn't have any effect
on the people in this world.

270
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,541
Now, I am sure you
are asking yourselves,

271
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,458
why we four gods
chose to join

272
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,750
your fight against
the God of Creation.

273
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,000
It's because...

274
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,625
Just like the Crimson World,

275
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,375
the new one that
is created...

276
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,666
...will affect this world,

277
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,375
which you are charged
with protecting.

278
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,583
That's right.

279
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,916
As the Four Gods
of the Earth,

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,541
it is our duty to uphold
the natural order,

281
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,291
and right now it
is being threatened

282
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,416
by the Snake of the Festival.

283
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,791
If you'll agree to
fight alongside us,

284
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,625
we'll do everything
in our power

285
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,875
to ensure that your army makes
it onto the next battlefield.

286
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,208
Well, Shana?

287
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,625
Will you fight?

288
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,625
When I move into that area

289
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,666
they suddenly cease
their assault,

290
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,500
and whenever I attack
in this direction

291
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,208
they dash to block it.

292
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,750
They must be
hiding something!

293
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
Could it be
Heaven's Road Palace

294
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,750
that they're
trying to protect?

295
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,375
They lead us to believe
it had already left,

296
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,958
but it was hidden
here all along.

297
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,375
True Crimson!

298
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,875
Below us!

299
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,791
You think you can hide
Heaven's Road Palace?

300
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,625
Not from me!

301
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,625
Pierce through!

302
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,041
Nice try!

303
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,750
The Chanter?

304
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,375
Six little mice
sat down to spin.

305
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,708
Pussy passed by,
and she peeped in.

306
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,791
"What are you at,
my little men?"

307
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,166
"We're making coats
for gentlemen!"

308
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,750
"Shall I come in and
bite your threads?"

309
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,750
"No, no, Miss Pussy,
you'll bite off our heads!"

310
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
"Oh no, I'll not,
I'll help you spin."

311
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,125
"That may be so but
you don't come in!"

312
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
Man, I need a nap
and a martini.

313
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,750
Looks like somebody's
back to normal.

314
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,416
It's good to
see you, indeed.

315
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,791
Rendezvous complete.

316
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,333
I feel like I haven't
seen you in ages,

317
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,125
lil miss. ou're lookin' good.

318
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,416
You've got this
aura about you.

319
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,375
It's 'cause I'm
stronger now.

320
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,333
Tell me, how long do you think
your spell will hold him?

321
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,166
All we need is ten minutes

322
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,916
and the Beckoner of Brightened
Dew could come with us.

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,708
While I appreciate your
concern for my well-being,

324
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,791
you must remember
that greediness

325
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,833
is not a quality
befitting a true god.

326
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,875
If I undo the Tlalocan now,
it would be disastrous.

327
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,041
Without it, the enemy
would surely realize

328
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,875
that Heaven's Road Palace is
right within their reach.

329
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,916
It's necessary to
cover your tracks

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,833
so they cannot figure
out where you've gone.

331
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,958
Therefore, I will stay
and keep it flowing.

332
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,083
I am simply following the
plan that we agreed upon.

333
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,583
You mustn't waste precious
time worrying about us,

334
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,291
or the Guardian
of Steady Passage,

335
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,458
who faces the
enemy army alone.

336
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,500
We are aware of the
fate that awaits us.

337
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,041
Time is running out,
even as we speak.

338
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,250
Please, hurry.

339
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, ladies.

340
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,125
We'd better get going.

341
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,000
Our ride should be coming
for us any minute now...

342
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,250
Whoa!

343
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,791
He's already
breaking through?

344
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,250
You thought a simple spell
was strong enough to hold me?

345
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,375
Give me a break.

346
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,041
You'll have to do
better than that.

347
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,500
Thousand Changes!

348
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,833
Oh, I get it.

349
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,375
You're staying behind
to help them escape.

350
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,166
You'll distract
me with a fight

351
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,750
and keep the Tlalocan going
as long as you're able.

352
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,583
Is that the game, old man?

353
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,000
Let me guess,

354
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,166
the real Heaven's Road Palace
is long gone.

355
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,916
So one of the Four Gods of
the Earth is willing to die?

356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,291
Yes.

357
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,958
I will fight until I've
used the last of my power,

358
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,416
because now I know I'm
fighting for the right cause.

359
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
Thousand Changes Sydonay,

360
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,583
we would be honored

361
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,458
if you would fight against
us in our last battle.

362
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,958
You're going to attack me
regardless of how I respond,

363
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,958
aren't you?

364
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,958
The mission was successful.

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,958
It seems I've found my way
to death's door once again.

366
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,583
It's no different than
when I was human,

367
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,458
except that this is exactly
where I want to die.

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,958
Zirnitra, my dear comrade,

369
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,875
thank you for renewing my
existence with your contract

370
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,291
and allowing me
to fight with you.

371
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,000
My pleasure, comrade.

372
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,333
For six centuries I have rued
the day our contract would end,

373
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,666
Samuel Demantius.

374
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,041
Well, old friend.

375
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,958
I'm afraid that
time is upon us.

376
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,583
Does this mean that
you are going to die?

377
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,083
It certainly
looks that way.

378
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,791
But I don't think it means as
much the second time around.

379
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,541
In that case,
I bid you farewell.

380
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,208
I shall return
to the Crimson World

381
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,291
until my next battle begins.

382
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,375
Good luck to you.

383
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,250
My comrade, Zirnitra.

384
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,708
I thank you for
your service,

385
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,791
and your friendship,
Samuel Demantius.

386
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,125
Do not fret.

387
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,500
There is no one who could
have done more than you,

388
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,916
Thousand Changes Sydonay.

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,375
Besides, we are
in no position

390
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,541
to mourn an unexpected
defeat right now.

391
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,041
Yes, sir.

392
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,583
Tell me Bel-Peol,

393
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,833
do you know when my body
will be stable enough to move?

394
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,458
Stabilization is now
at fifty percent,

395
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,916
but, please bear in mind,

396
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,750
we have other
tasks to complete

397
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,958
so it may be a while
before we can leave.

398
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,750
Excellent.

399
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,208
I cannot wait to
leave this place,

400
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,208
once and for all.

401
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:48,208
[Music]

402
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,583
Using Heaven's Road Palace

403
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,666
to transport all of
our defeated troops

404
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,291
through the enemy's
endless sea of soldiers

405
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,125
would have been
impossible.

406
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,958
Instead, we dug a pit large
enough to hold the Palace

407
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,791
and buried it
into the Earth.

408
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,291
Tlaloc then
summoned greenery

409
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,750
to conceal the
freshly turned soil.

410
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,875
The troops were ordered

411
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,583
to enter the tower
Sirotci constructed.

412
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,041
Once everyone was
accounted for,

413
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,875
they were led here via
an underground passage.

414
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,375
The Guardian of Steady
Passage acted as a decoy

415
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,791
and defended the tower,

416
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,291
while the Chanter of Elegies

417
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,416
made the enemy believe a
fake was hidden nearby,

418
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,708
and the Beckoner
of Brightened Dew

419
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,625
functioned as
a rear guard.

420
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,583
We've lost the battle,

421
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,375
though we gave it our all,

422
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,000
we're left with nothing.

423
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,708
But, we're still alive.

424
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,500
Every Flame Haze
here is lucky.

425
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,791
They will live to
see another day.

426
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,666
That is the one bright
spot in this tragedy.

427
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,791
I will fight.

428
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,791
That is good news indeed.

429
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,125
I knew I could count on
you to fight alongside me

430
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,708
because you are the
contractor of a true god.

431
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,791
Do me a favor,
Bright Flame.

432
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,416
Give the other three
Gods of the Earth,

433
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,333
my fellow priests,

434
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,791
a message on my behalf.

435
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,625
"My friends, I have
become a drop of rain.

436
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,125
I sacrificed myself in the
hopes of forcing you to act.

437
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,125
So please believe
me when I say... "

438
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,333
"Joining the Flame Haze in
their fight is, without doubt,

439
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,875
the right choice to make."

440
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,541
After suffering an
agonizing defeat,

441
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,958
Shana and the others are
left shaken and confused.

442
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,250
Should they face
Bal Masque again?

443
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,458
Is the creation of
Xanadu right or wrong?

444
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,833
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

445
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,375
"To Battle Once More."
