1
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,375
Hecate!

2
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,708
I'm all right.

3
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,625
It hurts but the
pain is fleeting.

4
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,750
I thought they
meant to destroy it?

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,541
What did you do?

6
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,833
I demand to know
what you've done

7
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,625
to my paradise!

8
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,625
We'll get to that,

9
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,583
but first, there's
something you oughta hear.

10
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,500
The God of Atonement
and his contractor.

11
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,125
Have a message for you.

12
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,291
Our goal is not to prevent
the creation of paradise.

13
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,375
But to prevent the
creation of a world

14
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,041
where anarchy
reigns supreme.

15
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,375
So, we are adding a law to
the Psalm of the Grand Order.

16
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,208
One that shall apply to all
Denizens in the new world.

17
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,166
So, they're not attempting
to destroy the spell

18
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,875
but to change it?

19
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,625
You mean to crush the
dreams of my loyal servants

20
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,375
by altering their
paradise, Xanadu?

21
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,500
The law we've added
prohibits the Denizens

22
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,583
from devouring
human souls.

23
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,791
And if you refuse
to uphold it,

24
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,125
there will be no Xanadu!

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,708
[Music]

26
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,083
How dare you?

27
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,000
You would oppose us by
attempting to alter

28
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,750
the very laws of nature?

29
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,250
Sydonay!

30
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,625
Are you prepared to fight?

31
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,166
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,541
Shame for you.

33
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,916
If only you had
played nice,

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,333
I might've let you live.

35
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,166
They cleared the
spell's entire memory!

36
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,666
This is a catastrophe!

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,125
They didn't just wipe its
memory, they modified it!

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I hate to be the bearer of
more bad news, Professor,

39
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,791
but that spell
fragment is altering

40
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,208
the Psalm of the
Grand Order's very core!

41
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,416
I'm not gonna let them
get away with this!

42
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,708
They think
they can prevent

43
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,166
the transformation of
humanity's existence?

44
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,625
Well, guess again!

45
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,708
How dare those imbecilic,
dunderheaded, buffoons

46
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,708
stand in the way
of our paradise?

47
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,125
Nothin' personal,

48
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,416
we just don't agree with
your idea of paradise.

49
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,916
What'd you expect, Dad?

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
He may be
artificially created,

51
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,041
but he's still a Flame Haze!

52
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,500
Sale!

53
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,750
I dunno if this
is gonna work.

54
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,625
But we might as
well give it a try.

55
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,875
You have the nerve
to call me "Dad"?

56
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,416
You're merely a reminder
of a botched experiment!

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,250
A lemon, a turkey, a flop!

58
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,625
And today's the last day

59
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,625
I have to look at
your face, you failure!

60
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,250
Well, if you haven't got
anything nice to say...

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,291
He's got 'em programmed
not to shoot each other.

62
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,375
He's gonna make this hard
for us to the bitter end.

63
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,125
How stupid do you
take me for, "son"?

64
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,708
You really thought your
little trick would work?

65
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,666
Okay, here goes.

66
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,666
I won't allow you to
ruin this day for us!

67
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,250
No! We have waited far
too long for our paradise!

68
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,000
When'd you get here?

69
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,125
We don't have time to
deal with him right now.

70
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,083
I ain't lettin' you
get to the new world;

71
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,833
it'll be a better place without
a dangerous psycho like you!

72
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,833
Oh no! Professor!

73
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,958
I've had enough
of you, Sale!

74
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,291
You're mine!

75
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,041
Surely they realize there's
no tactical advantage

76
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
to resuming their advance.

77
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,458
So why do they
continue to fight?

78
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
Don't know.

79
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,083
At this point,
all I do know,

80
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
is the Flame Haze are
dead set against us

81
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,166
ever getting to Xanadu.

82
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,625
We know what we must do.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,416
We've got to protect
the True Ruler's Shrine.

84
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
Envelope and protect!

85
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,916
Robes of Nimrod!

86
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,958
Now that we have
their attention,

87
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,750
we can have a
word with them.

88
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,875
Oh, good. I would
much rather be able

89
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,166
to discuss the
matter with them

90
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,125
than have to fight
to the death.

91
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,500
The words spoken by Alastor,

92
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,833
the God of Atonement,
and his contractor,

93
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,875
the Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter, Shana,

94
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,958
were meant only
for your ears.

95
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,041
Please tell me that you've
not only heard their message

96
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,750
but you've taken it to heart.

97
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,541
We heard what the
girl had to say

98
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,750
but it's not going to
make any difference.

99
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,208
You're not going
to persuade us

100
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,041
to change the laws of
nature solely to appease you!

101
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,458
Oh, I'm not attempting
to persuade you,

102
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,125
because there isn't anything
that would require changing.

103
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,833
If we share
with you the words

104
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,916
we told the Flaming-Haired
Blazing- Eyed Hunter,

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
perhaps it will all
become clear to you.

106
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
They were,
"Dream a splendid dream,

107
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,291
and then let your actions
reveal the dream."

108
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
You've already
ruined our paradise

109
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,791
so I don't see any reason to
continue this pointless battle.

110
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
But the party's just
getting started!

111
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,541
Our work here isn't
finished yet, Commander.

112
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,750
We will not rest until we
kill, butcher, and slay

113
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,000
every last one
of your allies!

114
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,708
It shouldn't be
too difficult,

115
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,041
just like lambs to slaughter,
no matter how many fall,

116
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,958
the others still
make their way here.

117
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,250
I could slay ten thousand,
a hundred thousand,

118
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,541
or even a million,

119
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,083
but their desire
to go to Xanadu

120
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,541
would still
lead them to me.

121
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,041
I swear to you,
here and now,

122
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,250
that my beautiful dead

123
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,375
will devour each and
every Crimson Denizen

124
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,125
who's dared to taste
the flesh of man!

125
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,041
I will rip one of you
apart for every life

126
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,708
that has been taken;
for every soul lost!

127
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,375
A gift for the new world,
before its birth!

128
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
That is your goal?

129
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,041
But why would the
Four Gods of the Earth

130
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,666
sacrifice themselves
for such a cause?

131
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,916
Who said anything about

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,083
sacrificing ourselves,
Commander?

133
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,666
I should get back
to business,

134
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,916
but before I do I have
a message for you.

135
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,666
This is senseless!

136
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,291
How many of my comrades
do you intend to kill?

137
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,833
Hundreds? Thousands?

138
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,458
For what reason?

139
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,333
I want you to listen well,

140
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
powerful creature that walks
the bountiful Earth.

141
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,250
It is said

142
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,958
"we will be known forever by
the tracks we leave behind."

143
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,583
And he tracks that
you've left...

144
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,708
Are laden with
the blood of man.

145
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,166
Any who come to this
land out of greed

146
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,333
will feel the wrath
of the heavens.

147
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,625
Their punishment...

148
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,875
...is death.

149
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,333
Those who are lucky enough to
survive the wrath of the heavens

150
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,708
will never forget.

151
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,833
That this is how
those greedy beasts,

152
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,083
those who've tasted
the flesh of man,

153
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,208
were wiped from the Earth.

154
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,833
Insolent fool!

155
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,750
Do you honestly believe
your meaningless threats

156
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,666
are going to stop Denizens
from devouring humans?

157
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,500
Perhaps I cannot dissuade
you and your brethren

158
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,958
but I have no doubt our
actions here today

159
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,958
will influence your
future generations.

160
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,958
Your descendants will
know the new world

161
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,500
as their homeland.

162
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,875
And it will live on
long after those

163
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,708
who have gathered
here have perished.

164
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,916
You will be thought
of as nothing more

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,208
than the messengers
of the past.

166
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,541
You will be looked down
upon as the creatures

167
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,250
that once devoured
the souls of man.

168
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,083
When you go to
the new world,

169
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,583
you will share the story of
what happened here today

170
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,583
with your fellow Denizens as
you travel, eat, and play.

171
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,958
You will tell them how
those who devoured man

172
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,791
were kept from
their paradise.

173
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,916
They were killed
without mercy.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,541
Your actions will
be considered taboo.

175
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,000
And your own kind
will rise against you.

176
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,625
Then, once we make
it to the new world,

177
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,333
we'll never speak
of it again!

178
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,625
It would be impossible

179
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,625
to keep such a thing
secret for long.

180
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,708
Eventually someone
would speak of it.

181
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,208
Does this mean we're doomed?

182
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,958
The only reason
we are here today

183
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,416
is to ensure this
prophecy becomes truth.

184
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,416
We have come to
bring death to all

185
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,791
who have tasted
the flesh of man.

186
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
Then you'll have to
get through me first!

187
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,208
Why are you telling
me this nonsense

188
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,583
and not the others?

189
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,083
I don't see how that could
possibly do you any good!

190
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
If we tell those with many
comrades our intentions,

191
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
then we know it will only
be a matter of time

192
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,291
before our words have spread.

193
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,416
The future of your
kind has been decided.

194
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,041
From this day forward,

195
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,000
the devouring of humans souls
is strictly forbidden.

196
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,916
You Crimson Denizens,
who share the Earth with us,

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,208
you know, as priests,

198
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,166
it is our duty to
watch over creation.

199
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,000
We are responsible for the
future of not only the Earth,

200
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,833
but the Crimson World
and the rift, as well.

201
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,541
Now and forever.

202
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,666
Your god's tale of creation
cannot continue without us.

203
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,208
Is this a dream?

204
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,791
It's so pretty.

205
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,875
I'd like to thank you,
Kazumi Yoshida.

206
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,833
You're thanking me, Johann?

207
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,875
If it weren't for you,

208
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,750
Pheles never would've
fulfilled my wish

209
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,625
because it went against
her own desires.

210
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,500
But if I had stayed inside the
Midnight Lost Child any longer,

211
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,333
I would've vanished.

212
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,541
Thankfully, your call to
her brought us together

213
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,000
before that happened.

214
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,250
I'm so sorry.

215
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,916
After all this time,

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,375
I think I finally understand
how Pheles felt

217
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,583
when she gave
me the Giralda.

218
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,750
I forced her to
make a sacrifice

219
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,458
that would change
her life forever,

220
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,541
all because it might help
two people I care about.

221
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,083
That was so selfish of me.

222
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,708
I hope she can forgive me.

223
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,833
I can't believe you're
apologizing to Pheles,

224
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,583
especially after everything
she's put you through.

225
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,833
You're very sweet

226
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666
but I should be the
one apologizing

227
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,083
for getting you involved.

228
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,541
No, it's okay.

229
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,916
My sole purpose for
bringing you here

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,458
was to ask you to deliver
a message to a friend,

231
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,250
but I'm glad we got
the chance to talk.

232
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,833
A message?

233
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,416
I'm afraid I won't
have the opportunity

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,916
to relay it myself.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,833
Even though she
had no choice,

236
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,958
Pheles feels terrible
about being cold to her

237
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,458
and doesn't want to
add to her troubles.

238
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,750
But, as far as
I'm concerned,

239
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,791
she's the only
one we can trust.

240
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,500
I'd say she's the
best friend we have.

241
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,333
So what are you
gonna do now?

242
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,333
If it's something Pheles
doesn't want to happen,

243
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,750
then I assume that means.

244
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,791
Yes. I'm going to disappear.

245
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,875
I know I'm quickly
running out of time,

246
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,625
but I plan to leave a
glimmer of hope behind.

247
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,500
Just one, before
I'm gone forever.

248
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,541
But Johann, there's
gotta be a way.

249
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,750
It's okay.

250
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,041
I've accepted my fate.

251
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,041
As long as everything works
out the way I've planned,

252
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,708
I know my memory
will live on

253
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,291
in the hearts of
others eternally.

254
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,583
I'm going to use the
upcoming miracle of creation

255
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,958
to my advantage.

256
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,625
Basically, we were
hoping to get in

257
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,250
on the God of Creation's
Grand Order.

258
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,625
That's why we gave you the
Scroll to change the spell.

259
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,333
It's all a part
of our plan.

260
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,833
Promise me that you'll keep
all of this a secret, okay?

261
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,875
The God of Creation and
the other Flame Haze

262
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,000
would get pretty upset if
they knew what we're up to.

263
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,166
I will.

264
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,458
I promise you.

265
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,416
Beautiful, isn't it?

266
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,875
Pheles and I came here the first
time we ever flew together.

267
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,625
It was so long ago
and I was so young.

268
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,125
I remember that I wanted
to fly by her side forever,

269
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:21,708
so I tried my best to ignore
how cold the wind felt.

270
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,375
I tried, but I still
lost consciousness,

271
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,791
and the next thing I knew,

272
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,541
I woke up lying
next to this lake.

273
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,291
I thought she was going
to be angry with me

274
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,875
but she just smiled and said,

275
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,791
"You'll do better next time".

276
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,500
It's been hundreds of years

277
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,083
and this is the first time
we've come back to visit.

278
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,166
We've flown all over the
world together since then.

279
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,000
But, in a way, this is
where our journey began.

280
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,000
That must be why she
decided to bring us here.

281
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,666
Ah, yes.

282
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,625
It almost feels as though

283
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,625
nothing's changed since then.

284
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,125
I'm still just as happy.

285
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,416
I can face anything

286
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,708
as long as I've got
Pheles by my side.

287
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,708
I feel the same
way, Johann.

288
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,541
Where am I?

289
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,916
Oh, you're finally awake!

290
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,791
That's the gist of what
happened while you were out.

291
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,416
Basically, we're
on the run.

292
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
I know it's a
lot to take in

293
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,083
especially with the
craziness outside.

294
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,041
Hope I was able to make
some sense of it for ya.

295
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,583
Yeah. I guess.

296
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,583
Our original plan was to lay
low until this was all over.

297
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,333
Unfortunately, our
Denizen comrades

298
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,625
aren't gonna
let that happen.

299
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,083
Damn it! We can't
go this way either.

300
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,375
You're gonna have to come
up with another route, Para!

301
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,666
Roger!

302
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,333
You're mine!

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,708
Darn it, I almost had him!

304
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,083
Watch your mouth,
young lady!

305
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,875
You knew this wasn't
going to be easy.

306
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,083
You've gotta hurry but
don't do anything risky!

307
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,208
Thanks, kid.

308
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,833
Well, this is
embarrassing.

309
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,625
Have you completely
gone insane?

310
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,041
What the heck
were you thinking?

311
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,416
Language, Chiara!

312
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,833
But she's right, you are
acting out of character.

313
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,083
You know your dad's just
trying to push your buttons!

314
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't let yourself get all
wrapped up in his drama!

315
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
But you gotta understand,

316
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,833
this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

317
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,500
You see, we want to be the
ones who take down Dantalion,

318
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,041
the Seeking Researcher,

319
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,666
and this may very well be
our only chance to do it.

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,958
Exactly.

321
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,416
I thought I had a good
shot at it back there.

322
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,708
No matter how
bad things get,

323
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,666
he's not gonna leave
his front row seat

324
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,083
for the creation of paradise.

325
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,833
I was tryin' to get inside
his observation deck,

326
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,208
but it didn't quite
work out for me.

327
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,083
I apologize for
Sale's behavior

328
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,208
but you have to think about

329
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,125
what he's going
through emotionally.

330
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,875
Please don't be
angry with him.

331
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,541
I'm not angry.

332
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,291
You should've just asked for my
help in the first place, silly!

333
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,916
Chiara?

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,166
You two rarely
listen to what I say.

335
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,458
It's about time for me to
start making my own decisions.

336
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,583
And I think that
working with Sale

337
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,916
to take down the
Seeking Researcher

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,208
is the best course of action for
the Archer of Aurora to take.

339
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,583
It appears the lovely Chiara
is going to be our escort.

340
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,791
Well, I suppose our chances
of survival are greater

341
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,125
if there are two of us.

342
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,041
What're they doing?

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,041
What was that?

344
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,250
Do you know?

345
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,916
I can't believe he's
pulling out a new weapon

346
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,291
at a time like this.

347
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,166
So, what do you think?

348
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,041
I've taken the Ultimate
Fist Circle one step farther

349
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,833
to create a super bomb!

350
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,541
Behold my latest invention,

351
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,708
the Ultimate Dispersing Circle!

352
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,958
No armor or Unrestricted
Spell in existence

353
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,458
can protect against it!

354
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,833
It's a miracle of science!

355
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,625
A super-weapon that
disintegrates anything

356
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,708
it touches within a
hundred foot radius!

357
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,166
It's more powerful than
any other bomb in history!

358
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,083
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any worse.

359
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,208
Jeez.

360
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,625
Damn it! Every time
I try to lose 'em

361
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,416
I end up headin'
straight for that tower!

362
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,333
Ah, because that's where
the Denizens are gathering.

363
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,583
They're moving in from
the outskirts of the city.

364
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,208
Merely escaping is
proving to be difficult.

365
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,541
But it would be hopeless
to try and fight them.

366
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,750
I hate to say it,

367
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,708
but it appears we've
run out of options.

368
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,958
We're not racin' 'em, Para!

369
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,541
Slow down, would ya?

370
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:23,375
Well, I would
but it's not me.

371
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,083
It's out of control!

372
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,750
The van's gone
rogue, Boss!

373
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,083
What?

374
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,750
It's the Unrestricted
Spell, Daimon.

375
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,500
Coachman of
Corpse-Bearing Slaves,

376
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,041
protect Kazumi Yoshida!

377
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,333
I'll do my best!

378
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,541
Um, is there
something wrong?

379
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,041
We've been hit
with a gas attack

380
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,708
that is controlling the van.

381
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,625
There is no reason
to be alarmed.

382
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,291
However, for your own safety,

383
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,166
hold onto those two
and prepare for impact!

384
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,083
-Okay.
-Crap!

385
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,708
I'm tryin' to change course
but it won't let me!

386
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:11,708
Boss!

387
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,666
Damn, that smarts!

388
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,791
Gyuuki!

389
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,583
Khamsin, help!

390
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:33,666
[Music]

391
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,958
As Sale fights to get his
revenge on Dantalion,

392
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,125
the Seeking Researcher,

393
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,791
Wilhelmina charges
into battle.

394
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,708
Meanwhile, Shana and Yuji
prepare for their final showdown

395
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,708
which will determine
the fate of Xanadu.

396
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,000
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

397
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,375
"Dream of the Stranger."
