1
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,750
Constructing
Unrestricted Spell:

2
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,041
-Qadesh's Blood Pulse.
-Deploying!

3
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,291
Ya ready, Gramps? !

4
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,083
What's going on?

5
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,500
Is this an attack? !

6
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,625
Trouble, sir!

7
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,958
It's the destroyer...!

8
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,125
The- the Mobilizer of
Ceremonial Equipment

9
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,833
is right outside
the Palace!

10
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,416
Khamsin? Here? !

11
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,500
No...!

12
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,458
That explosion was...

13
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,083
What're they waitin' for?

14
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,041
Where's Sydonay, huh...?

15
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,250
Or the rest of the Trinity,
for that matter?

16
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,916
The Scatterer of
Sparkling Light!

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,958
Why them, of all people...?

18
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,500
All forces, attack...!

19
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,625
Purson! Uvall! Report!

20
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,875
I won't fail...

21
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,791
Magnesia!

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,208
Aw, man! Didn't
even make a dent?

23
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,750
Ah... Thanks to Magnesia...

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,541
the Tempest Hoof's spell.

25
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,833
They were shrewd
in appointing him

26
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,125
to guard the Palace
of the Stars.

27
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,500
I... I did it, I shielded the
Divine Gate in time...

28
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,208
Lord Fecor!

29
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
Your orders, sir?

30
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,541
I'll keep maintaining
Magnesia from here...

31
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,291
Purson, I want you leading
from the front lines...

32
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,958
Uvall, find their
entry point...

33
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,416
You need to verify that no
more of their allies

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,458
came through with them.

35
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,000
Also, inform the maids:
the princess is to be

36
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,541
evacuated to the lower
levels immediately.

37
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,541
Understood. Leave it to us.

38
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,708
How is this even
possible...?

39
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,416
Decarabia, Officer
of Boundless Seas

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
and Supreme Commander of the
Forces attacking Outlaw,

41
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,250
come in.

42
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,416
I have been observing,...

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,958
Fortress Commander
Fecor, the Tempest Hoof.

44
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,791
Have you been able
to ascertain

45
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,250
how they could penetrated
our defenses...?

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,250
How did they get inside
the Palace of the Stars?

47
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,916
Our outer defenses have
not been penetrated...

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,625
Therefore, no explanation
can be discerned.

49
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,250
Are any troops
approaching?

50
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,416
-No.
-So then...?

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,708
The nearest reinforcements

52
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,000
will have arrived
here by morning...

53
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,500
They will begin by
searching the area

54
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,416
surrounding
the fortress...

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,833
For now, however...

56
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,291
Yes, I understand...

57
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,875
In our master's absence,

58
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,458
we must reinforce
the Crypta spell...

59
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,625
to shield both the
Gate and the Palace!

60
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:14,875
This is it!

61
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,875
The distraction I
need to break free!

62
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:37,666
[Music]

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:47,666
[Music]

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,791
[Music]

65
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
Mistress Shana,...

66
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,541
the castle is quickly
becoming a dangerous place.

67
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,750
We have been ordered to
take you to the lower levels,

68
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,125
where you will be safe.

69
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,916
Please, come with us.

70
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,625
Please hurry.

71
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,500
Not yet...

72
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,958
I still have only the
strength of a normal human...

73
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,166
If I tried to attack now,

74
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,083
I couldn't even
defeat these Rinne.

75
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,333
So I'll wait...

76
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,666
For a better moment...

77
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
For my opening
to strike back!

78
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,291
It's said... that Fecor's
Unrestricted Spell

79
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,458
is impregnable.

80
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,958
So whaddaya wanna do now,

81
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,708
try blastin' away at
the whole castle?

82
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,000
Kill anybody that might be
stupid enough to come out?

83
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,541
Or maybe...

84
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,708
We could smoke Fecor
out of his hidey-hole.

85
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,625
Ah... But it would be unwise

86
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,583
to underestimate
the Tempest Hoof.

87
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,083
Even on his own, he
is quite formidable.

88
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,750
You're correct that we
should strike before

89
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,333
they've gotten
their bearings...

90
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,541
I'd like to destroy the
Crypta Unrestricted Spell

91
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,583
that's shielding
the fortress.

92
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,500
Since we insisted
on coming here,...

93
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,833
we should contribute
something

94
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,958
that will aid
our covert team.

95
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,166
Oh, we're gonna help
'em out, all right...

96
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,208
'Cause I'm pretty sure they
can't do it without us...

97
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,750
But yeah... anyway...

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,125
It's not like we've
run into any serious

99
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,291
challenges so far!

100
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,500
So far, so good.

101
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,708
No one will expect this...

102
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,166
No one would even consider
an attack from within.

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,833
Indeed,...

104
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,583
were it not for the
Heaven's Road Palace,

105
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,458
we would not have
known either.

106
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,000
Heaven's Road Palace and
the Palace of the Stars

107
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,916
must never come in
close proximity.

108
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,791
Ah... Gavida, the Soaring
Tower of Quintessence...

109
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,541
A name I've not heard
in a long time...

110
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,875
It was he who was
responsible

111
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,750
for the creation
of both palaces.

112
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,875
Why can they not come...

113
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,375
near one another?

114
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,166
The Heaven's Road Palace
is a place of the sun,...

115
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,666
filled with life...

116
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,500
The Palace of the Stars,
a temple of night,

117
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,041
is its opposite.

118
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,666
Originally, the two
places worked in tandem,

119
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
as large Treasure Tools...

120
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,625
By their design,...

121
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,000
if they pass within a certain
distance of each other,...

122
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,208
a path connecting them,
which is currently severed,

123
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,541
will indeed
regenerate itself.

124
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,750
In other words, Bal
Masqué's headquarters...

125
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,416
is gonna be right
freakin' next door to us.

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,208
That answers the
question of why Gavida

127
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,041
would forbid their reunion.

128
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,666
Right...

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,958
But given the situation that
is our only feasible way in...

130
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,541
Guess we'll have to get used
to our new neighbors...

131
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,833
This is the passageway.

132
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,291
As we draw closer to the
Palace of the Stars,

133
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,458
it will begin
repairing itself.

134
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
The path opens.

135
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,166
So this leads
to the castle?

136
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,666
Indeed.

137
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,208
But what exactly we'll
face on the other side...

138
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,625
only fate can say.

139
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,916
Uh-huh...

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,958
There's every possibility
that we could walk

141
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,333
right into the middle of
an enemy formation.

142
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,250
A high-stakes wager.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,250
It'll be fun...! Come on!

144
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,666
We were most fortunate
indeed that Gavida

145
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,166
did not tell Bal Masqué
about this passageway.

146
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,666
He despised them.

147
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,750
All that is left
to do now...

148
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,416
is for us to locate
mistress Shana...

149
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,833
and to pray that
we have good luck.

150
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,708
Please Lady Shana,
we need to hurry.

151
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,541
If they're taking me somewhere
that's heavily guarded,...

152
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,708
it's over...

153
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,416
I'll lose my chance...

154
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,708
Come on...!

155
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,208
Gimme a sign...!

156
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
I need something big...!
Anything!

157
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,458
Supreme Commander...

158
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,625
I have the
latest report...

159
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,333
Operation Calm is
proceeding as scheduled.

160
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,500
And at this rate...

161
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
Is something wrong, ma'am?

162
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,750
I'm worried.

163
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,166
We've based this
operation solely upon...

164
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,583
the coordinates
we've received

165
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,375
and the observations we've made
of the mighty distortion

166
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,375
that's blanketed
the world.

167
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,500
There are lives
at stake...

168
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
I question whether or
not this is all part

169
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,458
of the enemy's plan.

170
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,791
That is why I fret...

171
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,375
I cannot rid myself
of that fear.

172
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,458
The unease that comes from
putting one's charges

173
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,875
into harm's way...

174
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,791
is one of a leader's
many burdens.

175
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,083
As I well know.

176
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,416
If you have concerns, let
my men alleviate them

177
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,625
by conducting an
investigation...

178
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,666
to confirm or
deny these fears.

179
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,083
Of course,...

180
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,833
the responsibility is
ultimately yours to bear.

181
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,708
That's is an excellent
idea, thank you.

182
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,791
Balar... that thing we saw
up in the sky...

183
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,500
What the heck was it?

184
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,333
Hmm...? Ah, yes.

185
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,750
That black mirror...

186
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,375
I have no idea
what it is...

187
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,541
but I suspect it's connected
to the disruption we felt...

188
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,458
It's another one of
Bal Masqué's secrets

189
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,458
that we'll
eventually unveil.

190
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,291
Hell yeah, we will.

191
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,833
We're already this deep
in their territory,...

192
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,166
and we still haven't
seen that Mystes,

193
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,500
who's supposedly
their new master...

194
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,166
Nor have we seen a single
one of the Trinity...

195
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,416
Seems fishy.

196
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,833
It makes me think that
creepy black mirror

197
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,458
has gotta have somethin'
to do with them

198
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,166
not bein' around.

199
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,791
Regardless,...

200
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,250
we don't know the
consequences of simply

201
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,708
blowing it up...

202
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,291
I'll bet the geezers have
come to the same realization.

203
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,791
Yeah... And either way,

204
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,625
until we're able to
neutralize Magnesia...

205
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,208
This is just fun!

206
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,666
That's quite enough.

207
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,666
I have let your
wanton destruction

208
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,916
go on for far too long.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sorry about
that, furball...

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,708
But it's kinda what
we're here for,

211
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,250
and we're just
so good at it!

212
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,291
Interesting...

213
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,958
It seems there's no
sense in asking nicely...

214
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,166
So I'm telling you:
leave this place at once.

215
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,291
I'm the Majestic Lion's
Bellowing Call, Purson...

216
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,166
A pleasure to meet you.

217
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,750
Fancy name, it'll look
nice on your tombstone!

218
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,125
What the crap? !

219
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
There's only one man
who would invent

220
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,666
something so powerful,
yet so stupid.

221
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,500
The Seeker, of course...

222
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,166
Man, I hate that guy!

223
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,750
Me too...

224
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,250
If I don't see Dantalion
for another hundred years,

225
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,625
it'll be too soon.

226
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,958
It may look foolish,
but as you can see,

227
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,458
it's quite functional.

228
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,750
Facing warriors of renown
such as yourselves

229
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,750
will be a daunting task...

230
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,666
I will use everything
at my disposal.

231
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,833
Heads up... big guy!

232
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,000
Old man!

233
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,000
How do you like my
battle cry...?

234
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,625
It is rather appropriately
titled the Lion's Roar.

235
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,791
Well, you managed
beat up an old man...

236
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,625
So hey, you
accomplished something

237
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,958
before your death.

238
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,666
Alright, Balar...

239
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,916
It's time for the kid
gloves to come off.

240
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,500
As long as you stop
when I tell you to.

241
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,333
What am I...

242
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,375
doing here?

243
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,333
Why am I waiting?

244
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,708
I can't waste this...

245
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,750
It's my chance
to break free.

246
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,125
It must be the chain...

247
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,625
It's keeping me weak.

248
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,166
Power... I need power.

249
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,500
I feel it...

250
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,208
I need to...

251
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,708
get up!

252
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,041
I have to...

253
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,708
Move!

254
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,541
Come on...

255
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,750
You can do this!

256
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,125
There we go...!
Inch at a time!

257
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,375
Please-... Please,
miss come with me.

258
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,958
Please, miss,
come with me.

259
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,500
Please come with me...

260
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,000
Please come...

261
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,750
come with me...

262
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,333
Please come with me...

263
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,791
It's here...

264
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,708
But, where is it?

265
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,291
Where is it? !

266
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,083
Nietono no Shana!

267
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,333
Hey, didja hear that?

268
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,250
Sounded like it was
right out there.

269
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,041
Whoa... That's...

270
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,291
My master.

271
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,083
Tenmoku Ikko!

272
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,875
My Master...

273
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,125
I go to you.

274
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,250
All of our investigations
have failed to reveal

275
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,916
signs of their entry...

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,333
None of the outer defenses
were penetrated...

277
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,500
And they couldn't
have found a way

278
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
to break through Crypta...

279
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,458
Otherwise, Trivia here
would have detected it.

280
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,041
So how did they
get here...?

281
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,250
How did they bypass
our defenses...?

282
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,833
It's like they
just appeared,

283
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,791
inside the palace...

284
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,458
That's it...!

285
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,166
They were able to
breach the castle walls

286
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,583
before we knew
they were here...

287
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,500
Which means they must've
somehow come

288
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,833
from within the Palace?

289
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,583
But how...?!

290
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,000
There has to be
an explanation...

291
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,833
Thinking back, the Mobilizer
of Ceremonial Equipment

292
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,833
visited Misaki
City once before...

293
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,958
And the Specialist of
Everything was there as well.

294
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,541
She inherited Heaven's
Road Palace from Gavida,

295
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,750
the Soaring Tower
of Quintessence

296
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,708
and lived there
for some time...

297
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,375
Heaven's Road Palace...!
The mobile citadel,

298
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,958
created in tandem
with this fortress...

299
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,458
What if it holds some
secret we are unaware of...?

300
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,416
A hidden path connecting
them, for instance...

301
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,041
To make matters worse, if the
Specialist of Everything

302
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,166
has traveled
here with them...

303
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,250
Then they do not merely
plan to destroy the Palace,...

304
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,625
but to recover
the princess!

305
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,916
Lord Fecor!

306
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,291
Come quickl--

307
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,208
What...?! Tenmoku!

308
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,250
Balar...! Look!

309
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,750
What do you know?

310
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,083
Hey, old man!

311
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,083
I see it... Ready?

312
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,625
Oh no!

313
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,375
Lord Fecor's spell...

314
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,750
it's dissipating!

315
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,333
Not so fast!

316
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,125
That's impossible!

317
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,833
Go, go, gooo!

318
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,208
Welcome back.

319
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,458
Thank you for that.

320
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,208
Your blade, my master...

321
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,375
As always, I am
your servant.

322
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,791
You have done well.

323
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:57,208
[Music]

324
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:07,250
[Music]

325
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:14,500
[Music]

326
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,666
With the Nietono no Shana
back in her hands,

327
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,708
Shana fights to test
her power...

328
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,916
Meanwhile, Sophie Sawallisch
and her team leave Zurich

329
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,166
to launch an attack on
the Palace of the Stars.

330
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,583
An operation code-named...
"Crossing"...

331
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,708
Next time, on Shakugan
no Shana Final.
