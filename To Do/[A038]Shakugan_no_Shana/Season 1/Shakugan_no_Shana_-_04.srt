1
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,875
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,250
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,416
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,875
AND THE FLAMES OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,208
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,666
- Yuji: I KNEW I WAS GOING
TO LEAVE THIS WORLD

8
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
BEFORE TOO LONG.

9
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,875
BUT I ALSO KNEW
THAT I WAS YUJI SAKAI.

10
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,833
AND EVEN THOUGH ONE DAY
NO ONE WILL REMEMBER ME,

11
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:32,708
THE POWER OF MY EXISTENCE
HELPED SAVE IKE AND THE OTHERS.

12
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,000
I WAS SATISFIED WITH THAT.

13
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,541
AND I WAS GLAD I COULD DO
SOME GOOD BEFORE I DISAPPEARED.

14
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,708
I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

15
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,666
BUT THE TRUTH WAS...
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,375
EVERYTHING WAS JUST BEGINNING,

17
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,000
INCLUDING MY TIES WITH SHANA.

18
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,750
- ( dog barking )

19
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,458
- LET'S SEE.

20
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,791
WHERE ARE
THOSE COFFEE SPOONS?

21
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,916
- Shana: THAT TORCH'S FLAME
WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT,

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,541
BUT THEN IT RECOVERED.

23
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,291
HOW?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

24
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,958
- Alastor: HMM.
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

25
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,791
WITH THE TREASURE INSIDE.

26
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,500
- SO WHAT KIND OF TREASURE?

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,666
YOU DON'T MEAN--
- THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

28
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,083
- IS THAT POSSIBLE?
- I AGREE.

29
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,833
IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT SOMETHING
OF SUCH VALUE WOULD JUST APPEAR.

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,250
- HMM.
- BUT IF TRUE,

31
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,958
THEN IT'S EVEN MORE REASON

32
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,791
WHY WE CANNOT
LET THE HUNTER ACQUIRE IT.

33
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,500
WE'LL NEED TO BE WATCHFUL
AS EVENTS UNFOLD.

34
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,541
- HMM.
- SORRY ABOUT THE WAIT.

35
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,125
HERE.  WHAT?

36
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,000
- UH, NOTHING.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,958
- HUH?

38
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,333
AH.

39
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,458
IT'S STARTING TO RAIN.

40
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,500
- I CAN SEE THAT.

41
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,666
- WANNA COME INSIDE?
- HUH?  THE HOUSE?

42
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,250
- YEAH.
YOU'RE GONNA GET SOAKED.

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,708
FIRST OF ALL,
IF YOU'RE WATCHING OVER ME,

44
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,875
I THINK YOU'D WANNA BE
BY MY SIDE.

45
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,000
- TRUE.

46
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,625
- DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE?

47
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,958
- IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO BRAG ABOUT.

48
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,875
- I WASN'T BRAGGING ABOUT IT. 
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

49
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,833
- FLAME HAZES ARE NOT BOTHERED
BY WEATHER CONDITIONS.

50
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,541
- OKAY, LET'S GO.
- SURE, OKAY.

51
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,458
MY MOM'S SLEEPING
ON THE MAIN FLOOR,

52
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,166
SO JUST DON'T MAKE
ANY LOUD NOISES.

53
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,250
- ( springs creak )

54
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,208
- YOU'LL USE THAT BED.

55
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,625
I'M GONNA GO SLEEP
IN MY DAD'S STUDY.

56
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,833
- HEY, IF I CAME IN HERE
TO GUARD YOU,

57
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SLEEPING IN ANOTHER ROOM?

58
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,291
- UH, BECAUSE.

59
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,458
- Alastor:
THIS WAS YOUR SUGGESTION.

60
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,041
SLEEP HERE.

61
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,333
- UH, HMM?

62
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,125
AH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

63
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,958
- I'M GETTING CHANGED,
OBVIOUSLY.

64
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,041
- SURE, BUT, UH, LOOK--
IS THERE SOME PLACE YOU--

65
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,500
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO RATTLED ABOUT?

66
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,250
YOU'VE NOTHING TO FEAR.
- HIDE WHILE I CHANGE.

67
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,625
- UH, OKAY.

68
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,708
- DON'T PEEK
OR I'LL CLOBBER YOU.

69
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,583
- MAN, YOU'RE TESTY.
- I SAID MOVE!

70
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,125
- DON'T RUSH ME.
IT'S SOMETHING I DIDN'T EXPECT.

71
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,583
- WHAT IS?

72
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,958
- I THINK YOU'RE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT THIS TOO.

73
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,958
AAH!

74
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,583
- ( grunts )

75
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,333
- ( sighs ) HMM.

76
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,666
NO P.J.s?
- ( object clattering )

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,333
- I TOLD YOU, NO PEEKING!
- I WASN'T.

78
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
I WAS JUST ASKING
IF YOU HAVE ANY PAJAMAS.

79
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,500
- WELL, I DON'T.

80
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,916
JUST MY UNDERCLOTHES.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,625
ALASTOR CLEANS MY BODY
WITH HIS FLAME

82
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,375
SO I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE
VERY OFTEN.

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,625
- WOW, THAT SOUNDS CONVENIENT.

84
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,791
OH, I HAVE A JERSEY
IN THAT DRAWER BESIDE MY BED.

85
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,500
YOU CAN USE THAT.

86
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,000
BY THE WAY, WHY DON'T
YOU HAVE ANY BAGS?

87
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,250
- ALMOST EVERYTHING
I HAVE IS WITH ME.

88
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,791
- WHERE?

89
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:17,458
- MY NIGHT CAPE-- A BLACK CAPE
ESPECIALLY FOR FLAME HAZES.

90
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,541
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE MAGIC.

91
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,041
- YEAH, THANK ALASTOR FOR THAT.

92
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,250
- AH.  THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

93
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,708
SO WHAT KIND OF PERSON
IS ALASTOR?

94
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,250
- I AM NOT HUMAN.  I AM A LORD
OF THE CRIMSON WORLD.

95
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,208
- WHAT?  YOU'RE ONE
OF THOSE DENIZENS?

96
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,166
THE THINGS THAT SUCK UP
EXISTENCES?

97
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,875
- THERE ARE THOSE WHO CONSUME
EXISTENCE WITHOUT RESTRAINT,

98
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,291
AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE
LIKE ME, WHO OPPOSE THEM.

99
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,833
THIS WORLD IS FILLED
WITH THE POWER OF EXISTENCE,

100
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,291
SOMETHING THE CRIMSON WORLD
LACKS.

101
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,541
THAT IS WHY THE DENIZENS
ARE DRAWN HERE.

102
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,583
THEY SEEK OUT THIS POWER

103
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,291
BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED
TO FULFILL THEIR DESIRES.

104
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,541
- AH, AND SO WHERE
DO THESE DENIZENS COME FROM?

105
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,833
- Shana: FROM THE CRIMSON WORLD,
THE WORLD NEXT TO THIS ONE

106
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,750
<i>THAT CANNOT BE REACHED</i>
<i>BY ORDINARY MEANS.</i>

107
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,958
- LIKE A DIFFERENT DIMENSION?

108
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,208
- Alastor:
AS GOOD A DEFINITION AS ANY.

109
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,458
BUT TOYING WITH THE POWER
OF EXISTENCE

110
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,666
WILL EVENTUALLY UPSET THE
BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

111
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,083
THUS,
THE NEED FOR FLAME HAZES.

112
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,833
IT IS OUR TASK TO PREVENT THIS
FROM HAPPENING.

113
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,416
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE MORE
THAN JUST YOU TWO OUT THERE.

114
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,666
- THERE ARE OTHER FLAME HAZES,
BUT WE'RE ALL ON OUR OWN.

115
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,250
- Alastor: THEIR REASONS FOR
FIGHTING AND METHODS VARY

116
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,125
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.

117
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,333
THERE ARE EVEN TIMES
WHEN FLAME HAZES

118
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,875
WILL BATTLE EACH OTHER.

119
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,583
SOME OF THEM
ARE EASILY AGITATED.

120
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
- OH.
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE

121
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,333
IF EVERYONE COOPERATED.
OW.

122
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,375
( grunting )

123
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,708
AAH!

124
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,833
OW!  HMM?

125
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,250
- ( gasps )

126
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,916
- UH, UH, UH...

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,708
- ( punching sounds,
pan clanging )

128
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,708
- YU-CHAN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

129
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,291
- NOTHING.
I'M JUST CLEANING MY ROOM.

130
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,875
- AH.  WELL, IT'S LATE,
SO DO IT QUICKLY.

131
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,541
- YEAH, GOTCHA.

132
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,833
( laughs )
- ( door closes )

133
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,541
- AH.

134
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,916
- UGH!  I SHOULD HAVE
PUNCHED HIM ANOTHER 10 TIMES.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,750
- Alastor: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S ONLY A TORCH.

136
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,958
- YOUR POINT?
- WOULD YOU BE EMBARRASSED

137
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,375
TO BE NAKED
IN FRONT OF A ROCK OR A TREE?

138
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,416
THIS IS OUT OF CHARACTER
FOR YOU.

139
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,916
- LOOK,
I JUST FELT UNCOMFORTABLE.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,416
- HMM.

141
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,416
- ( gasps )

142
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,916
YOU FEEL IT?

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,708
- YES.  A FLAME HAZE.

144
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,916
- DO YOU THINK
IT'S HERE AFTER FRIAGNE?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
- EVEN IF IT IS,
I'M SURE IT WILL LEAVE

146
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,875
WHEN IT FINDS OUT
THAT WE WERE HERE FIRST.

147
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,500
AFTER ALL, IT IS WELL KNOWN
THAT ENCOUNTERS

148
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,291
BETWEEN FLAME HAZES
NEVER TURN OUT WELL.

149
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
- MMM.

150
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,666
- ( footsteps echoing )

151
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,666
- AAH!

152
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,416
- ( stuttering )

153
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,250
- YOUR BEST ROOM, AND DON'T
TELL ME IT'S NOT AVAILABLE.

154
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,458
- YE-- YES, MA'AM.

155
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,291
- ( door rattling )

156
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
- OH, COME ON.

157
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,166
THIS IS THE BEST ROOM
IN THE CITY?

158
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,458
I'M SO GRATEFUL
I COULD WEEP.

159
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,958
- Marco: OH-HO-HO!
WHY NOT CHARM SOME YOUNG STUD

160
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,958
INTO GIVING YOU A NICE PLACE
TO SLEEP AGAIN, EH?  EH?

161
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,458
MY DEAR MISTRESS,
PRINCESS MARGERY DAW.

162
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,708
( laughing ) 
- QUIET, STUPID MARCO.

163
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,208
- ( Marco laughing )

164
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,375
OH!
- DAMN.

165
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,000
WHAT AN ABSURD LITTLE CITY
TO WANDER INTO.

166
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,333
THAT CORPSE-COLLECTING
BASTARD!

167
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,583
THERE'S A DENIZEN AS WELL AS
ANOTHER FLAME HAZE IN THIS DIVE,

168
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,833
AND SIMPLY SCADS OF TORCHES.

169
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,583
THEY'RE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO SENSE WHERE HE IS.

170
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,583
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU DEAL
WITH THE DENIZEN

171
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,250
OR THE FLAME HAZE FIRST?
SMASH THEM!  BURN THEM!

172
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,958
- THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

173
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,541
THIS PLACE IS A JOKE.
THESE BOTTLES ARE TINY.

174
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
AND IT'S NOTHING
BUT CHEAP BOOZE.

175
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,000
- ( laughing )
THIS IS A WONDERFUL HOTEL.

176
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,041
IF YOU DON'T DRINK,
YOU DON'T SNORE,

177
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
WHICH MEANS I'LL ACTUALLY
BE ABLE TO GET SOME SLEEP!

178
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,541
OW!
 - Friagne: I FEEL IT.

179
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,583
IT'S A FLAME HAZE.

180
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,958
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MEANS
I'LL HAVE TO POSTPONE

181
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,750
MY HUNT FOR THAT MYSTES.

182
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,708
- Marianne:
MASTER, ANOTHER FLAME HAZE.

183
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,666
AS IF THAT ONE WITH
THE FIERY HAIR WASN'T ENOUGH!

184
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,875
- CALM YOURSELF, MARIANNE.

185
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,041
I'VE ALMOST ACQUIRED ENOUGH
OF THE POWER I NEED FOR YOU.

186
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,625
I WON'T LET ANYONE
INTERFERE WITH THE PLAN.

187
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,000
WHEN ALL THIS IS OVER, YOU NO
LONGER WILL BE A MERE RINNE.

188
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,125
YOU WILL BE AN EXISTENCE

189
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,583
AND WILL LIVE IN THE WORLD
AS YOU DESERVE.

190
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,625
- YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE
SO MUCH FOR ME, MASTER.

191
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,750
- NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IF NOT FOR MY POWERS,

192
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,166
YOU WOULD VANISH
IN A MATTER OF DAYS.

193
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,583
THAT'S TOO TRANSIENT
TO BE A REAL EXISTENCE.

194
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,875
- I THINK YOU AND I
SHARE A SPECIAL BOND,

195
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,625
ONE THAT CAN'T BE DEFINED
BY WORDS ALONE.

196
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,833
- AH.  OH, MARIANNE.

197
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,583
MARIANNE, YOU SAY
THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS TO ME.

198
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,583
HOWEVER...

199
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,458
I MUST SEE THIS AFFAIR
THROUGH TO THE END.

200
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,041
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE,

201
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,333
THE REASON
I PURSUE EXISTENCES.

202
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,916
I'M DOING IT FOR YOU.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,250
EVERYTHING I DO
IS FOR YOUR SAKE.

204
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,041
OH, WHAT A SUBLIME SIGHT.

205
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,416
LOOK, SO MANY EXISTENCES
OUT THERE.

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,125
- MASTER.

207
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,541
- DON'T WORRY.

208
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,875
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

209
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,250
- WHY?

210
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,125
MMM, I'M SLEEPY.

211
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,500
- Alastor: YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN GETTING MUCH REST LATELY.

212
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,666
<i>I THINK YOU SHOULD GO INSIDE</i>
<i>THE HOUSE TO SLEEP.</i>

213
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,833
- MMM, OKAY.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,083
- ( birds chirping )

215
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,291
- AH.

216
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,750
MY PILLOW SMELLS NICE.

217
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,583
MMM.

218
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,916
HUH?  OH, IT'S ONLY YOU, SHANA.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,125
HUH? ( gasps )

220
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,291
- ( muttering )
- AAH!

221
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,875
WHAT THE--

222
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,083
AAH!

223
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,958
- Alastor: I SEE YOU'RE AWAKE.

224
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,291
- WHAT IS SHE DOING IN MY BED?

225
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,666
- NOTHING FOR YOU
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

226
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M STILL SHAKING.

227
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,791
- ( moans )

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,166
- AAH.

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,333
- HUH?

230
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,666
- AAH!
- HOW DARE YOU?!

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,750
- STOP!  WAIT!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, HONESTLY!

232
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,375
- Alastor:
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

233
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,625
YOU LOOKED TIRED, SO I SUGGESTED
YOU GO INTO THE HOUSE TO SLEEP.

234
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,375
IT WAS YOUR DECISION,
HALF ASLEEP, I MIGHT ADD,

235
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,833
TO CRAWL INTO HIS BED.
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

236
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,791
NORMALLY THIS
WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU.

237
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
- RIGHT.
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

238
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,041
- HUH?

239
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,166
- BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A TORCH.

240
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,333
- AND THAT MAKES IT OKAY?

241
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,833
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

242
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,958
HMM!
- UH.

243
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,625
OKAY THEN,
LET'S GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

244
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,583
YOU GET CHANGED
WHILE I GO AND WASH UP, OKAY?

245
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,583
- HMM.

246
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,666
WHY?

247
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,666
- AH.
THIS IS CRAZY.

248
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW CUTE SHE WAS.

249
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,416
OH, JUST FORGET IT.

250
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,583
- HEY, YOU MAGGOTS!  LET'S SEE
SOME ENERGY OUT THERE.

251
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
- Girl:
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH HIM?

252
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,958
HE'S SURE WORKED UP
ABOUT SOMETHING.

253
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,750
- Girl #2: I DON'T KNOW.
KONDO'S ALWAYS BEEN KINDA WEIRD.

254
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,833
- I GUESS.
HE LOOKS LIKE A PERVERT.

255
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,916
- QUIET!
SAVE YOUR BREATH FOR RUNNING.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,541
DAMN IT.

257
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,000
LOOK AT HER.
I BET SHE THINKS SHE'S SMART

258
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,541
MAKING FUN
OF THE OTHER TEACHERS.

259
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,458
SHE WON'T GET AWAY WITH THAT
IN MY CLASS.

260
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,833
I'LL TEACH HER A LESSON.

261
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,708
- WHAT IS THIS?
ARE WE GONNA RUN LAPS ALL DAY?

262
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,875
- YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING
FUNNY HERE.

263
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,625
ONE GOOD THING--
AT LEAST SHE WON'T

264
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,750
BE GETTING INTO TROUBLE
WITH THE TEACHERS OUT HERE.

265
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,750
- HMM.  WHY?

266
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,416
- DAMN IT,
SHE HASN'T EVEN BROKEN A SWEAT.

267
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,166
WHY ISN'T THIS
GETTING TO HER?

268
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,208
- Boy: THAT ASSHOLE.
HE'S GETTING A KICK OUT OF THIS.

269
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,125
- Boy #2: THIS IS REALLY
PISSING ME OFF.

270
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,208
- AAH.
- YOSHIDA.

271
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,500
- KAZUMI!

272
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,458
- YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

273
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,541
- PLEASE, MR. KONDO,
YOU'VE GOT TO LET KAZUMI REST.

274
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,833
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT SHE'S ANEMIC.

275
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,250
- THAT'S JUST AN EXCUSE
TO SLACK OFF.

276
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,625
PHYSICAL FITNESS
DEMANDS EFFORT.

277
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,208
- MR. KONDO, THAT'S ENOUGH.

278
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,291
I THINK
THIS IS A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

279
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,333
- SAKAI, I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

280
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,041
AAH!

281
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,541
- MOVE IT, JERK.

282
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,416
- WHY, YOU LITTLE THUG!

283
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,250
- THIS DRILL IS STUPID.

284
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,708
IT IS TIRESOME AND I FAIL
TO SEE THE PURPOSE.

285
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,833
EXPLAIN TO ME THE POINT BEHIND
RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES?

286
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,750
- AAH! WHY YOU--
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

287
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,833
- HIRAI, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW SERIOUS IT IS

288
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,166
FOR A STUDENT TO KICK A TEACHER?
YOU'RE A PROBLEM STUDENT.

289
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
YOU'RE SUSPENDED.
NO, EXPELLED!

290
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,833
- WHAT A REPULSIVE TOAD.
- STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.

291
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,625
- IS SHE ACTUALLY THINKING
OF HITTING HIM?

292
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,750
- Kondo:
WELL, SAY SOMETHING!

293
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,708
- HIRAI'S GONNA POP THE TEACHER.
LET'S HELP HER.

294
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,500
- RIGHT.
- THIS IS GONNA GET UGLY.

295
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,208
IT'S TOO LATE
TO STOP HER NOW.

296
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,166
- ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?!

297
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,208
- KICK HIM!

298
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,583
- ( grunting )

299
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,958
- Boy: DID YOU SEE--
- THANKS, SHANA.

300
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,541
- HMM.
- MR. KONDO, ARE YOU OKAY?

301
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:51,416
IT'S DANGEROUS JUST WANDERING
ONTO THE TRACK LIKE THAT.

302
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,583
RIGHT, EVERYONE?

303
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,791
- Ike: YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

304
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,333
- I SAW THE WHOLE THING.
- ME, TOO.

305
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,125
HIRAI'S A REALLY FAST RUNNER.

306
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,333
- A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT, MAN.

307
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,208
- Kondo: SAVAGES!

308
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,125
- SO YOU WANNA THREATEN HIM?
SHAKE HIM UP A LITTLE BIT?

309
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,791
- HMM.

310
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,208
I SEE YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE
ON THE TRACK.

311
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,666
- Yuji: MR. KONDO, YOU SHOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL

312
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,041
IN THE FUTURE.
CAN WE GO NOW?

313
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,708
- Kondo: UH, FREE PERIOD, KIDS.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

314
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,833
- ( all cheering ) 
- WOW, SAKAI,

315
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,708
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE BURSTING WITH CONFIDENCE.

316
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,916
- YOU WERE AWESOME, HIRAI.
- THAT FELT GREAT!

317
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,583
- ( all chattering )

318
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,375
- Yuji: THINGS WERE BEGINNING
TO LOOK UP, OR SO I THOUGHT.

319
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,958
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW
WAS THAT SHANA WAS STARTING

320
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,958
TO FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY.

321
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,875
- I WAS GOING TO PUNCH HIM
IN THE FACE.

322
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,625
- KICK HIM!

323
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,250
- Alastor: I'M NOT TRYING
TO HEAP PRAISE UPON HIM,

324
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,291
BUT I THINK HE SHOWED
SUPERB JUDGMENT.

325
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,541
WITHOUT HIM, YOU WOULD HAVE
STRUCK THE TEACHER.

326
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,625
I BELIEVE THAT
WOULD HAVE RESULTED

327
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,583
IN SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS.

328
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,291
- HOW DARE HE?
GIVING ME ORDERS?

329
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,708
WHY?  WHY?

330
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,708
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT A MERE TORCH
THAT HAS YOU SO UPSET?

331
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,208
- THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

332
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,916
- AH, THIS IS SO EXASPERATING.

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,291
I'M SENSING THE DENIZEN
AND THE FLAME HAZE,

334
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,416
BUT I CAN'T LOCK IN
ON THE CORPSE COLLECTOR.

335
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,458
- Marco: HE PROBABLY PLANNED IT
THAT WAY.

336
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,458
HE'S GOTCHA THIS TIME,
PARTNER. ( laughs )

337
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,000
- I'M GONNA GO IN
A LITTLE DEEPER.

338
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,416
- YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
WE'RE NOT THE FIRST TO ARRIVE.

339
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
IN A WAY
WE'RE TRESPASSING HERE.

340
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,541
- WHO CARES?
IF THEY WANNA COMPLAIN,

341
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,458
I'LL JUST HAVE TO KICK
THEIR TEETH DOWN THEIR THROAT.

342
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,375
- ( laughs )
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!

343
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,500
I'M READY ANY TIME
<i>YOU ARE!</i>

344
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,625
- MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE
AND JOHN,

345
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,375
COVER ALL CORNERS AND FIND THE
GHOST WHO DISRUPTS OUR DREAMS.

346
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,958
- ( gasps )

347
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,666
- Alastor: IT APPEARS
THEY'RE STILL HERE,

348
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,000
EVEN THOUGH THEY MUST HAVE
SENSED OUR PRESENCE.

349
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,833
IT'S AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD USED
FOR SEARCHING A LARGE AREA.

350
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,791
ARE YOU SURE? THIS COULD END IN
A BATTLE IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

351
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,250
- AT LEAST I WON'T HAVE TO THINK
IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT.

352
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,750
- MARCO.

353
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,416
- Marco:
THEY'VE NOTICED US.

354
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,208
CANCEL YOUR SPELL.
THEY'RE READY TO FIGHT!

355
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,916
- THAT SUITS ME JUST FINE.

356
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,708
BE SEALED!

357
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,541
THERE THEY ARE.
- FLAMING HAIR!

358
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,458
- Marco:
BLAZING EYES!

359
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,166
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

360
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,708
- MY,
WHAT A RUDE LITTLE GIRL.

361
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,166
NOT EVEN A HELLO.
- ( Marco laughing )

362
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
LONG TIME NO SEE,
FLAME OF THE HEAVENS.

363
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,208
- ALASTOR,
DO YOU KNOW THESE TWO?

364
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,250
- MARCOSIAS, THE CLAWS
AND FANGS OF VIOLATION.

365
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,833
AND MARGERY DAW,
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

366
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,750
THEY'RE TOUGH
AND THEY WON'T BACK DOWN.

367
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,875
- IF YOU TWO JUST PACK UP
AND QUIETLY LEAVE THIS CITY,

368
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,041
I'LL GLADLY SEE YOU OFF.
- HUH.  WE WERE HERE FIRST.

369
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,083
I'M TAKING OUT
FRIAGNE MYSELF.

370
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,791
- Marco: SO THAT'S WHO IT IS!

371
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,291
IT'S THAT PERVERT
WITH THE DOLL FETISH.

372
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,208
- I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIM
LATER.

373
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,583
WE'VE COME HERE
FOR THE CORPSE COLLECTOR.

374
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,500
- Alastor: THE CORPSE COLLECTOR?
BUT HE'S AN EXCEPTION.

375
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,500
HE ACTUALLY GOES OUT OF HIS WAY
NOT TO UPSET THE BALANCE.

376
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,166
- EXCEPTION?

377
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,958
THERE ARE NO INNOCENTS
IN THE CRIMSON WORLD.

378
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
I PLAN ON KILLING
ALL OF THEM!

379
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,041
THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM
IS TO KILL, KILL, KILL!

380
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,875
- Marco: SHE'S WHAT YOU MIGHT
CALL A DEVOTED FLAME HAZE.

381
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,166
- Alastor:
YOUR HATRED FOR OTHERS

382
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,750
HAS BLINDED YOU TO THE TRUTH,

383
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,833
YOU BLOODTHIRSTY BASTARDS.

384
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,250
- Marco: PRETTY STRONG WORDS.

385
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,375
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, ALASTOR?
CAN WE FIGHT THEM NOW?

386
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,875
- WAIT.

387
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,041
- I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LEAVE.

388
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,791
- Marco: STRIKE THEM DOWN
WITHOUT MERCY,

389
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,375
MY BELOVED GOBLET,
MARGERY DAW.

390
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,000
THE REASON THIS PLACE
IS FILLED WITH TORCHES

391
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,833
IS BECAUSE THEY LEFT THAT
DENIZEN ALONE.

392
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,250
THEY'RE INCOMPETENT.

393
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,708
- INDEED. TOO BAD THEY WON'T
BE MORE OF A CHALLENGE.

394
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,791
GET READY FOR A SURPRISE.
- Alastor: WAIT.

395
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,291
DON'T BE RECKLESS. 
- HMM.

396
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,833
- AAH!

397
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
HMM.  NOT BAD.

398
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,000
- Marco: SHE'S PRETTY SLICK.

399
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,583
- Alastor: THAT'S THE TOGA,
THE GOWN MADE OF FLAMES.

400
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,833
IT'S HER SPECIALTY.
BE CAUTIOUS.

401
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,375
- AAH!

402
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,625
- WHAT A LIVELY LITTLE BRAT.

403
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,125
- AAH!
- ( Marco laughing )

404
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,333
- YOU MISSED.

405
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,083
LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN HIT ME NOW.

406
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,000
- Alastor:
BE CALM.  THINK FIRST.

407
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,875
- HYAH!

408
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,166
HYAH!

409
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,083
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK
OF ANYTHING.

410
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,625
I DON'T
BECAUSE I'M A FLAME HAZE!

411
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,750
THAT ONE.

412
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,625
- MISSED AGAIN.

413
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,916
- Marco: SURPRISE!

414
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,208
- HA!

415
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,458
- A FOX BRIDE'S
ELECTRICAL SHOWER.

416
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,208
- Marco: YOU'LL BE DEAD
WITHIN THE NEXT THREE SECONDS.

417
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,500
- AH.

418
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,833
- ARE YOU THE REAL
FLAME-HAIRED BLAZING-EYES?

419
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,916
- Marco: YOU'RE NOT AS STRONG
AS I THOUGHT YOU'D BE.

420
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
- ENOUGH OF THIS!

421
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,666
ONE FINAL ATTACK
AND THEN I'LL LET HER GO.

422
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,583
- Marco:
YEAH, THIS ISN'T ANY FUN.

423
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,708
GIVE HER A BIG BLAST
AND THEN LET'S CALL IT QUITS.

424
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,666
- THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
I MUST GET UP.

425
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,916
- THE PAIN OF A LIFE
OF HASTE AND STRIFE!

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,625
- GET UP.

427
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,625
- THAT WAS "SOLOMON GRUNDY."

428
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,583
- Alastor: WATCH OUT!
MOVE!

429
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,208
- THERE!
GAME OVER.

430
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,250
- AAH!

431
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,458
- ( choir chanting )

432
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,916
- WHY?

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,041
WHY?!

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,833
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

435
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,625
- Yuji: TWO GIRLS
STRUGGLE WITH INNER TURMOIL.

436
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,625
SHANA'S STILL CONFUSED
WHILE KAZUMI DEALS

437
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,291
WITH HER FEELINGS
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

438
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,833
MEANWHILE, THE HUNTER AND THE
CHANTER OF ELEGIES CLASH.

439
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:07,833
