1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,708
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,958
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,291
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,875
AND THE FLAMES OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,166
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,250
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,416
- ( Yuji screams )
- ( roaring )

8
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,500
- YES, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
ARE A THING. YOU'RE NOT HUMAN.

9
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,916
- ( gasps )
- IT'S NOT ONLY YOU.

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,875
EVERYONE WALKING
AROUND WITH A FLAME

11
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,791
IN THEIR BODY IS A THING.

12
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,208
THEY ARE REPLACEMENTS OF PEOPLE
WHO HAD THEIR EXISTENCE CONSUMED

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,416
BY DENIZENS OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD. THEY'RE TORCHES.

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,333
- BUT THEN,
YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE...

15
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,708
- THE REAL YOU HAS HAD
ITS EXISTENCE CONSUMED

16
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,250
AND IS NO LONGER LIVING.

17
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,416
RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT RESIDUE.

18
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,333
- I WAS ALREADY DEAD.

19
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,541
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
SHE REALLY LOOKED AT ME

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,791
WITH THOSE BLAZING EYES OF HERS,

21
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,125
BUT IT CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T BE THE LAST.

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,666
AS THE MEANING
OF HER WORDS HIT ME,

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,666
ALL I COULD DO WAS
STAND THERE STUNNED.

24
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,291
THE DAY THE WORLD CAME UNDONE,

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,583
I MET THAT GIRL OF FLAMES.

26
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,875
AND THEN...

27
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:39,916
I'M-- I'M DEAD.
BUT HOW?

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,708
- I TOLD YOU. A DENIZEN OF
THE CRIMSON WORLD CONSUMED YOU.

29
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,791
- CRIMSON WORLD?
LIKE THOSE MONSTERS?

30
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
- ( snarling )
- ( screams )

31
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,958
- THEY WERE RINNE, SERVANTS
OF THE CRIMSON WORLD DENIZENS.

32
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,041
THE WAY IT WORKS IS
THE RINNE COLLECT

33
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,458
AND THE DENIZENS CONSUME.

34
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,875
- CONSUME?
BUT YOU SHOWED UP AND SAVED ME

35
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,791
BEFORE THAT COULD HAPPEN,
DIDN'T YOU?

36
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,875
- I DIDN'T SAVE YOU.
YOU WERE JUST THERE.

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,416
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME THE RINNE AND THE DENIZENS

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,791
FROM THE CRIMSON WORLD HAVE
APPEARED IN THIS WORLD.

39
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,958
IN FACT,
IT'S A PRETTY COMMON OCCURRENCE.

40
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,166
THE REAL YOU HAD BEEN EATEN

41
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,458
BEFORE YOU EVEN SAW
THOSE THINGS.

42
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,833
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

43
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,916
- WELL, YOUR FLAME IS STILL
PRETTY BRIGHT,

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,791
SO IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THAT LONG AGO.

45
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,458
BUT DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL BURN OUT EVENTUALLY.

46
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,958
- HUH?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

47
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,083
- YOU'RE A TORCH, WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA VANISH PRETTY SOON.

48
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,875
EXPLANATION OVER.

49
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,416
- VANISH?

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,375
WAIT UP!

51
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN...

52
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,458
VANISH?

53
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,375
THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.

54
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,500
I'M RIGHT HERE.

55
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,625
BESIDES, I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THIS

56
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,791
CRIMSON WORLD PLACE OR WHATEVER.

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,166
- YES, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THIS
WORLD IS WHAT WE CALL SEALED.

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,625
- SEALED?

59
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,208
YOU MEAN THAT WAS KIND OF
LIKE A FIREWALL?

60
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,416
- TO BE ACCURATE, IT'S LIKE THE
SPACE YOU FIND BETWEEN WALLS.

61
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,833
THE FLOW OF TIME IS SUSPENDED
WITHIN THAT SPACE.

62
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,833
YOU'RE CUT OFF
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

63
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,166
NO ONE EVER REMEMBERS WHAT
HAPPENS INSIDE THERE.

64
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,750
ANYWAY, THE DENIZENS CONSUME
THE PERSON'S EXISTENCE,

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,250
NOT THE PERSON.

66
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,750
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE,
IT'S AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED.

67
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,166
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
- MEANING WHAT?

68
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,833
- IT'S LIKE THE PERSON
HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN THERE.

69
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,875
OH, LOOK, PERFECT TIMING.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT.

70
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,125
THERE'S A SMALL TORCH
HEADED STRAIGHT THIS WAY.

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,958
- THE FLAME, IT'S SO SMALL.

72
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,666
- I KICKED THE BALL RIGHT
TO YOU.

73
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,125
- THAT WAS A GREAT GAME.
- YEAH, LET'S DO THAT AGAIN.

74
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:11,333
- HOW COME?
HOW COME THEY DIDN'T NOTICE?

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,625
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

76
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,541
- THAT'S WHY WE
PLACE THE TORCHES.

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,125
IF SOMEONE JUST UP
AND DISAPPEARED,

78
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,125
THE BALANCE WOULD BE UPSET

79
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,458
AND CHAOS WOULD RESULT.

80
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,833
- ARE YOU BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND?

81
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,208
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE GROUND
BENEATH YOUR FEET WAS

82
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,666
TO SUDDENLY VANISH, YOU WOULD
FALL, SUFFERING AN INJURY.

83
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,416
BUT IF THE GROUND
IS TRANSFORMED

84
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,291
INTO ICE THAT MELTS AWAY
GRADUALLY,

85
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,166
YOUR CHANCES OF BECOMING HURT
ARE LESSENED.

86
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,541
THINK OF TORCHES AS SIMILAR
TO THAT ICE.

87
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,291
THE EXISTENCE OF THE TORCH
GRADUALLY FADES AWAY,

88
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,250
AND BY THE TIME IT VANISHES...

89
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,958
ITS INFLUENCE HAS BEEN REDUCED
TO A MINIMUM.

90
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,125
IF YOU'RE STILL HAVING
TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING--

91
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,708
- I GET IT. I GET WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, BUT IT'S SO--

92
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,958
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO REACT TO THIS?

93
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,208
THE PERSON I AM, YUJI SAKAI,
IS ALREADY DEAD.

94
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,875
THEN WHO IS THE ME THAT'S
STANDING RIGHT HERE?

95
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,166
- ( chattering )

96
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,125
- I'LL TAKE FIVE.
- Man: HERE YOU GO. THANKS.

97
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,958
- MMM!

98
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,916
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,833
- YOU'VE NEVER HAD THIS BEFORE?
IT'S MELON BREAD.

100
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,083
YOU KNOW, FOOD.

101
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,625
- WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE
I KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT--

102
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,875
- THEN DON'T ASK.

103
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,625
- HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
FOLLOW ME?

104
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,333
- I'M NOT. THIS IS JUST
THE WAY TO MY HOUSE.

105
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,125
- OH.

106
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,083
- I'M REALLY GOING TO VANISH.

107
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,583
THIS ISN'T A BAD DREAM?

108
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,708
- STOP MAKING ME REPEAT MYSELF.
THIS IS REALITY.

109
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,416
- HOW CAN THIS BE REALITY?

110
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,291
IT'S TERRIBLE.

111
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,125
- IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

112
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,041
- THE WAY IT IS?
THIS IS REALITY?

113
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,458
NO, MY MIND JUST
CAN'T GRASP IT.

114
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,208
AND SHE'S TELLING ME THIS WHILE
SHE'S CHEWING ON MELON BREAD?

115
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,583
WHAT IS SHE ANYWAY?
LISTEN--

116
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,625
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
YOU JUST TALK AND TALK.

117
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,208
- SO WHAT ARE YOU? HUMAN?

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,875
- I'M SOMETHING CALLED
A FLAME HAZE.

119
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,083
- A FLAME WHAT?
- A FLAME HAZE.

120
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,500
MY JOB IS
TO HUNT DOWN DENIZENS

121
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,416
THAT CONSUME EXISTENCES
AND DESTROY THEM.

122
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,375
- WE CAN LEAVE ALL
THE TORCHES WE WANT,

123
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,125
BUT THAT ONLY SERVES AS
A TEMPORARY STOPGAP.

124
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,416
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE DANGER
TO THIS WORLD THAT COMES

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,125
FROM DISRUPTIONS
TO EXISTENCES.

126
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,333
- SO YOU'RE A FLAME HAZE.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,916
- WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE DENIZEN
STILL USING RINNE IN THIS CITY.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,125
- AND CONSIDERING WHAT
THE RINNE SAID,

129
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,916
IT COULD BE QUITE POWERFUL.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,416
NOT LIKELY TO THINK
OF US AS A THREAT.

131
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,041
AND THERE'S ANOTHER REASON
WHY IT MIGHT STAY.

132
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,375
- THAT MYSTES
FROM EARLIER.

133
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,583
- HMM.

134
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,750
- LOOK, MARIANNE.
ISN'T IT SIMPLY BREATHTAKING?

135
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,583
- YES, MASTER.

136
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,833
- WE SHALL ACQUIRE ETERNITY
ITSELF IN THIS CITY.

137
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

138
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,666
- YES, BUT WHAT
OF THE FLAME HAZE?

139
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,166
- ( shushing )

140
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,666
LET US NOT RUIN THE MOMENT
WITH A VULGARITY.

141
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,208
THIS IS A TIME
FOR ENJOYING BEAUTY.

142
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,000
- MY DEEPEST APOLOGIES.

143
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,875
- SUCH WORDS ARE NOT NECESSARY.

144
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,500
THEY DISTRACT US
FROM THE HERE AND NOW.

145
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,250
- MASTER.

146
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,250
- ( birds chirping )

147
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,000
- ( yawning )

148
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,125
MAN, WAS IT ALL A DREAM?

149
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,041
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

150
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,333
- MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD.
TAKING IT EASY TODAY?

151
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,000
- HUH? WHAT?
IS THAT THE TIME?

152
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:51,250
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU.
YOU ALMOST NEVER SLEEP IN.

153
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,625
AND YOU WENT STRAIGHT TO BED
WHEN YOU GOT HOME LAST NIGHT,

154
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,708
DIDN'T YOU?
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

155
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,791
- NO, I'M FINE, MOM.
REALLY.

156
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,500
HMM, THAT'S GOOD.
AT LEAST MOM'S NOT A TORCH.

157
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,583
- YOUR DAD CALLED LAST NIGHT.

158
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,791
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO COME HOME

159
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,416
FOR THE GOLDEN WEEK
HOLIDAY, AFTER ALL.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,416
- OH.

161
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,625
HOW WOULD MOM AND DAD REACT
IF THEY FOUND OUT

162
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,875
I WAS ALREADY DEAD?

163
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,625
TO BEGIN WITH, I GUESS
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW

164
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,208
THEY HAD A SON.

165
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,083
- BUT HE SAID HE PROMISES TO BE
HOME FOR YOUR SUMMER VACATION. 

166
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,333
- I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER NEVER TO
HAVE EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE,

167
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,083
RATHER THAN CAUSING THEM
ALL THAT GRIEF.

168
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,791
OR MAYBE I'M ALREADY GONE,

169
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,541
THE REAL YUJI SAKAI, I MEAN.

170
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,208
THEN WHAT
AM I WORRYING ABOUT?

171
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,375
THE REAL YUJI SAKAI WOULD BE

172
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,208
PRETTY DEPRESSED
OR EVEN ANXIOUS.

173
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,041
I FEEL KIND OF--
- SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

174
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,500
- UH. NO, NOT REALLY.

175
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,166
I'D BETTER GO. MY TEACHER IS
PRETTY TOUGH ON LATE STUDENTS.

176
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,416
LATER.

177
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
- HAVE A NICE DAY.
BE CAREFUL.

178
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,541
- HUH?

179
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

180
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,083
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LOT
EASIER TO STICK CLOSE TO YOU,

181
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,666
RATHER THAN RUNNING AROUND
SEARCHING FOR THE DENIZENS,

182
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,500
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LIKE
OTHER TORCHES, YOU KNOW?

183
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,583
- OKAY.

184
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,458
- YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT RINNE THING

185
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,458
CALLED ME A MYSTES YESTERDAY.

186
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,208
- AHH, YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

187
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,750
- MYSTESES ARE TORCHES THAT
HAVE BEEN CHANGED

188
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,250
BY CRIMSON DENIZENS.

189
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,333
THEY HAVE SPECIAL ABILITIES

190
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,833
OR SOMETIMES THEY
CONTAIN TREASURES.

191
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,833
- TREASURES?
- WHEN THE FLAME

192
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,208
OF SOME TORCHES BURN OUT,
WHAT IS INSIDE THEM

193
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,875
IS TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER TORCH,

194
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,166
KIND OF LIKE THEY'RE A TRANSPORT
CONTAINER FOR TREASURES.

195
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,791
- WHY DO I HAVE ONE?
- DON'T ASK ME.

196
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,625
THE TREASURES MOVE ABOUT
ON THEIR OWN.

197
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,125
- Alastor: IT IS LIKELY
THE ENEMY WILL TARGET YOU

198
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,625
BEFORE YOUR FLAME DIMS
AND GOES OUT.

199
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,625
- HEY, WHAT EXACTLY
AM I ANYWAY?

200
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,083
- Girl: I TOLD YOU.
YOU'RE A TORCH AND A MYSTES.

201
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,083
BUT THE THINGS I THINK ABOUT
ARE THE SAME THINGS YUJI SAKAI

202
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,625
WOULD THINK ABOUT.
- OF COURSE.

203
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,958
BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS RESIDUE.
- I SEE.

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,500
HIRAI!

205
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,541
THAT'S RIGHT.

206
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,416
THE SAME THING HAPPENED
TO HIRAI.

207
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,375
HER FLAME, IT'S SO WEAK.

208
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,458
- YEAH, SHE WON'T BE AROUND
MUCH LONGER.

209
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,916
- BUT THOSE THINGS ONLY ATTACKED
HER YESTERDAY.

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,916
- THEN THEY MUST HAVE CONSUMED
MORE OF HER.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,375
THOSE RINNE WERE FEROCIOUS,

212
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,375
AND THEY WERE FEEDING
PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY.

213
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,958
- HIRAI! HIRAI!
GOOD MORNING.

214
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,291
UM, HI, THERE.

215
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,250
- GOOD MORNING.

216
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,541
- IS THIS THE SAME HIRAI?

217
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,458
SHE'S LIKE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

218
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,708
- BY THE END OF TODAY,
IF SHE'S LUCKY.

219
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,500
- LUCKY? BUT CAN'T WE
RESTORE HER SOMEHOW?

220
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,500
- NO. IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT'S ONLY HER RESIDUE.

221
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,916
THE REAL ONE IS ALREADY DEAD.

222
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,000
- NO WAY.

223
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,416
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

224
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,333
- WHY HORRIBLE?
THAT'S NOT A PERSON.

225
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,250
IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A TORCH.
- ( scoffs )

226
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,750
HIRAI! WE'RE GONNA
BE LATE. LET'S RUN.

227
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,166
COME ON. TRY AND CHEER UP.

228
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,833
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT BEING

229
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,458
RESTORED WHEN WE WERE
DISCUSSING HIM.

230
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,833
- PERHAPS IT IS A CASE
OF THINGS BECOMING CLEARER

231
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,458
WHEN YOU SEE IT HAPPENING
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

232
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,416
- ( panting )

233
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,833
HIRAI'S ON THE VERGE
OF DISAPPEARING?

234
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,083
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

235
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,333
DO YOU KNOW IF IKE
HAS A GIRLFRIEND?

236
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,833
- Teacher:
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

237
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,291
WELL, IT SEEMS YOU'RE LATE
FOR CLASS, SAKAI.

238
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,791
- SORRY, SIR.

239
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,791
- SAKAI, ONE DEMERIT.

240
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,000
- WHAT ABOUT HIRAI?

241
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,583
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE WAS WITH YOU.

242
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,500
NEVER MIND.
JUST TAKE YOUR SEAT.

243
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,875
- HMM.

244
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,083
- WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU'RE ALMOST NEVER LATE.

245
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,791
- YEAH.

246
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:41,166
NO ONE'S EVEN LOOKING AT HER.
I CAN SEE IT HAPPENING.

247
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,166
HER EXISTENCE WILL KEEP FADING,
AND PEOPLE WILL JUST FORGET HER.

248
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,791
HIRAI, LUNCH TIME!
- WHAT?

249
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,208
THAT'S NICE.

250
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,000
- SAKAI, DID YOU ALREADY
BUY LUNCH?

251
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,750
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO
STAND IN LINE.

252
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,041
- I'LL JOIN YOU.
HIRAI, LET'S GO TOGETHER.

253
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,583
ALL RIGHT?
WE'LL BE WITH IKE.

254
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,416
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU, IKE?

255
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,416
- SURE, FINE WITH ME.
- COME ON.

256
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,958
- HMM?

257
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,708
HEY, SATO, HAS THAT GIRL
ALWAYS BEEN IN OUR CLASS?

258
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,625
- SHE'S HERE,
SO I GUESS SO.

259
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,083
- Ike: HEY, GET THIS,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT,

260
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,583
BUT YOU KNOW MY INSTRUCTOR
AT PREP SCHOOL?

261
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,625
THE GUY IS MURATA'S BROTHER.

262
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,666
- SO DO YOU HAVE PREP SCHOOL
TODAY, IKE?

263
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,750
- NOPE.
GOT THE DAY OFF.

264
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HANG OUT

265
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,125
AT THE TRAIN STATION
AFTER SCHOOL?

266
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,458
YOU, ME AND HIRAI.
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A PLAN?

267
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,625
- SURE.
- GOOD. IT'S SETTLED.

268
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,291
HIRAI, IKE'S COMING TOO.

269
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,208
- ( sighs )

270
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,416
- Yuji: SHE SEEMS
TO RESPOND A LITTLE BIT MORE

271
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,041
WHEN IT COMES TO IKE.

272
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,166
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP HER BE MORE
LIKE SHE WAS YESTERDAY.

273
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,500
COME ON, IKE, A LITTLE
CLOSER. SAY "CHEESE."

274
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,708
THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

275
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,125
OOPS, I'M SORT OF IN THE WAY,
AREN'T I?

276
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,791
SORRY ABOUT THAT, HIRAI.

277
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,458
- HEY, SAKAI--
- WHAT SHALL WE DO NEXT?

278
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,250
PLAY THE CLAW GAME?

279
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,916
I KNOW, HOW ABOUT YOU AND IKE
PLAY A FIGHTING GAME?

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,166
HUH?

281
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,375
IKE, DO SOMETHING
WITH HIRAI, OKAY?

282
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,958
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- HOLD ON.

283
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,291
- ( grunting )

284
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,708
- YOU'RE A DECOY,
SO TRY TO STOP MOVING.

285
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,666
IT'S A HASSLE IF YOU'RE
ALWAYS RUNNING AROUND. 

286
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,291
- WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO?

287
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,125
- YOUR FEELING SORRY FOR IT
ISN'T GONNA HELP.

288
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,958
IT'S ONLY A TORCH. YOU CAN'T
STOP IT FROM VANISHING.

289
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,458
- BUT MAYBE IF I MAKE SURE
NO ONE FORGETS HIRAI.

290
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,208
- POINTLESS.
- I DON'T CARE!

291
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,916
- I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH
A FOOLISH TORCH.

292
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,208
- HMM.

293
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,208
- HEY, IKE, WHERE'S HIRAI?
- HUH?

294
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,125
WHO'S HIRAI?
- HIRAI.

295
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
YOU KNOW, THE GIRL YOU
WERE HERE WITH.

296
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,541
- WAS I WITH A GIRL?
- YEAH, SHE WAS RIGHT HERE.

297
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,083
NO WAY.
IS SHE GONE ALREADY?

298
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,458
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
I KIND OF REMEMBER

299
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,000
HER WALKING OUT A MINUTE AGO.

300
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,208
- WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?
SHE JUST WALKED OUT?

301
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,375
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
HEY, I JUST CLEARED THIS STAGE!

302
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,541
- IKE, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY ARE YOU SO INDIFFERENT?

303
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,791
TRY TO REMEMBER HER!
IT WAS THE THREE OF US.

304
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,875
WE CAME HERE TOGETHER.
COME ON, YOU KNOW HIRAI.

305
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,791
REMEMBER.

306
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,500
- DOES IKE HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
OR ANYTHING?

307
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,750
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE FEELING
ALL RIGHT, SAKAI?

308
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,791
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
- IT'S NOT IKE'S FAULT.

309
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,333
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A TORCH.

310
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:27,125
SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M GONNA GO
AND LOOK FOR HIRAI MYSELF.

311
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,541
- I WONDER WHAT'S UP WITH HIM.

312
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,041
- HIRAI, YOU CAN'T HAVE
VANISHED ALREADY.

313
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,458
PLEASE DON'T DISAPPEAR YET.

314
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,458
( panting )

315
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,458
- DAMN IT. I TOLD HIM NOT
TO GO RUNNING AROUND.

316
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,250
HE'S ONE STRANGE TORCH.

317
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,208
- IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO FIND
THOSE WHO DEFY THEIR FATE.

318
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,583
- HUH?

319
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,958
WHAT A RELIEF.
I FOUND YOU.

320
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,166
SORRY ABOUT IKE.

321
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,416
HE SAID HE HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE.

322
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,833
HUH? HEY, JUST
CUT OFF THE RIGHT SIDE

323
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,666
AND YOU'VE GOT A NICE SHOT
OF THE TWO OF YOU.

324
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,125
- ( inaudible )

325
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,083
- WHAT WAS THAT?

326
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,916
- ( whispers )
IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

327
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,541
- I SEE. SO THAT'S WHY YOU
CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. 

328
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,000
( sighs )

329
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,500
HIRAI, TOMORROW,
LET'S BRING IKE HERE.

330
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,333
YOU CAN SHOW HIM THIS
VIEW YOURSELF, OKAY? 

331
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,458
HUH?

332
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,041
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS?

333
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,833
- Girl: THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

334
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,375
- ( sighs )

335
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,750
AND I WILL DISAPPEAR
IN THE SAME WAY.

336
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,000
- YES, JUST LIKE YOU SAW.

337
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,000
THE RESIDUE EVENTUALLY
BURNS OUT.

338
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
IT'S GONE, AND NOBODY WILL
REMEMBER ITS EXISTENCE.

339
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,416
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.

340
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,875
THAT'S WHY THERE'S
NO INTERRUPTION.

341
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,541
- YOU'RE WRONG! I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT HIRAI EXISTED.

342
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,833
I KNOW SHE LIKED IKE. I KNOW
HER NAME IS YUKARI HIRAI!

343
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,541
THERE'S NO DOUBT SHE WAS HERE.
SHE WAS.

344
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,500
SHE EXISTED.

345
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,833
- AND YOU?
- AND I EXIST TOO.

346
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,416
AND I KNOW THAT
I'M YUJI SAKAI.

347
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,000
- YOU'RE ONLY A TORCH.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

348
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,166
I'M YUJI SAKAI.
JUST LIKE YOU'RE--

349
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,666
- I AM ONLY A FLAME HAZE.
NOTHING MORE.

350
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,416
IN A WAY,
I'M THE SAME AS A TORCH.

351
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,083
- WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING "ONLY"?
JUST STOP IT.

352
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,291
- BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU ARE ONLY A TORCH.

353
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,791
AND I AM ONLY A FLAME HAZE.
NOTHING MORE.

354
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,791
- YOU'RE WRONG.
- NO, I'M NOT.

355
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,750
- WHY ARE YOU SO--

356
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,416
- WHAT IS IT?
- YOUR NAME.

357
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,666
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOUR NAME IS.

358
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,500
- I DON'T HAVE A NAME.

359
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,125
I'M ONLY A FLAME HAZE.
- YOU SAID IT AGAIN.

360
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,458
- LOOK, SHUT UP, SHUT UP,
SHUT UP!

361
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,125
WHO NEEDS A NAME ANYWAY?

362
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,250
TO DISTINGUISH ME FROM
THE OTHER FLAME HAZES,

363
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,125
THEY JUST CALL ME THE ONE
WITH NIETONO NO SHANA.

364
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,041
- NIETONO NO SHANA?

365
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,250
- THAT IS THE NAME OF THE SWORD
SHE CARRIES.

366
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,791
- NIETONO NO SHANA.
THEN YOUR NAME IS SHANA.

367
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,625
THAT'S WHAT I'LL CALL YOU.

368
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,125
YOU'RE SHANA. STOP SAYING
YOU'RE ONLY A FLAME HAZE.

369
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,833
AND I'M NOT ONLY A TORCH.
I'M YUJI SAKAI.

370
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,125
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

371
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,916
I'M THE ONE WHO GAVE
HER THAT NAME.

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,083
FROM THAT DAY ON, THE FLAME HAZE
WITH THE FIERY HAIR

373
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,333
AND BLAZING EYES WAS
KNOWN AS SHANA.

374
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,208
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

375
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,708
- Yuji:
A RINNE SHOWS UP AT MY SCHOOL.

376
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,583
PREPARING THE WAY FOR FRIAGNE,
A LORD OF THE CRIMSON WORLD. 

377
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:06,375
AND IN THE CITY,
ANOTHER FLAME HAZE APPEARS.

378
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,958
