1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,750
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,625
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,500
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,083
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,458
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,458
- YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.

9
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,208
- THAT'S RIGHT. I AM
CALLED A FLAME HAZE.

10
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,291
MY TASK IN THIS WORLD IS
TO FIGHT THE DENIZENS.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,166
- Khamsin: SEE HOW
THE WORLD REALLY IS.

12
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,375
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
IT'S TOO MUCH.

13
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,416
- YUJI.

14
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,375
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- Alastor: SHANA.

15
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,958
- ( gasps )

16
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,666
- IT APPEARS YOUR HELP IS NEEDED
TO FIX THIS CITY'S DISTORTION.

17
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,833
COME WITH ME, QUICKLY.

18
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,875
- ( panting )

19
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,541
- THEN YOU'RE THE MYSTES
MARGERY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

20
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,375
- YEAH.

21
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,291
- AND YOU. YOU'RE WITH
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

22
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,333
- RIGHT, TANAKA TOO.

23
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,458
- I SEE. SURPRISING.

24
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,208
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

25
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:52,333
IF YOU REALLY ARE A MYSTES,
THEN THE REAL YUJI SAKAI...

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,291
- YUJI SAKAI IS DEAD.

27
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,583
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M DEAD.

28
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,166
- YOU'RE... YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH.

29
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,916
- YEAH, YOU THINK SO?

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
- NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE COULD
STAY CALM. YOU'VE GOT GUTS.

31
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,041
- I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

32
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,958
I'VE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT
HOW PEOPLE WOULD REACT

33
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,541
IF THEY FOUND OUT THE TRUTH.

34
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,833
TONIGHT FOR INSTANCE.

35
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,541
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'VE GOTTA GO FIND YOSHIDA.

36
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,541
- YOSHIDA?

37
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,291
- SHE FOUND OUT
THAT I'M A TORCH.

38
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,458
SHE WAS COMPLETELY
SHOCKED BY IT.

39
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,875
I NEED TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS.

40
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,208
THOUGH I GUESS THAT
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

41
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,250
A FACT IS A FACT.

42
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,875
- ( loud screeching sound )

43
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,500
- ( gasps )

44
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,541
- Professor: ( laughing )
DOMINO,

45
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,833
I CAN SEE THE WHOLE SACRED
CHAPEL RISING BEFORE ME.

46
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,833
CAN I ASSUME IT'S ALMOST
FULLY OPERATIONAL?

47
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,000
- Domino: INDEED,

48
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,250
YOUR ASSUMPTION IS
CORRECT, PROFESSOR!

49
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
AT THIS POINT, I AM PLEASED TO

50
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,083
REPORT THE FLAME HAZES
SEEM TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY

51
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,750
NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,750
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
ITS PURPOSE IS TO ACTUALLY

53
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,041
INCREASE THE DISTORTION.

54
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,250
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT,
THE DISTORTION

55
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,833
IS MERELY A SIDE EFFECT
FROM ITS OTHER OPERATION.

56
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,291
- Behemoth: THE SEEKER DOES
HAVE A REPUTATION

57
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,708
FOR DOING UNNECESSARY THINGS.

58
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,000
- WE'LL JUST OBSERVE FOR NOW.

59
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,458
- DAMMIT, HOW MUCH LONGER DO I
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE PESTS?

60
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,916
AND WHY HAVEN'T KEISAKU AND EITA
REACHED THE CRYSTAL ALTAR YET?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,750
- Marco:
I'M NOT PICKING UP ANYTHING

62
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,500
FROM THAT WHACKED OUT
CRAZY PROFESSOR.

63
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,083
HE'S NOT SHY ABOUT MOVING
HIS RINNE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

64
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,000
- NOW WHAT?

65
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,166
- Marco: THAT REMINDS ME,

66
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,625
THERE'S ANOTHER FLAME
HAZE IN THE MIX.

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,000
- I WONDER IF HE HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE SEEKER.

68
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,166
- Marco: WHY DON'T WE FIND HIM
AND PUT HIM ON THE SPOT?

69
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,625
- SOUNDS GOOD.
THEN SHALL WE GO?

70
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,708
- Marco: CLIMB ON!

71
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,666
- WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,166
- THESE RINNES DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM,

73
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,166
AND NEITHER DOES SHANA.

74
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,791
IT'S THE OTHER FLAME HAZE.

75
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,833
MARGERY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT ANOTHER ONE

76
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
SHOWING UP IN THE CITY.

77
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,166
- IT'S HIS! THIS IS HIS!

78
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,958
THIS THING SHOWED
EVERYTHING TO YOSHIDA.

79
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,541
- SAKAI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

80
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,125
WAIT, I'VE GOTTA GET
TO THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

81
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,625
HE'S A TORCH.

82
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,250
- YUKARI IS A FLAME HAZE?

83
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,416
THEN SHE KNOWS ABOUT EVERYTHING
HAPPENING IN THIS CITY...

84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,416
AND ABOUT SAKAI.

85
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,208
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING,
AND YET SHE STILL...

86
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,916
- ( exclaims )

87
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,250
AND YET SHE STILL CARES FOR HIM.

88
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,291
- LET'S GO.

89
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,791
- I'M FINE. I CAN KEEP UP.
- GOOD.

90
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,791
- I CAN KEEP UP.

91
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,125
- AH, IT'S CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

92
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,250
SO, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WAS FIGHTING.

93
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,708
- Behemoth: HMM, SO EXPLAINS THE
AGGRESSIVE PRESENCE WE SENSED.

94
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,250
- OH, IT'S ONLY YOU TWO GEEZERS.
HOW BORING.

95
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,833
- Marco: YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

96
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,791
WITH THAT CRACKPOT PROFESSOR.

97
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,791
- Behemoth: HMM,

98
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,833
I TAKE IT YOU'RE JUST
AS PUZZLED AS WE ARE

99
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,666
OVER NOT BEING ABLE TO
DETECT THE SEEKER.

100
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
- OF COURSE.

101
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,791
HE MUST BE USING
SOME KIND OF TRICK.

102
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,625
- BUT WHAT?
- WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE...

103
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,250
OH, WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

104
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,000
- SEEMS TO BE A MYSTES.
- HE'S NOT INVOLVED.

105
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,375
DON'T WORRY.

106
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,833
- Marco: HE LOOKS PRETTY
MAD FOR SOME REASON.

107
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,541
- THIS BELONG TO YOU?
- YES.

108
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,791
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
YOU ARE YUJI SAKAI.

109
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,458
- Behemoth: HMM.
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

110
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,125
YOU'D END UP BEING A MYSTES?

111
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,333
I FEEL BAD FOR WHAT THAT YOUNG
LADY HAD TO GO THROUGH.

112
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,166
- WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO GET HER INVOLVED?

113
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,166
- WE NEED SOMEONE
TO COOPERATE WITH US,

114
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,166
AND SHE WAS THE BEST QUALIFIED.

115
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,916
- QUALIFIED? YOU GAVE
HER THIS TREASURE

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
BASED ON THAT KIND OF NONSENSE?

117
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,916
- YUJI.

118
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
- SAKAI!

119
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,875
- CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW
SHOCKED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN

120
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,666
WHEN SHE SAW HOW THE
WORLD REALLY LOOKED?

121
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,916
SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ALL OF THIS,

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,583
SO WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
DRAG HER INTO THIS WORLD?

123
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,541
WHY? WHY!

124
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,583
- BE CALM.

125
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,708
I CAN SEE THAT SHE IS A VERY
IMPORTANT PERSON TO YOU.

126
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,666
- YOSHIDA'S A PERSON
OF GREAT KINDNESS.

127
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,375
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO
COME TO THIS WORLD.

128
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,833
SHE SHOULD HAVE STAYED BEHIND

129
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,541
IN THE WORLD I CAN'T GO BACK TO.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
- SAKAI.

131
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,000
- HUH?

132
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,625
YOSHIDA.

133
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,458
SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.

134
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,166
- OH, YUJI.

135
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,041
- ALRIGHT, WE'RE VERY TOUCHED.
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCENE,

136
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,000
BUT LET'S TRY TO FOCUS
ON REALITY, SHALL WE?

137
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,541
- YES, SHE'S RIGHT.

138
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,000
I THINK I'VE GOT A GRASP ON THE
SITUATION WITH THIS SYSTEM.

139
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,125
- Alastor: SHANA!

140
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,375
- KAZUMI YOSHIDA HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH US!

141
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,875
- THAT WASN'T LIKE SHANA.

142
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,916
WHY'D SHE SAY THAT?

143
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,291
- ABOUT THE
UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM...

144
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,291
IT'S GOING TO OPEN
A HOLE IN SPACE

145
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,583
BY UTILIZING THE
CITY'S DISTORTION.

146
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,875
- A HOLE IN SPACE?
- YES.

147
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,833
AS IF YOU TOOK A PIECE
OUT OF A JIGSAW PUZZLE.

148
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,250
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

149
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,333
- Marco: SURE, BUT WHY?

150
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,958
- Alastor: WHAT MEANING IS THERE
IN DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

151
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,333
- Behemoth: HMM, THE SEEKER HAS
ALWAYS DONE THINGS

152
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,750
THAT SIMPLY DON'T
MAKE MUCH SENSE.

153
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,791
- IN ANY CASE, IT'S CLEAR THE
CITY IS BEING AFFECTED BY IT.

154
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,458
WE SHOULD BEGIN THE TUNING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

155
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,708
AS I EXPLAINED YESTERDAY,

156
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,750
WE'D LIKE YOU TO
COOPERATE WITH US.

157
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,458
- WHAT? COOPERATE?

158
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,541
IT'S NOT FAIR TO
INVOLVE HER IN THIS.

159
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,333
- UNLESS WE ACT, THIS CITY
IS ONLY GONNA GET WORSE.

160
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:33,416
- SAKAI, IT'S OKAY.
I MADE A PROMISE TO KHAMSIN.

161
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,208
AND I'M JUST FINE NOW.

162
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,625
I'M SORRY FOR
RUNNING OFF BEFORE.

163
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,791
- YOSHIDA...

164
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,375
- COME HERE PLEASE.

165
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,291
VENTRICLE OF KEDESH.

166
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
- Marco: HEY,
NOTHING'S HAPPENING!

167
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,375
- YES.

168
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,208
- WE SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM.
- Behemoth: HMM.

169
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,541
THAT UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM IS
PREVENTING THE NUMEROUS MARKINGS

170
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,041
WE PLACED IN THE
CITY FROM MOVING.

171
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,958
- ALL THAT TO NOW YOU SAY
YOU CAN'T DO YOUR TUNING?

172
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.

173
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,625
- JUST A MINUTE.

174
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,916
- Tanaka: BIG SISTER,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,208
- SURE CAN.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

176
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,666
- Tanaka: SORRY, I WAS HELD UP.

177
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,583
- Margery: FORGET THAT.
IS THE CRYSTAL ALTAR WORKING?

178
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,083
- UH, JUST A MOMENT.

179
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,708
UM, THERE'S A HOLE
AT THE TOP OF THAT

180
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,500
UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM
ABOVE THE CITY.

181
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,500
- Margery: WE KNOW ABOUT THAT.
ANYTHING ELSE?

182
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,375
- THE SYSTEM IS SPREAD
ACROSS THE CITY,

183
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,333
BUT THE LINES LEAD TO
A SINGLE LOCATION.

184
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,041
- Margery: WHERE?
- THE RIVERBANK.

185
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,791
MAYBE THE FESTIVAL'S
MAIN STAGE.

186
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,333
- THE FESTIVAL'S MAIN
STAGE DOWN BY THE RIVER.

187
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,458
HE SAYS THAT'S WHERE THE CORE
OF THE UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM IS.

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,208
- I BET IT'S THE TOWER!

189
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,125
- I DON'T SENSE ANYTHING.

190
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,583
- COME TO THINK OF IT,

191
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,125
THE SEEKER HAS A MECHANICAL
ASSISTANT WORKING FOR HIM.

192
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,125
A RINNE COMPRISED OF MACHINERY.

193
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,000
- IT'S CALLED DOMINO, RIGHT?

194
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,458
- Behemoth: HMM, I'D
FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT.

195
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,125
IT'S NOT SURPRISING WE WEREN'T
ABLE TO SENSE HIS ASSISTANT.

196
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,291
- I'M SURE DESTROYING THAT RINNE

197
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,291
WOULD AFFECT THE
UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM.

198
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,291
- HERE. USE THIS TO REACH ME,
JUST IN CASE.

199
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,416
- LET'S GO MARCOSIAS!
- Marco: TALLY-HO!

200
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,833
- Alastor: WE SHOULD GO AS WELL.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,541
- Yuji: BE CAREFUL.

202
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,208
- USUALLY HE'D SAY HE
WAS COMING ALONG.

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,083
- Domino: PROFESSOR,

204
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,875
THE BASIC VALUE OF
THE WHOLE SACRED CHAPEL

205
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,291
IS NOW WITHIN
ESTIMATED RANGE.

206
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,541
THIS MEANS THE REQUIREMENT
FOR THE EXPERIMENT

207
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,333
HAVE ALL BEEN SATISFIED.

208
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,416
- Professor: EXCELLENT!

209
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,833
WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WE'LL
CONDUCT A TRIAL EXPERIMENT

210
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,333
USING A SIMPLE
UNRESTRICTED SYSTEM,

211
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,041
THAT I SO THOUGHTFULLY
BROUGHT ALONG.

212
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,375
- Domino: OH! DETECTING
INCOMING FLAME HAZES!

213
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,041
- Professor: I SUGGEST YOU
PREPARE YOURSELF,

214
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,541
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.

215
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,000
I, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL
PROCEED TO OUR RENDEZVOUS POINT.

216
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,333
THAT'S ALL. OVER AND OUT.

217
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,583
- THAT'S IT.

218
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,791
- ( grunting )

219
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,375
- Marco: HEY, HEY! ALREADY?

220
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,541
- HUH? WHAT JUST
HAPPENED THERE?

221
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,916
- Marco: THE RINNE!

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,916
- Margery: I SEE.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,916
DEFENSIVE UNRESTRICTED
METHODS ARE BEING USED

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,625
TO DEFLECT POWER OF EXISTENCE.

225
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,125
- ( Domino laughs )

226
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,750
YOUR ATTACKS ARE
INEFFECTIVE AGAINST ME!

227
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,875
BEGIN TRANSFORMATION!

228
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,916
- Marco: IS THERE A
POINT TO ALL THIS?

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,666
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT THAT
DEFLECTION EARLIER

230
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,583
HAS ME A BIT WORRIED.

231
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,125
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO APPROACH.

232
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,000
THERE'S THE LUNATIC NOW.
HE'S MAKING HIS MOVE.

233
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,250
- HE WAS OUTSIDE THE CITY.
- YES,

234
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,916
HE WASN'T ACTUALLY
HIDING FROM US AT ALL.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,250
THAT'S WHY WE WEREN'T
ABLE TO DETECT HIM.

236
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,833
- Behemoth: HMM, BUT HOW IS HE
PLANNING ON ENTERING THE CITY?

237
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,833
- THERE'S NO DOUBT.
HE IS COMING CLOSER.

238
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,666
- THAT'S IT!

239
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,833
- WELL, I'M ARRIVING
IN STYLE.

240
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,500
- ( maniacal laughter )

241
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,875
- AN AIRSHIP?

242
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,208
- Khamsin: THE SEEKER LOVES TO
BE SHOWY FOR NO REAL REASON.

243
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,416
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
THERE'S NO MEANING

244
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
TO HIS PLAN AT ALL.

245
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,125
- HANG ON A SECOND.
- WHAT IS IT?

246
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,125
- THERE COULD BE A REASON WHY HE
CHOSE TO COME IN FROM THE AIR.

247
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,958
YOU SAID SOMETHING
EARLIER ABOUT REMOVING

248
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
A JIGSAW PIECE FROM SPACE.

249
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,916
- Khamsin: YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

250
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,666
- ANY CHANCE THAT AIRSHIP
IS THE FINAL PIECE?

251
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,458
- YOU KNOW, THE BOY'S
THEORY HAS MERIT.

252
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,083
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
HEAD TO THAT SPACE

253
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,083
AND FORGET ABOUT THE ROBOT.

254
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,083
- I BET THE AIRSHIP IS
PROTECTED WITH THE SAME

255
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,750
KIND OF DEFENSE MECHANISM.

256
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,666
ATTACKING IT ISN'T
GOING TO WORK.

257
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,583
- BUT IF MY THEORY'S CORRECT,

258
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
ANY DEFENSIVE MEASURES
WILL BE AFFECTED

259
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,166
BY THE SYSTEM THAT
MADE THE HOLE.

260
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,166
WHICH WOULD MEAN...

261
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,166
- Margery: THE MECHANISM WOULD
HAVE TO BE DEACTIVATED

262
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,583
TO GET NEAR THE SPACE.

263
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,666
- RIGHT.

264
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
- SAKAI IS INCREDIBLE.

265
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,916
- AND IF NEEDED, I WILL STAGE
AN ATTACK ON THE AIRSHIP MYSELF.

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,625
- Marco: IS HE SERIOUS?

267
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,708
- I SINCERELY HOPE HE
DOESN'T DO THAT.

268
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:16,000
- I CAN'T HEAR YUJI'S VOICE.
HE'S SO FAR AWAY.

269
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,166
- OKAY, I'M FINISHED
TRANSFORMING NOW.

270
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,208
FLAME HAZES COME AT ME!

271
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,125
THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

272
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,583
- LO, BEHOLD! THE CLIMAX
AND THE GRAND FINALE!

273
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:55,958
BEGIN THE EXPERIMENT! DEACTIVATE
THE UNRESTRICTED METHOD!

274
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,458
- ( screaming )

275
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,875
- Margery: RIDE A COCK
HORSE TO BANBURY CROSS.

276
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,041
SHE SHALL HAVE MUSIC
WHEREVER SHE GOES!

277
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,791
- WEIRD FLAME HAZES!

278
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,291
- HE'S STILL NUTTY
AS A FRUITCAKE.

279
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,458
- Shana: WE CAN'T LET
HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS.

280
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,416
- DAMN THEM!

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,125
I'M BEING THWARTED BY
WRONG-HEADED THINKERS

282
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,625
WHO REFUSE TO BE ENLIGHTENED!

283
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,125
- DOMINO!
- Domino: YESSIREE!

284
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,125
- IT'S TIME TO USE THE SPECIAL
TECHNIQUE WE PREPARED

285
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,208
IN CASE THINGS WENT AWRY.

286
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,625
- WHAT IS THAT?

287
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,208
- Marco: THIS IS GETTING
TOO SILLY FOR ME.

288
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,166
- I GUESS HE WANTED TO TRY IT.

289
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,750
- ( laughing ) THIS BRILLIANT
MANEUVER HERALDS THE END!

290
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,500
- Khamsin: PLEASE GET OUT OF
THE WAY. I'LL FINISH HIM OFF.

291
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,500
- YOU WILL?

292
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:06,791
- THE OLD MAN'S GONNA OPEN FIRE!
- Marco: RUN FOR IT!

293
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,666
- WHAT?
- Alastor: MOVE! NOW!

294
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,791
- HAVE I WON THE FIGHT ALREADY?

295
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,791
- ( screams )

296
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,041
- Domino:
PERHAPS IT WAS POINTLESS

297
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,708
TO COMBINE LIKE THAT. OW. OW.

298
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,416
- I DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING
IS POINTLESS OR NOT!

299
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:00,000
ESCAPE!

300
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,541
- WHAT IN THE WORLD DID
HE COME HERE FOR?

301
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,375
- Marco: I DON'T
EVEN WANNA KNOW.

302
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,458
- YOSHIDA, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

303
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,875
- YES.

304
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,083
- UH, SORRY.

305
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,458
- UH, YOSHIDA?

306
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,958
- SAKAI, YOU'RE SO WARM.

307
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,000
ARE YOU EVER GONNA GET BETTER?

308
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,833
- NO.

309
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,125
THE REAL ME IS ALREADY DEAD.

310
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,791
THE ME RIGHT HERE
ISN'T EVEN HUMAN.

311
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,833
- NO, SAKAI, YOU'RE HUMAN.

312
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,375
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT.

313
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,625
- HUMAN? BUT WHY?

314
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,541
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SO WARM.

315
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,500
YOUR BODY AND YOUR HEART.

316
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,625
- THAT MAKES ME HUMAN?

317
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,291
- MMM-HMM. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU

318
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,875
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

319
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,791
I, I LOVE YOU, SAKAI.

320
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,625
- NOW, THE VENTRICLE OF KEDESH.

321
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,416
YOUNG LADY,

322
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,125
PLEASE IMAGINE THE
CITY AS YOU KNOW IT.

323
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,375
THAT IMAGE WILL CORRECT
THE DISTORTION

324
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,416
AND FINE TUNE THE PROCESS.

325
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,583
- OKAY.

326
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,083
MY CITY.

327
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,500
- I FEEL IT.

328
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,416
IT'S THE CITY, THE ONE I'VE
LIVED IN EVER SINCE I WAS BORN.

329
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,333
- Behemoth: HMM, THIS IS GOOD.

330
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,166
THE IMAGES ARE VERY WARM.

331
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,958
- I LIVED HERE.

332
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,291
- Yoshida: NO, SAKAI,
YOU'RE HUMAN.

333
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,541
- ( crying )

334
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,583
- I CAN TELL. YUJI.

335
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,083
YUJI'S NOT GONNA COME WITH ME.

336
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,583
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

337
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,041
- ( panting )

338
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,583
- WHAT SEEMS TO
BE BOTHERING YOU?

339
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:52,958
- WIRHELMINA.

340
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,333
- I THOUGHT I WARNED YOU
NOT TO OVERDO THINGS.

341
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:07,125
AH, SEEKER. YOU WERE ONLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARATIONS.

342
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,500
- WELL, THE EXPERIMENT ACHIEVED
