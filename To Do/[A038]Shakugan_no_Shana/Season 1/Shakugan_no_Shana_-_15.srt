1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,041
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,750
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,541
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,125
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,750
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,250
( screams in pain )

9
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,041
- ( screaming )

10
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,916
- HUH?

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,166
- WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,000
I, I FOUND IT.
THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

13
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
- WE HAVE A REAL
EMERGENCY INDEED.

14
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,291
- MIGHTY WARRIOR,

15
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,000
I AM HERE TO FIGHT YOU.

16
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,125
- FROZEN WITH FEAR I SEE.

17
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,416
- INDEED, WE MUST RETURN
AT ONCE.

18
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,708
- Tiamat: Agreed.

19
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:56,875
- YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK
YOU'LL ESCAPE, DO YOU?

20
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,125
- ( footsteps approaching )

21
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,541
- Hmm?

22
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,125
- WHAT?

23
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:21,000
- THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING...

24
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,208
- ( groans )

25
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,041
- SHIRO.

26
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,208
IS THIS MY FAULT?

27
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,333
THIS HAPPENED...
BECAUSE I TRICKED HIM?

28
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,375
- ( sobs ) I'M SORRY.

29
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,416
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU.

30
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,750
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THAT I COULD DO IT.

31
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,750
THAT I COULD BEAT YOU
IF I PUT MY MIND TO IT.

32
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:59,625
- ( crying ) SHIRO,
I AM SO SORRY. SHIRO.

33
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,750
- WELL LOOK HERE. I THINK
I'VE FOUND THE CULPRIT.

34
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,166
- ( laughing )

35
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,791
I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS,
BUT WHATEVER YOU DID, THANKS.

36
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,000
- HUMAN? NO, HE'S...
A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

37
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,333
- YEAH, SO?

38
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,375
WHAT'S WITH THE SOUR FACE?

39
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,833
HEY, NOW I'VE GOT
A LITTLE QUESTION.

40
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,708
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

41
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,250
- WHAT ARE YOU?
- I AM...

42
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,000
- YEAH, I AM. WHAT?

43
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,750
- I'M TRAINING... TO BECOME
A FLAME, FLAME HAZE.

44
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,000
- ( laughs )

45
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,208
- SO, YOU WANT TO
BE A FLAME HAZE.

46
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,583
PERFECT, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

47
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,833
I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

48
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,833
PREVENTING THE REINSTATEMENT
OF A CONTRACT

49
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,916
IS A GREAT
ACCOMPLISHMENT,

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,708
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S THE
FLAMING-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED ONE.

51
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,416
- IT'S JUST LIKE ALASTOR SAID,

52
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,416
HE'S MANIPULATING THE
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

53
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,333
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO DRAW IT
FROM HUMAN BEINGS.

54
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
SO IS THAT HOW YOU EAT PEOPLE?

55
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,083
- YEAH, THIS IS
HOW I ALWAYS DO IT.

56
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,791
- HE ALWAYS DOES IT.
HE'S THE ENEMY.

57
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
- HMM, WHAT'S THIS?
YOU'RE TREMBLING.

58
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,583
- ( groans )

59
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,208
- GOODBYE. I HOPE YOU HAVE
BETTER LUCK IN YOUR NEXT LIFE.

60
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,250
- ( laughs )

61
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,708
- NOW I SEE. IT'S CLEAR.

62
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,416
THIS IS RIGHT. I'VE MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

63
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,375
I'VE DECIDED TO BECOME
A FLAME HAZE. GOT THAT?

64
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,333
I WILL BE A FLAME HAZE. I WILL.

65
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,791
- NOT IN THIS
LIFETIME YOU WON'T.

66
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,375
- ( screams )

67
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
- INDEED, I SEE I
AM NOT TOO LATE.

68
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,916
- WIRHELMINA.

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,625
- YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT LATER.

70
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,208
INDEED IT'S TIME FOR CHANGES...
FOR EVERYONE.

71
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,000
- PLEASE DON'T BLAME
SHIRO FOR THIS.

72
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,166
IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I DID IT.

73
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,125
- INDEED I'VE NO INTENTION
OF BLAMING HIM

74
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
FOR WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED.

75
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,041
NOW THAT A DENIZEN HAS FOUND IT,

76
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,083
WE CAN NO LONGER LIVE
IN THIS PLACE.

77
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,625
TO STAY AND TO TRY
AND CONTINUE OUR LIVES

78
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,458
AS WE KNEW IT,
WOULD BE POINTLESS.

79
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,958
- DON'T SAY THAT.
I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT.

80
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,541
I WANNA BE A FLAME HAZE.
I DO, I DO.

81
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,125
IT'S ALL I WANT.
MY TRAINING CAN'T BE OVER,

82
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,333
PLEASE WIRHELMINA,
SAY IT ISN'T SO.

83
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,125
- YOU MISUNDERSTAND.
IT SEEMS YOU HAVE INDEED

84
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,250
MISSED THE POINT HERE.

85
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,833
- I HAVE?

86
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,916
- YOUR TRAINING'S OVER BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

87
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,458
- HUH?

88
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,791
- YOU NO LONGER NEED TO TRAIN,
NOR TO LIVE WITHIN THE WALLS

89
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,041
OF THIS PALACE BECAUSE INDEED
YOUR LIFE AS A FLAME HAZE

90
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,416
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

91
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,583
- REALLY?

92
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,583
- ( coughing )

93
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,500
- ( Screams )

94
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,541
- SHIRO.

95
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,958
- INDEED, OTHER ENEMIES FOLLOW.
YOU ARE TO STAY HERE,

96
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,291
AND DO THE BEST YOU
CAN TO HOLD THEM BACK.

97
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
YOU NEED TO BUY US SOME TIME.

98
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,500
- WIRHELMINA.
- WE HAVE TO BE GOING.

99
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,875
- NOT SO FAST.

100
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,791
BASTARD.

101
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,875
- AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT SHIRO?

102
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,166
- NO.

103
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,750
- Shana: UM, WIRHELMINA,
ARE YOU, YOU KNOW...

104
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,375
ARE YOU A FLAME HAZE?

105
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,208
- THAT IS, INDEED, WHAT I AM.

106
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,791
I AM THE FLAME HAZE OF TIAMAT,

107
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,875
THE TIARA OF DREAMS
AND ILLUSIONS.

108
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,750
MY NAME IS WIRHELMINA CARMEL,
THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING.

109
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,875
- Tiamat: GREETINGS.
- HUH?

110
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,000
- THAT'S HER. THAT WAS
THE VOICE OF A DENIZEN OF

111
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,458
THE CRIMSON REALM, TIAMAT.

112
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,541
INDEED, SHE IS NOT WHAT YOU
WOULD CALL THE SOCIABLE TYPE.

113
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,333
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

114
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
- I DID THIS TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOU WOULD

115
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,791
HAVE NO PRECONCEPTIONS.

116
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,833
- I WANTED YOU TO ENVISION
WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE.

117
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,041
AND THEN, INDEED, DEVELOP
THAT VISION IN YOUR OWN HEART.

118
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,166
THOUGH IT SEEMS I DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

119
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,541
- WELL, I GUESS IT WORKED THEN,

120
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,958
BECAUSE I REALLY WANNA
BE A FLAME HAZE.

121
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,958
AREN'T YOU AT LEAST
A LITTLE PROUD OF ME?

122
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,708
- INDEED I CAN'T
THINK OF A MOMENT

123
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,458
WHEN I WASN'T PROUD OF YOU.

124
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,625
- ( sobs ) I CAN FEEL IT. YOU
ARE PROUD OF ME,

125
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,833
AREN'T YOU, WIRHELMINA?

126
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,791
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU.

127
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,458
- THAT IS CORRECT INDEED.

128
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,416
- HUH?
- HUH?

129
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,083
- HUH?

130
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,041
- ( screams )

131
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:14,291
- OH NO, THIS CAN'T BE
HAPPENING. WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

132
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,000
JUST MY LUCK TO HAVE THE
NEMESIS

133
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,250
OF THE ENTIRE CRIMSON
WORLD SHOW UP.

134
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,875
IT'S TENMOKUIKKO.

135
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,375
- Wirhelmina: INDEED, OUR
LATEST GUEST IS TENMOKUIKKO.

136
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,583
- Shana: WHO'S HE?
- THE MOST FEARED MYSTES EVER.

137
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,666
INDEED, THOSE WHO SURVIVE
THE ENCOUNTER CALL HIM

138
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,666
THE MONSTER OF ALL TORCHES.

139
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,791
HE'S NIGH INVINCIBLE,
AND INDEED OVER THE YEARS

140
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,583
HE HAS MADE HIS REPUTATION
SLAUGHTERING

141
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,625
COUNTLESS POWERFUL DENIZENS.

142
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,833
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
TO APPROACH HIM RECKLESSLY.

143
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,416
- Tiamat: DELAYED DEFENSE.
- ROGER THAT.

144
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,583
- Vine: DON'T COME
NEAR ME. DON'T.

145
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,000
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.
STAY BACK!

146
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,750
- ( yells ) STAY BACK.

147
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,583
- EVERYTHING WAS GOING
SO WELL FOR ME.

148
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,416
BUT THEN THIS, WHY?

149
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,291
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HIM.

150
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,666
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

151
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,791
WHAT HAPPENED TO ORGON?

152
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,500
THIS MONSTER MUST HAVE
DEFEATED HIM. NOW I SEE.

153
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,250
HE'S THE ONE WHO'S BEEN KILLING
THE MEMBERS OF THE BALL MASQUE.

154
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,666
LADY BEL PEOL,
PLEASE PROTECT ME.

155
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,333
- Shana: HOW DID HE GET HERE?

156
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,125
- Wirhelmina: I THINK
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

157
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,833
HE WAS ABLE TO FIND US.

158
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,500
INDEED THE PALACE MUST
HAVE BEEN REVEALED

159
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,833
WHEN THE RAINBOW SKY SWORD

160
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,208
DESTROYED THE OUTER SHELL.

161
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,375
- WAS THE RAINBOW SKY SWORD,
THE RAINBOW SHIRO PULLED OUT?

162
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,291
- WAIT, WHERE'S SHIRO?
- HE'S DOING JUST FINE.

163
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,958
HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

164
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,458
- BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGES,
SO HE'S KEEPING STILL.

165
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,708
- HE'S NOT DEAD?

166
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,000
- HIS LIFE IS BOUND BY
A SOLEMN OATH.

167
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,416
THEREFORE IT IS INDEED
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM

168
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,791
TO DIE BEFORE THE
VOW IS FULFILLED.

169
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:32,500
- WHY IS TENMOKUIKKO TAKING SO
LONG TO FINISH OFF THAT DENIZEN?

170
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,208
- I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE
HE HAS SENSED

171
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,208
THE PRESENCE OF A MUCH
GREATER TARGET.

172
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,208
- THE FLAME OF HEAVEN.
- Tiamat: AGREED.

173
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,916
- HE WANTS TO FIGHT ALASTOR,

174
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,958
BECAUSE HE'S THE
STRONGEST DENIZEN HERE.

175
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,166
- Wirhelmina: I WILL KEEP
THAT OTHER DENIZEN AT BAY,

176
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,708
AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT
FOLLOW, FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

177
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:02,958
- SO I CAN MAKE A CONTRACT
WITH, WITH ALASTOR.

178
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,500
- IF BOTH OF YOU ARE
IN AGREEMENT,

179
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,666
THE CONTRACT WILL BE ENACTED
INSTANTANEOUSLY.

180
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,000
AFTER THAT, ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW

181
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
THE FLAME OF HEAVEN'S
INSTRUCTIONS.

182
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,875
THEN YOU WILL EMBARK ON
YOUR MISSION AS A FLAME HAZE.

183
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,875
RIGHT NOW THE MAIN PROBLEM
ISN'T YOUR DETERMINATION,

184
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,125
BUT IT'S WHETHER OR NOT I CAN
HOLD THEM BACK LONG ENOUGH

185
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,250
FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY
REACH THAT STAGE.

186
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,083
- CAN YOU DEAL WITH
THAT DENIZEN ALONE?

187
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,125
- I SURMISE FROM THE AMOUNT
OF ENERGY HE EMITS THAT

188
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,666
THE ODDS OF VICTORY
ARE INDEED IN MY FAVOR.

189
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,166
- AGREED.

190
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,833
- TELL ME ABOUT TENMOKUIKKO.
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

191
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,416
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

192
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,125
IF I MAKE A WRONG MOVE,
HE'LL SPLIT ME IN TWO.

193
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,958
- Wirhelmina: TENMOKUIKKO.

194
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,125
- THE FOOL. THAT'S SUICIDE.
WHAT THE...

195
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,083
SOMEHOW THAT LITTLE GIRL
KNOWS HE NEVER ATTACKS HUMANS.

196
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,250
- Shana: TENMOKUIKKO,
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

197
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,333
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DUEL WITH
A REAL FLAME HAZE,

198
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,833
THEN YOU MUST ACT AS MY ESCORT.

199
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,625
IF YOU AGREE, THEN I SWEAR
I WILL ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE

200
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,291
AND FIGHT YOU AS THE FLAME-
HAIRED BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

201
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,875
- FLAMING-HAIR BLAZING-EYES.
- YES.

202
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,458
- YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL
TO BECOME A MIGHTY WARRIOR.

203
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,125
I WILL FIGHT YOU.

204
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,416
- I WON'T LET YOU.

205
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,458
- INDEED, I AM TO
BE YOUR OPPONENT.

206
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,000
- ( groans )

207
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,125
- SO BE IT.

208
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,708
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU...

209
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:44,083
- I'LL KILL YOU. I SHALL SLAY
EVERYONE WHO DARE TO INSULT ME.

210
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,000
EVERYONE SHALL DIE.

211
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,333
- Alastor: IT IS HERE.
THE TIME HAS COME.

212
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,458
- WHEN YOU ENTER INTO
THE CONTRACT,

213
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,958
I WANT YOU TO SHOW THE
FLAME OF HEAVEN

214
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,500
THE FEELINGS YOU HAVE
HIDDEN AWAY IN YOUR HEART.

215
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,208
- I UNDERSTAND.

216
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,708
I HAVE DECIDED THAT TODAY
I WILL ACCEPT EVERYTHING

217
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,958
AND ANYTHING THAT I SEE.

218
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,416
I WILL REVEAL MY HIDDEN
FEELINGS AND HOLD NOTHING BACK,

219
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,583
BECAUSE IF I HAVE TO SHOW THEM
TO ANYONE, IT SHOULD BE ALASTOR.

220
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,416
- Wirhelmina: YES.

221
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,291
- LET'S GO.

222
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,250
- WHEN YOU'RE THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER,

223
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,958
THE GLITTERING FLAMES
WILL LOOK GOOD ON YOU INDEED.

224
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,625
- HURRY UP.

225
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,625
THE FASTER YOU MOVE, THE SOONER
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR DUEL.

226
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,125
- FLAME HAZES ARE INDEED
BY NATURE A RATHER SINFUL LOT.

227
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,875
HESITATION AND MERCY
ARE UNNECESSARY.

228
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,625
- PERSONA GOD VESSEL.
- Tiamat: UNDERSTOOD.

229
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,666
- NO DEFECTS.
- Tiamat: CHECKED.

230
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,875
- YOU ARE THE
SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING.

231
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,750
- INDEED, I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED
TO FACE YOU IN BATTLE.

232
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,083
- Tiamat: COMMENCE.

233
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,416
- Alastor: LET US BEGIN.

234
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,208
- Shana: THIS WILL
ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.

235
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,958
- ( screams )

236
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,583
- Alastor: HURRY
WITH THE CONTRACT.

237
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,625
- WIRHELMINA TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT I'VE BEEN HIDING FROM YOU.

238
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,750
- HMM?

239
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,375
- YOU'RE KEEPING SECRETS
FROM ME, TOO.

240
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,291
- MY HUNTER IS DESTINED
TO CARRY A HIDDEN TREASURE,

241
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,666
THE TENPAJYOSAI.

242
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,750
- AND THE FLAME HAZE THAT
USES IT, IS DESTROYED BY IT.

243
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,708
- GOODBYE.

244
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,333
MAY YOUR FLAMES LAST
FOR ETERNITY AND NEVER DIM.

245
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,500
I LOVE YOU ALASTOR,
FLAME OF HEAVEN.

246
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,083
- Alastor: IF NECESSARY,

247
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,250
MY CONTRACTOR IS TO USE
THE SECRET METHOD

248
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,625
TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION.

249
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,916
YOU WOULD HAVE WALKED
ANOTHER PATH IN LIFE,

250
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,708
YET WE HAVE BOUND
YOU TO THIS DESTINY,

251
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,125
WITH NOTHING BUT OUR LOVE.

252
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,958
- I KNOW. I LOVE YOU TOO.
I LOVE ALL OF YOU.

253
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,250
YOU NEVER WANTED
TO USE IT, DID YOU?

254
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,250
THAT METHOD WAS A LAST RESORT.

255
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,416
WHEN YOU TALK OF THE
PREVIOUS FLAMING-HAIRED

256
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,750
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER,

257
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,166
YOU SOUND SO HAPPY...
AND SAD AT THE SAME TIME.

258
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,166
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TELLING ME ABOUT IT,

259
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,875
BUT IT'S FINE. I'VE DECIDED
THAT THIS IS RIGHT FOR ME.

260
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,041
THIS IS MY PATH. I WILL
CARRY OUT MY MISSION,

261
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,666
EVEN AT THE COST OF MY LIFE.

262
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,000
THAT IS WHAT FLAME HAZES DO.

263
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,166
THE FEELINGS I HAVE BEEN HIDING
ARE FROM BEFORE.

264
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,916
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THESE
DOUBTS ABOUT THIS

265
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,750
GREAT CAUSE IN WHICH FLAME HAZES

266
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,958
DO BATTLE WITH CRIMSON
DENIZENS TO MAINTAIN

267
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,500
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD.

268
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,791
- Alastor: I SEE.

269
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,958
- Shana: IT MAY BE OR
MAY NOT BE TRUE

270
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,625
BUT THE ONLY WAY I'LL
KNOW FOR SURE IS IF

271
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,250
I FIND OUT ON MY OWN.

272
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,166
I'M SORRY ALASTOR.
I KNOW I'M BEING DIFFICULT.

273
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,458
I KNOW YOU CARE BUT NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE ME

274
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,041
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I LOVE EVERYONE ELSE IN RETURN,

275
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,833
IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
THIS, THEN I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

276
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,583
HE'S GETTING IN THE WAY.
KILL HIM.

277
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,916
- ( screams )

278
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:10,208
- OH MAGNIFICENT CRIMSON LORD,
FLAME OF HEAVEN, ALASTOR,

279
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,000
I RESPECT YOUR WILL.

280
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,625
BE INCARNATED USING MY
BODY AS YOUR VESSEL.

281
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,625
TOGETHER WE SHALL CARRY OUT
THE MISSION OF THE FLAME HAZES

282
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,875
UNTIL THE DAY WE FALL.

283
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:32,375
ALASTOR, THIS IS YOU.
YOUR FLAMES ARE SO HOT.

284
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,750
YOU, YOU ARE THE
FLAME OF HEAVEN.

285
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,041
- Alastor: CHOOSE
YOUR GOD VESSEL.

286
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,875
- A PENDANT,

287
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,083
SO THAT YOU WILL BE LIKE A
CLEAR AND UNCLOUDED EYE

288
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,458
WATCHING OVER US.

289
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,541
- Alastor: HMM.

290
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,250
I WELCOME YOUR ARRIVAL TO
THE SCENE OF CARNAGE,

291
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,625
TO THE GARDENS OF BATTLE,
MY FLAME HAZE.

292
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,416
- YOU ARE WELCOME IN ME,
ALASTOR, THE FLAME OF HEAVEN,

293
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,541
FOR I AM NOW A FLAME HAZE.

294
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,500
FLAMING HAIR AND BLAZING EYES.

295
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,416
- ( theme song playing )

296
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

297
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,625
- Yuji: IT WAS A PROMISE
FROM A DAY LONG, LONG AGO

298
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,583
BETWEEN THOSE HOLDING THE FLAME

299
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,500
AND THE GIRL WHO WAS
ABOUT TO RECEIVE IT.

300
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,750
THEN, THE END OF
THE BEGINNING ARRIVES.

301
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:07,958
NEXT EPISODE,

302
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,250
"THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER."
