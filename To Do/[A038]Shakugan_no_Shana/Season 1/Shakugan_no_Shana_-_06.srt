1
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,750
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,208
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,208
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,625
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,125
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,750
- Yuji: A CRIMSON DENIZEN
CALLING HIMSELF LAMIES

8
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,083
APPEARS BEFORE ME AND TELLS ME
SOMETHING DISTURBING.

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,333
HE EXPLAINS THAT FRIAGNE
IS ON THE VERGE

10
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,250
OF CARRYING OUT A HORRIFYING
PLAN TO DEVOUR THE ENTIRE CITY.

11
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,708
MY MOTHER, IKE,
YOSHIDA,

12
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,625
EVERYONE WILL SIMPLY VANISH
FROM THE WORLD.

13
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,500
I WAS SHOCKED, BUT I KNEW
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,166
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IN THE MEANTIME,

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,666
SHANA WAS BEING FORCED
TO MAKE A DECISION...

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,875
ABOUT ME.

17
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,375
- ALASTOR,
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

18
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,333
- Alastor: I SAID WE HAVE
TO DESTROY THE MYSTES.

19
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,208
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS,

20
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,916
WE'VE BEEN DISTRACTED
BY IT FOR NO GOOD REASON.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,833
- BUT-- BUT WE'RE USING IT
AS BAIT TO FRIAGNE DRAW OUT.

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,666
- Alastor: RIGHT NOW HE'S DOING
US MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

23
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,125
- Yuji: MY MOM AND MY FRIENDS
ARE GONNA DISAPPEAR?

24
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,208
- NOT ONLY PEOPLE.

25
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,458
AS THE WORD "DEVOUR" IMPLIES,
HE WILL CONSUME THE ENTIRE CITY

26
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,166
AND CHANGE IT TO POWER
OF EXISTENCE.

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,583
- I WON'T LET HIM.

28
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,291
IT'S HORRIBLE.
I WON'T LET HIM DO IT.

29
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,875
- IN THAT CASE,
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS NECESSARY.

30
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,541
- HMM.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
- HMM.

32
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,166
- YOSHIDA, I'M SORRY.

33
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,750
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL TOMORROW,
OKAY?

34
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,250
- ( gasps )
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

35
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,458
- BUT SAKAI--

36
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,958
- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

37
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,000
HE'S GONE TO DO SOMETHING
THAT ONLY HE

38
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,708
IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED FOR.

39
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,625
IT MAY NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH IN
THE GREATER SCHEME OF THINGS,

40
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,958
BUT AT LEAST IT WILL PROVE
THAT HE DID HIS BEST

41
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,500
WITH THE TIME HE HAD.

42
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,375
- SHANA--
I HAVE TO LET HER KNOW.

43
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,875
HMM?

44
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:55,166
- ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO PUT
THE PLAN INTO MOTION, MASTER?

45
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,916
- YES, I AM,
MY ADORABLE MARIANNE.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,291
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BUT THAT TORCH-EATING

47
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,791
CORPSE COLLECTOR IS HERE.

48
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,708
THE SITUATION
IS BECOMING SERIOUS.

49
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,541
- BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO START
THE CITY DEVOURING

50
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,833
FOR A WHILE YET.

51
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,916
IF A FLAME HAZE
WERE TO ATTACK IN THE MEANTIME,

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,125
YOU'D BE IN GREAT DANGER,
MASTER.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,833
- THERE THERE.

54
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,583
I'M TOUCHED BY YOUR KINDNESS
AND CONCERN, MY DEAR MARIANNE.

55
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,583
BUT NOT TO WORRY, I HAVE
ALREADY TAKEN PRECAUTIONS.

56
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,458
WHEN I BEGIN
THE ACTUAL CITY DEVOURING,

57
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,041
I WILL DIVERT ATTENTION
FROM IT BY ENGAGING IN A BATTLE

58
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,041
WITH THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED LITTLE GIRL.

59
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,791
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
WILL USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY

60
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,541
TO GO AFTER HER OWN PREY,
THE CORPSE COLLECTOR.

61
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,458
ONCE SHE'S OUT OF THE PICTURE,

62
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,250
WE'LL KEEP
THE LITTLE ONE BUSY

63
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,750
AND WAIT FOR TIME TO PASS.
- MMM.

64
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,000
- AS LONG AS I KEEP
RINGING THIS BELL,

65
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,250
THE STRING KEYS
IN ALL OF THE TORCHES

66
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,500
THROUGHOUT THE CITY
WILL BE TIED TOGETHER.

67
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,125
MARIANNE,
WITH THE POWER WE OBTAIN,

68
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,958
YOU WILL EXIST FOREVER.

69
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,291
AND WE WILL KNOW
ETERNAL LIFE TOGETHER.

70
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,458
- OH, MASTER.

71
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,916
- NOW LET US BEGIN
THE CEREMONY.

72
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,791
- ( ringing )

73
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,291
- Alastor: IF THIS INFORMATION
COMES FROM LAMIES,

74
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,250
THEN I BELIEVE
IT'S MOST LIKELY TRUE.

75
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,666
IT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE
UNUSUAL NUMBER

76
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,125
OF TORCHES IN THE CITY.

77
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,666
- SHANA, LET ME BE A DECOY.

78
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,625
WOULDN'T THAT
DRAW OUT FRIAGNE?

79
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,625
WHAT'S WRONG?

80
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,541
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM QUICKLY!

81
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,625
MY MOM AND FRIENDS
ARE IN DANGER!

82
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,083
WHY WON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?!

83
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,833
WHAT IS IT?

84
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,875
OH, I GET IT, YOU CAN'T HELP ME
OR TALK TO ME

85
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,500
BECAUSE I'M NOTHING
BUT A TORCH TO YOU.

86
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,750
- OH, YU-CHAN.
- UH.

87
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,375
UH, HI, MOM.
- HELLO THERE.

88
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,375
SO WHO'S YOUR FRIEND.
- SHE'S, UM...

89
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,333
SHANA.
SHE'S ONLY A CLASSMATE.

90
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,416
- OH.
MAY I CALL YOU SHANA-CHAN?

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
WELL, YOU TWO
HAVE A GOOD TIME NOW.

92
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,833
- MOM, DON'T CALL HER THAT.
- WHY NOT?  WHAT'S WRONG?

93
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,500
OH, BY THE WAY, I'M MAKING YOUR
FAVORITE FOR SUPPER TONIGHT--

94
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,666
OMELET RICE--
SO DON'T BE LATE.

95
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
IT WAS VERY NICE
MEETING YOU SHANA-CHAN.

96
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,791
- Shana: ONLY A CLASSMATE?

97
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,625
I'M ONLY A FLAME HAZE,
NOTHING MORE.

98
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,083
IN A WAY, I'M THE SAME
AS A TORCH.

99
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,500
- WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING
"ONLY"? JUST STOP IT.

100
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,041
- THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.

101
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,833
- UM, LET'S GET BACK
TO OUR CONVERSATION.

102
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,875
- HE'S DISGUSTING.

103
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,291
HE MAKES ME LOSE FOCUS
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

104
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,583
- SHANA?
ARE YOU LISTENING?

105
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,583
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

106
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,791
- A SEAL?

107
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,666
SHANA?

108
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,125
- I WANT YOU TO STOP
CALLING ME THAT!

109
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,375
- WHY?
GIVE ME A REASON.

110
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,000
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

111
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,458
I TOLD YOU,
I'M ONLY A FLAME HAZE.

112
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,416
DAMN YOU.

113
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,416
DAMN YOU!
- AH!

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,666
- DAMN YOU!

115
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,375
- HUH?

116
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,208
- HUH?
- ( power surging )

117
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,875
- IT'S FRIAGNE.

118
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,375
- SHANA.  WHY?

119
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,458
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO COME TO ME.

120
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,458
SAVES ME THE HASSLE
OF FINDING YOU.

121
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,125
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

122
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,708
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS SAY THANKS, LITTLE GIRL.

123
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,458
AH, DECIDED TO SHOW UP
WITHOUT YOUR PET MYSTES?

124
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,125
- WHY DON'T WE CUT
THE CHIT-CHAT?

125
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,000
- ( chuckles )
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

126
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,458
SHALL WE GET STARTED THEN?

127
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,166
- ( ringing )

128
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,875
- AAH!

129
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,041
- COME, LITTLE GIRL.

130
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,958
COME TO ME NOW.

131
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,041
- ( grunting )

132
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,916
- SHE'S FIGHTING FRIAGNE NOW.

133
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,375
I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO LEAVE THE REST TO HER.

134
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,041
I REALLY WANNA HELP HER,
BUT I CAN'T.

135
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,791
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

136
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,333
- Lamies: CAN YOU SAY
WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE

137
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,875
THAT YOU ARE
THE REAL YUJI SAKAI?

138
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,250
ARE YOU REALLY SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU ARE?

139
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,083
THE WAY YOU ARE NOW?

140
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,416
YOU APPEAR TO BE NOTHING MORE
THAN A TORCH TO ME.

141
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,875
- ( panting )

142
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,291
- ( chuckling )

143
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,041
DO YOU LIKE THIS TREASURE?

144
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,541
IT'S THE SIMPLE,
YET EFFECTIVE, BUBBLE ROOT.

145
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,375
HOWEVER IMPRESSIVE YOUR SWORD
MIGHT BE,

146
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,166
I VERY MUCH DOUBT
IT CAN BREAK THESE LINKS.

147
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,208
- FINE THEN.
I'LL CUT YOU INSTEAD!

148
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,500
- SHANA, JUMP BACK!

149
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,000
- ( grunting )

150
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,041
HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

151
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,791
- ( grunts )

152
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,666
- WELL WELL,
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

153
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,000
I'D THINK YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME
TO TAKE THIS TREASURE FROM YOU.

154
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,083
I WONDER WHAT IT IS.

155
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,125
- AAH!

156
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,791
- OH, HOW AMAZING--

157
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,250
A FLAME HAZE ACTUALLY
STOPPING HER SWORD IN MID-SWING.

158
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,250
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO COME AFTER ME

159
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,791
IF YOU WANT TO GET
THIS MYSTES BACK.

160
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,416
I WILL PREPARE THE STAGE
FOR A FITTING FINALE.

161
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,250
- ( bell ringing )

162
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,833
- ( Friagne chuckling )

163
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,625
- HMM. WHEN YOU SAID
YOU HAD A PLACE IN MIND,

164
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,250
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT KEISAKU'S HOUSE?

165
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,250
- YEAH.
IT'S A LONG STORY,

166
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,791
BUT THE POINT IS, HE LIVES
IN THIS HUGE HOUSE BY HIMSELF.

167
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,250
- WELL,
SO YOU'RE A SILVER-SPOON KID.

168
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,625
MUST BE NICE.
- ( chuckles )

169
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,583
- Marco: YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE YOU AIN'T GOT A HOME!

170
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,375
- QUIET!
- OH!

171
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,750
- BUT DON'T YOU FIND IT
HARD LIVING ALONE?

172
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,750
I MEAN, DEALING WITH YOUR
PARENTS AND YOUR REPUTATION.

173
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,708
- IT'S COOL.
MY PARENTS DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

174
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,916
IT'S NOT AS IF MY REPUTATION
CAN GET ANY WORSE.

175
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,125
- I SEE.

176
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,750
- WHOA, AWESOME.
WHAT IS IT?

177
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,958
- Sato: IT'S A MAP OF MISAKI.

178
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,500
- I'VE COVERED THE CITY WITH AN
UNRESTRICTED METHOD NET.

179
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,833
WITH THIS MAP,
IF LAMIES TRIES TO GET AWAY,

180
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,583
I'LL SENSE HIM IMMEDIATELY.

181
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,083
ENOUGH TALK.
GET ME A DRINK.

182
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,458
- AH!
YES, MA'AM, RIGHT AWAY.

183
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,916
- ( distant creaking )

184
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,125
- ( distant explosions )
- HUH?

185
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,708
- THE LITTLE GIRL'S LATE,
ISN'T SHE?

186
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,708
I DO HOPE SHE WASN'T BLOWN APART
IN THE LAST EXPLOSION.

187
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,416
- SHE'LL COME.
SHANA'S A FLAME HAZE.

188
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,791
SHE'LL SHOW UP,
AND SHE'LL BEAT YOU!

189
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,708
- FOR YOUR SAKE?

190
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,666
- I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

191
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,291
- POOR FLAME HAZES,
I DO PITY THEM.

192
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,000
MANACLED TO THEIR MISSIONS,
FETED TO THEIR CRIMSON LORDS,

193
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,625
THEY WILL NEVER ESCAPE.

194
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,833
SUCH A POINTLESS EXISTENCE
DESERVES MY SYMPATHY.

195
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,416
- Shana: AW, THAT'S NICE,

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,708
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
ASKING FOR YOUR SYMPATHY.

197
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,250
- SHANA, YOU'RE HERE.

198
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,333
- PREPARE YOURSELF.
YOUR TIME HAS COME.

199
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,458
- ( ringing )

200
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,041
- AAH!

201
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,458
- SHANA!

202
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,625
- ( ringing )
- AAH!

203
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,291
- Alastor: NO, DON'T! HEAD-ON
ATTACKS WON'T WORK AGAINST HIM.

204
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,541
- AAH!  UH.

205
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,875
- Yuji: THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP HER.

206
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,791
- ARE YOU REALLY SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU ARE?

207
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,625
- BUT I'M--

208
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:24,625
SHANA'S FIGHTING.
I JUST FEEL SO HELPLESS.

209
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,083
NO, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,958
SHANA, BEHIND YOU,
KICK IT!

211
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,375
( laughs )
- WHAT? 

212
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,083
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND
OF GAME WE'RE PLAYING.

213
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,958
- Yuji: IF I CONCENTRATE,

214
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,750
I CAN SEE A PATTERN
TO THE BALLS OF LIGHT.

215
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,958
I HAVE TO TELL HER.

216
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
SHANA!  BEHIND YOU!
- SHUT UP!

217
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,791
- ABOVE YOU!
- SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

218
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,791
WHAT'S GOING ON?

219
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,666
MY BODY'S RESPONDING
AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL HOT.

220
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,791
- Alastor: THE INTENSITY
OF YOUR FLAME HAS INCREASED.

221
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,583
- Marianne: MASTER, PLEASE,
I THINK WE SHOULD STOP.

222
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,541
SHE'S GETTING STRONGER.

223
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,083
- YES, I FEEL IT TOO,
MARIANNE.

224
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,666
BUT WE MUST SEE THIS UNDERTAKING
THROUGH TO THE END.

225
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,541
WE CAN'T GIVE UP ON MY PLAN
FOR US NOW,

226
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,541
NOT WHEN WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO OBTAINING ETERNITY.

227
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,291
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

228
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,000
THE CITY DEVOURING
WILL COMMENCE SHORTLY.

229
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,250
WE HAVE TO PERSEVERE
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

230
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,875
- ( ringing )

231
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,083
( ringing continues )

232
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,583
- MARCOSIAS, LOOK.
- Marco: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!

233
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,625
THAT BASTARD WITH THE THING
FOR DOLLS IS UP TO SOMETHING.

234
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,250
- IF HE KEEPS THAT UP,
I'LL NEVER FIND LAMIES,

235
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,041
EVEN WITH THE NET
I'VE THROWN OVER THE CITY.

236
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,625
- ( Marco laughing )
WANNA CRASH HIS PARTY?

237
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,291
- HMM.

238
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,375
- ( ringing )

239
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,125
- ( laughing )

240
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,416
WE'RE SO CLOSE.
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

241
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,083
MY UNRESTRICTED METHOD
WILL BE COMPLETE ANY MOMENT NOW.

242
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,708
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

243
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,041
- MASTER.

244
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,416
I PRAY FOR YOUR SAFETY,
MASTER.

245
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
PREPARE TO DIE, FLAME HAZE!

246
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,041
- ( screaming )

247
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,166
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
MY PRECIOUS DARLING MARIANNE.

248
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,708
SOON ALL OUR WISHES
WILL COME TRUE.

249
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,333
- ( ringing )

250
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,250
- THAT'S STRANGE. THOSE BIG
BALLS OF LIGHT ARE GONE,

251
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,166
BUT HE'S STILL RINGING
THE BELL.

252
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,750
AND WHY DID HE LURE SHANA
TO THIS ROOF

253
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,041
IF THERE'S NOTHING UP HERE?

254
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,458
MAYBE-- ( gasps )
MAYBE HE BROUGHT HER UP HERE

255
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,291
JUST TO KEEP HER DISTRACTED.

256
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,708
THAT MUST MEAN HE'S READY
TO START CONSUMING THE CITY.

257
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,458
- EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.
THE LONG-AWAITED CITY DEVOURING

258
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,250
THAT WE HAVE PRAYED FOR
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

259
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,208
- ( ringing )

260
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,166
- BUT BEFORE IT STARTS,
LET'S GET RID OF HER.

261
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,583
WHEN A MERE TOOL FOR DESTRUCTION
DARES TO DEFY US,

262
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,833
THEY MUST BE PUNISHED.

263
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,833
- SHANA!
- STAY BACK!

264
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

265
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,041
I THINK I'LL USE YOUR POWER
TO OPERATE THE TRIGGER HAPPY.

266
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,000
- ( gasps )
AAH!

267
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,500
- DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T DRAIN YOU COMPLETELY.

268
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,958
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS THE CITY DEVOURING.

269
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,166
- SHANA.

270
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,166
- THIS SHOT WILL SIGNAL
THE BEGINNING OF

271
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,791
OUR ETERNITY TOGETHER, MARIANNE.

272
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,708
- Yuji: DON'T DO IT.
WAKE UP, SHANA.  WAKE UP.

273
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,458
- NOW GOOD-BYE, LITTLE GIRL.

274
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,625
AND FAREWELL TO THE CITY
THAT GAVE US ETERNITY.

275
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,583
- SHANA!

276
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,500
- AAH!

277
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,041
( panting )

278
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,458
IT'S NOT OVER.

279
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,916
THE CEREMONY FOR OUR LIFE OF
NEVER-ENDING BLISS ISN'T OVER.

280
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,375
IT ISN'T OVER!

281
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,083
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

282
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,833
HOW LONG WERE YOU
GONNA STRETCH THIS OUT FOR?

283
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,583
( blows )

284
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,583
- LOOK AT IT, MARIANNE.

285
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,333
OUR PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.

286
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,166
WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER NOW,
FOREVER.

287
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
AAH!

288
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,541
- AAH!

289
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,875
- AH! ( grunts )

290
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,833
MARIANNE,
WE'LL BE TOGETHER...

291
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,833
FOREVER.

292
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,333
- Yuji: WE WON.

293
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,333
- AT THE END,
IT WAS YOUR VOICE

294
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,750
THAT GAVE ME THE STRENGTH
I NEEDED.

295
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,250
- WELL, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
I COULD BE OF SOME HELP.

296
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,791
MOST OF MY EXISTENCE
HAS BEEN DRAINED.

297
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,708
I GUESS I'M GONNA DISAPPEAR
PRETTY SOON.

298
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,875
I WANTED TO HELP,
EVEN THOUGH I'M ONLY A TORCH.

299
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,541
- DON'T SAY "ONLY."
YOU'RE YUJI SAKAI.

300
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:02,416
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.
- BUT I'M SORRY.

301
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,875
YESTERDAY YOU LOST
BECAUSE OF ME, DIDN'T YOU?

302
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,833
THAT'S WHY YOU TRIED
TO CUT ME.

303
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,583
- IT WASN'T YOU.
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

304
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,458
- REALLY?
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

305
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,916
AT LEAST WHAT I DID WHILE
I WAS HERE HAD SOME MEANING.

306
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,208
TAKE CARE NOW, SHANA.

307
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,833
- ( bell tolling )

308
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,750
- ( gasps )
WHAT?

309
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,708
WHAT THE--
WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME?

310
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,125
- Alastor:
I'D SAY THAT CONFIRMS IT.

311
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,416
- HUH?

312
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
- THAT'S THE POWER OF THE
TREASURE INSIDE YOU,

313
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,375
THE MOST VALUABLE
IN ALL THE CRIMSON WORLD.

314
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,208
IT'S CALLED
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

315
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,791
AT THE FIRST STROKE
OF MIDNIGHT,

316
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:55,208
WHATEVER EXISTENCE YOU'VE LOST
DURING THE DAY FULLY RESTORED.

317
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,708
- SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

318
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,500
IT MEANS YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE
AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

319
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,708
- WELL,
AM I INTERRUPTING ANYTHING?

320
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,166
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ME THANK YOU, ARE YOU?

321
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,125
- DON'T BOTHER.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING

322
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,416
TO BRING THAT STUPID FIGHT
TO AN END.

323
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,416
OH MY, DID I UPSET YOU?

324
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,958
- SOMEDAY YOU AND I ARE GONNA
SETTLE THIS, ONCE AND FOR ALL.

325
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,666
- HMM.

326
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:29,041
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

327
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,458
- Yuji: DRIVEN BY HER HATRED
FOR ALL DENIZENS,

328
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,291
MARGERY DAW
RENEWS HER PURSUIT OF LAMIES.

329
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,208
ANOTHER CONFRONTATION
TURNS VIOLENT

330
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,041
WHEN SHANA GETS IN HER WAY.

331
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,000
NEXT EPISODE...
