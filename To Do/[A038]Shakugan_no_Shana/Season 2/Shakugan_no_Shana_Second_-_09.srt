00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,541
- Announcer:
IN 20th CENTURY NEW YORK,

2
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,958
MARGERY MET A YOUNG FLAME HAZE
BY THE NAME OF YURI.

3
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,916
THOUGH HE FOLLOWED
THE FLAME HAZE MISSION,

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,333
HE WAS PREOCCUPIED
WITH SAVING HUMAN LIVES.

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,125
MARGERY HAD NO PATIENCE
FOR THE BOY'S NAIVETE.

6
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,958
SHE LEFT HIM BEHIND
AS SHE WENT IN SEARCH

7
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,875
OF THE CRIMSON DENIZEN ANNABERG.

8
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,500
- ( theme music playing )

9
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,500
- Alastor:
LISTEN CLOSELY, YUJI SAKAI.

11
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,958
THROUGH YOUR TRAINING,
YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL

12
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,958
YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

13
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,500
ARE YOU READY TO MOVE ON TO
CASTING AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL?

14
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,250
- UH, SURE.

15
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,041
- WHAT'S WRONG?

16
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,666
- WELL, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

17
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,250
I'M GLAD ALL OF MY HARD WORK
IS PAYING OFF

18
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,166
AND I'D LIKE TO THINK I'M READY
TO MOVE FORWARD,

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
BUT IT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS.

20
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,041
I MEAN, WHAT IF I SCREW
EVERYTHING UP?

21
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,666
- YOU CAN DO IT.

22
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH
IN YOU, YUJI.

23
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,708
- ( sighs )

24
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,875
- Margery:
CAST A SEAL!

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,958
- MARCOSIAS, THE CLAWS
AND FANGS OF VIOLATION.

26
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,166
AND MARGERY DAW,
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

27
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,791
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

28
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,708
I'M HONORED YOU'RE HERE
TO OBSERVE MY WORK.

29
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,291
- I CAN TELL BY THAT COCKY
ATTITUDE OF YOURS

30
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,041
THAT YOU'RE NOT WORKING
ALONE.

31
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,791
CARE TO TELL US
WHO YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU?

32
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,708
- Marcosias: THE MORE
THE MERRIER, I ALWAYS SAY!

33
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,875
NOW LET'S GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD! ( laughs )

34
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,833
- Valac: THE BATTLE HAS BEGUN.
- YEAH.

35
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,083
- YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE
SHARED YOUR STORY...

36
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,041
NOT WITH
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

37
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,000
ALL THAT NONSENSE ABOUT

38
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,041
WANTING TO SAVE
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

39
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
IT'S NO WONDER SHE REJECTED
YOUR NAIVE VIEW

40
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,708
OF THE FLAME HAZE MISSION.

41
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,625
- YEAH. I FIGURED SHE WOULD.

42
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,458
I EXPECTED IT.

43
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,625
EVEN SO, IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT NEEDED TO BE SAID.

44
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,541
WHAT I WANT.  IT ISN'T WRONG.

45
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,500
- Tanaka: I GUESS I MUST'VE
MISSED SOMETHING

46
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,916
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,750
THIS YURI KID.

48
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,291
HE WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE,
RIGHT, TO SAVE LIVES?

49
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,333
HOW IS THAT WRONG?

50
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,208
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
IF YOU BOYS WERE FLAME HAZE

51
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,375
AND YOU KNEW MY LIFE
WAS IN DANGER,

52
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,666
BUT I HAD ORDERED YOU NOT
TO FOLLOW ME INTO BATTLE.

53
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,583
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

54
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,208
- WE'D TRY TO SAVE YOU.
RIGHT, DUDE?

55
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,333
- PATHETIC.  HONESTLY.

56
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,333
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.
FLAME HAZE.

57
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,083
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT'VE RETAINED
A SHRED OF THE HUMANITY

58
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,791
YOU ONCE POSSESSED.
IT SEEMS I WAS WRONG.

59
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,750
- YOU TALK TOO MUCH!

60
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,291
- Marcosias:
WE'RE SENDING YOU TO HELL!

61
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,875
- YOU'RE A SOULLESS CREATURE,
DRIVEN BY YOUR MURDEROUS RAGE.

62
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,208
- THERE'S SOMETHING ODD
ABOUT HIS PRESENCE.

63
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,833
- Marcosias: I FEEL IT TOO.
HE'S GOT A TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE.

64
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,625
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS.

65
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,708
- I SPECIALIZE
IN THE MANIPULATION OF STEAM

66
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,125
AND THE ART OF CONCEALMENT.

67
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,541
MY CLOUDS OF VAPOR CAN
HIDE ALMOST ANYTHING.

68
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,416
EVEN A PRESENCE.

69
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,666
- Margery:
I KNEW HE WAS UP TO SOMETHING.

70
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,333
- Marcosias:
TALK ABOUT A DIRTY TRICK.

71
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,083
- BUT A PRETTY FACE LIKE MINE
CAN'T STAY HIDDEN.

72
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,333
- IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
SURPRISE ME THAT EASILY,

73
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,791
YOU'RE IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

74
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,500
- Valac: IT'S NOT A MATTER
OF RIGHT OR WRONG.

75
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,083
- Yuri: HELPING THOSE IN NEED.
SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES.

76
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,083
I HONESTLY BELIEVE 
THAT IS MY DESTINY.

77
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
IT IS MY PURPOSE
AS A FLAME HAZE.

78
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:47,125
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES IS OUT
THERE FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE.

79
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,958
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HELP HER.

80
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,708
- YOUR PURPOSE IS HUNTING
CRIMSON DENIZENS,

81
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,166
NOT SAVING LIVES.

82
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,500
HELPING OTHERS IS
NOT YOUR OBJECTIVE.

83
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,666
IT'S MERELY A BY-PRODUCT.

84
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,708
HOWEVER, THIS PARTICULAR
SITUATION MAY LEND ITSELF

85
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,041
TO DOING THINGS YOUR WAY.
- REALLY, DO YOU MEAN IT, VALAC?

86
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,625
- YOU HAD BETTER HURRY
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

87
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,250
- PUNCH AND JUDY FOUGHT
FOR A PIE.

88
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
- PUNCH GAVE JUDY A BLOW
IN THE EYE.

89
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,166
- WHAT THE--?
- THAT'S NO STANDARD ELEGY.

90
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,041
- THANKS FOR MAKING OUR JOB
EASY, THOUSAND CHANGES.

91
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,125
- HE WAS EVEN NICE ENOUGH
TO DIG HIS OWN GRAVE.

92
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,875
( laughing )

93
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,833
- Annaberg: I WOULD
HAVE PREFERRED YOU HAD

94
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,833
DEMOLISHED THE BUILDING
WITHOUT YOUR SEAL IN PLACE.

95
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,791
- YOU WANTED IT
TO BE DESTROYED?

96
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,375
- NATURALLY.

97
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,416
IT'S ALL IN THE NAME 
OF PROGRESS, MY DEAR.

98
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,875
I'M ACCELERATING CIVILIZATION.

99
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,333
ISN'T IT A WONDROUS THING
TO BEHOLD?

100
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,291
THESE BUILDINGS REPRESENT
THE POWER OF HUMANITY

101
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,125
AND ITS ABILITY
TO SHAPE THE WORLD.

102
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,166
WHEN HUMANITY FACES A LOSS,

103
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,500
THEIR GOAL IS TO REBUILD
BIGGER AND BETTER.

104
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,958
I WILL STRIKE THEM DOWN
TO HELP THEM GROW STRONGER.

105
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,041
IT'S MY JOB TO NUDGE THEM ALONG,

106
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,958
TO MOTIVATE THEM,
TO FORCE THEM INTO ACTION.

107
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,583
THEY ARE FUELED BY ADVERSITY

108
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,041
SO I WILL DESTROY
WHAT THEY HAVE WROUGHT.

109
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,833
WHEN I AM FINISHED...

110
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,541
THEY WILL RISE FROM THE ASHES
WITH RENEWED STRENGTH,

111
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,375
POSSESSING THE POWER
TO CHANGE THE WORLD

112
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,083
AND IT WILL BE MY DOING,
MY MASTERPIECE.

113
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,333
I WILL BE THE ARCHITECT
OF THEIR EVOLUTION.

114
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,333
- SOME SPEECH.
YOU BEEN PRACTICING THAT?

115
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,083
TOO BAD IT'S JUST THE EMPTY
RAMBLINGS OF A MANIAC.

116
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,166
- I WOULDN'T EXPECT AN EMPTY
CARAPACE THAT FORSOOK

117
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,916
ITS OWN HUMANITY
TO UNDERSTAND.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,750
- HA HA!  YOU SURE ARE FULL
OF HOT AIR, AREN'T YOU?

119
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:22,041
SORRY, PAL.  IT'S BEEN FUN,
BUT THE PARTY'S OVER NOW.

120
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,250
BEHIND YOU!
- ( gasps )

121
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,500
- ( screaming )
- MARGERY!

122
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,000
- ( panting )

123
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,875
- Yuri:
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

124
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,708
- HMM.
- CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

125
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,166
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

126
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,750
- GOOD RIDDANCE PEST.

127
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,625
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

128
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,458
- Annaberg:
NEVER FEAR.

129
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,166
WE WILL STILL BE THE VICTORS.

130
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,375
- Margery:
THOUSAND CHANGES.

131
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,125
- Marcosias: HE'S TAKEN ON
TWO SEPARATE FORMS.

132
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,375
- Sydonay:
( laughs ) LET ME GUESS.

133
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,666
YOU THOUGHT I'D BE DISTRACTED
WITH PROTECTING MY CLIENT.

134
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
- I HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY.

135
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,416
IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING
SOON, SHE'LL DIE.

136
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,875
- Valac: I'M AFRAID SO.  ARE
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

137
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,875
- I AM.

138
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,458
- THEN CALL ON YOUR FAMILIARS
TO ENSHROUD YOU WITH POWER.

139
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,458
IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST
GRACEFUL ATTACK,

140
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,500
BUT IT'S A STRONG ONE.

141
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,666
IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO USE IT,
THIS IS THE TIME.

142
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,166
- I WILL TAKE FLIGHT.
- YOU SWORE AN OATH.

143
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,666
- I WILL FIGHT THIS BATTLE.
- YOU HAVE CHOSEN A PATH.

144
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,083
- I'LL SAVE HER.  I SWEAR IT!

145
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,083
- Sydonay:
( laughs ) BEAUTIFUL FLOWER.

146
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,458
EVEN MORE CAPTIVATING
AS IT WITHERS AND DIES.

147
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,958
THIS ENDS NOW.
- ( gasps )

148
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,250
- ( grunting ) WHAT WAS--

149
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,875
- ( gasps )
- I COULDN'T LET YOU

150
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,500
DO THIS ALONE.
YOU'RE WOUNDED.

151
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,583
- IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE
THAN THAT TO KILL HIM.

152
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,250
BUT DON'T GIVE UP NOW.

153
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,875
JUST KEEP TRYING.
- I WILL.

154
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,541
- Marcosias:
THE ROOKIE SAVED YOUR LIFE?

155
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,125
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL.
YOU TAKE MORE RISKS THAN

156
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,750
A TIGHTROPE WALKER,
MY DEAR MARGERY DAW.

157
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,750
- ( scoffs )

158
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,833
- Annaberg:
ANOTHER FLAME HAZE!

159
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,416
- I FOUND HIM.

160
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,833
- ( screams )

161
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,000
- DAMN IT!
MY CLIENT IS IN DANGER.

162
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,958
HUH?

163
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,833
- OVER HERE.  I'M YOUR OPPONENT.

164
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,458
- I'M IMPRESSED YOU'RE
STILL ABLE TO FIGHT

165
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,083
AFTER THAT HIT YOU TOOK.

166
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,583
- YOU JUST SPOKE
YOUR LAST WORDS.

167
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,458
( roars )

168
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,083
- I COULDN'T FINISH IT.

169
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,166
- YOU'RE DOING WELL
FOR YOUR FIRST BATTLE.

170
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,500
BUT BE CAREFUL.  YOU'RE
EXPENDING TOO MUCH ENERGY.

171
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,958
YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS UP.
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

172
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,500
THIS IS SUCH
AN AMAZING POWER.

173
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,250
JUST THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE
I COULD SAVE USING THIS.

174
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,041
- ( crash )
- DAMN YOU.

175
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,416
MEDDLING FLAME HAZE!

176
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,416
- Valac: THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.
TAKE HIM DOWN.

177
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,791
- YEAH.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,125
- ( grunting )

179
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,541
- I GOT HIM.
- Valac: NOT YET.

180
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,708
HE'S FEEDING OFF YOUR POWER.
YOU NEED TO SHAKE HIM.

181
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,583
- IMPOSSIBLE!

182
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,500
I CANNOT BE KILLED
BY A FLAME HAZE.

183
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,750
I'VE BEEN DEFEATED

184
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,458
BY THE HOLLOW SHELL
OF A HUMAN.

185
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,625
- I'M NOT LIKE
THE OTHER FLAME HAZE.

186
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,458
I'M NOT.  I'M MORE.

187
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,583
I HAVE A HIGHER PURPOSE!

188
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
I FIGHT TO SAVE LIVES.

189
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,125
- Tanaka:
AWESOME!  THAT KID'S BADASS.

190
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,833
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
COME ON, SPILL.

191
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,291
I BET YOU AND YURI UNLEASHED
A WORLD OF PAIN

192
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,291
ON THAT SHAPE SHIFTING
SYDONAY JERK, DIDN'T YOU?

193
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,208
- Valac: DON'T BE RECKLESS.
LET THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES

194
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,750
HANDLE THOUSAND CHANGES.

195
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,250
- Yuri: I CAN'T.
SHE'S BEEN BADLY INJURED.

196
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,750
- YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY AT THE
HEIGHT OF YOUR POWER, EITHER.

197
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,791
- I KNOW.  STILL, I HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING TO HELP HER.

198
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,125
- THIS DESIRE TO SAVE OTHERS.

199
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,208
YOU JUST CAN'T LET IT GO,
CAN YOU?

200
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,041
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
A CLIENT HAS EVER DIED

201
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,083
ON MY WATCH.
YOU'VE HUMILIATED ME.

202
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,125
- YOU WON'T HAVE TO FEEL
THAT WAY FOR LONG.

203
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,875
SOON YOU TOO WILL BE DEAD.
THAT SHOULD OFFER SOME RELIEF.

204
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,125
- I'VE HEARD RUMOR
OF HER INSATIABLE BLOODLUST.

205
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:09,125
WITH THE DEATH OF THE CHASM
OF FASTIDIOUS IMPALING,

206
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,833
THERE'S NO REASON
TO CONTINUE FIGHTING.

207
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,875
- ( panting )

208
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,708
YURI.
- HE'S BACK.

209
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,583
HMM, PERFECT TIMING.

210
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,750
I'LL LET HIS APPEARANCE
PUT AN END TO THIS BATTLE.

211
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,583
- HOW MUCH IS THE KID WILLING
TO GAMBLE?

212
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,708
- Marcosias: SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?
IF WE HIT HIM FROM BOTH SIDES,

213
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,666
WE MIGHT HAVE A SLIM CHANCE
OF BEATING HIM.

214
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,208
- NO, I CAN'T RISK MY LIFE.

215
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,375
NOT UNTIL I HAVE MY REVENGE.

216
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,750
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE.

217
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,500
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN MY HANDS

218
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,375
THAT WERE STAINED
WITH THEIR BLOOD, NOT HIS.

219
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,750
I STILL HEAR IT.

220
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,000
I CAN STILL HEAR HIS LAUGHTER.

221
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:09,125
I REMEMBER THE JOY HE TOOK
IN MOCKING MY PAIN.

222
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,750
I WON'T RISK MY LIFE
IN THIS MEANINGLESS BATTLE.

223
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,333
I CANNOT DIE
UNTIL I'VE HAD MY REVENGE.

224
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,500
CHANTER OF ELEG--

225
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,500
I'M SORRY, VALAC.

226
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,125
- YOU GOT YOUR WISH,
DIDN'T YOU?

227
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,416
- Marcosias: IF THE ROOKIE
HADN'T JUMPED IN WHEN HE DID,

228
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,375
THEY WOULD'VE KEPT FIGHTING
UNTIL ONE OF 'EM WOUND UP DEAD,

229
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,625
BUT THE BATTLE ENDED IN A DRAW

230
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,375
AND TWO LIVES WERE SAVED.

231
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,083
THANKS TO HIM.

232
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,250
- Margery: HE DIDN'T HESITATE
FOR A MOMENT.

233
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,750
UNFORTUNATELY, NEITHER DID I.

234
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,833
- Tanaka: I GUESS SHE DOESN'T
WANT US TO FOLLOW HER.

235
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,625
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE
TELL THAT STORY?

236
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,791
MAN, I NEVER KNEW SHE
HAD SUCH A ROUGH PAST.

237
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,916
SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO TAKE
REVENGE AGAINST HER ENEMIES.

238
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,750
BUT THE SILVER GOT
TO THEM FIRST.

239
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,291
NOW SHE'S HUNTING HIM DOWN.

240
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,083
NO WONDER SHE TURNED OUT
AS STRONG AS SHE IS.

241
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,125
SERIOUSLY,
SHE'S TOUGH AS NAILS.

242
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,250
- WERE YOU EVEN
PAYING ATTENTION?

243
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,333
- ( panting )

244
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,666
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

245
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,750
- Alastor: COMPLAINING WILL
GET YOU NOWHERE.

246
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,375
CASTING AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL
TAKES PRACTICE.

247
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,416
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE
TAUGHT.

248
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,375
YOU MUST MASTER IT YOURSELF.

249
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,833
- DON'T GIVE UP NOW.

250
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,333
YOU CAN CONTROL
THE POWER INSIDE YOU.

251
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,041
- YOU THINK?

252
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,250
CAST A SEAL.

253
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,625
- OH, WOW.
I DID IT, SHANA.

254
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:27,708
SOMETHING WRONG?
- Alastor: THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

255
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,750
HIS FLAME.
LOOK AT THE COLOR.

256
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,166
- SILVER.

257
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,625
- Margery: ONE DAY
I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE.

258
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,416
I WILL SACRIFICE ANYTHING

259
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,791
TO SEE HIM DEAD BY MY HAND.

260
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,416
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME.

261
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,833
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

262
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,416
- Yuji: MISAKI HIGH SCHOOL'S
ANNUAL AUTUMN FESTIVAL

263
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,791
IS FAST APPROACHING.
YOSHIDA AND SHANA ARE CHOSEN

264
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,625
FOR IMPORTANT ROLES
IN THE COSTUME PARADE.

265
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,916
THEY VISIT MY MOM
FOR COSTUME MATERIALS

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,541
AND SOME WOMANLY ADVICE.

267
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,291
ON THEIR WAY HOME, THEY
ENCOUNTER A SUSPICIOUS STRANGER.

268
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,500
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT MAN LOOKS FAMILIAR.

269
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,666
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND"--

270
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,375
"THE MAN WHO RETURNED."
