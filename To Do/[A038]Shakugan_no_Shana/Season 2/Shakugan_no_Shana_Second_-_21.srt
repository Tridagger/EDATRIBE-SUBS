1
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,333
- Alastor:
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE, SABRAC,

2
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,541
MADE AN EXPLOSIVE APPEARANCE.

3
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:59,291
HIS SURPRISE ATTACK
LEFT BOTH SHANA AND MARGERY
INCAPACITATED.

4
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,416
HOWEVER, WILHELMINA
REMAINED STANDING

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,416
AND BRAVELY FOUGHT
AGAINST HER ARCH-NEMESIS

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,541
WHILE YUJI
RAN IN SEARCH OF SHANA.

7
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,708
- ( theme music playing )


8
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,958
- ( panting )

9
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,250
- YOU ARE WEAKENED,

10
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,041
APPROACHING
YOUR INEVITABLE END.

11
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,083
SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING,

12
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,625
ALLOW ME
TO PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

13
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,000
- I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
I CAN TAKE.

14
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,500
- Tiamat: DO NOT LOSE HOPE.

15
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,708
- Alastor:
WHILE I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP,

16
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,708
IT'S FAR TOO PERILOUS
FOR YOU HERE.

17
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,916
I'M AFRAID WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO PROTECT YOU

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,083
IF YOU COME UNDER FIRE.

19
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,625
- I'M STAYING.

20
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,375
- YUJI.
- YOU'RE OKAY.

21
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,791
- SHANA.
AND YOSHIDA?

22
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,958
PLEASE LEAVE.
IT'S NOT SAFE.

23
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,125
YOU'RE DRESSING HER WOUNDS?

24
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,541
USE THESE.
THEY'RE SPECIAL BANDAGES.

25
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,125
WILHELMINA SENT THEM.

26
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,958
- ( crashing sounds )

27
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,541
- PLEASE HURRY, KAZUMI.

28
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,125
I HAVE TO GET OUT THERE
AND HELP WILHELMINA.

29
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,333
- NO.  WE NEED
TO GO FIND MARGERY FIRST.

30
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,000
I HAVE AN IDEA HOW.

31
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,500
- IT DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU CAN TAKE MUCH MORE
OF THIS, SPECIALIST.

32
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,833
IT'S A SHAME
YOU WEREN'T THERE

33
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,166
WHEN I HAD
THAT FATEFUL RUN-IN
WITH THE ENGAGED LINK.

34
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,083
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE

35
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,208
TO DISPOSE
OF ALL OF YOU PESTS AT ONCE.

36
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,458
DAMN IT.

37
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:21,166
I THOUGHT STIGMA
WOULD'VE KILLED OFF
THE OTHER FLAME HAZE BY NOW.

38
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,333
BUT THAT CRIMSON FLAME 
COULD ONLY BELONG TO...

39
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,583
THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

40
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
- SHANA.

41
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,833
THAT'S THE NAME I GO BY!

42
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,208
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

43
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,541
STIGMA MAY NOT HAVE KILLED HER,

44
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,000
BUT IT SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER
COMPLETELY DEBILITATED.

45
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,083
SOMETHING IS AMISS.

46
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,250
- DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL?

47
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,875
I KNOW TO BE PREPARED
WHEN FACING MY ARCH-NEMESIS.

48
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,000
- Tiamat: OUR SECRET WEAPON.

49
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,958
- Wilhelmina:
A SPELL HAS BEEN CAST
ON THESE BANDAGES

50
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,916
WHICH COUNTERS STIGMA.

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,958
IT WAS CONCEPTUALIZED
BY A BRILLIANT MYSTES

52
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,250
WHO YOU RELENTLESSLY TARGETED.

53
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,125
I HAVE SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING
AND TESTING HIS SPELL.

54
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:21,208
AND FINALLY
I FEEL IT HAS BEEN PERFECTED.

55
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,458
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS

56
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,958
THE POWER OF THE ETERNAL LOVER,
JOHAN!

57
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,083
- NO!
- AHHH!

58
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,416
- HOW CAN THIS BE?

59
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,541
MY UNRESTRICTED SPELL

60
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,958
WAS NULLIFIED BY A LOWLY MYSTES?

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,250
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN KEEP GOING?

62
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,000
- YES INDEED, MILADY.
- Tiamat: WE WILL SOLDIER ON.

63
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,791
- THE BATTLE AGAINST SABRAC
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN.

64
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,541
- Yuji: <i>Wilhelmina...</i>

65
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,583
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

66
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,958
- Wilhelmina:
<i>I thought I told you</i>
<i>to flee somewhere safe.</i>

67
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,458
- JUST HEAR ME OUT.

68
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,791
MARGERY, SHANA, AND I
HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN

69
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,083
TO DEFEAT SABRAC,
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.

70
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,291
- <i>You have a plan?</i>
- YES.

71
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,958
AND I THINK
IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

72
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:22,583
I'VE HAD THIS WEIRD FEELING
SINCE I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

73
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,291
LIKE MY HEART'S TRAPPED 
INSIDE AN OMINOUS CLOUD.

74
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,375
WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED
BY ZAROVEE,

75
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,250
I AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED

76
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,125
I MUST'VE BEEN PICKING UP
ON HIS PRESENCE.

77
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,291
HE WAS SO WEAK
THAT AT FIRST

78
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,416
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
HE WAS A DENIZEN.

79
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,250
THING IS,
THE FEELING DIDN'T GO AWAY

80
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,083
AFTER ZAROVEE AND THE WANDERER
WERE DEFEATED.

81
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,833
- YOU'VE FELT IT
ALL OVER TOWN.

82
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,583
- Marcosias:
AND IT WAS EVEN STRONGER
WHEN YOU WERE UNDERGROUND?

83
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,750
- SABRAC'S BEEN PULLING OFF
THESE HUGE SURPRISE ATTACKS
ON US.

84
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,958
AND NONE OF US
EVER EVEN SEE HIM COMING.

85
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:03,166
I THINK THAT'S
'CAUSE HE BLANKETS HIS PRESENCE
OVER A LARGE AREA.

86
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,958
BUT SOMEHOW
I CAN STILL PICK UP ON IT.

87
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,541
- WAIT, LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.
ARE YOU SAYING--

88
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,541
- Marcosias:
HE'S SPREAD HIS PRESENCE
THROUGHOUT MISAKI CITY? 

89
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,958
- IT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
'CAUSE GET THIS--

90
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:22,208
THE FEELING THAT STARTED 
RIGHT BEFORE HE SHOWED UP

91
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,583
WAS THE SAME ONE I FELT
AT HOME THIS MORNING.

92
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,291
- UNBELIEVABLE.

93
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,500
THEN IF THAT
IS INDEED THE CASE,

94
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,791
THE SABRAC WE'RE FIGHTING
IS NOTHING MORE THAN--

95
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,083
- Tiamat: A FRAGMENT.

96
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,791
- Yuji: <i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

97
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,416
- INTERESTING.
THAT EXPLAINS

98
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,041
WHY NONE OF MY ATTACKS
SEEM TO EVEN FAZE HIM.

99
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,125
HE'S FEEDING OFF
OF AN ENDLESS SUPPLY 
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE

100
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,416
HE'S STREWN
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

101
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,250
- Tiamat: SNEAKY TACTIC.

102
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,416
- YES, BUT WE KNEW HE WOULD BE
A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.

103
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,166
HOW ARE WE TO DEFEAT HIM?

104
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,125
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

105
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,208
- AHHH!

106
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,958
- YOU MAY
HAVE COUNTERED STIGMA,

107
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,333
BUT I STILL HAVE THE UPPER HAND
IN THIS CONFLICT.

108
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,875
AS A FLAME HAZE,
YOU ARE IMPULSIVE BY NATURE,

109
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,166
PUTTING YOU AT A DISADVANTAGE
IN A WAR OF ATTRITION.

110
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,833
- Both: AHHH!

111
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,541
- I ASSUME
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES

112
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,166
HAS ALREADY BEGUN
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
FOR THIS PLAN?

113
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,666
- Yuji: <i>Yes, but we're still</i>
<i>gonna need someone</i>

114
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,875
<i>to distract Sabrac</i>
<i>until she's done.</i>

115
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,708
- ( grunts )
- <i>Please, will you help us?</i>

116
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
- I'LL BE ACTING AS YOUR GUIDE,
WILHELMINA.

117
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,333
- Wilhelmina:
<i>Miss Yoshida, is that you?</i>

118
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,750
- I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL BE
ANY GOOD AT IT,

119
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,541
BUT-- NO, I CAN DO THIS!

120
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,500
- INDEED YOU CAN.

121
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,416
I WILL DO MY BEST
TO KEEP HIM DISTRACTED

122
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,291
UNTIL THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
IS FINISHED SETTING THE TRAP.

123
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,125
- Tiamat: A CAT AND MOUSE GAME.

124
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,375
- THE GOLD EGG IN THE SEA...

125
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,583
- Marcosias:
...WAS THROWN AWAY THEN!

126
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,416
- KEISAKU, WHERE TO?

127
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,208
- <i>Take a left</i>
<i>at the intersection.</i>

128
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,208
<i>It's near the railroad ramp.</i>

129
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,208
- OKAY.

130
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,291
THE ONE GOOD THING
ABOUT THIS CITY IS
IT'S NEVER BORING.

131
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,416
I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY THE FLAME OF HEAVEN

132
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,125
WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT'S
A MAELSTROM OF WARFARE.

133
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,041
- Marcosias: FROM NOW ON,
IT'LL BE KNOWN AS SABRAC'S
ETERNAL RESTING PLACE.

134
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,875
THAT BASTARD
WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT HIM!
( laughs )

135
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,833
- Sato: IN 100 METERS,
YOU'LL SEE A MUSIC STORE.

136
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,166
THAT INTERSECTION 
IS THE 13th POINT.

137
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,000
- 'KAY, WILHELMINA,
GO SOUTH TOWARDS THE MAIN ROAD

138
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,125
AND THEN PUSH HIM
TO THE RIGHT.

139
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,625
THAT SHOULD KEEP HIM
FAR ENOUGH AWAY.

140
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,166
- Yuji: YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF

141
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,500
UNTIL YOU TRY.

142
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,250
FOR ALL I KNOW,

143
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,708
I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG
ABOUT THIS, BUT--

144
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,958
- Margery: WHEN AN ODD FISH
BROUGHT HER...

145
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,541
- --WE CAN'T GIVE UP.
- Marcosias: ...THE EGG
BACK AGAIN!

146
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,166
- THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY HOPE.

147
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,666
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,250
AND TOGETHER
WE WILL WIN.

149
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,458
- AHHH!

150
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,875
- AHHH!

151
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,041
( shouting )

152
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
DAMN YOU.

153
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
- THE FIRST RULE OF BATTLE

154
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,791
IS TO NEVER
LET YOUR GUARD DOWN, SABRAC.

155
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,958
- AFTER ALL THE TIMES
WE'VE DANCED THIS DANCE,

156
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,166
YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED
IT REQUIRES MORE THAN THAT

157
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,625
TO TAKE ME DOWN.

158
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,791
- SHANA!

159
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,000
- I'M OKAY.

160
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,083
- GOOD.

161
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,041
- I THINK OUR PLAN
MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

162
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,791
- YEAH?

163
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,208
- Marcosias:
 LET'S GET TO THE POINT.

164
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,833
HOW DO WE
DEFEAT AN ENEMY

165
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,000
WHO'S SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE CITY?

166
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,833
I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,

167
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,416
BUT WE COULD SET OFF
GIANT EXPLOSIONS ALL OVER TOWN.

168
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,625
THAT WOULD WHITTLE AWAY
AT HIS POWER OF EXISTENCE,
RIGHT?

169
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,416
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'D ALSO LEVEL THE CITY.

170
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,458
- YEAH, BUT WE CAN ALWAYS
RESTORE THE DAMAGE AFTERWARD.

171
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
- NO WAY.
IF WE ALL OF A SUDDEN

172
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,208
TAMPER WITH HIS SUPPLY
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE,

173
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,291
HE'LL START TAKING IT
FROM REGULAR PEOPLE.

174
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,708
I'M DETERMINED
TO PROTECT THIS CITY.

175
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,666
- SAKAI.

176
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,375
- I KNOW
HOW WE CAN DEFEAT SABRAC

177
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
WITHOUT CAUSING
ANY MAJOR DAMAGE.

178
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,458
- OH, YEAH?
THEN LET'S HEAR IT, KID.

179
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,833
- WELL,
AS YOU GUYS KNOW,

180
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,166
WILHELMINA'S
BEEN KEEPING SABRAC DISTRACTED.

181
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,958
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ODD

182
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,500
THAT HE HASN'T EVEN TRIED
TO ATTACK US YET?

183
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,875
A CRIMSON LORD AS POWERFUL
AS HIM

184
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,958
SHOULD BE CAPABLE
OF ATTACKING US

185
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,916
EVEN WHILE HE'S BUSY
FIGHTING SOMEONE ELSE.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,625
WHY HASN'T HE TRIED IT?

187
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,541
WELL, 'CAUSE HE CAN'T.

188
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

189
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,500
- HIS LARGE-SCALE
SURPRISE ATTACKS,

190
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,833
LIKE THE EXPLOSION
HE CAUSED BEFORE HE APPEARED,

191
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,041
ARE LIMITED TO A SINGLE USE.

192
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,166
HE IS SO FOCUSED
ON DEFEATING THE OPPONENT
IN FRONT OF HIM,

193
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,500
I GUARANTEE
HE WILL NOT EVEN THINK

194
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,250
TO ATTEMPT
ANOTHER LARGE-SCALE ATTACK.

195
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,458
- SABRAC SPREADS HIS POWER
OF EXISTENCE OVER A LARGE AREA

196
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,625
TO MAKE IT APPEAR
AS IF HE HAS MORE OF IT.

197
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,875
BUT HE HAS THE SAME AMOUNT
AS ANY DENIZEN.

198
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,541
- Marcosias:
SO THAT'S HIS SECRET.

199
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,750
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN ALL WE GOTTA DO

200
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,166
IS WORRY ABOUT THE "BRAIN"
OF THE OPERATION.

201
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,958
- YEAH, 'CAUSE HE'S ALREADY
SPREAD HIMSELF SO THIN,

202
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:50,375
HE CAN ONLY FOCUS
ON WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

203
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,583
HE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH POWER LEFT

204
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,875
TO CONSTANTLY SCAN
THE REST OF THE CITY.

205
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,416
- SO HOW DO WE TAKE HIM DOWN?

206
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
- WE CUT OFF HIS SUPPLY
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE.

207
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.

208
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,583
IT SHOULD WEAKEN HIM
ENOUGH THAT WE CAN STRIKE.

209
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,666
- PERFECT.

210
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,250
I HAVE TO CONSERVE MY POWER

211
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,541
UNTIL IT'S TIME TO STRIKE.

212
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,291
- HOW'RE WE DOING, KEISAKU?

213
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,916
- Sato: <i>We're lookin' good.</i>

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,291
<i>All the spells</i>
<i>are perfectly positioned.</i>

215
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,333
- WHERE TO NEXT?

216
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,750
- <i>Keep heading</i>
<i>in that direction.</i>

217
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,916
<i>You should see</i>
<i>a big parking lot.</i>
<i>That's the final point.</i>

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,916
- ROGER THAT.

219
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,916
- <i>About that question</i>
<i>you asked me earlier--</i>

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,666
<i>I don't wanna think</i>
<i>about what I would do</i>
<i>if you were to die.</i>

221
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,083
TO BE HONEST,
I'M PRETTY TICKED

222
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,166
THAT YOU WOULD EVEN ASK ME
SUCH A STUPID QUESTION.

223
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,500
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU DIE!

224
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,625
I'M GIVING IT MY ALL
OVER HERE.

225
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,708
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
YOU LIVE THROUGH THIS.

226
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,250
<i>Now can we drop it?</i>

227
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,250
- IDIOT.

228
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,333
- OH!
MARGERY IS ON HER WAY

229
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,041
TOWARDS THE FINAL POINT
RIGHT NOW.

230
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,458
WE'VE ALMOST GOT HIM,
WILHELMINA.

231
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,208
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

232
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,875
- AHHH!

233
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,125
WAIT.

234
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,541
WHERE DID THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER RUN OFF TO?

235
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,166
WHY IS SHE NO LONGER ATTACKING?
OH, DEAR.

236
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,750
SURELY YOU FLAME HAZE
ARE NOT SO FOOLISH

237
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,291
AS TO THINK
YOU CAN SET A TRAP FOR ME.

238
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,583
- I'VE NEVER WANTED TO SEE

239
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,708
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
SO BADLY IN MY LIFE.

240
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,000
- Tiamat: YOU MUST BE PATIENT.

241
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,583
- HERE HE COMES.
- WE ARE READY.

242
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,500
- I HAVE YOU NOW!

243
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,583
- THE TRAP IS SET.
LET'S GET THIS BASTARD!

244
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,500
- Marcosias:
THIS IS GONNA BE A BLAST!
( laughs )

245
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,041
- WHAT THE--

246
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,458
- Margery:
JACK'S MOTHER CAME IN--

247
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,125
- Marcosias:
--AND CAUGHT THE GOOSE SOON!

248
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,375
- AND MOUNTING ITS BACK--

249
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,916
- Marcosias:
 --FLEW UP TO THE MOON!

250
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

251
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,458
- NO!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

252
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,583
- ( Marcosias laughing )

253
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,666
- THE REST IS UP TO YOU,
MILADY.

254
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,583
- RIGHT.

255
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,041
YUJI?

256
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,875
NEVER MIND.

257
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,166
- Alastor:
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD HIM
HOW YOU FEEL.

258
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,291
I WASN'T GOING TO STOP YOU.

259
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
NOT ONLY DID HE
DEFEAT THE JAEGER,

260
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,125
HE SABOTAGED THE WANDERER,
AND REVEALED THE SECRET

261
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,833
OF THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE'S
INVINCIBILITY.

262
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:20,250
IN FACT, HE EVEN CAME UP
WITH A PLAN TO DEFEAT SABRAC.

263
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,083
YUJI SAKAI--

264
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,166
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD'S
MYSTES.

265
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,875
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

266
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,041
HE WAS CAPABLE
OF SUCH GREATNESS?

267
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,041
- AHH!

268
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,458
- ( shouting )

269
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,000
- ( shouting )

270
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,833
- AHHHHH!

271
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,875
- THAT'S THE END OF HIM.

272
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,291
- Marcosias:
AND GOOD RIDDANCE, I SAY.

273
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,291
- A SWEET VICTORY INDEED.
- Tiamat: NEMESIS DEFEATED.

274
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,375
- IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY GOT HIM.

275
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,958
- THANK GOODNESS.

276
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,000
- Chigusa: I'M SORRY
I HAD YOU ALL WORRIED.

277
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,458
- WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU'RE LOOKING MUCH BETTER.

278
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,250
- THANKS.
I FEEL GREAT.

279
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,791
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU,
SHANA AND YOSHIDA.

280
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,000
AND WILHELMINA'S MEDICINE
HELPED TOO.

281
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,375
PLEASE TELL HER
I SAID THANK YOU AGAIN.

282
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,416
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

283
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,875
- THAT PORRIDGE WAS TERRIBLE.

284
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,250
- ( both giggle )

285
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,625
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

286
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,416
- THANKS AGAIN.

287
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,375
YOSHIDA?

288
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,958
I'M WORRIED
THIS'LL MAKE YOU ANGRY AGAIN,

289
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,166
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SAY.

290
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,791
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU

291
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,583
I'D DECIDED
TO LEAVE MISAKI CITY?

292
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:56,000
I REFUSED TO ACCEPT
THE FOOD YOU'D BROUGHT OVER.

293
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,083
THAT WAS SO RUDE.

294
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,833
I'M SORRY.

295
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,750
I HOPE
YOU CAN ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.

296
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,541
- I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

297
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,833
FROM THE MOMENT
I HEARD YOU SAY

298
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,041
THAT YOU'RE DETERMINED
TO PROTECT THIS CITY,

299
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,000
I KNEW YOU WERE BACK
TO THE SAKAI I LOVE.

300
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,916
- THANK YOU.

301
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,541
- YUJI.
- SHANA.

302
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,750
- I'LL SEE YA TONIGHT.

303
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,625
WE PICK UP YOUR TRAINING
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.
- RIGHT.

304
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,500
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

305
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,750
BEFORE YOU DEFEATED SABRAC,

306
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,875
YOU STARTED TO SAY SOMETHING.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

307
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,083
- UH, IT WAS NOTHING.
- COME ON.

308
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,625
- I SAID IT WAS NOTHING!

309
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,500
- SHANA.

310
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,500
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

311
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,000
- ( theme music playing )


312
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:30,541
- Yuji: THEY SAY TIMES CHANGE
AND WE CHANGE WITH THEM.

313
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,833
SHANA AND YOSHIDA
DECIDE TO WRITE LETTERS TO ME

314
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,000
REVEALING
THEIR TRUE FEELINGS.

315
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,666
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

316
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,250
"CHRISTMAS EVE."
