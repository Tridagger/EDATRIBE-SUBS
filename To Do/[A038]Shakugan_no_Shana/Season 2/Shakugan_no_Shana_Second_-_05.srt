1
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,250
- Alastor: FUMINA KONOE WAS
RAISED LIKE A SPOILED PRINCESS,

2
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,291
BUT SINCE MOVING TO MISAKI, SHE
HAS BECOME DEPENDENT ON YUJI.

3
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,291
SHE WILL NOT LEAVE
HIS SIDE,

4
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,791
UNABLE TO PERFORM EVEN THE
SIMPLEST TASK WITHOUT HIS HELP.

5
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,625
KAZUMI AND SHANA
FEEL SLIGHTED

6
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,791
THAT YUJI SPENDS ALL OF HIS
FREE TIME WITH FUMINA.

7
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,791
THE GIRLS TRY TO FIGHT BACK
THEIR JEALOUSY,

8
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,583
BUT IT IS
A CONSTANT STRUGGLE.

9
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,208
- ( theme song playing )

10
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,791
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

11
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,541
- ( exclaiming )

12
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,791
OW, OW, OW, OW.

13
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,916
WHAT THE--?
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HURT.

14
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,083
DOESN'T EVEN LOOK
LIKE I'M INJURED.

15
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,583
- INDEED, YOU ARE BECOMING
STRONGER AND LEARNING

16
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,791
TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF YOUR
POWER OF EXISTENCE.

17
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,416
- Tiamat: TO MANIPULATE IT.

18
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,083
- AND THAT KEEPS ME
FROM GETTING HURT?

19
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,541
- THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP
WITH MY TRAINING.

20
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,083
SO HOW'S SHANA DOING?

21
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,708
- WHY DO YOU ASK ME,
WHEN YOU SEE HER AT SCHOOL?

22
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,375
- Tiamat: ALMOST EVERY DAY.

23
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,458
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEA

24
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,625
WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TRAIN ME ANYMORE, DO YOU?

25
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,208
I'VE TRIED TO ASK HER,
BUT SHE REFUSES TO TELL ME.

26
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,916
- THE MISTRESS STATED
SHE IS SIMPLY OCCUPIED

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,833
WITH OTHER THINGS AT THE MOMENT.
- NO PRYING, YOUNG MAN.

28
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,875
- YEAH, I GET IT.
SORRY.

29
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,166
- MORE TRAINING TOMORROW.

30
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,166
HE WAS ABLE TO DODGE
A DIRECT HIT FROM ME--

31
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
IMPRESSIVE INDEED.
- Tiamat: AND THEN HE FELL DOWN.

32
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,291
QUITE A BLUNDER
ON HIS PART, YES.

33
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,375
MY POINT IS,

34
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,625
HE'S COME A LONG WAY
IN HIS TRAINING.

35
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,291
HE IS NOW ABLE TO REGENERATE
HIS POWER IN BATTLE.

36
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,083
- ( clock ticking )

37
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,541
- YOUR RAMEN IS READY.

38
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,166
- Tiamat: TIME'S UP.

39
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,291
- HMM.
- A CUP OF NOODLES AGAIN?

40
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,916
- AFTER TRYING VARIOUS COOKING
STYLES FOR A HOME-COOKED MEAL,

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,916
MY CONCLUSION IS THAT
THIS IS MOST EFFICIENT.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,750
- Tiamat: NO COOKING REQUIRED.
- Alastor: THAT MAY BE TRUE,

43
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,708
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE HAVING
THE SAME MEAL NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

44
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,500
LACKS WHAT THE HUMANS CALL
"VARIETY."

45
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,208
- ALASTOR, THIS VARIETY
YOU SPEAK OF

46
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,166
IS UNNECESSARY
FOR FLAME HAZE.

47
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,125
WON'T YOU FINISH
YOUR RAMEN, MILADY?

48
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,083
- BATH TIME.

49
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,458
- ( Yuji's voice )
SHANA, WAIT UP!

50
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,291
WHAT ARE YOU
SO ANGRY ABOUT?

51
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,250
- ( Shana's voice )
I'M NOT ANGRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

52
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,291
- DON'T LIE TO ME.
- I'M NOT LYING.

53
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,541
IT'S JUST THAT I--

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,791
- I WISH I COULD TELL HIM.

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,250
- THE MISTRESS HAS LEFT HER
CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR YET AGAIN.

56
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,041
MOST UNCOUTH INDEED, TO LEAVE
SUCH SIMPLE TASKS TO OTHERS.

57
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,833
- Tiamat: THE MISTRESS
IS LAZY.

58
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,458
- Shana: I PICK UP AFTER MYSELF.
- INDEED, MILADY, YOU DO NOT.

59
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,291
- SHUT UP.
YES, I DO.

60
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,958
- FORGIVE MY ASKING, MILADY,
BUT HOW MUCH LONGER

61
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,916
DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE
THE MYSTES'S TRAINING TO ME?

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,875
I'VE CONTINUED THIS LONG WITHOUT
ANY EXPLANATION FROM YOU.

63
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,541
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST KEEP DOING IT?

64
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,208
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA!

65
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,333
- YELLING WILL NOT CHANGE
THE SITUATION IN ANY WAY.

66
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,708
- Tiamat: IT'S ACTUALLY
QUITE RUDE.

67
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,708
- INDEED, YOU HAVE DONE
NOTHING BUT YELL

68
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,000
FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS.
IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

69
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,083
YOU ARE DISTRESSED--
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU I'M FINE!

70
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,916
JEEZ, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE,
WOULD YOU?

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,208
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW

72
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,291
EVEN IF I TOLD YOU.  ALL YOUR
NAGGING ABOUT CHORES AND YUJI--

73
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,291
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING ME
EVEN MORE.

74
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,125
SO THE BEST THING
YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW

75
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,750
IS JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE!

76
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,791
- ( door opens and closes )

77
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,250
- I ALWAYS SEE YOU OUT AND ABOUT
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING,

78
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,250
BUT WE NEVER REALLY
GET THE CHANCE TO TALK.

79
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,416
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN,
HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH ME?

80
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,333
- THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER, BUT
I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE TIME NOW.

81
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,791
HOWEVER, I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO JOIN YOU IN THE FUTURE.

82
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,250
- IF YOU SAY SO.

83
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,708
- ARE YOU TRYING TO PERSUADE HER
TO COME IN FOR TEA AGAIN?

84
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
COME ON, MOM,
I BET SHE'D LOVE TO,

85
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,875
BUT SHE'S A VERY BUSY LADY.
- RIGHT.

86
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,041
- WELL, I HAVE TO GO BY KONOE'S
TO WALK HER TO SCHOOL.

87
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
SEE YOU LATER.

88
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,041
- I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY
AT SCHOOL, YUJI.

89
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,791
- PARDON, BUT I SHOULD BE
GOING AS WELL.

90
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,291
- I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

91
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,791
- ( knocks )

92
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,541
- GREETINGS, MASTER SAKAI.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

93
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,125
I AM AFRAID MISS KONOE
IS TAKING HER TIME

94
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,083
GETTING READY THIS MORNING.
I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE.

95
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,791
I HOPE YOU WON'T BE LATE
FOR CLASS.

96
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,791
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR YOUR HELP.

97
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,458
- NO, FORGET IT.
- WELL, I SHOULD IMAGINE

98
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,750
THAT SHE'LL BE READY TO GO
ANY MOMENT NOW.

99
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,750
WHY DON'T YOU COME
AND WAIT FOR HER INSIDE?

100
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,916
- OH, I DON'T WANT
TO INTRUDE.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
- NONSENSE, YOUNG MAN.

102
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,583
PLEASE COME IN.

103
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,250
THIS WAY,
MASTER SAKAI.

104
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,708
NORMALLY I WOULD BE
RESPONSIBLE

105
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,833
FOR WALKING HER TO SCHOOL
EACH AND EVERY DAY.

106
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,083
AGAIN, I'M SO GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR HELP.

107
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,125
IT ALLOWS ME TO GET MORE DONE
AROUND THE HOUSE.

108
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,291
- OH, HEY,
NO PROBLEM AT ALL, SIR.

109
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,291
I'M UP EARLY EVERY MORNING
FOR TRAINING ANYWAY,

110
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,083
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S AN INCONVENIENCE.

111
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,583
- AH, TRAINING, YOU SAY?
MAY I ASK FOR WHAT?

112
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,458
- UH, NOTHING BIG.  I'M JUST
TRYING TO GET A LITTLE STRONGER.

113
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,083
- GOOD MORNING, SAKAI.

114
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,166
( giggles )

115
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,291
- YOUR HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY
AMAZING, KONOE.

116
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,333
IT'S NOT ONLY GORGEOUS
ON THE OUTSIDE,

117
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,791
BUT THE INSIDE TOO.
- IT'S JUST A NORMAL HOUSE.

118
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,958
- THAT'S RIGHT,
I FORGET SOMETIMES

119
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,625
THAT "NORMAL" FOR YOU IS
LIVING IN THE LAP OF LUXURY.

120
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,625
IN FACT, I'M BETTING
YOU WOULDN'T BE

121
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,875
EVEN A LITTLE IMPRESSED
WITH SATO'S FANCY PLACE.

122
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,875
- WHO IS SATO?

123
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,875
- HE'S A GUY
IN OUR CLASS.

124
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,708
HE WENT TO THE SUPERSIZE
RESTAURANT WITH US, REMEMBER?

125
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,583
- UH...
- IT'S OKAY.

126
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,541
TAKES TIME TO LEARN
EVERYONE'S NAMES.

127
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,583
- MAYBE SO,
BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM

128
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,750
REMEMBERING YOUR NAME, SAKAI.
- I'M GLAD.

129
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,541
BUT YOU DO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH ME.

130
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,541
- OKAY, THIS IS
FOR CONTEMPORARY LIT.

131
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,625
AND HERE'S YOUR NOTEBOOK.

132
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,500
GREAT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN NOW.

133
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,166
RIGHT?
THINK SO, YOSHIDA?

134
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,333
- UH, YEAH, SURE.

135
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,375
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO
ALL OF THIS BY MYSELF JUST YET.

136
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,750
- WHA--?  SERIOUSLY?

137
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,000
WELL, THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU
TO PUSH YOURSELF.

138
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,583
JUST ASK ME IF YOU HAVE ANY
TROUBLE FIGURING IT OUT, OKAY?

139
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,541
- AH, SAKAI,
YOU'RE STILL HELPING KONOE.

140
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,541
- Students: GOOD MORNING.
- HAVING TO TAKE ON ALL THAT

141
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,250
RESPONSIBILITY IS PRETTY TOUGH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

142
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,250
POOR GUY, I HEAR

143
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,250
YOU'VE BEEN STUCK WITH HER
FROM MORNING TO NIGHT.

144
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,750
- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT.
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.

145
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,166
YOSHIDA'S BEEN HELPING ME
WITH HER TOO.

146
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,250
- ABOUT THAT: I DON'T THINK
SHE SHOULD HAVE TO.

147
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,375
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU
HELP HER HERE ON CAMPUS,

148
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,041
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WALK WITH HER

149
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,208
TO AND FROM SCHOOL
EVERY DAY.

150
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,208
YOU LIVE IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION

151
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,916
OF KONOE'S HOUSE,
DON'T YOU?

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,125
- UH, WELL, YEAH.

153
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE.

154
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,958
MY APOLOGIES.
MM, LET'S SEE.

155
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,875
OGATA, YOU LIVE NEAR KONOE,
DON'T YOU?

156
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,250
DO YOU MIND TAKING OVER
YOSHIDA'S DUTIES?

157
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,041
- NO, I DON'T MIND.
I WOULD LOVE TO HELP HER OUT.

158
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,666
- OKAY THEN, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

159
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,250
- YES, SIR.

160
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,083
- SO, JUST TO REITERATE,
STARTING THIS AFTERNOON

161
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,291
OGATA IS ON KONOE DUTY
WITH SAKAI.

162
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,583
NOW I EXPECT THE REST OF YOU
TO HELP THEM WITH HER

163
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,375
HERE AT SCHOOL.  GOT IT?
- YES, SIR.

164
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,791
- OH MY.

165
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,291
IT'S AN OFFER
I CANNOT REFUSE.

166
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,250
- Tiamat: IT IS
QUITE A MARKDOWN.

167
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,125
- WHAT'S GOING ON,
SAKAI?

168
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,875
WHERE THE HECK HAVE YOSHIDA AND
SHANA BEEN THE LAST FEW DAYS?

169
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,916
WHAT, THEY DON'T WANT
TO EAT LUNCH WITH US?

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,208
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THOSE TWO.

171
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,708
THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST TRYING

172
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,416
TO WORK OUT THEIR
DIFFERENCES OR SOMETHING.

173
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,833
- DOUBT IT.  THAT'S NOT
THE VIBE I WAS GETTING.

174
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,791
- LOOK, SAKAI,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

175
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,666
BUT YOU THINK THEY MAY BE
UPSET WITH YOU?

176
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,791
THEY BOTH MAKE YOU
BOXED LUNCHES EVERY DAY.

177
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,000
MAYBE THEY THINK
YOU'RE NOT GRATEFUL.

178
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,291
- HMM.

179
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,000
- UM, SAKAI,
WOULD YOU MIND

180
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,083
IF I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE
OF EACH OF YOUR LUNCHES?

181
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
- NOT AT ALL.
GO AHEAD.

182
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,416
- YOU THINK I'M SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME WITH KONOE?

183
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,416
YOU'VE SEEN
HOW HELPLESS SHE IS.

184
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,125
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN LEAVE HER
TO HER OWN DEVICES, YOU KNOW.

185
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,541
- I THINK YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE, BUDDY.

186
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,791
YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU.

187
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,166
JUST TRY NOT TO SPEND
SO MUCH TIME WITH HER.

188
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,458
- THAT'S WEIRD.

189
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,208
- GATHER 'ROUND,
EVERYBODY!

190
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,666
I'VE GOT THE FRESHEST VEGETABLES
YOU'VE EVER SEEN--

191
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,875
CABBAGE, GREEN PEPPERS--
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

192
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,458
WELCOME, YOUNG LADY.
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

193
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,708
I GOT THE BEST PRICES
IN TOWN

194
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,125
AND THE FRESHEST PRODUCE,
GUARANTEED.

195
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,125
HEY, YOU'RE CHECKING OUT
THE CABBAGE, HUH?

196
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,458
GOOD CHOICE.  YOU CAN BOIL IT,
STIR-FRY IT OR SERVE IT RAW.

197
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,250
AND WITH A LITTLE
ELBOW GREASE,

198
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,625
THAT BAD BOY'LL MAKE
SOME MEAN CABBAGE ROLLS.

199
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,708
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT:
YOU'RE SUCH A LOOKER,

200
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,041
I'LL CUT YOU A DEAL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

201
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,583
- CABBAGE.
- Chigusa: WELL, HELLO THERE.

202
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,708
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO RUN INTO YOU HERE.

203
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,708
- Seller: HERE YOU GO,
YOUNG LADY.

204
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,291
THANKS FOR YOUR PATRONAGE.
- OH, HELLO.

205
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,791
- IS SOMETHING WRONG,
WILHELMINA?

206
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,833
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
A LITTLE DOWN TODAY.

207
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,583
- NO, EVERYTHING IS FINE.

208
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,583
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR ASKING.

209
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,791
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
I DON'T MEAN TO MEDDLE,

210
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,958
BUT ARE YOU HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH SHANA?

211
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,416
I KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY
MY PLACE,

212
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,708
BUT I NOTICED SHE HASN'T
COME TO VISIT IN A WHILE.

213
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,708
AND WHEN I ASK YUJI
ABOUT IT,

214
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,958
HE SEEMS CONFUSED
ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION.

215
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,500
- MA'AM,

216
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,708
I AM CURIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING.

217
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,416
IS PRACTICALITY NOT ENOUGH WHEN
IT COMES TO PREPARING DINNER?

218
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,541
- PRACTICAL IS FINE.

219
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,750
BUT IF THAT WERE THE ONLY
REASON WE WERE TO COOK,

220
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,791
THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE
HALF AS MUCH VARIETY.

221
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,875
- SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY
ABOUT GAINING NUTRITION.

222
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,500
IT'S ABOUT EXPERIENCING
VARIETY AS WELL?

223
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.  THERE'S AN ART
TO USING DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS

224
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,916
TO CREATE NEW AND EXCITING
FLAVOR COMBINATIONS

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
THAT MAKE EACH MEAL
AN EXPERIENCE ALL ITS OWN.

226
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,166
SO, WILHELMINA.
- YES, MA'AM?

227
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,166
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME BY

228
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,416
AND HAVE THAT CUP OF TEA
WE TALKED ABOUT?

229
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,750
- WHAT'S UP, OGATA?

230
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,875
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
THIS AFTERNOON?

231
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,875
YOU DON'T HAVE PRACTICE,
DO YOU?

232
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,250
- SORRY, TANAKA,
BUT I CAN'T TODAY.

233
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,791
- BUT WHY NOT?

234
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,166
- YOU READY, OGATA?
WE'D BETTER GET A MOVE ON.

235
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,541
- YEAH, SURE.
BE RIGHT THERE.

236
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,791
I'VE BEEN PUT ON KONOE DUTY,
SO I'VE GOT TO HELP SAKAI.

237
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,541
I HAVE TO WALK HOME WITH THEM ON
THE DAYS I DON'T HAVE PRACTICE.

238
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,875
- OH, UM, OKAY THEN.

239
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,708
- SEE YA.

240
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,291
- SUCKS TO BE YOU.
- YEAH.

241
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,541
- Kazumi: WHY HAVEN'T YOU
GONE HOME YET?

242
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,000
- I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME.

243
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,958
- Kazumi: THERE IT IS AGAIN.

244
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,458
I WISH THIS FEELING
WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

245
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,541
I-- I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

246
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T MEAN TO GET ANGRY,

247
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,208
BUT WHEN I SEE THEM
TOGETHER--

248
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,958
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT GETS ON MY NERVES SO BAD.

249
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,250
- ( Margery moaning )
OH, YEAH!

250
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,083
THERE YOU GO.
OH, RIGHT THERE.

251
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,666
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
YOU'VE GOT GREAT HANDS, SATO.

252
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,000
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE
A GIRL FEEL GOOD.

253
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,125
- CAN I STOP NOW,
MARGERY?

254
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,125
PLEASE, MY HANDS
ARE KILLING ME.

255
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,958
- HUH?  WE NEED TO WORK
ON YOUR STAMINA.

256
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,500
COME ON, KEEP IT UP
UNTIL I FINISH THIS GLASS.

257
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,291
- BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
FOR THE LAST THREE GLASSES.

258
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,291
JEEZ, HOW ARE YOUR
SHOULDERS STIFF

259
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,250
WHEN YOU JUST
SIT AROUND ALL DAY?

260
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,958
- ( Marcosias laughs )
SHE GOT YOU THERE, KIDDO.

261
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,750
SHE AIN'T STIFF.
SHE JUST DIGS MASSAGES.

262
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,708
- I'M AFRAID HE'S RIGHT.
IF YOU'RE TOO TIRED TO CONTINUE,

263
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,875
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE EITA
TAKE OVER FOR YA?

264
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,208
- WELL, I WOULD,
BUT HE'S NOT HERE YET.

265
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,250
- WHAT?
WHERE IS HE?

266
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,125
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I BET YOU HE RAN AWAY.

267
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,625
MUST HAVE WISED UP AND REALIZED
THE GIG'S NOT FOR HIM.

268
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,625
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO HANG
WITH MARGERY DAW,

269
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,291
YOU BETTER HAVE STRONG HANDS
AND SOME SERIOUS PATIENCE.

270
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,708
THAT GIRL CAN BE QUITE A HANDFUL
WHEN SHE'S DRUNK,

271
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,875
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
- STUPID MARCO, SHUT UP.

272
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,666
- CUT IT OUT
WITH THE THROWING!

273
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,083
- I'M SURPRISED KONOE'S FAMILY
BOUGHT THAT MANSION.

274
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,958
NO ONE'S LIVED THERE IN YEARS.
IT'S SUCH AN OLD PLACE,

275
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,375
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO TO
RUIN, BUT I GUESS IT WON'T NOW.

276
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,208
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

277
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,708
HER BUTLER INVITED ME INSIDE
THIS MORNING,

278
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,083
AND THE PLACE DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE IT WAS VERY OLD AT ALL.

279
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,875
I DID NOTICE THERE WERE
A LOT OF EMPTY ROOMS THOUGH.

280
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,916
- WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,666
KONOE AND HER BUTLER ARE THE
ONLY ONES LIVING THERE, RIGHT?

282
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN'T OCCUPY ALL
THE ROOMS IN THAT HUGE PLACE.

283
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,041
- YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

284
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,333
BUT STILL, THERE WAS SOMETHING
STRANGE ABOUT IT.

285
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,333
- HMM.

286
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,750
- OH, HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

287
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,000
ARE YOU GUYS HEADED BACK
FROM KONOE'S HOUSE?

288
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,333
- ARE YOU HERE 'CAUSE YOU WERE
WORRIED ABOUT ME?

289
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,083
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

290
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,583
I JUST HAPPENED
TO BE PASSING BY.

291
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,083
- SO ARE YOU GOING OVER
TO SATO'S PLACE TO HANG OUT?

292
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,958
- UM, NO, NOT TODAY.

293
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,875
- Alastor: WH-- WHAT'S HAPPENED?
- WILHELMINA!

294
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,458
WHERE ARE YOU, WILHELMINA?
HELLO?

295
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,500
WILHELMINA, ANSWER ME!

296
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,083
ARE YOU--?

297
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
- WELCOME HOME, MILADY.

298
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,833
YOUR DINNER SHOULD BE
READY TO SERVE

299
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,500
IN JUST A FEW MORE
MINUTES.

300
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,916
- MY DINNER?

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,625
- Alastor: YOU COOKED IT
YOURSELF?

302
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,125
OF COURSE.  I'VE USED
DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS

303
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,541
TO CREATE NEW AND EXCITING
FLAVOR COMBINATIONS.

304
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,541
- Tiamat: VARIETY IS
THE SPICE OF LIFE.

305
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,250
- PLEASE DO NOT BE AFRAID.

306
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,375
I HAVE TRAINED LONG AND HARD
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS FEAT.

307
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,708
- Alastor: SEEMS HER TRAINING
DIDN'T COVER

308
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,000
TURNING THE VENTILATION
FANS ON.

309
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,666
- Yuji: HEY, MOM.

310
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,333
- WELCOME HOME, SWEETHEART.
I'M IN THE KITCHEN.

311
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,250
- WHAT THE--?  WHAT ON EARTH
HAPPENED IN HERE?

312
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,666
- ( chuckles )

313
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,666
GUESS I MADE
A BIT OF A MESS, HUH?

314
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,583
- I'D CALL THAT
MORE THAN A BIT.

315
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,000
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAIT, MILADY.

316
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,416
- Alastor: EXCUSE ME,
WILHELMINA,

317
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,416
BUT WOULD YOU
PLEASE TELL US

318
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,916
WHAT THIS INTERESTING-LOOKING
DISH IS CALLED?

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,500
- IT IS A CABBAGE ROLL.
- THAT'S A CABBAGE ROLL?

320
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,750
- INDEED.  I HAD TO
CUT THE CABBAGE,

321
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,291
COOK THE MEAT, ADD THE SEASONING
AND LET IT STEW.

322
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,875
I'VE ENSURED THIS MEAL IS
NOT ONLY FULL OF MUCH NEEDED

323
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,166
NUTRITIONAL VALUE,
BUT ALSO TASTES GOOD.

324
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,208
- Tiamat: AN IMPROVED EPICUREAN.
- Alastor: A BIASED OPINION.

325
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,833
- I THOUGHT A HOME-COOKED MEAL
MIGHT HELP CHEER YOU UP.

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,250
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MILADY?

327
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,125
- KIND OF BITTER.

328
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,916
AND IT COULD PROBABLY
USE SOME SALT.

329
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,583
BUT YOU TOOK THE TIME
TO MAKE IT FOR ME,

330
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,666
SO I LOVE IT.
THANKS A LOT.

331
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,791
- SHANA'S STILL ANGRY WITH ME
FOR SOME REASON.

332
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,791
MAYBE WE'LL GET A CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

333
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,916
I THINK
IKE'S GOT A POINT.

334
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,875
I NEED TO BE
MORE AWARE.

335
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,791
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

336
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,583
- Yuji: SATO AGREES
TO HOLD AN ALL-NIGHT

337
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,583
STUDY SESSION AT HIS PLACE, AND
THE WHOLE GANG'S GONNA BE THERE.

338
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,666
THINGS MAY GET A BIT AWKWARD,
BECAUSE SHANA AND YOSHIDA

339
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,666
HAVE BEEN KIND OF WEIRD
AROUND ME LATELY.

340
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,541
AND THEN THERE'S
WHATEVER THAT IS GOING ON

341
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,166
WITH OGATA AND TANAKA.

342
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,208
MARGERY SENSES
THAT SOMETHING IS AWRY

343
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,208
AND DECIDES TO GIVE THE GIRLS
SOME SAGE ADVICE.

344
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,750
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

345
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,708
"EVE OF TROUBLE".
