1
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,541
- Alastor:
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL TURNED OUT

2
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,583
TO BE MORE EVENTFUL
THAN ANYONE HAD ANTICIPATED.

3
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:59,000
THE SILVER MATERIALIZED,
HECATE AWAKENED KONOE,

4
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,750
JOHAN BRIEFLY TOOK OVER
YUJI'S BODY,

5
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,416
AND PHELES
DEPARTED TO TAKE CARE
OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,583
AND SO BEGINS
OUR NEXT CHAPTER.

7
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme music playing )


8
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,625
- Boy: WE ALL CLEAR?
- Boy #2: ALL CLEAR!

10
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,125
- OKAY, YOU GUYS READY?
- All: YEAH!

11
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,416
- AND PULL!

12
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
WHOA WHOA, EASY! 
- Boy: GOT IT!

13
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,000
- CLEAN UP'S GOING A LOT FASTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

14
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,666
- IT'S SURPRISING.

15
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,416
- NOT REALLY, WE STARTED
AS SOON AS THE FESTIVAL ENDED.

16
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,708
- BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T HERE
TO HELP OUT.

17
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,208
- AT LEAST YOU GUYS
ARE HERE TODAY, UNLIKE SATO.

18
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,458
- DON'T LET WHAT SHE SAID
GET TO YOU, YOSHIDA.

19
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,875
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS YOU'RE HERE NOW.

20
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,333
- Fujita:
AHA! FOUND YOU, IKE!

21
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,833
WHY ARE YOU CLEANING

22
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,416
WHEN WE'VE GOT MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO? 

23
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,166
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
ALL THE FLIERS

24
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,833
AND MAKE SURE
ALL THE RENTED EQUIPMENT
GETS RETURNED.

25
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,083
LISTEN, I KNOW
IT'S A LOT OF WORK,
BUT YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS.

26
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,500
- AREN'T THE UPPER CLASSMEN
IN CHARGE OF THAT STUFF?

27
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,000
- LIKE WE CAN TRUST
THOSE MORONS TO DO IT ALL.

28
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,750
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
DONE RIGHT, DO IT YOURSELF.

29
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,458
- FUJITA MAY BE BOSSY,

30
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:51,083
BUT SHE SURE KNOWS
HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE.

31
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,375
- Ike: I CAN WALK ON MY OWN,
YOU KNOW.

32
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,041
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DRAG ME AROUND.

33
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,333
- IF I DON'T,
YOU'LL START LOLLYGAGGING AGAIN,

34
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,625
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME
TO WASTE RIGHT NOW.

35
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,125
- ( protesting )

36
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,833
- Girl:
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THESE?

37
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,833
WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WITH THE COSTUMES
FROM THE PARADE?

38
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,291
- WE COULD KEEP THEM
AS MEMENTOS,

39
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,083
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
DONATE THEM TO THE DRAMA CLUB.

40
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,166
- WAIT.
WHOSE COSTUME WAS THIS?

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,458
- I BET IT BELONGS
TO ANOTHER CLASS.

42
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,083
MUST'VE GOTTEN MIXED UP
WITH OURS.

43
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,666
- WELL, NOW THAT FUMINA KONOE'S
DISAPPEARED,

44
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,083
IT'S AS THOUGH
SHE NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

45
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,291
SINCE NO ONE ELSE
REMEMBERS HER,

46
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,041
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO'LL EVER KNOW SHE'S GONE.

47
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,750
- HOW SAD.

48
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,166
- Yuji: THAT-- THAT THING
IS INSIDE OF ME.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,083
- HERE YOU ARE, BEL-PEOL.
THIS BELONGS TO YOU.

50
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,958
- THANKS.
I HOPE IT SERVED YOU WELL.

51
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,208
- WE WERE CLOSE
TO DESTROYING THE MYSTES,

52
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,916
BUT I'M AFRAID
WE WERE INTERRUPTED
AND THEREFORE UNABLE

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,166
TO RETRIEVE
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD, MA'AM.

54
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,708
- WHILE I'M DISAPPOINTED,

55
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,750
I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE'S CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

56
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,083
IT SIMPLY
WASN'T IN THE CARDS TODAY.

57
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,875
BUT WE'LL GET OUR HANDS
ON IT EVENTUALLY.

58
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,291
- YES!
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

59
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,500
( cackling )
WITH OUR FRIEND HERE,
WE CAN'T FAIL!

60
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,166
AND NOW I HAVE THE TIME
TO COLLECT MORE DATA ON HIM.

61
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,458
- WHAT FUN!
OHH, THIS IS TERRIBLY EXCITING!

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,541
NOW LET'S WAKE HIM,
SHALL WE?

63
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,250
- RISE AND SHINE!
WE HAVE BIG PLANS FOR YOU!

64
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,541
- IT APPEARS OUR INVESTMENT
IS ABOUT TO PAY OFF.

65
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,833
- HEY, ANY IDEA
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THESE?

66
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,083
UH, YUJI?
- HUH?

67
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,083
- WHAT IS THE MATTER?
- NOTHING.

68
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,250
I'M FINE.
- YO, YOU HAVE SOME FREE TIME
TONIGHT?

69
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,125
MARGERY SAID SHE WANTED
TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU GUYS.

70
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,833
- SHE WANTS TO DISCUSS
OUR SITUATION,

71
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,750
BUILD OUR STRATEGY
FOR THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

72
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,541
- YEAH, SOMETHING
ALONG THOSE LINES, I THINK.

73
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,541
SHE ALSO MENTIONED
THAT SHE WANTED TO EXAMINE YUJI
ONE MORE TIME.

74
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,000
SHE'S TRYING TO PLAY IT SAFE.

75
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,541
YOU KNOW,
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED LATELY.

76
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,875
- I'LL BE THERE.

77
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,208
- YOSHIDA?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

78
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,791
- YEAH.

79
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,333
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME
IF YOU'RE NOT UP TO IT.

80
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,291
- NO, I'M FINE, IT'S JUST...

81
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,750
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

82
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,500
- I NEED TO BE THERE.

83
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,958
- OKAY, THEN.

84
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,250
- WHY ARE YOU
GIVING THIS TO ME?

85
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,083
- AS A FLAME HAZE,

86
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,625
MY MISSION IS TO MAINTAIN
THE WORLD'S BALANCE.

87
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,875
IT WOULD NOT
BE AFFECTED BY THE LOSS
OF AN ORDINARY HUMAN.

88
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,500
- WHA-
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

89
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,541
- THIS TREASURE TOOL
ALLOWS YOU TO SUMMON ME.

90
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,416
BUT IN DOING SO,

91
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,791
IT WILL CONSUME
ALL OF YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,625
IF THAT MYSTES
IS EVER IN DANGER,

93
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,791
I WANT YOU TO SUMMON ME.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

94
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,458
MAKE THE SACRIFICE,
FOR JOHAN'S SAKE,

95
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,750
AND MY OWN.

96
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,291
- ( Marcosias laughing )

97
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,791
I CAN'T BELIEVE
BAL MASQUE PULLED ONE OVER
ON THREE FLAME HAZE!

98
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,166
PRETTY PATHETIC
IF YOU ASK ME, LADIES.

99
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,375
- FUMINA KONOE.

100
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,916
- Alastor: SHE WAS AFTER
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,041
JUST AS WE SUSPECTED.

102
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,833
WE SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED
OUR INITIAL INSTINCTS.

103
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,791
I'M ASHAMED
WE WERE SO EASILY FOOLED.

104
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,625
- GIVE IT A REST, WOULD YA?

105
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,166
HOW THE HELL WERE WE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW KONOE WAS A SPY?

106
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,958
WE ATE LUNCH WITH HER,
WE HUNG OUT WITH HER.

107
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,333
SHE WAS OUR FRIEND, DAMN IT.

108
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
- OKAY, I'M DONE.

109
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,041
- SO WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON WITH HIM ALREADY?

110
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,500
- EVIDENTLY
BEFORE IT WAS RESEALED,

111
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,500
A TRANSMITTER OF SORTS
WAS IMPLANTED

112
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,958
IN THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

113
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,166
- SO THEY'RE WATCHING
HIS EVERY MOVE?
- MM-HMM.

114
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,166
- RESEAL THE TREASURE TOOL.

115
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,708
- AS IF THAT RIDICULOUS KEEPER
WASN'T ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH.

116
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,250
I CAN'T GO DIGGING TOO DEEP
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
OF KNOWING

117
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,958
WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE IN THERE.

118
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,000
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
I FINALLY HAD THE BASTARD.

119
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,000
- WHO?  THE SILVER?

120
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,125
- MM-HMM.

121
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,833
HONESTLY, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
SCREWED IF IT WASN'T FOR PHELES.

122
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,833
THE ONLY REASON BAL MASQUE
RETREATED

123
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,625
WAS BECAUSE SUMMONING JOHAN
SPOILED THEIR PLANS.

124
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,583
- CHANTER OF ELEGIES,

125
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
HE WAS ABLE TO MATERIALIZE

126
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,458
AFTER THE TREASURE TOOL
HAD BEEN RESEALED.

127
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,500
I WOULDN'T THINK
THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

128
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,000
- AS FAR AS I COULD TELL,

129
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,041
IT LOOKED LIKE JOHAN
MANIPULATED A SPELL

130
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,958
I WAS USING TO SECURE YUJI.

131
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,666
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO FORCE OUTWARD-FLOWING POWER

132
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,916
TO MOVE BACK INWARD,
BUT HE REVERSED IT

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,125
AND USED THE POWER FLOW
TO BREAK FREE.

134
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,041
- Marcosias:
HE ALTERED YOUR SPELL
TO BENEFIT HIMSELF?

135
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,166
GUESS HE'S A LOT SMARTER
THAN HE LOOKS.

136
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,666
- WELL, IT WOULD BE
A SIMPLE TASK INDEED

137
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,916
FOR THE CREATOR
OF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
TREASURE TOOL.

138
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,875
- HMMM!  WHATEVER.

139
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,833
HE'S JUST ANOTHER PROBLEM
LOCKED INSIDE THE POOR KID.

140
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,291
I FEEL FOR YA, BRO.

141
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,000
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

142
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,041
AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW
THAT BAL MASQUE

143
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,166
IS STILL GUNNING
FOR THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

144
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,666
- I CAN ONLY ASSUME THEIR PLAN
FOR ACQUIRING THE TREASURE TOOL

145
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,083
IS DESTROYING ITS MYSTES.
- Tiamat: PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

146
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,416
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM
TOUCH HIM!

147
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,166
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

148
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,125
- WE SHOULD PROBABLY
CONTACT OUTLAW FOR INFO.

149
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,583
CAN YOU DO THAT? 
- INDEED I CAN, CHANTER.

150
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,083
- I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR QUESTIONABLE ACTIVITY.

151
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,125
- Alastor: I HOPE I'M WRONG.

152
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,500
BUT WE'VE SEEN SO MANY DENIZENS
AND FLAME HAZE COME AND GO,

153
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,666
MISAKI CITY COULD BE
A MAELSTROM OF WARFARE.

154
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,416
- MAELSTROM OF WARFARE?

155
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,750
- I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION
THIS CITY

156
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,000
IS SOMEHOW
ATTRACTING THE MISFORTUNE
THAT HAS BEFALLEN IT.

157
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,333
AND I FEAR
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

158
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,125
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

159
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,041
- Shana: SO YOU THINK DENIZENS
AND FLAME HAZE

160
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,208
ARE SOMEHOW BEING DRAWN HERE?
 - THAT'S CORRECT.

161
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,333
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION

162
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,166
FOR THE CALAMITY
WE'VE WITNESSED HERE THUS FAR.

163
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,916
I FEAR
WHAT THE FUTURE MAY HOLD.

164
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,958
- WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE HOME AGAIN?
- WHO KNOWS?

165
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,708
- THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART
GROW FONDER.

166
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,458
- EVERY TIME I COME HOME,

167
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,416
YOU AND I PICK UP
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

168
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,458
BUT NOT SO MUCH WITH YUJI.

169
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,541
I LEFT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE'S MR. POPULAR.

170
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,750
WOULD YOU GIRLS
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM FOR ME?

171
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,958
- SURE, NOT A PROBLEM.

172
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,750
- YEAH, WE'D LOVE TO.

173
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,958
- CHIGUSA,
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

174
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,000
TO TAKE ME
ON A DATE TO THE AIRPORT?
- I'D BE HONORED.

175
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,166
THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

176
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,375
- YEAH, GO AHEAD.

177
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,833
- BE GOOD WHILE I'M GONE.

178
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,208
- THANKS.

179
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,666
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DAD.

180
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,333
- YOU TOO.

181
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:47,333
- Yuji: I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
SO DISTANT FROM MOM AND DAD.

182
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,875
- YUJI.
- YEAH?

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,500
- WILHELMINA TOLD ME
SHE WANTS YOU TO LEND HER
A HAND WITH SOMETHING.

184
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,708
- SHE WANTS ME TO HELP HER?
BUT WITH WHAT?

185
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,333
- LET'S GO FIND OUT.

186
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,583
- 'KAY.
THAT'LL WORK FINE.

187
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,708
I WANT TO ASK YOU
AND ALASTOR SOMETHING.

188
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,416
AND WILHEMINA
MIGHT WANT TO WEIGH IN TOO.

189
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,416
- I GUESS THIS
IS WHERE I SAY GOODBYE.

190
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
- UH, YEAH.

191
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,125
THANKS FOR COMING
TO SEE MY DAD OFF.

192
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,541
- SURE.

193
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,375
- WELL, I'LL SEE YA.

194
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,750
- I WISH I HAD THE KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP WITH SAKAI

195
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,958
THAT SHANA HAS WITH HIM.

196
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,000
I'M SO JEALOUS OF HER.

197
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,791
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

198
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,291
- YOU ARE AN ORDINARY HUMAN,

199
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,375
WHICH MAKES YOUR EXISTENCE
IN OUR WORLD FUTILE.

200
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,000
HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH
TO USE THIS,

201
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,833
YOU WILL PROVE
YOUR WORTH TO US.

202
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,666
THIS TREASURE TOOL
ALLOWS YOU TO SUMMON ME.

203
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,458
BUT IN DOING SO,

204
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:46,125
IT WILL CONSUME
ALL OF YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

205
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,375
- DON'T SEE YOU IN THIS PART
OF TOWN OFTEN.

206
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,000
- YOU SURPRISED ME.

207
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,000
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY HOME
FROM SAKAI'S HOUSE.

208
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,125
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

209
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,583
- ME?  I WAS JUST
GOING FOR A LITTLE WALK...

210
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,916
TO TANAKA'S.

211
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,541
- THIS PARK.

212
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,666
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

213
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,708
- KONOE.
- WHO?

214
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,125
- SHE WAS A GIRL IN OUR CLASS.
AND SHE WAS OUR FRIEND!

215
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,875
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
- WHOA.

216
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,791
CALM DOWN, KAZUMI.
DON'T BE UPSET.

217
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,458
I DON'T KNOW A KONOE.
- OH.

218
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,125
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

219
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,000
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

220
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:41,083
- Yuji: ALL OF THESE REPORTS
WERE SENT FROM OUTLAW?

221
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,291
- YES, BUT I'M AFRAID MOST OF IT
IS USELESS INFORMATION

222
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,083
REGARDING EVERYTHING
FROM LONG-TERM WEATHER FORECASTS

223
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,333
TO MAJOR TRAIN SCHEDULES.

224
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,625
- ( grunting )

225
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,291
I WOULD LIKE YOU TWO
TO ORGANIZE THIS MESS OF PAPER.

226
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT,
I'LL START COMBING

227
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,333
THROUGH THE REPORTS
FOR APPLICABLE INFORMATION.

228
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,041
- Tiamat:
LET'S GET TO WORK.

229
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,333
- YEAH.

230
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,375
- HEY, SHANA?
- YEAH?

231
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,708
- WOULD YOU MIND
LENDING ME BLUTSAUGER?

232
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,875
- WAIT,
YOU MEAN SORATH'S SWORD?
- YEAH.

233
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
- WHAT DO YOU INTEND
TO DO WITH IT?

234
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,958
- I WANT TO LEARN TO WIELD IT
SO I CAN HELP YOU FIGHT.

235
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,416
- YOUR CALL, ALASTOR.

236
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,125
- HMM.

237
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,666
CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT
OF DANGER HE'S FACING,

238
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,625
IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA.
VERY WELL.

239
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,750
- THANK YOU, ALASTOR.

240
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,166
- Wilhelmina:
BAL MASQUE WOULD NEVER
SEND THE SUPREME THRONE

241
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,125
JUST TO RESEAL
A TREASURE TOOL.

242
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,166
THEY MUST HAVE HAD
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

243
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,166
- ( creaking )

244
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,958
- PERFECT.

245
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,375
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
READY TO PROCEED.

246
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,000
AT THIS POINT,
EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP TO HIM.

247
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,583
- HA!
WELL, WHY SHOULD WE WAIT

248
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,583
WHEN I CAN BEGIN
TESTING HIS RESONANCE
AT THIS VERY MOMENT?

249
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,916
AHH, DOMINO, I COULD USE
YOUR ASSISTANCE HERE.

250
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,791
- AT YOUR SERVICE,
PROFESSOR!

251
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,333
- SO MANY SPELLS
IN ONE TREASURE TOOL.

252
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,000
THINKIN' ABOUT IT
MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.

253
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,666
- Marcosias: DON'T FORGET
YOU'VE STILL GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THE SILVER IS,

254
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,708
HOW HE MATERIALIZES
OUT OF NOWHERE,

255
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,208
AND WHAT IT WILL TAKE
TO KILL HIM.

256
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO DO SOME HOMEWORK,

257
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,250
MY TIPSY LITTLE SCHOLAR,
MARGERY DAW.

258
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,166
- I'M READY.

259
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,708
IT'S TAKEN ME SO MANY YEARS
TO FIND THE BASTARD.

260
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,250
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M LETTING HIM ESCAPE NOW.

261
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,625
- I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

262
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:20,166
BUT I WANT THE OTHERS
TO RESPECT ME.

263
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,416
I-- I WANT TO PROVE MY WORTH
TO THEM.

264
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:32,458
ACCORDING TO PHELES,
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT

265
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,291
IS TO SACRIFICE MYSELF.

266
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,916
BUT I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,583
'CAUSE WHEN I'M GONE,

268
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,000
SAKAI AND SHANA
WILL STILL BE HERE TOGETHER.

269
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,125
WHY?

270
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,083
( sobbing )

271
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,375
- ( grunts )

272
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,166
- DON'T JUST SWING
WITH YOUR ARMS,

273
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,000
PUT YOUR WHOLE BODY INTO IT
AND FEEL THE FLOW OF POWER
OF EXISTENCE.

274
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,791
- RIGHT.

275
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,541
I'VE GOT TO DO IT.

276
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,791
I'VE GOT TO GET STRONGER!

277
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,041
- Alastor:
I NEVER IMAGINED HE WOULD FIND
SUCH COMMITMENT.

278
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,166
- MMM.

279
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,458
- ALL I WANT--

280
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,291
ALL I WANT
IS TO BE WITH SAKAI.

281
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,916
- Pheles: IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH
TO USE THIS.

282
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,208
YOU WILL PROVE
YOUR WORTH TO US.

283
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,375
- ( twittering )

284
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,416
- ( theme music playing )


285
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,625
- Yuji: EVEN THOUGH MARGERY
PERFORMED A RESTORATION

286
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,000
AFTER HER RAMPAGE
THAT DEMOLISHED THE SCHOOL,

287
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,708
SHE COULDN'T FIX EVERYTHING.

288
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,916
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DAMAGE
DEEP WITHIN THE HEARTS

289
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,708
OF HER FOLLOWERS,
TANAKA AND SATO.

290
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,583
THE PATH THESE TWO HAD CHOSEN
TO WALK TOGETHER

291
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,708
IS ABOUT TO DIVERGE.

292
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,791
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

293
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,541
"RESPECTIVE PATHS."
