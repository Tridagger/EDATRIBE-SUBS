1
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,833
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,416
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,958
- ( wind whistling )

4
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,833
- ( jingles )

5
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,083
- Mare: A TRANSIENT

6
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,291
AND YET ETERNAL AFFAIR.

7
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,083
- ( birds chirping )
- ( car horns honking )

8
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,250
- ( people chattering )

9
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,416
- Yuji: THAT MORNING BEGAN
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER.

10
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,583
I WAS OFF TO MEET MY BEST FRIEND
FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL,

11
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,791
HAYATO IKE,
BEFORE CLASS.

12
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,000
IT FELT TOO NORMAL
TO BE MY LAST MORNING.

13
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,750
- ( students chattering )

14
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,291
- SAKAI.

15
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,250
- IKE.

16
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,500
WHAT'S UP?

17
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,875
- Hayato: WITH YOU AROUND,
IT DOESN'T FEEL

18
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,583
LIKE I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL,
YOU KNOW?

19
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,000
IT'S JUST LIKE
THE OLD DAYS.

20
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,083
- THAT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD THING, IS IT?

21
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,125
SO ARE YOU FREE
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY?

22
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,041
- NO, I'VE GOT TO GO
TO CRAM SCHOOL.

23
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,791
- JEEZ, YOU'RE ALREADY
PREPARING FOR COLLEGE?

24
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,708
- I'VE GOT TO DO WHAT I CAN
TO KEEP MY PARENTS HAPPY.

25
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,583
OTHERWISE MY ALLOWANCE
ENDS UP SUFFERING.

26
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,000
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

27
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,000
- I GUESS I'LL GO DOWN
TO THE STATION

28
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,000
AND CHECK OUT THE NEW
CD RELEASES.

29
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,791
UH, HOLD ON.

30
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,166
- HMM?

31
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,250
- IKE, DON'T YOU FEEL

32
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,416
LIKE WE'VE HAD
THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE?

33
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,375
CHERRY BLOSSOMS?

34
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,000
BUT IT'S SEPTEMBER,
RIGHT?

35
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,375
- YEAH, SO?

36
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,875
- THAT'S WEIRD.
OH, WELL.

37
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,291
- Yuji:
THIS IS OUR SECOND SEMESTER.

38
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,625
ALL THE CRAZY STUFF THAT
HAPPENED OVER SUMMER VACATION

39
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,875
HAS LONG SINCE BEEN
FORGOTTEN.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,708
- ( panting )

41
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,416
SAKAI.

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
HAVING A GOOD MORNING?

43
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,916
- YEAH, THANKS.
- HMM.

44
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,333
- YOSHIDA SURE HAS CHANGED.

45
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,375
SHE'S MUCH MORE CONFIDENT
THAN BEFORE.

46
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,833
- Hayato: YOSHIDA?

47
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
IF YOU'RE FREE
AT SOME POINT TODAY,

48
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,916
WOULD YOU MIND
HELPING ME PREPARE

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,708
FOR TOMORROW'S
STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING?

50
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,083
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.
IT'D BE HARD

51
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,375
TO DO THAT
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

52
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,333
- I APPRECIATE IT.

53
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,750
- IKE HAS DECLARED WAR IN
THE BATTLE FOR YOSHIDA'S HEART.

54
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,666
- ( yawns )

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,375
MAN, I'M STILL
SO FREAKIN' SLEEPY.

56
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:34,041
- I'VE HEARD THAT MARGERY'S
STILL STAYING AT SATO'S HOUSE

57
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,291
AND EVIDENTLY SHE'S REFUSING
TO CHANGE HER WAYS.

58
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,041
- ( giggles )

59
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,875
( giggles )
- ( giggles )

60
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,625
- SEE YA.

61
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,041
- Yuji: AND THEN THERE'S HER.

62
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,000
- QUIT FOLLOWING ME,
WILHELMINA.

63
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,500
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WALK ME TO SCHOOL.

64
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,666
- I DO NOT MEAN
TO BE A BOTHER, MILADY.

65
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,208
I SIMPLY WISH TO DETERMINE
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SCHOOL

66
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,208
IS UP TO STANDARD.
- Tiamat: WE WANT A TOUR.

67
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
- WHY CAN'T YOU WAIT
UNTIL I INVITE YOU

68
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,875
TO A CULTURAL FESTIVAL
OR SOMETHING?

69
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,500
GO HOME.
( grunts )

70
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,750
- ( sighs )

71
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,750
I WILL LEAVE
ON ONE CONDITION:

72
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,666
YOU MUST PROMISE TO ALERT ME
WHEN SUCH A FESTIVAL ARISES.

73
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,875
- Tiamat: UNTIL THEN.

74
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,208
- YUJI.

75
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,083
- ( Yuji's voice )
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

76
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,958
SHANA AND I ARE STILL
ALIVE AND WELL IN MISAKI CITY.

77
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,833
- ( students chattering )

78
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,083
- NOW YOU KIDS
WILL WANT TO TAKE NOTES.

79
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,458
- Yuji: SHANA DOESN'T
SEEM FAZED BY WHAT HAPPENED,

80
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,416
BUT I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THAT DAY.

81
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,250
RIGHT BEFORE WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO DISAPPEAR,

82
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,208
SHE SAID SOMETHING
TO ME.

83
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,833
- TENPA JYOUSAI.

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
I SHOULD TELL YOU...

85
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,041
YUJI, I--

86
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,333
- FOR SOME REASON
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER

87
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,916
WHAT SHE SAID
AFTER THAT.

88
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,208
- ( inaudible )

89
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,125
- DID SHE TELL ME SHE--?

90
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,875
NO, I MUST BE CRAZY.

91
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,708
THERE'S NO WAY SHANA FEELS
THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

92
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,125
- ( thud )
- THAT'S IT, HIRAI.

93
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,791
WHY ARE YOU JUST
SITTING THERE

94
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,833
WITHOUT YOUR NOTEBOOK
OR TEXTBOOK OPEN?

95
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,750
IF YOU'RE SO SMART,
FILL IN THE BLANK FOR US.

96
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,375
- YEAH, FINE.
- HUH?

97
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,291
- BUT I SHOULD
TELL YOU, SIR,

98
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,625
YOUR LITTLE FILL-IN-THE-BLANK
QUESTION IS LAUGHABLE.

99
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,125
WE'RE NOT PARTICIPATING
IN SOME SILLY GAME SHOW,

100
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,500
THEREFORE THE ANSWER SHOULDN'T
BE SO OVERWHELMINGLY OBVIOUS.

101
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,666
THE COMPLETED LINE IS,
"THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE,

102
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,083
BY ANY OTHER NAME
WOULD SMELL AS SWEET."

103
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,958
IT'S A LINE FROM
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S

104
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,625
"ROMEO AND JULIET."

105
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,958
SEEING AS YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO LEAVE IN THE WORDS "ROSE"

106
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,458
AND "AS SWEET," THE ONLY
VIABLE OPTION FOR THE BLANK...

107
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,083
- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE?

108
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,625
- ( gasps ) WOW,

109
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,041
YOU MADE THOSE, KAZUMI?
THEY LOOK SUPER YUMMY.

110
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,875
- THEY LOOK AMAZING.

111
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,083
- ( chuckles )

112
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,666
- DELICIOUS.

113
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,666
- YOURS TASTE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN WHAT'S SOLD IN STORES.

114
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,958
- YOU REALLY
THINK SO, IKE?

115
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,125
- ( chuckles )
- ( chuckles )

116
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,000
- ( wind whistling )

117
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,333
- IT'S STRANGE.
I KEEP GETTING THIS FEELING

118
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,333
THAT ALL THIS
HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

119
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,083
IT'S LIKE DEJA VU.

120
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,750
- THEY'RE HERE.

121
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,416
- IT'S A SEAL.

122
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,166
- HOW DO YOU DO,
DEAR YOUNG LADY?

123
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,750
I WONDERED WHEN WE WOULD
FINALLY MEET FACE TO FACE.

124
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
- IT'S FRIAGNE THE HUNTER.

125
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,791
BUT NO, THAT CAN'T BE.
SHANA, WHAT IS THIS?

126
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,875
- I GUESS YOU MUST BE
THAT RINNE'S MASTER.

127
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,500
- YES, YOU MAY CALL HER
MARIANNE.

128
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,666
I AM FRIAGNE THE HUNTER.

129
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
ISN'T THIS EXCITING,
GETTING TO MEET YOU IN PERSON,

130
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,666
ALASTOR,
THE FLAME OF HEAVEN?

131
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,875
- Alastor: I CAN'T SAY
THAT I'M THRILLED.

132
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,791
- BUT THEY HAVE MET.

133
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,416
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!

134
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
- AN INTERESTING CHOICE
OF CONTRACTOR--

135
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,166
THE FLAMING-HAIRED,
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

136
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,541
I'VE HEARD
OF YOUR STRENGTH.

137
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,500
- JUST TRY ME.

138
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,833
- ARGH!

139
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,250
- MY, IT WOULD APPEAR
THE TALES I'VE HEARD WERE TRUE.

140
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,458
- Yuji:
WHY IS FRIAGNE HERE?

141
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,458
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE DEAD.

142
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,083
SHANA AND ALASTOR
DON'T SEEM BOTHERED BY IT.

143
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,250
BUT WHY NOT?

144
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,000
- ( screams )

145
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,750
- NOT AGAIN.

146
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,500
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE.  WHAT'S GOING ON?

147
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,125
- ( bells jingle )
- HUH?

148
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,250
HUH.  BELLS?

149
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,958
- ( screams )

150
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,333
( screaming )

151
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,416
MASTER, I'M SO SORRY
I'VE FAILED YOU.

152
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE, MARIANNE.

153
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,416
THAT FLAME HAZE IS A BRUTE.
I'LL RETURN.

154
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,416
AND THEN I'LL CLAIM
MY PRIZE.

155
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,708
AFTER ALL, THIS IS
MY HUNTING GROUND.

156
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,541
- SHANA, WILL YOU
PLEASE EXPLAIN?

157
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,375
WHY IS FRIAGNE
STILL ALIVE?

158
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,541
- HE CALLED THIS
HIS HUNTING GROUND.

159
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,208
HE MUST BE THE REASON THERE ARE
SO MANY TORCHES IN THIS CITY.

160
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,208
- Alastor: YES.
I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS

161
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,416
IT'S ALL PART OF HIS PLAN.
- HE'S INSANE.

162
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,208
- SHANA, WOULD YOU LISTEN
TO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU?

163
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,125
WHY DID FRIAGNE SHOW UP HERE
WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD?

164
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,000
IT'S LIKE THE PAST
IS REPEATING ITSELF.

165
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,666
CAN'T YOU FEEL IT?

166
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,958
- I NEED TO REBUILD
BEFORE LEAVING THE SEAL.

167
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,833
- ( bells jingle )

168
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,500
- Yuji: WE SPENT THE REST OF THE
SCHOOL DAY

169
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,083
LEARNING THINGS
WE'D ALREADY COVERED.

170
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,041
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

171
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,458
- Hayato: WHAT'S UP, SAKAI?
ARE YOU HEADED HOME?

172
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,958
WHAT'S WRONG?

173
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,333
- CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT MONTH IT IS RIGHT NOW?

174
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,875
- WHAT?  IT'S SEPTEMBER,
YOU BIG DUMMY.

175
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,708
- BUT CHERRY BLOSSOMS

176
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,500
USUALLY BLOOM IN THE SPRINGTIME,
DON'T THEY?

177
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,291
- I'VE GOT TO DO WHAT I CAN
TO KEEP MY PARENTS HAPPY.

178
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,458
OTHERWISE MY ALLOWANCE
ENDS UP SUFFERING.

179
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,333
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

180
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,875
- WAIT.

181
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,458
WILHELMINA, THANK GOODNESS
IT'S YOU.

182
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,541
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MASTER YUJI?

183
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,250
HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THE MISTRESS?

184
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,750
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
JUST SHANA.

185
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,625
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON,

186
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,833
BUT DENIZENS WE'VE ALREADY
DEFEATED ARE SHOWING BACK UP.

187
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,375
IT'S LIKE HISTORY
IS REPEATING ITSELF.

188
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,583
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

189
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,416
- I MUST BE GOING.

190
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO WALK THE MISTRESS HOME.

191
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
- Tiamat: SCHOOL IS OUT
FOR THE DAY.

192
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,458
- WILHELMINA, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WALK ME HOME EITHER.

193
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
- I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
MILADY.

194
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,583
- FINE.

195
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,541
- YUJI, YOU'D BETTER NOT BE
LATE FOR TRAINING TODAY.

196
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,333
- Tiamat: BE PUNCTUAL.

197
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,333
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

198
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,208
EVERYONE'S ACTING
STRANGELY.

199
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,166
- ( bells jingle )

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,208
- I HEAR BELLS AGAIN.

201
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,625
I DON'T GET IT.

202
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,166
WHERE ARE THEY
COMING FROM?

203
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,375
THIS IS TOO BIZARRE.

204
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,958
IT MUST BE THE WORK
OF A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

205
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,375
BUT WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THEY UP TO?

206
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,416
COULD IT BE
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL?

207
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,000
WAIT.  YEAH,
MARGERY WOULD KNOW.

208
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,000
IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY,

209
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,916
SATO'S HOUSE
IS IN HAGINO-CHOU.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
BUT I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY BEEN THERE.

211
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
- ( bells jingling ) 
- ( Mare laughing )

212
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,958
- ( moaning )

213
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,000
- I'VE GOT TO TRY
TO CALM DOWN.

214
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,541
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO REALIZES
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

215
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,416
IF ANYBODY'S GONNA GET US
OUT OF THIS, IT'S GONNA BE ME.

216
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,333
BUT...

217
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,625
AM I GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO THIS ON MY OWN?

218
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,083
I'VE ALWAYS RELIED
ON SHANA FOR HELP,

219
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,958
BUT THIS TIME
SHE'S BEEN AFFECTED TOO.

220
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,916
ANY DENIZEN WHO'S CAPABLE
OF PULLING THIS OFF

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,916
HAS GOT TO BE
PRETTY STRONG.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,625
BUT IF IT IS
THAT POWERFUL,

223
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,041
THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY NOBODY ELSE

224
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
HAS BEEN ABLE
TO PICK UP ON IT?

225
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,208
I MEAN, EVEN IF IT IS USING
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL,

226
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,416
SHANA AND THE OTHER FLAME HAZE
WOULD HAVE SENSED ITS PRESENCE.

227
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,250
THERE'S NO WAY IT WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN PAST HER.

228
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,708
EXACTLY.
SHE WOULD HAVE NOTICED IT.

229
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,958
SO THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

230
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,500
WAIT, MAYBE I SHOULD
APPROACH THIS DIFFERENTLY.

231
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,666
WHAT IF IT HAS LESS TO DO
WITH HER AND MORE WITH ME?

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,208
WHAT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S NOTICED, BECAUSE--

233
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,958
THAT'S GOT TO BE IT.

234
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,416
- ( knocks on door )
- ( door opens )

235
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,458
YUJI, HON, I JUST MADE COFFEE.
WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP?

236
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,041
- MOM.
- HMM?

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,333
- IS IT THE SAME COFFEE
YOU ALWAYS MAKE?

238
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,041
- YES, IT IS.
YOU LIKE IT, DON'T YOU?

239
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,041
- THIS MAY SEEM LIKE
A WEIRD QUESTION TO ASK,

240
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,541
BUT COULD YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU BOUGHT THAT COFFEE?

241
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,166
- YOUR DAD CALLED ME
THIS MORNING

242
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,750
AND HE SAID HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT HOME SOON.

243
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,041
- ( both giggling )

244
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,750
- ( panting )

245
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,250
- SHANA!

246
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,958
- HERE YOU ARE,
DEAR BROTHER.

247
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,416
IT'S THE NIETONO NO SHANA
YOU'VE BEEN LONGING FOR.

248
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,708
- YAY.

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,625
- IF I'M RIGHT,

250
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,041
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO STOP THEM MYSELF.

251
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,708
IT'S WHY FRIAGNE SHOWED UP,
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW HE'S DEAD,

252
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,250
AND WHY I COULDN'T GO
TO SATO'S HOUSE.

253
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,375
IT'S THE REASON
THINGS FROM THE PAST

254
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,375
KEEP HAPPENING AGAIN.

255
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,083
I GET IT NOW.

256
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,833
- ( exclaims )

257
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,750
- IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SENSE,

258
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,625
SO I BET
I CAN DO THIS...

259
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,375
- STOP IT.
LEAVE HER ALONE.

260
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,833
- HE IS A FOOL,
DEAR BROTHER.

261
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,666
YOU HAVE
THE POWER NOW.

262
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,708
YOU CAN GO KILL HIM
IF YOU WANT TO.

263
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,333
- SHANA'S COMPLETELY HELPLESS
IN THIS SITUATION,

264
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,375
SO I GUESS
IT'S ALL UP TO ME.

265
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,375
JUST TO TEST
MY THEORY,

266
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,041
I WONDER IF I CAN REMEMBER
WHAT SHE SAID TO ME THAT DAY.

267
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,833
- YUJI, I...

268
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,500
- NO, ALL THAT CAN EXIST HERE
IS STUFF I ALREADY KNOW.

269
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,708
I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE
I'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

270
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,625
AND NO ONE CAN
ANSWER QUESTIONS

271
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,416
I DON'T ALREADY
KNOW THE ANSWER TO.

272
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,708
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS
IS A WORLD THAT I CREATED.

273
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,666
- ( giggling )
- ( bells jingling )

274
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,875
- A TRANSIENT
AND YET ETERNAL AFFAIR.

275
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,625
- THIS IS ALL
A DREAM!

276
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,291
- YUJI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SHANA.

277
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,458
- YOU CAN'T SPACE OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT.

278
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,083
- SORRY.
HOW LONG WAS I ASLEEP?

279
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,750
- Alastor: FOR NO MORE
THAN A FEW SECONDS.

280
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,458
BUT EVEN THAT'S
DANGEROUS IN BATTLE.

281
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,125
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR NAP
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

282
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,666
- DAMN IT,
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION.

283
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,083
- YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT.

284
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,958
THERE'S THE SHANA
I KNOW.

285
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,208
- YOU'RE NOT SLEEPWALKING,
ARE YOU?  NO MATTER HOW WEAK

286
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,500
THE DENIZEN MAY BE,
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

287
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,541
SHE HAS A VERY POWERFUL
TREASURE TOOL.

288
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,541
- YOU THINK SHE'S WEAK?

289
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,458
- WELCOME BACK, MYSTES.

290
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,500
HOW WAS YOUR
TRANSIENT DREAM?

291
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,250
( giggles )

292
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,958
- ( bells jingle )

293
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,083
- NOT TOO SMART,
SHOWING YOURSELF TO ME.

294
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,791
I CAN EASILY OVERPOWER YOU.
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN WIN.

295
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,583
- MAYBE NOT,
BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM

296
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,708
RISKING MY LIFE
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

297
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,250
AS A CRIMSON DENIZEN, I'M FREE
TO DO WHATEVER I PLEASE,

298
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,208
LONG AS I'M NOT CAUGHT.

299
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,416
- PARTY'S OVER.
YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT.

300
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,541
( shouts )

301
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,500
- ( bells jingle )
- ( giggling )

302
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,500
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE ENCOUNTERED

303
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,500
SUCH AN INCREDIBLY WEAK
CRIMSON DENIZEN.

304
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,166
- Alastor: HMM, HAD IT NOT
SHOWN ITSELF,

305
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
WE MAY NEVER HAVE EVEN
REALIZED IT WAS HERE.

306
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,291
- IT MAY HAVE BEEN WEAK,
BUT IT HAD A STRANGE POWER.

307
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE PUTTING YOU TO SLEEP

308
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,708
IN THE MIDDLE OF BATTLE?
- WELL, I THINK.

309
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,166
WAIT.

310
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,541
I JUST COMPLETELY FORGOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

311
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,083
WHAT WAS IT?

312
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,000
- JEEZ, YOU ARE
SLEEPWALKING.

313
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,166
- Alastor: YOU'VE GOT TO STAY
ON TOP OF YOUR GAME, YUJI SAKAI.

314
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,791
DON'T FORGET
THAT YOU HAVE

315
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,750
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
TREASURE TOOL INSIDE OF YOU.

316
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,000
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN BAL MASQUE

317
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,375
MIGHT COME AFTER YOU
TO STEAL IT FOR THEMSELVES.

318
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,958
- Yuji: I KNOW.

319
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,416
- OKAY, LET'S GO
TO SCHOOL.

320
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
- MM-HMM.

321
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,250
- UM, SHANA, I--
- GO ON.

322
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,541
- WELL, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

323
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
REMEMBER WHEN WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA DISAPPEAR?

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,583
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME
RIGHT BEFORE THE BLAST HAPPENED?

325
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,958
- ( Alastor gulps )

326
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,791
- HUH?  I--

327
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,541
I DON'T REMEMBER.

328
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,000
I PROBABLY THANKED YOU
FOR FIGHTING ALONGSIDE ME.

329
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,458
- I DEFINITELY HEARD YOU SAY
MY NAME, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

330
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,541
- I-- I SAID

331
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,791
I RESPECT YOU.

332
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,000
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

333
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,666
NOW WHAT?

334
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,541
- SO THAT'S ALL?

335
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,958
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP
SHUT UP!

336
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,625
WHAT I SAID
ISN'T IMPORTANT.

337
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,166
- IT CERTAINLY SOUNDED
LIKE IT WAS.

338
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,708
- HA!

339
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,916
WELL, NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH
FOR ME TO REMEMBER.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,250
- Yuji: IF YOU SAY SO.
- ( Alastor chuckles )

341
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,000
- Yuji: I SHOULD
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.

342
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,750
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE SAID--

343
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,166
- GOOD MORNING.

344
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,666
- HUH?  OH, HEY THERE.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

345
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,833
- YO, WHAT'S UP?
- OH, I DIDN'T SEE YOU, IKE.

346
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,208
- GOOD MORNING.

347
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,583
- I DID IT BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU, SAKAI.

348
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,875
- HEY, ABOUT YOSHIDA--

349
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,375
NEXT TERM I'M COMPETING
FOR HER HEART.

350
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,083
- GUESS THIS IS
ROUND TWO, HUH?

351
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,750
- AND THIS TIME
I'M SERIOUS.

352
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,708
- YEAH, WELL, SO AM I.
SO WATCH OUT.

353
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,208
- OW, MY HEAD HURTS
SO BAD.

354
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,291
WHY WON'T YOU DO SOMETHING
TO HELP ME OUT?

355
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,541
I'M GONNA THROW UP.
- Marcosias: I TOLD YOU TO STOP.

356
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,000
I SWEAR, YOU'RE LIKE
A BOTTOMLESS PIT WITH THE BOOZE,

357
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,333
MARGERY.  YOU JUST KEEP
GOING AND GOING.

358
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,833
I'M DONE
BABYSITTING YOU.

359
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,833
- STOP YELLING AT ME, MARCO.
- HEY MARGERY.

360
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,750
I BROUGHT YOU SOME WATER.
IT'S ON THE TABLE.

361
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,875
I'LL GET YOU SOME HANGOVER
MEDICINE ON THE WAY HOME.

362
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,458
- WELL, HURRY,
'CAUSE I'M DYING OVER HERE.

363
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,833
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
BE BACK SOON.

364
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,666
- Ogata: THE WEATHER'S
AWESOME TODAY, HUH?

365
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,166
- Tanaka: YEAH,
BEAUTIFUL WEATHER.

366
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,250
- ( bells jingling )
- ( Mare laughing )

367
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:20,000
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

368
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,666
- Yuji: THE MYSTERIOUS DREAM
I THOUGHT I HAD WOKEN UP FROM

369
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,666
STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.

370
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,500
BUT THIS TIME I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO GETS PULLED IN.

371
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,916
SHANA AND YOSHIDA
ARE TOO.

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,166
SHANA AND I DESPERATELY TRY TO
FIND A WAY OUT OF THE NIGHTMARE.

373
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,375
WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
MANIPULATING OUR DREAMS?

374
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,208
IT SEEMS THAT BEL-PEOL,
SYDONAY AND HECATE

375
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,208
ARE READY TO MAKE
THEIR NEXT MOVE.

376
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,500
BAL MASQUE BEGINS
A NEW PLOT.

377
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,333
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

378
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,333
"THE BEGINNING
OF EVERYTHING."
