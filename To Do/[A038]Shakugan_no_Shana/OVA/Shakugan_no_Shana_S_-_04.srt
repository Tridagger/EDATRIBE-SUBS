1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,458
- JUNKO, WOULD YOU...
- HUH?

4
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,000
- GO OUT... WITH ME?

5
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,125
- SURE.
- ( chuckles )

6
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,375
- ( giggles )

7
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,291
- ( sighs )

8
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,583
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
THAT JUNKO

9
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,416
WOULD END UP WITH
SUCH A HOTTIE?

10
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,583
- RIGHT?  GUESS HAMAGUCHI
LIKES THE QUIET TYPE.

11
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,000
THEY REALLY DO MAKE
A CUTE COUPLE THOUGH.

12
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,416
- THEY DO!

13
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,291
I'VE NEVER SEEN
JUNKO SO HAPPY.

14
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,333
- WELL, HE'S LUCKY,

15
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,250
'CAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT
TO GIVE UP ON HIM.

16
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,916
- ( beeping )

17
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,458
- WHERE TO?

18
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,208
WANT TO GO TO JOUSHI PARK?

19
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,458
YOU SAID THE ICE CREAM
THERE IS AWESOME.

20
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,791
I'D LIKE TO
GIVE IT A TRY.

21
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,416
- HMM.  SOUNDS GOOD.

22
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,666
- UH-- HEY,
YOU'RE WEARING IT.

23
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,791
- YEAH, I PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE WAITED

24
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,041
TO WEAR IT WITH
A NICER OUTFIT,

25
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,708
BUT I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

26
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,208
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHAT KIND OF STUFF YOU LIKE.

27
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,750
I DID OKAY ON 
THAT ONE THEN?

28
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,208
- MM-HMM.

29
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,666
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,291
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN EXPENSIVE.

31
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,666
- WELL, YEAH.

32
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,166
I HAD NO IDEA
JEWELRY WAS SO PRICEY.

33
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,791
BUT AS LONG AS YOU LIKE IT.

34
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,375
- YEAH, I LOVE IT.

35
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,083
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

36
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,041
- UH?  THE LIGHT.
- LET'S GO.

37
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,666
- ( pop music playing )

38
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

39
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,416
- AWESOME, THANKS.

40
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,750
TODAY WAS A BLAST.

41
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,833
- WHO KNEW THERE WERE
SO MANY THINGS TO DO HERE?

42
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,291
- WE SHOULD COME BACK.

43
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,750
- NEXT TIME, WE'LL HAVE TO
MAKE A DAY OF IT

44
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,875
INSTEAD OF JUST
DROPPING BY AFTER SCHOOL.

45
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,708
- HMM!

46
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,333
- YOU FREE SATURDAY?
- YOU BET.

47
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,916
- HOW ABOUT SUNDAY?
- YEAH, I'M FREE.

48
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,333
- OKAY.

49
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,916
WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING
WEEKEND?

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,625
- ALL YOURS.

51
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,333
- WHAT ARE YOUR SUMMER
AND WINTER BREAKS LOOKING LIKE?

52
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,750
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR CHRISTMAS YET?

53
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,583
- THAT'S MONTHS FROM NOW.
- JUST CHECKING.

54
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,958
- Junko: I HOPE WE STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER, HAMAGUCHI.

55
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,666
- Hamaguchi: FOREVER, HUH?

56
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,875
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

57
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,916
- ( gasps )

58
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,250
- JUNKO?

59
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,166
- ( gasps )

60
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,416
- KISSING A BOY IN PUBLIC?

61
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,666
HOW COULD YOU
BE SO SHAMELESS?

62
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,583
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

63
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,166
- YOU'RE STILL A CHILD.

64
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,666
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
MAKING OUT WITH A BOY.

65
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,000
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

66
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,500
THEY'RE ONLY AFTER
ONE THING.

67
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,000
- HAMAGUCHI ISN'T LIKE
THE OTHER BOYS!

68
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,833
- IF THAT WERE TRUE, 
HE'D KNOW BETTER THAN
TO EVEN TRY.

69
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,458
- IT IS TRUE! YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM!

70
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,708
- NO, WAIT.
- LET GO!

71
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,000
( gasps, groans )

72
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:46,958
- ( gasps )

73
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,916
JUNKO?

74
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,875
- THIS BRACELET HOLDS
NO INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE DENIZEN.

75
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
- Alastor: EVIDENTLY,
THE GIRL'S SOUL WAS CONSUMED

76
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,041
WITHOUT HER EVEN
REALIZING IT.

77
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,041
- THE ONLY TIME SHE
COULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKED

78
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,416
WAS WHEN SHE WAS
WITH HAMAGUCHI. 

79
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,208
- CAN YOU EXCUSE ME?
- MM-HMM.

80
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,125
- BE RIGHT BACK.
WAIT HERE.

81
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,583
- OKAY.

82
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,958
- EXCUSE ME, MAY I HAVE
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME? 

83
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,541
- HUH?

84
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,041
- I'M A PROFESSIONAL 
PHOTOGRAPHER IN TOWN,

85
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,833
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR MALE MODELS.

86
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,833
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
SOME SHOTS OF YOU.

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,416
- UH...

88
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,833
- YOU'VE GOT A GREAT LOOK,

89
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,500
AND I'D LOVE TO
CAPTURE IT ON FILM.

90
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,750
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

91
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
HOW ABOUT IT?

92
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,041
- I'M WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

93
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,916
- WE CAN WRAP IT UP
WHENEVER SHE RETURNS.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
- WELL...

95
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,125
Hamaguchi:
HE'S CREEPY LOOKING,
BUT HE SEEMS LEGIT. 

96
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,958
I GUESS IT'LL BE COOL
TILL JUNKO GETS BACK.

97
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,541
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

98
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,916
- MUCH OBLIGED.

99
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,833
- ( camera shutter clicks )

100
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,791
- THE CAMERA LOVES YOU,
YOUNG MAN.

101
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,958
THANKS AGAIN.

102
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,958
I GOT SOME FANTASTIC STUFF.

103
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,958
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA 
DO WITH THE PICTURES?

104
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,583
ARE THEY FOR A MAGAZINE?

105
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,750
- WELL, UH...

106
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,166
- IF THEY'RE PRINTED,
I'D LIKE TO PICK ONE UP.

107
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,166
- COULD YOU COME BACK TOMORROW
AND POSE SOME MORE FOR ME?

108
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,333
SCHOOL UNIFORM'S NOT BAD,

109
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,125
BUT I'D LIKE TO SHOOT YOU
IN SOMETHING TRENDY.

110
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,333
SAY YES, AND I'LL NOT ONLY
GIVE YOU THE PICTURES

111
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,916
WE'VE TAKEN TODAY,

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,500
BUT I'LL PAY YOU A SMALL
STIPEND FOR YOUR TIME.

113
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,083
- SERIOUSLY?

114
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,583
OHH, I HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

115
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,166
BUT I COULD DO SATURDAY?

116
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,000
- THAT WORKS FOR ME.
SEE YOU THEN.

117
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,375
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

118
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,000
- Shana: BY THE TIME
YUKIO HAMAGUCHI

119
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,416
FINALLY FOUND JUNKO OGAMI...

120
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,166
- Alastor: SHE HAD ALREADY
BECOME A TORCH.

121
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,541
- HER SOUL MUST
HAVE BEEN CONSUMED

122
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,041
WHILE HE WAS BEING
DISTRACTED.

123
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,041
I SUSPECT THE PHOTOGRAPHER
IS OUR DENIZEN.

124
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,041
SEEMS AN ODD CHOICE
OF HOBBY THOUGH.

125
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,375
- Alastor:
THERE ARE DENIZEN

126
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,041
WHO HAVE USED THEIR
LOVE OF ART

127
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,291
TO LURE IN PREY.

128
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,541
IT APPEARS THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT THIS PHOTOGRAPHER IS 
ATTEMPTING TO DO.

129
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,041
- HMM.

130
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,208
HOWEVER,
IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY

131
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,625
JUNKO OGAMI'S SOUL
WAS CONSUMED,

132
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
AND YUKIO HAMAGUCHI'S WAS NOT.

133
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,625
- Alastor:
OR THE MYSTERY OF
THE AMERICAN TORCH.

134
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,541
PERHAPS WHEN WE MEET
WITH YUKIO HAMAGUCHI

135
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,625
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER
TOMORROW,

136
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,333
OUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

137
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,083
- ( sighs )

138
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,708
THAT BRACELET IS
OF NO USE TO ME.

139
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,208
- JUNKO?

140
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,916
FORGET SOMETHING?

141
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,666
IF YOU'RE MEETING HAMAGUCHI,

142
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,041
YOU SHOULD WEAR THIS.

143
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,458
- ( chuckles )

144
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,208
- OH.

145
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,250
YOU READY TO GO?
- YEAH.

146
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,333
- Hamaguchi: MAN, I'M GLAD
SHE DECIDED TO COME ALONG.

147
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,041
I KNOW, I'LL ASK TO TAKE
A PHOTO OF US TOGETHER. 

148
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,333
- Shana: I CAN DEFINITELY
SENSE A DENIZEN IN THIS CITY.

149
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,333
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE
RATHER WEAK.

150
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:56,166
IT MUST BE AWARE OF 
MY PRESENCE AS WELL.

151
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,833
WHY HASN'T IT SHOWN ITSELF?

152
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,833
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
ATTACKED ANY MORE HUMANS.

153
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,625
I WONDER WHAT IT'S AFTER.

154
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,083
WHAT?
- NOTHING.

155
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,166
YOU JUST HAD A WEIRD
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

156
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,250
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE HAVING FUN. 

157
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,291
- Shana: HAVING FUN?

158
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,416
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO COME ALONG

159
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

160
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,333
I CAN GO ALONE.

161
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,333
IT'S COOL EITHER WAY.

162
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,375
- NO, I WANT TO.
- OKAY.

163
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,791
- Shana: I JUST CAN'T
LET HIM SUSPECT ME.

164
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,208
I HAVE TO MIMIC
JUNKO OGAMI TO 
SET HIM AT EASE.

165
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,291
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY?

166
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,333
- UH--
( chuckles )

167
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,958
HUH?

168
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,625
YOUR BRACELET?

169
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,041
- MY MOTHER WAS
ABLE TO FIX IT.

170
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,541
- OH, GOOD.

171
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,208
SO YOU MADE UP WITH HER.

172
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541
I'M REALLY GLAD.

173
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,166
- Shana:
I WILL FIND THIS DENIZEN.

174
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,250
- HUH.  I GUESS
HE HASN'T MADE IT YET.

175
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,083
- THIS IS WHERE
YOU ARE TO MEET HIM?

176
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,250
- YOU'RE SO FORMAL.
YEAH.

177
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,041
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

178
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,000
WANT TO HAVE A SEAT
WHILE WE WAIT?

179
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,666
HERE YOU ARE, MILADY.

180
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,041
- THANKS.

181
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,416
CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE
YOU FOUND ME SPACING OUT?

182
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,916
- OH, IT WAS OVER THERE
IN FRONT OF THAT LAKE. 

183
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,916
- Shana: SO CLOSE.

184
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,083
NO MORE THAN 15
OR 16 METERS.

185
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,375
- I'LL GET US SOME DRINKS.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

186
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,000
- A NON-CARBONATED
BEVERAGE, PLEASE. 

187
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,458
NOTHING TOO SOUR,

188
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,291
AND I PREFER
NATURAL FRUIT FLAVORS.

189
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,125
- UH, WHAT?
- JUST GET ME SOME FRUIT JUICE.

190
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,375
- AS YOU WISH.
SIT TIGHT.

191
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,875
- WELL, ALASTOR,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

192
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,875
- Alastor: THEY WERE IN
SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY.

193
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,708
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

194
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,291
I SUSPECT THE DENIZEN
CAST A SEAL

195
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,208
ENTRAPPING BOTH 
YUKIO HAMAGUCHI,

196
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,625
AND JUNKO OGAMI.

197
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,708
BUT WHY WAS ONLY
ONE OF THEIR SOULS CONSUMED?

198
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,708
- SERIOUSLY.
IT JUST DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE.

199
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,458
- Alastor:
THERE MUST BE A REASON.

200
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,875
BUT WE HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING,

201
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,166
SHORT OF ASKING
THE DENIZEN ITSELF.

202
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO SENSE ITS PRESENCE?

203
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,083
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

204
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,333
AND I FIND THAT
DISTURBING.

205
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,416
( gasps )
NO WAY.

206
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,125
HAMAGUCHI'S VANISHED.
- Alastor: WHAT?

207
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,750
- HE'S GONE.

208
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,791
I TOOK MY EYES OFF HIM
FOR A SPLIT SECOND.

209
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,583
- Alastor: A HUMAN CANNOT
MOVE THAT FAST.

210
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,958
IT'S HERE!

211
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,041
- YOU SEE THAT?
IT LEFT US A TRAIL.

212
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,916
( grunts )

213
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,208
- Alastor:
EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL DENIZEN

214
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,708
WOULD NEVER BE BRAZEN ENOUGH

215
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,791
TO LEAVE BEHIND
SUCH AN OBVIOUS TRAIL.

216
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
- HE WAS ABDUCTED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

217
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,250
AND I DID NOT
SENSE ANYTHING.

218
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,958
WHICH CONFIRMS HOW WEAK
IT MUST BE.

219
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,708
- Alastor:
IT MUST HAVE A DEATH WISH

220
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,541
IF IT HAS THE AUDACITY
TO ABDUCT SOMEONE

221
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,250
IN FRONT OF A FLAME HAZE.

222
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,750
- DAMMIT.

223
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,500
I SHOULD HAVE WATCHED HIM.

224
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,416
THAT'S THEM.
- Alastor: RIDICULOUS.

225
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,083
IT'S TRYING TO
ESCAPE IN A TRUCK?

226
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,750
- WISHFUL THINKING.

227
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,041
( grunts )

228
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,708
( gasps )

229
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,250
A SEAL?

230
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,875
ARE THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS?

231
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,458
- IF IT ISN'T
THE FLAMAING-HAIRED,

232
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,625
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER...

233
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,375
- Alastor:
IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

234
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,083
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

235
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,666
- ( chuckles )
AND OF COURSE,

236
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,625
SHE'S JOINED BY
THE GREAT FLAME OF HEAVEN.

237
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,208
( laughs )

238
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,208
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
BELONG TO ME...

239
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,875
THE RELISHING EMBRACE,
UKOBACH.

240
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,208
- UKOBACH?

241
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,125
- Alastor: I HAVE NEVER
HEARD THAT NAME.

242
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,958
- WELL, NOW YOU HAVE.

243
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,500
ONE DAY IT WILL BE SYNONYMOUS
WITH UNLIMITED POWER AND BEAUTY.

244
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,000
- Alastor:
YOUR FORM IS SO PRIMITIVE

245
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,416
IT'S NO WONDER WE
COULD NOT SENSE YOUR PRESENCE.

246
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,833
- I AM IN THE MIDST OF
SEARCHING FOR A NEW ONE.

247
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,750
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING
THESE ATTRACTIVE YOUNG MEN

248
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,916
SO I COULD COMBINE 
THEIR BEST FEATURES

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
TO CREATE THE PERFECT FORM.

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,125
- THAT IS WHY YOU'VE
COME TO THIS WORLD? 

251
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,958
I FIND YOUR REASONING 
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE.

252
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,041
- Alastor: A DENIZEN'S FORM
MUST MATCH ITS TRUE NATURE.

253
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,708
- YES.

254
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,458
SOME DAY I'LL TAKE ON 
A FORM I FIND FITTING.

255
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,375
- IT WON'T WORK.
YOU'RE TOO WEAK.

256
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,958
- EXCUSE ME?

257
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,958
- NORMALLY I'M ABLE
TO SENSE THE PRESENCE

258
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,000
OF EVEN THE WEAKEST
OF DENIZEN.

259
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,291
HOWEVER, YOUR PRESENCE
WAS NO STRONGER THAN
THE HUMANS'.

260
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,208
- ( gasps )

261
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,458
- YOU ARE SO WEAK,

262
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,000
EVEN IF YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF CREATING THE PERFECT FORM,

263
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,708
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO SUSTAIN IT.

264
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,333
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
YOUR CURRENT FORM

265
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,333
IS ALREADY A PERFECT FIT
FOR YOUR TRUE NATURE,

266
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,291
A HIDEOUS BLOB.

267
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,833
- ( growls )

268
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,000
- GIVE UP.
YOUR ATTACKS ARE NO MATCH
FOR THE NIETONO NO SHANA.

269
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,583
- ( sighs )
- GO BACK TO THE CRIMSON WORLD.

270
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,250
YOUR SEARCH FOR
A NEW FORM IS FUTILE.

271
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,208
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT CAUSE HUMANS
PAIN AND SUFFERING.

272
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,791
- ( chuckles )

273
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,250
YOU KNOW THIS BOY?

274
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,791
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
HE'S STILL ALIVE? 

275
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,375
I USED MY TREASURE TOOL,
ATLANT,

276
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,208
TO CAPTURE HIM
PHOTOGRAPHICALLY

277
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,208
WITHOUT CAUSING HIM HARM.

278
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,625
- AND THE OTHERS?
- THEY'RE ALL ALIVE.

279
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,166
THEY'VE SIMPLY BEEN FROZEN
IN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

280
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,625
- ( gasps )

281
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,291
- Alastor:
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

282
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,958
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE AMERICAN MAN

283
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,666
WHO WAS FOUND RECENTLY?

284
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,416
- HE HAD BECOME WEATHERED,
SO I CONSUMED HIS SOUL.

285
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,375
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT HIS
POWER OF EXISTENCE

286
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,416
WOULD RUN OUT
BEFORE HE WAS FOUND.

287
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,125
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE
COME AFTER ME?

288
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,791
OR IS IT BECAUSE I ALSO
CONSUMED THE SOUL

289
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,833
OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S
LITTLE GIRLFRIEND? 

290
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,958
- ( grunts )
- STAY BACK,

291
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,625
OR I'LL KILL HIM.

292
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,666
- YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO THREATEN A FLAME HAZE.

293
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,500
- IMAGINE HOW
THE WORLD'S BALANCE
WOULD BE AFFECTED

294
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,625
IF I CONSUMED ALL THESE
HUMAN SOULS AT ONCE.

295
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,250
I HAVE THE UPPER HAND,
FLAME HAZE.

296
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,250
ONE FALSE MOVE
AND THEY'RE DEAD,

297
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,833
LIKE YOU!

298
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,083
THEY'RE GONE.

299
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,541
- AAH!

300
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,291
- ( shouts )

301
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,625
- ( Ukobach groans )

302
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,625
- Alastor: NICE WORK.
THE HUMANS REMAIN UNHARMED,

303
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,708
AND THE DENIZEN'S
TREASURE TOOL IS 
NOW IN OUR HANDS.

304
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,625
- ( sighs )
- ( car horn honks )

305
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,500
- Alastor: I ALMOST FORGOT
WE'RE ON A TRUCK. STOP IT!

306
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,041
- DAMN. AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS OVER.

307
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,875
- ( sighs )

308
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,875
I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF.

309
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,375
I HOPE JUNKO'S BEHAVING.

310
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,708
( sighs )

311
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,708
SHE'S NOT MY LITTLE BABY
ANYMORE.

312
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,916
MAYBE...

313
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,333
I SHOULD INVITE HIM
OVER FOR TEA ONE DAY.

314
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:42,708
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HURT
FOR ME TO GET TO KNOW THE BOY.

315
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,000
YOU NEVER KNOW.

316
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,333
( chuckles )

317
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,291
LET'S NOT RUSH THINGS.

318
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,250
- ( siren wailing )

319
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,416
- ( moans )

320
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,375
- SPAIN-- NO, HE'S BRAZILIAN.

321
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,208
ANYONE HERE SPEAK
PORTUGUESE?

322
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,958
- I THINK THIS GUY'S
ITALIAN.

323
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,666
- WATER.
KEEP HIM HYDRATED.

324
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,375
- Hamaguchi:
WHAT HAPPENED?

325
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,541
HOW DID I END UP HERE?

326
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,375
JUNKO...

327
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,375
I WAS WITH JUNKO.

328
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,791
WHERE IS SHE?

329
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,833
( gasps )

330
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,500
( chuckles )

331
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,458
THANK GOODNESS.
SHE'S OKAY.

332
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,833
- ( chuckles )

333
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,000
- JUNKO.

334
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,500
JUNKO?

335
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,458
- THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

336
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,250
- DON'T LEAVE.

337
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,458
( gasps )

338
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,916
- ( EMTs chattering )

339
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,791
- Junko: I HOPE WE STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER, HAMAGUCHI.

340
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,000
- WHAT'S THIS?

341
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,625
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

342
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,041
WHOA.

343
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,416
WHY AM I...?

344
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,041
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SON?

345
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,458
ARE YOU IN PAIN?

346
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,875
- UH-UH.

347
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,416
( crying )

348
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,458
- Alastor:
THIS MISSION WAS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

349
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,333
- FOR YOU.

350
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,750
I FIND IT DIFFICULT
TO ASSIMILATE WITH 

351
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,000
THE HUMAN BEINGS.

352
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,333
- Alastor:
I HAVE NO DOUBT

353
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,500
THAT ONE DAY
YOU WILL COME UPON A HUMAN

354
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:36,083
WHO IS ABLE TO
RELATE TO YOU.

355
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,916
- MAYBE SO.

356
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,416
BUT THAT MAY ONLY
CAUSE MORE TROUBLE.

357
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,083
I HOPE ON OUR NEXT MISSION,

358
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,083
I'LL GET THE CHANCE
TO FIGHT A CRIMSON LORD.

359
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,458
- ( Alastor chuckles )

360
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,041
- Shana: OTO.

361
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,000
AND AFTER THAT,
WE'LL REACH MISAKI.

362
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,291
- ( theme music playing )

363
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

364
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,250
- Shana: THIS IS THE PLACE THAT
FIRST BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

365
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,916
MISAKI CITY.

366
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,250
SINCE THE DAY WE MET,

367
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,083
WE'VE FOUGHT COUNTLESS
BATTLES TOGETHER.

368
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,291
BUT IT HASN'T ALWAYS 
BEEN ABOUT THE FIGHT.

369
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,958
THEN ONE DAY,

370
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,458
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

371
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,375
SO WE MEET AGAIN.

372
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,125
YUJI.
