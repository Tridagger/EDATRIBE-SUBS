00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,350
If I move closer,
he’ll run for it.

177
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,520
Forget this. It’s now or never.

178
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,520
I’ll blast him from over here.

179
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,260
He’s moving! Now!

180
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,160
- I got it!

Josuke: Here we go.

185
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,240
That weird machine
must be his stand.

186
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,710
All right, pal,
come and get some

187
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,640
if you think you’ve got
what it takes to beat me.

188
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,050
Just know that my next shot
is gonna take you out for good.

189
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,420
damn it!
He’s running under the table!

190
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,120
No, you don’t!

191
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,660
Jotaro, what the hell
are you doing?!

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,060
The rat’s in here! ( Gasps )

193
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,670
That shape.

194
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,900
Not good!

195
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,000
His stand fires projectiles!

196
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,170
Shining diamond: Dora!

197
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,610
Josuke: What now?

198
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,180
Should I slap it away
with my bare hands?

199
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
No, that’s disgusting.

200
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,610
Where’s the rat?

201
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,350
did I hit it with
my ball bearing, or did I miss?

202
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,180
( Rat squeals )

203
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,390
( Josuke gasps ) You bastard.

204
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,320
( Rat shrieks )

205
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,260
Josuke: Yeah!
I got him after all!

206
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,000
It wasn’t between his eyes like
I said, but he’s still a goner.

207
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,000
That was a close one.

208
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,140
( Sighs )
Hey, jotaro, get over here!

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,110
I took out the rat!
The hunt is over.

210
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,140
Jeez, what were
you doing in there?

211
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,450
You went missing right
when I needed you the most.

212
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,210
I was starting to think
you’d abandoned me.

213
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,120
But, hey, at least it’s dead.

214
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,120
Luckily everything
went according to plan.

215
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,350
Well, for me, that is.

216
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,990
Our rat friend
wasn’t so fortunate.

217
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,260
though his stand shot
some needle-like things at me.

218
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,630
Whatever they were,

219
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,600
I bet they’re what
turn your flesh to goo.

220
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,730
He got to the people
who own this place,

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,330
but they’re still alive.

222
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
I’ll fix ’em right up
with shining diamond.

223
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,040
Jotaro: If we don’t
eliminate him by sundown,

224
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,670
things might get even messier.

225
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,480
Josuke: Huh?

226
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,680
Jotaro: There was another rat,

227
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,680
and that one managed to hit me.

228
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,580
( Josuke gasps )
Jotaro, your hand is melting!

229
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,550
Jotaro: It happened
in the other room.

230
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,390
I could have dodged the attack,

231
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,990
but I thought catching
the needle for analysis

232
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,190
was the best choice.

233
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,390
All it takes is a touch,

234
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,760
and its stand’s poison
begins to permeate,

235
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,560
even melting other stands.

236
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,530
Five or six hits,

237
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,140
and you’ll turn into
a quivering mass of flesh.

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,540
Josuke: Ohh! Good thing
that needle didn’t hit me.

239
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,340
Never thought i’d be grateful
for being squeamish.

240
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,540
Jotaro: The rat
bolted out the door

241
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,180
after hitting me
with the needle.

242
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,610
Somehow it must have figured out

243
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
you killed its kin
here in the kitchen.

244
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,980
Um, sorry to bother,

245
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,420
but would you mind using
your power to fix my hand?

246
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,220
Josuke: Uh, not to worry.
Just leave it to me.

247
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,190
damn it. Why’d those
little s.O.B.S have to multiply?

248
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,730
Man: This is the speedwagon
foundation research department.

249
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,100
jotaro: Hello.
This is jotaro kujo speaking.

250
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,500
Man: Jotaro! Finally.

251
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,710
We’ve tried to reach you
several times.

252
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,410
Jotaro: I was hunting the rat
and had the ringer off.

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,310
Is this about otoishi?

254
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,250
Man: Yes. Akira otoishi
was withholding the fact

255
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,550
that he shot two rats
instead of one.

256
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
Jotaro: Are you sure?

257
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,350
is there any chance he
could have shot three or four?

258
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,090
Man: No, sir.
We’re sure it’s two.

259
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,690
Jotaro: Oh, good grief, otoishi.

260
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,500
What a fool.

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,100
when it comes
to its own territory,

262
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,770
it’ll kill everything,
humans and rats alike.

263
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,100
It cares only about itself.

264
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,240
So this savage’s time on earth
is about to come to a fast end.

265
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,510
Let’s move.

266
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,810
josuke: Jotaro,
hold on a minute, would you?

267
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,610
a pint-sized rodent
just ran into an open field.

268
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,520
How exactly do you plan
on tracking this thing down?

269
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,790
Jotaro: The famous artist
Ernest Thompson seton once said

270
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,750
there’s not an animal
on the planet

271
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,120
that cannot be tracked.

272
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,160
You have to know their habits.

273
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,560
rats are known
to avoid unfamiliar paths,

274
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,560
which means its route of escape

275
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,130
had to be that
irrigation channel from before.

276
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,740
And there’s something else
about rats.

277
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,640
if they’re
not constantly eating,

278
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,510
they’ll starve
within a few hours.

279
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,610
there.
Those are fresh bite marks.

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Josuke: Nice going.
This is an awesome start.

281
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,150
Now we’re gonna corner
that bucktoothed bastard!

282
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,590
( Sighs ) Take a look at this.

283
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,460
I don’t think he even gave
a damn that our bait was here.

284
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,160
Jotaro: He’s on tape.

285
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,640
Huh. His ear looks
like a bug-eaten leaf.

286
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,210
what do you say
we call him "bug-eaten"?

287
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,040
He’s being cautious.

288
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,810
This isn’t gonna be
like at the house.

289
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,380
Bug-eaten is gonna
be extra careful

290
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,610
to not let us get
within 20 meters of him.

291
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,220
These are live rifle rounds.

292
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,590
Worst-case scenario, we’ll have
to use these to finish the job.

293
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,390
Josuke: Wait. Those are real?

294
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,590
Jotaro: Yeah, they have to be.
Because of air resistance,

295
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,460
ball bearings lose accuracy
when traveling over 20 meters.

296
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,230
With a bullet nose like this,

297
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,200
we’ll be able to hit our Mark
up to 70 meters away.

298
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,540
Josuke: Will I
have to launch that

299
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,300
with my stand’s hand, too?

300
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,570
’cause I don’t think
i’m ready for that just yet.

301
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,180
Jotaro: Point taken.

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
I’ll have to be
the one to do it.

303
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,350
Josuke: Hold it right there.

304
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,220
Just what are you trying to say?

305
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,120
that comment
didn’t sit well with me.

306
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,230
I am the one who nailed the rat
back at the house, remember?

307
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,790
Sure, it wasn’t exactly
a perfect shot, but still...

308
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,030
Jotaro: Guess you’re right.
Take two.

why would they
randomly stop like that?

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,300
I know. He’s under us.

325
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
He must have burrowed a hole
and covered himself.

Jotaro: No.

327
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,700
This is called backtracking.

328

I didn’t know rats
could do this, too.

329
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,770
Josuke: Backtracking?

330
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,610
Narrator: Backtracking is
the way in which a wild animal

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,380
reverses itself
by stepping in its own tracks.

332
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,380
This confuses predators
long enough for them to hide.

333
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,650
In Japan, the behavior
has been observed

334
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
with brown bears,
weasels, and rabbits.

335
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,360
However, it is unheard of
among rats and other rodents.

336
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,730
josuke: Okay,
so let me get this straight.

337
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,630
you’re saying
that a common brown rat

338
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,230
pulled a fast one on us?

339

a turn for the worse.

the good news
is bug-eaten’s attack

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,750

before the poison spread,

So far, no sign
of any more needles.

373
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,160
He knows a random firing
would give away his location,

374
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,230
and its obvious
he doesn’t want to be attacked.
