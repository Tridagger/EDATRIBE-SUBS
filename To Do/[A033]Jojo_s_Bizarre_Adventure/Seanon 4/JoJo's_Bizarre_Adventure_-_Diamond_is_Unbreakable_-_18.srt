step foot out of town.

and some creepo

183

of my innocence. Hee hee.

235

What you were attempting
to do just now is honestly

236
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,680

to pay for our friendship.

with a little business venture?

so much money you can make

by picking up
leftover change, right?

255

I know things have worked out
for you so far,

256

approach for harvest.

nothing corrupt about it,

in the process.

262

Josuke: Well, that’s where
the business part comes in,

265
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,240
and as compensation
for coming up

266
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,180
with this marvelous proposal,
you give us half the profits.

267
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,910
the other half
will go to you, shigechi.

268

The three of us are gonna
have to put our heads together

the payday we deserve.

for a few ten thousands,

should be the adults here

delicately.

Josuke: ’cause they’re nothing
but worthless junk now,

468
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,040

shigechi to pick these up

470

when he was grabbing
all the other tickets.

471
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,050
Josuke: You mean these losing

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,050
new year’s postcard
lottery letters?

473
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,790
And just how would you know
if these were losing tickets?

474
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,620
Josuke: That’s an easy one.

475
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,860
No one’s gonna throw away
a winning ticket, you dumb-ass.

476
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,230
Okuyasu: You say that,
but i’ve heard

477
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
that a lot of people
forget to check their numbers

478
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,330
and then end up missing out
on claiming their prizes.

479
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,670
if this wins,
you have to promise me

480
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,240
I can take half of it
for myself. Are we clear?

481
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,340
Shigechi: Fine by me.
half, it is.

482
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,240
And if you win
a sheet of stamps

483
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,910
instead of cold, hard cash,
i’ll let you keep that, too.

484
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,080
( Okuyasu chuckles )

485
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,010
Josuke: Jeez, okuyasu,
I never realized

486
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,650
how much you liked those
cheap, little gambling games.

487
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,750
Okuyasu: That one’s no good.
How ’bout this?

488
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,750
I didn’t really
think about it before,

489
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,920
but do you think I can
collect lottery prizes

490
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,520
if i’m still in high school?

491
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,090
Josuke: I don’t see
why you couldn’t.

492
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,630
So long as you have your I.D.
And name stamp on you,

493
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,060
it should be smooth sailing.

494
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,230

495

Aw, man, that’s lame.
It’s just another dud.

496
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,940
Thought I had it this time.
Guess not.

497
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,540

Hey, question--

501
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,760
if I happened to win
the lottery by chance,

502
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,820
would I have to take it
to the police?

503

Josuke: You idiot! Why would
you turn it in to them?

504
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,800
Harvest only picked up
what people threw away.

505
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,800
It’s not stealing.
And besides that,

506
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,900
unless you were
to somehow magically win,

507
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,800
it’s a moot point, right?
but best of luck.

508
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,810
okuyasu: What?!
This says, "sg group 121314"!

509
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,610
- Josuke: Eh?
- Shigechi: Huh?

510
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,780
Okuyasu: "Sg group 121314"?!

511
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,980
It’s sg group 121314!

512
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,320
Josuke: Whoa there. What are
you getting so worked up about?

513
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,320
( Okuyasu gasping )

514
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,690
Yaah! Five million!

515
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,690
There’s no doubt about it!
I won!

516
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,060
( Shrieks )

517
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,260
Josuke: Wait!
Are you kidding me?!

518
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,100
This better not
be a stupid joke.

519
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,900
( Both shrieking, laughing )

520
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,370
Josuke: Great!

521
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,940
♪

522
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,840
Okuyasu: Oh, yeah!
A dream come true!

523
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,270
Incredible!

524
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,710
We’re the first to ever
experience this greatness!

525
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,280
Josuke: Don’t get
ahead of yourself!

526
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,650
( Panting ) Settle down.

527
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,120
Let’s just double-check
to make sure you actually won.

528
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,290
"Sg group 121314,
prize five million yen."

529
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,960
Well, there you go. It’s hard
to believe, but it’s true.

530
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,230
If you hadn’t found this
lottery ticket when you did,

531
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,630
it would have been
off to the incinerator.

532
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,200
Look, it expires in a few days.

533
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,900
We have to get this to the bank.

534
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,700
And if they ask us
a bunch of questions,

535
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,570
we’ll tell them
we bought it fair and square

536
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,900
and hope they believe us
so we can get the cash.

537
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,170
You good on that plan?

538
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,770
Okuyasu: You know it.
Lie and get the dough!

539
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,340
Josuke: All right! We’re gonna
be five million yen richer!

540
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,680
( Okuyasu laughs )

541
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,750
Josuke: Now what
should I buy first?

542
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,750
i know. I’ll get
some sick Italian shoes.

543
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,250
Then i’ll buy
a new designer suit

544
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,690
that complements
my sexy physique.

545
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,020
After that, it’s on to tonio’s
for his most expensive dish.

546
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,730
And of course i’ll have
to go someplace cool abroad.

547
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,990
Okuyasu: I’m saving
all my money!

548
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,660
josuke: Wow!
Talk about playing it safe!

549
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,770

( Shigechi growls )

551
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,770
My harvest did
all the heavy lifting

552
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,870
while those two goofed around.

553
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,610
Every last yen of that
five million belongs to me.

554
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,980
