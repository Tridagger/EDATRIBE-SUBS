earlier has dried and hardened.

not a part of me anymore.

186

187

and stick it
to whatever I want.

188
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,380
In fact, I trapped some
inside a chunk of glass.

189

bloodstain on his jacket

190

than me.

Just one more shot,

210
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,310

will bask in victory!

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,380
And, man, i’ve never
seen him make one this big!

214
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,250
I guess he’s
not messing around.

215

This has gotta be
his last-ditch attack.

216

Well, two can play at that game.
Here we go!

218

The same attack isn’t
gonna work on Kira twice!

219
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,730
You know that! He’ll deflect it!

221

until we try, right?

222
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,440
By the way, hayato,
i’m sorry to bother you,

223
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,980
but I put that lighter
I was using back in my pocket.

224
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,010
Grab it for me.

225
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,380
I’d do it myself,

226
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,480
but this piece of wood
stuck in my side

227
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,020
is kind of getting in my way.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,920
Hayato: You don’t need
to make smoke anymore!

229
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,690
You can already see
the air bullet, right?!

230
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,420
Josuke: You’ve got it all wrong.

231
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,890
I’m not using the lighter
to see the bullets.

232

It’s for something else
entirely. Trust me here.

Josuke: Time’s come.

how he knows where I am.

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Stay very still, hayato.

Josuke: I’m starting
to get the feeling

241
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,550
he’s not observing us
with his eyes.

242
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,220
He may be listening
to our every move.

243

Hayato: Huh?

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,650
Josuke: Kira was clutching
a cell phone.

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
Simple coincidence? Yeah, right.

246
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,330
So who was on the other end
of that call?

247
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,560
His boss from the office? Nah.

248

in the world
