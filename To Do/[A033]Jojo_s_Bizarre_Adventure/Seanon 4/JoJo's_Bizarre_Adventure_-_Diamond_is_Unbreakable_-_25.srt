Actually, it was
his former house,

68
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,690
He was born in morioh
on January 30, 1966.

69
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,690
He’s nearly two meters tall,

70
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,400
he weighs 65 kilograms,
and his blood type is a.

71
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,000
He was born to older parents.

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,270
When he was 21, his father,
yoshihiro, fell ill and died.

73

Seems his mother
died soon after.

74

graduated in 1988
with a degree in literature.

75
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,250
Same year, he starts
at kameyu in s city

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,550
and, in 1993, transfers
to the morioh branch.

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,990
He has no previous
criminal record,

78
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,890
has never married,
has no close friends or lover.

79
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,790

81

you’re trying to say

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
so he certainly
wasn’t a star athlete.

87
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,740
Nothing speaks to his talents.

89

even here,
he’s trying not to stand out.

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,950
he’s never been
the object of ridicule or envy,

91
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,850
and he never reveals
his strengths

92
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,150
or weaknesses to anyone.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690

his talent and intellect.

96
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,330

the best way
to stay out of trouble.

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,930
My hope in coming here

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,700
was to find
hobbies or interests,

100
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,600
any clue in the slightest.

Jotaro: Hobbies?
I may have found one.

102

For some weird reason, he keeps
a bunch of jars in this drawer.

Jotaro: Notes? You mean
those numbers on the jars?

120

You mean he’s been collecting
these things since 1983?

( Gasps ) There are
details about every finger!

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,890
According to this, in 1983,
his right thumb grew a nail

124
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,660
that was
31 1/2 centimeters long!

125
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,860
Wait a sec! I’m pretty sure 1983

126
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,600
was the year
reimi sugimoto was murdered!

127
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,740
Jotaro: Yeah, and the records
begin in that year.

128
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,540
He probably reached a point

129
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,440
where he couldn’t repress his
murderous impulses any longer.

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,910
Josuke: Whoa!

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,450

133
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,580

a very interesting hobby.

134

Look.

135
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,520
This is a form of divination.

136
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,520
it’s similar
to ancient Jewish merchants,

137
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,930
who once observed sunspots
to predict economic prospects.

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,100
It appears yoshikage Kira
is tying his nail growth

139
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,600
to his physical and
mental preparedness.

140
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,570
His preparedness to kill,
that is.

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,630
Josuke: Could he have been
maybe working with a partner?

153

jotaro: No way.
He’s too cautious for that.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,240
more people
means more risk for capture.

155

A partner could
just rat him out.

156

jotaro: Yeah.
Considering reimi’s situation,

169
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,540
it’s entirely possible
that his father

170
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,670
is stuck in some kind
of spiritual limbo

171
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,170
between the land of the living
and the dead.

172
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,510
Look at his expression.

173
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,780

the foggiest clue,

348

but i’m not gonna sweat it.

349
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,930

as a sheet, we should be good.

I can’t breathe!

351
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,970
It’s torture in here!
Can’t I have a bit of air?!

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,910
Just poke a couple
of holes in the tape,

353
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,240
and let me catch my breath.

354
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,310
What? You seriously
can’t breathe in there?

355

your leg, koichi.

Don’t fall for it.

357
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,050

an opening so he can get away.

Yoshihiro: I know
you don’t trust me,

359

but I really
am dying in here, I swear!

360

Koichi: I don’t know
about this, okuyasu.

361
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,120

362
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,390

the poor guy’s going through.

363

quit your bitchin’, geezer.

364
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,260
if you really need
a breathing hole that bad...

365
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,030
I’m more than happy to help.

366
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,670

working out for you?

was that sound just now?!

we might have messed up!

387

the tacks to escape?

only happening cause of me!

392
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,660
I stuck some tacks in it,
and he did something weird!

393

Eh? Wha?

394
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,430

duped, my blockhead friend!

395

and you lost!

i mean,
this is the bow and arrow,

400
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,320
but why is it here?
I just don’t understand.

401
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,550
We already retrieved them
from otoishi!

402
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,160
I thought the speedwagon
foundation was guarding them.

403

Is this another set?

At least now we know

419
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,630
what kira’s father was
trying to stop us from finding!

420
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,830
he was hiding
another bow and arrow!

He simply outsmarted us.

424

definitely kira’s father.

425

As long as those chumps don’t
get this arrow, we’ll be fine.

430
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,260
And in the meantime, i’ll use it

431
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,460
to make even more enemies
for them to face!

432
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,530
Jotaro: The bow and arrow.
So it’s true.

433
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,460
I had a feeling there
might be more than one set.

434
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,100
That would explain
how dio and his henchmen

435
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,400
were able to pull together

436
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,200
such a large group
of stand users so quickly.

437
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,870
They built an army of minions
across the globe

438
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,280

of bows and arrows.

probably obtained this set

441

from enyaba the witch,

442
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,350
and we already know
okuyasu’s brother keicho

443
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,720
came into possession of one

444
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,390
at some point
before they arrived in morioh.

445
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,830
Stand users really do seem
to be drawn to each other.

Yoshihiro: Oh, yoshikage,
where are you?

what makes you happy,

that’s what I get for
doing business with schmucks!

517
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,920
Learn to live
within your means!

518
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,420
Shinobu: You’ll get your money--

519
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,660
kira: No, I think
you misunderstood me earlier.

520
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,520
I said I was short on cash,

521
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,430
but I meant that I only had
a little over 500,000.

522
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,830
- Landlord: Ah!
- ( Shinobu gasps )

523
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,000
Kira: I’ll only be able
to pay for this month,

524
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,070
last month, and for the next
couple of months in advance.

525
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,700
Will that suffice for now?

526
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,110
Landlord: Yes,
that’ll do nicely.

527
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,910
thanks so much.
Have a good one. ( Chuckles )

528
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Until next time.

529
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,580
( Door closes )

530
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,050
Shinobu: Wh-what was that?

531
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,880
I don’t know how,

532
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,390
but you must
have stolen that money.

533
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,450
there’s no point
trying to say that you didn’t.

534
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,960
you stole it from
the landlord’s bag, didn’t you?

535
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,690
if anyone else
was in this situation,

536
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,930
they’d be horrified that their
partner could do such a thing,

537
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,770
but his gusto,

538
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,970
the way he stole the money
and lied about it so easily...

539
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,440
I’ve been with him
for so many years,

540
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,870
but he’s never made me
feel like this before.

541
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,440
It’s exhilarating.

542
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,450
It’s like i’m falling in love
with him for the first time.
