Apparently the baby
has formed a bond

with josuke’s dad, Mr. Joestar.

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,060
People assume manga is born
of imagination and fantasy,

175
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,430
but they couldn’t be more wrong.

176
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,830
A great manga is one
that captures things

177
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,870
experienced, seen, and felt
by flesh-and-blood beings.

178

exquisite spider, for example,

180
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,470
something a typical city-dweller
would kill in disgust.

181
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,510
The way the legs
connect to the body

182
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,480
and the positions
of its many eyes,

183
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,980
even subtle differences
between the male and female--

184
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,550
a manga artist must understand

185
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,680
each of these elements
to draw a spider.

186
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,050
It’s said a spider’s silk
solidifies when exposed to air,

187
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,960
but have you ever given
any thought to its spinnerets?

188
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,730
- ( Both yelp )
- Rohan: And then there’s

189
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,200
the intricate arrangement
of its internal organs.

190
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,160
How does a spider squirm,

191
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
especially when it’s
been sliced open

192
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,500
and awaiting certain death?

193
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,770
To depict reality in detail,
one must know such things.

194
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Koichi: That’s barbaric!

195
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,180
rohan: Silence!
How dare an amateur like you

196
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,480
give Rohan kishibe
his opinion?!

197
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,850

voicing my opinion at all!

for a taste.

200

( Koichi gasps )
Holy shit.

201
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,960

202
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,190

really are total weirdoes.

Rohan: An excellent
expression of agony.

204
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,900

I simply must sketch it!

208

Eh, let’s forget
about the sketch.

209
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,680
It won’t be of any use.

Hazamada: Oh. I’m sorry.

211
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,820
You wanted autographs.

212

I’ll see if I can find a pen
in the kitchen.

213

that there’s something
really dangerous about Rohan.

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,230
Hazamada: Dangerous?
What do you mean by that?

230

those hippie artist-types

234
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,740
would call avant-garde,
but that doesn’t mean you should

235

about him being a stand user.

let’s say Mr. Rohan

actually is a stand user.

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,820

don’t you think?

Everything in here

347
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,470

353
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,850
In these pages, koichi hirose,
i’ve just uncovered

354
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,960
the mother lode
of manga material.

355
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,660

What the heck are you
planning to do to us now?!

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,810
Rohan: You mean
it isn’t obvious yet?

360
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,540
I’m going to use your memories
to write my manga!

ask you nicely once

364
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,780
to stop attacking us
with your stand!

365
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,920
If you persist--

366
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,020
( Rohan chuckles )
What will you do?

367
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,160

sound attack? Just try it.

368
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,020
( Koichi gasps )
Don’t test me.

369
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,560
If you don’t release me
from your stand right now,

370
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,900
I won’t hold back!
This is your last chance!

371
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,130
Rohan: Yes, I know.
There’s actually a section

372
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,230
devoted to that
written on page 11.

373
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,240
you’ve always been
far more timid than most others,

374
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,910
and many tend
to blatantly disrespect you,

375
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,770
but when push comes to shove,

376
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,010
you find the courage
to conquer your fears.

377
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,850
Remarkable. I like you already.

378
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,250
And as for my readers,

379
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,980
they’ll feel the same
once they get to know you.

380
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,520
Koichi: I’m not bluffing,
you hear me?!

381
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,990
I’ll attack if I have to!

382
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,590
Rohan: You really don’t know
when to shut up, do you?

383
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,790
Try it, if you dare!

384

How’d my attack miss?!

387

Hazamada: You honestly missed
at that range?

388
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,840
I thought you let it
go wide on purpose!

389
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,610
Hate to break it to you,
but your aim is shit.

390
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,710
( Koichi growls )
I won’t miss this time!

391

Hazamada: Where are
you attacking?!

392
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,180
That wasn’t even close!

393
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,020
rohan:
Unfortunately for you, koichi,

394
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,890
I took the Liberty of placing
a little safety lock on reverb.

395
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,590
You can attack me
to your heart’s content,

396
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,690
but you’re no longer able
to land a blow.

397
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,230
Hazamada: Safety lock?

398
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,330
( Koichi groans )

399
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,340
rohan: Take a look.
It’s in the margin on page 11.

400
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,610
i added that new rule as
a little bit of a safety measure

401
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,770
just in case
you used your stand.

402
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,740
( Koichi whimpering )

403
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,180
Do you see?

404
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,350
This is the awesome power
of heaven’s door.

405
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,660
Through it, I can
use words and pictures

406
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,930
to read people’s experiences
or create brand-new memories.

407
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
It doesn’t matter what sort of
tricks you have up your sleeve.

408
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,060
you’ll never
be able to do me harm

409
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,600
as long as I have this power.

410
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,530
Koichi: Shit!
What do I do now?!

411
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,070
( Rohan laughs )

412
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,570
Chin up, koichi,

413
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,580
that’s all the tampering
i intend to do.

414
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,680
if I meddled
with your pages any further,

415
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,850
your precious life
would lose all authenticity,

416
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,250
and you’d no longer be
of any benefit to my work.

417
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,920
All right, now let’s have a look
at your pages, hazamada.

418
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,260
Hazamada: You’re a genius
in every sense of the word, sir!

419
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,990
I respect you so much!

420
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,730
Rohan: I suppose
we’ll see about that.

421
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,030
Now then, you sometimes
find a sense of comfort

422
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,130
in picking on creatures
weaker than you,

423
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,970
like helpless kittens
and small birds.

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,170
You want to have
your way with junko,

425
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,370
a junior from class e,

426
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,240
but are too cowardly
to act on it.

427
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,140
Your testicles
often grow sweaty,

428
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,010
and when you adjust them
during class,

429
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,310
nothing thrills you more

430
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,050
than the thought
that someone might see you.

431
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
You’re a disgusting troll.

432
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,990
Including someone like you
in my manga

433
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,650
would drive readers away.

What am I gonna do now?!

437
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
I’m hopeless!

438

- Koichi: Why?
- Rohan: Hmm?

Koichi: Why are you doing this?!

440
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,700
You don’t need any of my
experiences to create stories.

441
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,300
you’re a spectacular
manga artist all on your own!

442
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,640
Every reader in the world
knows that!

443
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,070
Also, you’re only
20 years old

444
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,740
and live in this amazing house!

445
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,110
Think of how blessed you are

446
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,650
compared with most people
your age!

447
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,780
So why do you need my memories

448
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,980
- when you’re already great?!
- ( Rohan growling )

449
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,190
How stupid can you be?!

450
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,050
Do you think that I,
Rohan kishibe,

451
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,290
draw manga to gather money
and admiration?!

452
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,690
I draw manga so that people
around the world will read it.

453
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,200
My only objective is for people
to read my work.

454
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,370
i know it’s
a single, simple reason.

455
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,430
Even so, it’s all I care about.

456
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,070
People want honesty
when they read my work,

457
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,940
so I search for inspirational
realism every day.

458
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,940
And truth be told,
I absolutely love

459
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,940
the feeling
of finishing a manuscript.

460
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,380
Everyone feels good

461
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,410
after finishing a project
they’ve worked hard on,

462
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,720
but that gratification
is fleeting and immaterial.

463
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,850
After the initial rush
of euphoria is gone,

464
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,990
I begin to think no one will
read the manga I slaved over,

465
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,060
and my deep-seated insecurities
begin to flare up.

466
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,230
"What if all my readers
are gone by next week?"

467
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,360
what if I don’t know
what to draw for the next issue?

468
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,870
What if I lose
the ability to draw?

469
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,700
what if
my motivation disappears?"

470
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,240
These are the recurring thoughts
that have tormented me

471
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,380
over and over since I was
a 16-year-old novice,

472
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,050
until three months ago,
when a mysterious stranger

473
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,010
shot me to the core
with an arrow

474
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,980

the ability of heaven’s door.
