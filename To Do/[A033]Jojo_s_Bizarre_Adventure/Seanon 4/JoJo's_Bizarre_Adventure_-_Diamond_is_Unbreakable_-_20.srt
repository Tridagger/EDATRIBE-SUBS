00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,400
but, hey, if you and yukako
are really into each other,

348
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,910
then I wish you both
the best of luck.

349
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,180
koichi: Thanks,
but that’s not the problem.

350
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,180
i don’t know
what’s going on with her,

351
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,110
but she’s refusing to see me.

352
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,420
- both: Huh?
- Koichi: It’s all so baffling.

353
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,080
She’s been absent from school
for two days.

354
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,420
She won’t answer the phone
or say a single word.

355
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,490
She’s off the grid,
but how come?

356
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,530
Okuyasu: Wow, so she went awol
after you guys kissed?

357
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,290
Josuke: And you haven’t
talked to her since?

358
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,330
- Koichi: Not a word.
- Okuyasu: Uh-oh.

359
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,000
The silent treatment’s
a real bad sign.

360
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,200
it’s a shame, too.
I admired her crazy devotion,

361
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,900
but ghosting you like this
is so uncool.

362
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,510
Josuke: It’s gonna
be awkward as hell,

363
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,940
but I think your best bet

364
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,110
is asking yukako
about it face to face.

365
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,310
i’m sorry, bud, but we
shouldn’t get involved in this.

366
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,420
Koichi: Yeah.

367
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,050
Okuyasu: But if
things turn ugly,

368
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,990
give us a holler,
and we’ll rush over.

369
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,950
We’ll be there to help
before you know it.

370
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,120
Koichi: Thanks, guys.
I’ll see you both later.

371
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,420
Josuke: See you.

372
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,860
( Okuyasu crying )
But still, damn that koichi.

373
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,360
Why does he get to kiss a girl?

374
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,830
Josuke: Calm down!

375
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,960
You’re freaking out
over nothing again.

376
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,970
( Koichi gasps )

377
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,170
I’d know that hair anywhere.

378
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Yukako!

379
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,440
( Yukako gasps )

380
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,840
Koichi: Please, wait up!

381
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,880
We need to talk!

382
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,280
( Sighs ) Yukako?

383
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,810
( Yukako shudders )

384
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,480
- ( Koichi gasps )
- Yukako: I’m sorry.

385
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,890
i don’t know
who you’re referring to.

386
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,390
Koichi: Oh, my mistake.
i saw your hair

387
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,560
and thought
you were someone I know.

388
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,830
♪

389
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,030
Hmm?

390
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,070
yukako: No,
I don’t want you to go!

391
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,510
Ohh. Oh, koichi.

392
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,020
( Stifled yelling )

393
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,060
( Shrieks )

394
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,560
Why the hell would you do this
to me, you conniving shrew?!

395
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,390
My face is falling apart,

396
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,560
and your stupid makeup
just cracks and flakes away!

397
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,530
( Aya screams )

398
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,130
( Yukako panting ) Damn you.

399
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,940
You’re a backstabbing bitch!

400
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,010
Turn my face back to normal!

401
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,980
( Aya sighs ) Foolish girl.

402
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,880
Seems you didn’t follow
my instructions.

403
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,880
( Yukako yelps )

404
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,480
It’s such a shame.

405
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,420
I truly thought i’d impressed
upon you the importance

406
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,220
of applying the cinderella
lipstick every 30 minutes.

407
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,560
yukako: So this is
my punishment for forgetting?

408
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,490
( Gasps ) What is this?

409
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
My hands, what the hell
is wrong with them?

410
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,390
( Shrieks )

411
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,460
The skin on my hands
is breaking down!

412
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,130
Aya: Your palm lines and
fingerprints are disappearing.

413
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,900
that’s what happens
when you don’t follow orders.

414
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,240
that lipstick was
an assurance of good fortune

415
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,640
during your quest for love.

416
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,010
Tremendous energy is required

417
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,350
to change the course of one’s
destiny, and it’s all used up.

418
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,010
You’ve only yourself to blame

419
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,920
for not taking
your destiny seriously.

420
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,150
Yukako: Hey! Do you wanna die?!

421
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,690
Aya: Die, you say?

422
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,590
Ambition and wealth aren’t
my only motivating factors,

423
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,160
so save the intimidation.

424
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,290
i modeled myself
after the fairy godmother.

425
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,530
She was a sorceress
of the highest level

426
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,200
and bringer of happiness.

427
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,270
It really is such a shame.
It’s clear to me now

428
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,170
that I never should have tried
to make your wish come true.

429
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,010
Your face and palms
are long gone.

430
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,340
They’ve been erased
from this world.

431
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,180
Yukako: What did you say?

432
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,510
Aya: That they’re gone.

433
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,280
and who has use
for things with missing parts?

434
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,520
Yukako: My face,
it’s gone forever?

435
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,990
This isn’t fair.

436
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,990
how am I supposed
to live my life like this?

437
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,320
Koichi: Yukako.

438
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,260
( Yukako gasps )

439
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,060
It’s koichi.

440
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,230
why is he here?
I can’t let him learn my secret.

441
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,170
No, i’m afraid not.

442
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,270
Sorry, but you’ve got
the wrong person.

443
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,070
- Aya: Hmm?
- Yukako: Dr. Aya,

444
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,540
your beauty institute
is for women only, correct?

445
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,270
I want him out of here now.

446
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,680
( Sighs )

447
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,650
Koichi: Nice try,
but you can’t fool me.

448
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,280
I’d know that tough-as-nails
temperament anywhere.

449
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,020
Now I know for sure
you’re yukako.

450
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,520
( Yukako gasps )

451
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,220
koichi: Your personality
leaves a real strong impression.

452
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,620
And this lady,

453
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,160
she’s a stand user.
Is that right?

454
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,460
From what i’m gathering,
she did something to you.

455
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,230
( Yukako gasps ) It’s all over.

456
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,630
I can’t live like this.

457
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,170
You’ll pay for this.

458
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,040
Aya tsuji, i’m gonna murder you!

459
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,740
Aya: Don’t give in to despair.

460
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,170
( Yukako gasps )

461
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,410
( Gasps )

462
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,510
Koichi: What the hell?!
Part of her face flew off

463
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,280
and is flying around the room!

464
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,680
Aya: There we go.

465
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,450
So this is koichi. Hmm.

466
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,390
He saw through
your altered state

467
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,390
and identified you as yukako.

468
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,430
You tried denying yourself
in front of him,

469
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,700
but some people just have
an eye for character.

470
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,700
All right, yukako.

471
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,640
out of consideration
for this young man’s efforts,

472
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,640
i’ll give you one final chance
as a fairy godmother.

473
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,740
Select one of these faces.

474
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,580
You have one chance,
so choose wisely.

475
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,550
Know that your original face
is no more,

476
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,220
but cinderella remembers
the face of each patient

477
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,290
that has made use of its ability
and can replicate them.

478
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,090
Now pick your own face
from among the samples.

479
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,230
If you can find it,
there’s a chance

480
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,560
your original features
could be restored.

481
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,430
your palms
and fingerprints, too.

482
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,640
much like cinderella
and her famous glass slipper,

483
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,500
i invite you
to find your perfect fit.

484
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,110
yukako: Why didn’t you
say that earlier, Dr. Dumbass?!

485
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,310
I’ll be out of here
in no time flat!

486
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,310
I look in the mirror every day,
so how hard can this be?

487
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,850
Aya: Don’t get cocky. If you
choose someone else’s face,

488
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,820
it’ll clash with your own,
as you might have imagined.

489
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,420
actually,
why sugarcoat the truth?

490
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,120
As an authority
on all things beauty,

491
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,490
I can say your face
will become grotesque.

492
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,530
No one will want to look at it.

493
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,260
what’s more,
the contours of your face

494
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,100
will dictate your destiny.

495
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,330
( Yukako panting )

496
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,770
Koichi: Hey, yukako,
be extra careful.

497
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,510
Remember, your face is reversed
when you look in a mirror.

498
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,310
Yukako: Yeah, you’re right.

499
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,150
Aya: Poor girl.

500
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,780
truth is,
none of the faces are correct.

501
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,620
Every one is a fake.

502
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,820
If you can figure that out,
i’ll return your face to normal.

503
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
that is
the fairy godmother’s rule.

504
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,830
yukako: Damn it.
The more I look at them,

505
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,830
the more they look like my face.

506
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,530
But this is the one.
It has to be.

507
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,740
No way i’d be able
to forget my own face.

508
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,570
Aya: You sure about that?

509
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,210
Once you try it on,
you’ll know for sure.

510
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,840
( Koichi gasps )

511
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,480
( Yukako panting )

512
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,220
no, i’m wrong.
This isn’t the right face.

513
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,520
I almost missed it,

514
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,690
but my eyes have
more of a slant than these do.

515
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,730
( Gasps ) Which one is it?

516
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,300
I have no idea! What if I
make the wrong decision?!

517
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,300
Aya: Hmm.

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,940
What’s wrong?

520
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,440
You have a face to choose,
so get to picking.

521
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,410
Yukako: No, I won’t.

522
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,810
I refuse to choose.

523

Koichi: But why?

524
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,580
Aya: So what are you saying?

525
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,720
You want to live out your life
without a face?

Yukako: I’m saying
I want koichi to choose.

Yukako: That way...

529
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,360
It’ll be a face koichi can love.

530
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,520
I couldn’t care less
what it looks like,

531
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,460
and the amount of luck it has
doesn’t mean a thing to me.

532
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,430
I’ll bear with the outcome
and live a life free of regret.

533
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,330
Koichi: But what if
I get it wrong?

534
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,640
- What’ll you do?!
- Aya: Hmm?

535
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,370
Yukako: I’ll deal with it.

536
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,240

Here. This is it.

539
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,760
I can’t tell you why I chose it.

540
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,790
I guess it’s just intuition.

541
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,390
But if I did mess up
and choose the wrong face--

542
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,730
oh, by the way,
this guy’s my stand, reverb.

543
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,900
Right, so, anyway,
if I screw up,

544
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,770
i want you
to wound reverb’s eyes

545
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,240
- and blind me for life.

Koichi: I know you said
you wouldn’t have any regrets,

547
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,450
but knowing you like I do now,
you’d secretly get really upset

548
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,010
if I couldn’t see you
just the way you’ve always been.

549
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,950
and, though I
couldn’t see it before,

550
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,420
i’m in love with you.

551
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,490
I couldn’t bear
to see you unhappy.

552
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,460
That’s why the best solution

553
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,420
would be for me
to never see again.

It’s a perfect fit!

( Yukako laughs ) Koichi!

562

Koichi: Yeah, we did it, yukako!

563
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,850
Yukako: It’s all ’cause you were
brave enough to choose my face.

aya: To think
he’d sooner blind himself

565
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,860
than witness his beloved
suffer unhappiness.

566
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,630
I figured, as fairy godmother,

567
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,460
i’d bend the rules
and give them a happy ending.

568
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,300
after all,
if I stole the eyesight

569

of an innocent young man,

570
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,370
what kind of fairy godmother
would I be?
