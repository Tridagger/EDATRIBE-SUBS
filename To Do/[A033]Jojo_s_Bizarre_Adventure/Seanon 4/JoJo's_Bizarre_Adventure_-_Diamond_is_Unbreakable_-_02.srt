If you have a plan, now's the time.

368
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,570
How do we get out of this?

369

370

Come on. This way.

375
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,720
The wall's gonna repair itself.

382
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,770
I predicted that you'd break through the wall

383
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,880
and flee into this room, seeking shelter!

384
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,810

I guess it's like picking all the right answers.

387
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,990
Or maybe I should compare it to winning at the races.

388
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,350
Either way, you can't help but let out a little giggle

389
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,720
when you end up being the Victor!

390
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,630

Jotaro: Josuke.

I can promise you I won't feel like laughing in the least,

It's kinda gross, though. Sorry about that.

404

I cut a rubber glove into little pieces

Easy now. I don't know what you're thinking,

Josuke, let's be frank. Yeah, I murdered your grandpa,

425
