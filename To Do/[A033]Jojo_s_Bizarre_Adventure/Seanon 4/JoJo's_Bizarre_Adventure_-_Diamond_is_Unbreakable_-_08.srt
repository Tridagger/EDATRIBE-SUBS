he didn’t know anything

about that sparky s.O.B.
Who killed my bro?

4

Josuke: Yeah.
Apparently he’s only

ever talked to him
over the phone.

that twat-waffle

before he told you this, right?

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,640

telling me the truth.

still breathing, isn’t he?

For now,
that’s all the proof we need

that he’s telling the truth.

17

Now then, hazamada did
tell us about one thing.

to tell you why this is,

( Sighs )

517
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,510
( Koichi gasps ) Is it c?

518
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,840
Yukako: Tell me, koichi.

519
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Were you watching my expressions
to decide which box to pick?

520
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,110
( Koichi gasps )

521
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,810
I never thought i’d say this,

522
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,720
but your reputation
for being a conniving,

523
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,220
shoplifting cheater is true!

524
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,720
For your penalty,
you shall consume

525
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,460
the contents of boxes a and b!

526
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,420
A is english vocab corn flakes.

527
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,490
B is asparagus,

528
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,230
a la english dictionary.

529
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,630
You’re gonna learn
with every bite you take!

530
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,230
- ( Koichi whimpers )
- Yukako: Here!

531
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,730
Now open up that mouth,

532
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,740
’cause here comes the knowledge.

533
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,640
What’s wrong?

534
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,810
Eat your food, damn it!

535
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,440
( Koichi whimpering )

536
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,340
I’ve had about enough of this!

537
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,580
You expect me to sit back
and take this crap?

538
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,150
Well, I can’t!
I’m getting the hell outta here!

539
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,920
- ( Yukako grunts )
- ( Koichi yelps )

540
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,250
Yaah! Now what’s happening?!

541
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,890
What’s pulling my scalp?!

542
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,860
It feels like somebody’s hair!

543
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,860
Wait! Does this belong to...

544
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,800
Yukako: Indeed. I implanted
a few hundred strands

545
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,700
of my own hair
into your scalp.

546
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,600
( Koichi groans )

547
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,800
Yukako: I’m well aware
that you’ll probably hate me

548
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
for going to these
extreme measures, koichi.

549
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,940
Koichi: Huh?

550
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,270
Yukako: But by the time
you leave this house,

551
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,580
you’ll look in the mirror

552
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,450
and see a brand-new man
staring back at you.

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,580
I’m certain
you’ll thank me after that,

554
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,880
and you’ll realize you need
a woman like me in your life.

555
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,890
It’s safe to say
you won’t be able to live

556
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,190
without Yukako Yamagishi.

557
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,890
( Koichi gasps )

558
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,730
Yukako: Oh,
you might as well know,

559
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,330
until you finish every
last morsel on your plates,

560
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,500
I won’t be giving you
any more food.

561
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,900
There’s one more thing.

562
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,230
A famous c.E.O. Vacations here,

563
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,370
but no one will be visiting
until summer.

564
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,810
( Koichi gasps ) Until summer?!

565
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,810
Yukako: Although, it doesn’t
really matter who drops by,

566
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,710
because in the very end,
love is an invincible power.

567
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,750
♪

568
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,520
( Koichi screams )

569
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:32,600
S-somebody help me!
