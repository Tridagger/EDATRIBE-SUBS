00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,260
mother's name, tomoko.

178
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,330
She was 21, attending university in Tokyo.

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,400
This town's the only home you've ever known.

180
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,440
But everything changed in 1987

181
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,340
when you came down with a mysterious fever at age four.

182
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,910
For 50 days, you were a knock away from death's door.

183
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,450
Your father's name is--

184
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,920
( thinking ) Good grief. How'd I get mixed up in this?

185
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,420
The name of your father is Joseph joestar.

186
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,290
He's 78 now and the founder of joestar realty.

187
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,360
Koichi: The Joseph joestar?

188
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,800
He's that American real-estate mogul.

189
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,700
Jotaro: Don't worry. The old man's fine,

190
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,970
but one day, I was looking into how to divide his properties.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
That's when I discovered you, his son,

192
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,370
living right here in Japan.

193
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,910
Even the old man had no idea,

194
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,780
piece of shit that he is.

195
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,010
The bastard always said his wife was his one and only.

196
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,180
Then I find out he had an affair at the ripe old age of 62,

197
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,320
and the product of it is you.

198
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,890
Sorry. Guess I shouldn't have said that.

199
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,820
My name is jotaro kujo,

200
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,730
which means, since he's my grandfather,

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,430
I'm technically your nephew. Bizarre, huh?

202
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,900
Josuke: Nephew? Huh?

203
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,170
Pleasure.

204
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,140
Jotaro: We can talk on the way.

205
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,910
So there you have it.

206
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,280
Eventually, you're gonna find yourself in possession

207
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,450
of a third of the old man's inheritance.

208
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,780
That's the message I came here to tell you.

209
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,950
Hate to lay this on you, but this affair

210
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,920
has turned the joestar family upside down.

211
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,290
Josuke: Uh, upside down? Are you serious?

212
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,790
Jotaro: I am. My grandma, Suzie q,

213
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,290
is the angriest she's ever been in their entire marriage,

214
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,930
and they've been together 61 years.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,900
Josuke: Wha--please forgive me!

216
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,830
This is all my fault!

217
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,870
Jotaro: Hey, there's no need to freak out.

218
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,140
Why are you apologizing in the first place?

219
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,310
Josuke: Well, i-I'd hate to be the cause

220
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,140
of the family falling apart.

221
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,740
Whenever the subject came up,

222
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,950
mom told me she was deeply in love.

223
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,250
Knowing that she had that is enough for me.

224
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,880
Could you tell my dad-- I mean Mr. Joestar--

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,390
he doesn't need to concern himself with us? Thank you.

226
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,060
Jotaro: What's with this kid?

227
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,330
I came here ready to be decked on behalf of the old man,

228
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,460
but instead of being angry, he's the one apologizing to me.

229
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,230
- Girl: Look, it's josuke! - Girl #2: Yeah, it is!

230
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,070
- Girl #3: Hey, josuke! - Girl #1: What a coincidence!

231
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,900
Girl #3: Let's go to class together.

232
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,270
Girl #1: Your hair is looking glorious as ever.

233
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,070
Girl #2: It's so great!

234
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,040
Girl #3: You're so different from the other guys at school.

235
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,810
Josuke: That's great, but we're actually in the middle

236
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,480
- of an important chat, so... - Girl #1: Aww, come on!

237
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,750
Girl #2: If you don't hurry, you're gonna be late for school.

238
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,250
- Girl #3: You can talk later. - ( Jotaro growls )

239
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,520
Earth to josuke. We haven't finished our business yet.

240
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,150
- Get the groupies outta here. - ( Girls gasp )

241
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,460
Girl #3: Who the hell's this guy?

242
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,920
Jotaro: Hey, you can cackle like hens

243
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,260
about his hair on your own time.

244
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,260
( Josuke gasps )

245
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,900
Girl #2: This guy has no idea the beast he's just released.

246
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,070
Girl #1: Why'd he talk about his hair that way?

247
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Josuke: Bastard...

248
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,240
Do you wanna repeat what you just said about my hair?

249
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,410
Girl #3: Ooh, this isn't good.

250
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,910
Girl #1: You don't have to tell me.

251
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,780
Girl #2: The one thing that sets josuke off

252
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,940
like nothing else is someone insulting his hair.

253
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Koichi: This is just what happened before.

254
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,550
Jotaro: Hold on a minute, josuke.

255
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,020
I wasn't trying to take a shot at your hair.

256
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,220
Damn. Here he comes.

257
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,390
( Josuke gags )

258
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,860
- ( Girls wail ) - Girl #2: Josuke, no!

259
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,860
Girl #3: He's bleeding!

260
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,000
Jotaro: Do you see it, josuke?

261
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,560
This is called a stand.

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,470
It's a physical manifestation of the soul.

263
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,070
Joseph has one of these as well.

264
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,310
Only a stand user can see another stand.

265
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,080
Josuke: You know, it pisses me off

266
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,110
when someone decides to bad-mouth my pride and joy.

267
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,950
It really grinds my gears!

268
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,450
Stand: Dora!

269
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,420
Jotaro: So that's what his stand looks like!

270
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,120
Stand: Dora!

271
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,390
Dora!

272
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,160
Jotaro: This kid's power is unreal.

273
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,260
Josuke: Hah. Don't know if you realized this, nephew,

274
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,260
but you left your chest wide open!

275
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,330
Jotaro: Enough!

276
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,870
Josuke: Where did he--( Gasps )

277
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Girl #3: How'd that happen?

278
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,840
Girl #1: The heck is going on?

279
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,770
Josuke: Why you--when did--

280
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,110
- girl #2: Josuke! - ( Girls wail )

281
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,110
Girl #3: No! Josuke!

282
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,380
Jotaro: Shut your mouths! And get the hell outta here

283
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,520
before your whiny bitching makes me angrier!

284
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,120
Girls: Uh...

285
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,920
Okay.

286
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,850
Girl #1: They must know each other.

287
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,290
Girl #2: He's kinda scary.

288
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,990
Girl #3: Yeah, but in a hot way.

289
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,760
Koichi: Unreal. I don't understand.

290
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,130
What just happened?

291
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,770
I can't wrap my head around any of it.

292
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,230
Jotaro: It's been a while,

293
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,940
ten years to be exact.

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,840
I only managed to stop time for half a second.

295
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,340
I doubt we would have killed each other if I hadn't,

296
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,840
but it would have gotten ugly for one of us.

297
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,010
- ( Josuke groaning ) - Jotaro: Here. I got you.

298
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,020
Josuke: No, it's okay. I can manage on my own.

299
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,350
Jotaro: Fair enough.

300
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,820
As I was saying,

301
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,190
there's another reason I came to see you.

302
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,460
Look at this picture.

303
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,460
Do you see it?

304
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,860
Something evil is lurking in this town.

305
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,400
A catastrophic danger is closing in as we speak.

306
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,370
When the old man used his psychic photography

307
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,240
to get a picture of you, this was the result.

308
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,070
We don't know who this guy is,

309
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,480
but if I had to guess, I'd say he's a stand user.

310
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,810
I know this is all new to you,

311
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,980
but I wanted to show you the picture.

312
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,120
Don't let your guard down.

313
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,950
Koichi, if you ever run into him,

314
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,990
get as far away as you can.

315
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,060
Getting the police involved won't help. Just haul ass.

316
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,130
Josuke, if you find yourself face to face with him,

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,900
keep your cool, and stay out of it,

318
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,500
or it'll be a repeat of what happened here.

319
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,970
( Koichi gasps ) Our orientation!

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,170
Josuke: You're right! It's started!

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,310
No, no, no, no, no, no! My mom is gonna kill me

322
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,740
if I show up late for my first day of school!

323
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,280
Hey, I need to get going, but I promise to listen

324
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,380
to whatever you have to say after school, okay?

325
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,250
You're koichi, right? Come on. Let's take off!

326
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,350
Koichi: Huh?

327
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,480
Josuke: Put some pep in your step!

328
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,820
Koichi: Right!

329
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,820
This is josuke higashikata.

330
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,060
He's one of the other bizarre friends I made that year.

331
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,460
One second, he's a wallflower.

332
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,930
The next, he's acting like a crazy person.

333
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
He's got some family drama going on.

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,770
( Chuckles )

335
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,870
That's one way to make a first impression.

336
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
Jotaro: Josuke.

337
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,840
That kid's a strange one,

338
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,870
not to mention his stand.

339
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,310
And given that my hat isn't currently ripped to all hell,

340
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,480
it must be able to destroy objects

341
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,410
and rearrange their structure.

342
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,350
If he'd managed to connect with my face or my skull--

343
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,990
I don't even wanna think about it.

344
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,890
But he could be a potential ally.

345
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,360
He's already a more than capable fighter.

346
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,760
Excluding his fickle personality, that is.

347
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Regardless, I'm really hoping this mess

348

360

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,930
Officer: And, in addition to being a public nuisance,

374
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,630
you also referred to my baby girl

375
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,470
as a crazy bitch, so I'd watch myself if I were you.

376
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,000

How's josuke doing?

390

Today is his orientation.

391
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,860
That boy had better not be getting into trouble.

392
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,870
Tomoko: Right. Who knows with that kid.

393
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,700
He looks innocent, but the moron loses it at the drop of a hat.

394
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,510
I wonder where he gets that from.

395
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Officer: All right, settle down.

396
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,940
- Tomoko: But... - Officer: Eh?

397
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,640
Tomoko: Deep in his heart of hearts,

398
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,610
he's an honest-to-goodness sweetie pie.

399
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,550
I'm not too worried about it.

400
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,980
Officer: That's the spirit.

401
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,850
How do you feel about having a big celebration tonight?

402
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,150
Tomoko: Sounds good. That was actually my plan.

403
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,190
I doubt he'll come straight home, though.

404
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,530
That child of mine likes his detours.

405
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,790
Officer: That, he does.

406

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,200
I just bought you an expensive bag. Remember?

( Shuddering )

420
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,660
Jotaro: Anjuro katagiri, a.K.A. Angelo.

421
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,540
He was born in morioh in 1964 and has an IQ of 160.

422
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,970
He was sent to juvie for robbery and rape

423
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,810
when he was only 12 years old.

424
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,610
That was the beginning of his depravity.

425
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,850
He earned a reputation for being the most violent,

426
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,520
abominable criminal to ever walk on Japanese soil.

427
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,520
Most of his youth was spent in jail.

428
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,460
By the time he turned 34,

429
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,090
he'd already spent 20 years in the slammer.

430
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,100
The final crime he ever committed was so reprehensible,

431
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,030
it'd make a sewer rat puke.

432
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,200
He was eventually arrested

433
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,170
and then executed.

434
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,870
But unfortunately for all involved,

435
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,210
the execution didn't stick.

436
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,770
( Angelo grunts )

437
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,780
Jotaro: Angelo escaped from custody shortly after,

438
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,650
and he most likely became a stand user

439
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,180
right before his execution.

440
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,220
I'm not sure why, but he's now hiding

441
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,020
in the shadows of this quiet town,

442
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,860

It's happening in our backyard.

but when I thought about it, I figured it'd be best

Woman: But how? There's not a Mark on me.

522
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,170
Koichi: She's back to normal, like before.

523
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
( Robber screams )

524
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,710
My knife's inside my body!

525
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,740
How did my knife get inside?!

526
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,740
W-what did you do?

527
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,050
Josuke: I'd suggest finding a surgeon to remove that

528
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,550
in the prison hospital.

529
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,820
( Robber gasping )

530
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,150
Officer #1: Quickly, let's cuff this guy.

531
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,790
Officer #2: What's going on around here?

532
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,790
Koichi: Josuke!

533
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,120
Josuke: What's up, koichi?

534
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,120
Koichi: Are you okay? That was...

535
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,860
( Robber gagging )

536
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,190
Officer #1: Wh-what the hell is happening?

537
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,700
( Josuke gasps )

538
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,630
Stand: Well, what a surprise.

539
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,770
It appears another annoying stand user has joined the fray.

540
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,640
And I was having so much fun

541
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,940
using that meat puppet for my armed robbery,

542
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,710
but of course you had to get in my way.

543
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,810
Josuke: Hang on. He's from the picture!

544
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,880
Koichi: Huh?

545
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,750
Stand: So you know, I'm gonna keep a close eye on you.

546
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,750
Wherever you are, whatever you do,

547
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,220
I'll be nearby watching and waiting.

548
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,620
Josuke: What did you say, water boy?!

549
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,030
- Koichi: Josuke! - Josuke: Eh?

550
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,860
Officer #3: What the hell were you thinking, idiot?!

551
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,200
Officer #2: You could have been killed!

552
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,730
Josuke: Wait a minute!

553
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,800
- ( Koichi chuckles ) - Josuke: Get off!

554
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,740
Koichi: Mr. Jotaro was telling the truth all along.

555
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,180
Robber: Guys, I'm begging you!

556
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,950
Koichi: Something's happening in this town.

557
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,850
It's almost as if I can feel it in the air.

558
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Whatever found its way into morioh,

559
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,520
it's--it's monstrous.

Hello.

Josuke: Oh, hi.

Jotaro: Our conversation yesterday was too brief.

571
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,550
We need to talk about the guy hiding in this town.

572
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,850
Josuke: Um, I wanted to talk about that, too.

573
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,690
We should meet. You staying somewhere in town?

What's on your mind?

Josuke: Well, to be honest...

577
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,430
Tomoko: Damn it. This really pisses me off.

578
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,830
Where the hell did I put that damn shovel?

Angelo: What a little brat.

580
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,640
He's living the high life with his perfect little family.

581
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,910
He's even got a hot, young mom,

582
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,740
not that he could appreciate it.

583
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,750
That kid's such a lucky bastard.

584
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,950
Josuke higashikata,

585
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,750
you'd better not get too cocky, you little pissant,

'cause I'm gonna stomp your soul and your precious little life.

I'm gonna get to have my fun after all.
