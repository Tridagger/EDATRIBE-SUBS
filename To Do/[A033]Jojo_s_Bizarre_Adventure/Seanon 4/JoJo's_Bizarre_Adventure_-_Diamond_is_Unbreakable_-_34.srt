498
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,060
Kira: EH?

499
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,260
( growls )

500
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,290
HOW SILLY OF ME. YOU’RE RIGHT.

501
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,360
\h\h\h\hYOU ALWAYS WERE
A TICKLISH ONE, HAYATO.

502
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,160
Hayato: UH, I’LL TAKE CARE
OF THE FRONT MYSELF.

503
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Kira: I’D BE HAPPY
TO LEND YOU A HAND.

504
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,810
BY THE WAY, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

505
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,580
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHIS EVENING,
I WAS DOING SOME WORK ERRANDS

506
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,380
IN THE OPPOSITE END
OF TOWN NEAR JOZENJI

507
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,210
- WHEN I HAPPENED TO SEE YOU.
- Hayato: HUH?!

508
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,420
Kira: AND YOU WERE HOLDING
A VIDEO CAMERA.

509
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,950
\h\h\h\hWHAT COULD YOU
HAVE BEEN DOING THERE?

510
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,020
- ( Hayato gasping )
- Kira: I’VE GOT HIM.

511
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,820
I KNEW THIS SLEUTHING SHIT
WAS SPYING ON ME!

512
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,130
I CAN’T BELIEVE IT.

513
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,400
\h\h\h\hSO MUCH FOR CASUALLY
ASSIMILATING INTO THIS FAMILY.

514
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,870
IT HAS BEEN ONE CATASTROPHE
AFTER ANOTHER, A YEAR OF HELL.

515
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,270
KILLING THIS PUNK
WILL CAUSE A COMMOTION

516
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,410
AND A BAD ONE AT THAT,

517
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,310
BUT HE SAW EVERYTHING.
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

518
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,410
A STRAND OF THIS BRAT’S HAIR

519
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,310
NOW FUNCTIONS AS A BOMB.

520
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,380
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hALL IT’LL TAKE
IS A SMALL BLAST TO HIS SKULL,

521
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,550
AND IT’LL APPEAR HE SIMPLY
SLIPPED AND BUMPED HIS HEAD.

522
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,190
\h\h\h\hPEOPLE SLIP AND FALL
IN THE BATHROOM ALL THE TIME,

523
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,390
\h\h\h\hSO IT’S TIME
FOR YOU TO DIE, PEST!

524
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,290
Hayato: SO YOU
GONNA KILL ME, TOO?

525
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,860
( Deadly Queen grunts )

526
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,060
Hayato: TAKE A LOOK
AROUND, "POPS."

527
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,630
I’M RECORDING EVERYTHING
THAT’S HAPPENING!

528
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,570
Kira: WHAT? ( grunts )

529
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,540
( Hayato grunts )

530
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,970
I’VE NEVER TRUSTED YOU, FRAUD!

531
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,040
\h\h\h\hI’VE RECORDED
ALL YOUR WEIRD SHOE SIZES

532
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,880
AND SIGNATURE
PRACTICING SESSIONS!

533
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,510
AND THAT’S NOT ALL.

534
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,210
I TAPED THAT CAT PLANT
LIVING IN THE ATTIC, TOO!

535
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,150
\h\h\h\hONLY I KNOW
WHERE ALL THE TAPES ARE,

536
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,490
BUT IF SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WERE TO HAPPEN TO ME,

537
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,190
\h\h\h\hI’M SURE SOMEONE
WOULD FIND THEM EVENTUALLY.

538
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,890
Kira: WHERE DO YOU GET OFF--

539
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,590
Hayato: YOU’RE NOT GONNA
LAY A FINGER ON ME! WE CLEAR?!

540
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,660
Kira: HOW DARE YOU?!

541
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,900
YOU THINK YOU CAN THREATEN
THE LIKES OF ME?

542
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,270
Hayato: AND THAT
GOES DOUBLE FOR MOM!

543
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,600
( Kira growls )
