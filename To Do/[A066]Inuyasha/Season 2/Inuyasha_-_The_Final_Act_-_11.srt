00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:50,428
-Tetsusaiga?

3
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:52,962
-(VOICEOVER) Why does that thing
have Tetsusaiga in his hand?

4
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:53,662
-Careful.

5
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:54,762
That's no reflection.

6
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,928
It seems that Kanna's
mirror has actually

7
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,495
transformed into a demon.

8
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,928
It may have all the
powers of your Tetsusaiga.

9
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,128
Now take this.

10
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:05,428
Wind Scar!

11
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,862
-His Wind Scar isn't working.

12
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,795
-(VOICEOVER) So it did'nt
just copy the shape?

13
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,228
It also stole the
demonic energy?

14
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,162
-Your turn.

15
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:14,462
Wind Scar.

16
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:15,228
-It's real.

17
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:16,262
Get out of here!

18
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:16,962
You're too slow.

19
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:17,628
Adamant Barrage!

20
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,762
That doesn't work either?

21
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,228
-Adamant Barrage.

22
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,228
-Dammit.

23
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,195
-Fox Magic!

24
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,928
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Kanna's Gravestone.

25
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,528
-I've created a barrier.

26
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:58,462
It should keep us safe
for the time being.

27
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:00,195
-What's wrong with
your sword, Inuyasha?

28
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,995
How come they could
attack us, but you

29
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,228
weren't able to attack them?

30
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:07,028
It's almost like they've
gotten the real Tetsusaiga.

31
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,662
-Unfortunately, it
would seem that all

32
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,662
of Tetsusaiga's demonic
energy was somehow

33
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:13,695
captured by Kanna's mirror.

34
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,995
SHIPPO: This isn't the
first time it's happened.

35
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,062
That sword Dakki
was able to steal

36
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,728
Tetsusaiga's demonic
energy as well.

37
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:24,228
-Every time our blades across,
Dakki's demonic presence

38
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,062
eats away at Tetsusaiga,
absorbing its demonic energy

39
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:30,062
little by little.

40
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,462
Ha ha ha!

41
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:34,428
I've absorbed all the demonic
energy from the Backlash Wave.

42
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:35,862
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Tetsusaiga, I

43
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,395
won't waste the
path you've opened!

44
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,728
-I've won!

45
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,262
SHIPPO: But in the
end, he was killed

46
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,328
by the demonic energy
from the blade.

47
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:48,962
-That's because he was human.

48
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,662
It's different this time.

49
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,295
-Different, to say the least.

50
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,328
This demon has an endless
appetite for energy.

51
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:58,028
It won't be nearly as
simple as this time.

52
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,795
-It seems unfair,
seeing as how far you've

53
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:01,328
come with Tetsusaiga.

54
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,728
-Exactly.

55
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,995
Who would've thought that Wind
Scar and Adamant Barrage would

56
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,262
fall in the hands of the enemy?

57
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,295
-So, is Tetsusaiga just
an empty shell now?

58
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,295
-Kagura.

59
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:32,762
Are you free now?

60
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,195
Did you ever become the wind?

61
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:44,028
Kagura.

62
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,528
-So has everything been
going according to plan?

63
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,195
-Byakuya of the dreams.

64
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,762
-There's only one way!

65
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:12,428
We have to defeat
the mirror demon

66
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,662
and take back the
demonic energy.

67
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,262
-Hold your horses.

68
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,328
Fighting against that thing
seems a bit dangerous.

69
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,628
-Indeed.

70
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,228
It would mean we'd also be
fighting against Tetsusaiga.

71
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,128
-Huh?

72
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:24,695
That'd be suicide!

73
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:25,928
-Relax, Shippo.

74
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,162
Don't be afraid.

75
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:28,528
Oh, I get it.

76
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,328
You're probably just realizing
what a deadly opponent I am.

77
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,162
-I never thought that you
were a deadly opponent, idiot!

78
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:35,028
It's the sword that
scares me, not you!

79
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,162
-What?

80
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:37,695
-Well, whatever it is
we're planning to do,

81
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:38,728
we better do it soon.

82
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,095
-No!

83
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,095
The red Tetsusaiga can
break through barriers.

84
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,195
-Hiraikotsu!

85
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,528
-My turn!

86
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,028
-Oh, you did it!

87
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:14,762
-That's not good.

88
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,428
The sacred arrow didn't work.

89
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,362
-Look at that.

90
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,495
They're actually
trying to resist.

91
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,495
[cracking]

92
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,262
-Kanna.

93
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:25,462
What happened to your neck?

94
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:26,028
Fine.

95
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:27,962
Ignore me, then.

96
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:29,428
-Now, Adamant Barrage.

97
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,995
-It's going to use
Adamant Barrage.

98
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:40,262
-It's got us trapped in here.

99
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:41,028
-No it doesn't.

100
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:41,762
-Inuyasha!

101
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,328
-Inuyasha, stop!

102
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,128
-All you've got is the
shell of Tetsusaiga.

103
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,528
You don't stand a chance!

104
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,828
-(VOICEOVER) The shell
of Tetsusaiga, huh?

105
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:51,362
We'll see about that!

106
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,995
I won't let you swing!

107
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,295
-Inuyasha!

108
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,062
-I'm OK.

109
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,795
SHIPPO: It doesn't make sense.

110
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,362
Look where all
these spears went.

111
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,095
It's like they were
trying to avoid us.

112
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,562
-That was Tetsusaiga.

113
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:22,762
Its protective barrier
must've kicked in.

114
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:26,362
And that means Tetsusaiga's much
more than just an empty shell.

115
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,195
-Inuyasha!

116
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,128
Look at your face!

117
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,728
-There's no mistaking that look.

118
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:34,362
His demon blood took over
because he was in danger.

119
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,662
-This is not going well.

120
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,662
Once Inuyasha turns
into a full demon,

121
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,495
he won't hesitate
to tear us apart.

122
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:41,395
In fact, he'll enjoy it!

123
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,762
-It's going to attack again.

124
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:47,895
-(GRAVELY VOICE) Fine by me.

125
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:48,962
Bring it on.

126
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:49,495
-Inuyasha.

127
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,428
Is that you?

128
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:51,862
Do you still recognize us?

129
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,362
-I don't know what I look
like to you right now,

130
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:58,362
but my mind is perfectly clear.

131
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,428
I can feel it.

132
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,128
Tetsusaiga is seeking
my demonic energy.

133
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,262
It's trying to help
me win this battle.

134
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:11,495
You're mine!

135
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:25,628
Dammit.

136
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:28,095
What's it take to
destroy this thing?

137
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,328
-Inuyasha's not
looking himself, is he?

138
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:32,595
In fact, he almost
looks like a demon.

139
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:33,562
[cracking]

140
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,462
-Kanna.

141
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:39,228
That's exactly the spot where
the mirror demon was cut.

142
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,595
What's going on, Kanna?

143
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:43,362
Are you somehow
absorbing the damage

144
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,928
inflicted on the mirror demon?

145
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:53,128
-Inuyasha.

146
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:56,028
You've turned demon
to save your own life.

147
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:56,995
How perfect.

148
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:05,095
-The Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga!

149
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:05,895
-Of course.

150
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,328
It's after his demon vortex!

151
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:08,362
It makes sense.

152
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:12,728
He's a mass of demonic
energy right now.

153
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,328
-Inuyasha, your
demon vortex will

154
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,395
be a pleasure to cut through.

155
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,395
You will be destroyed
by the very technique

156
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,695
that you struggled
so hard to obtain.

157
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,328
-Inuyasha!

158
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,628
-Let us help you!

159
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:25,728
-Stay away.

160
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:28,495
You come near me and
I'll cut you down too!

161
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,695
You don't want to know what
I'm capable of right now.

162
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,728
-Inuyasha.

163
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,195
-(VOICEOVER) This fight
is for Tetsusaiga and me.

164
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:40,128
I won't let anyone
get in the way.

165
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,328
-Inuyasha!

166
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,295
-You'll die if it goes
through your demon vortex.

167
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,162
-You heard him.

168
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:47,628
Now take your best shot!

169
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:48,962
Tetsusaiga's mine.

170
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:52,595
An empty puppet like you
isn't worthy of my sword!

171
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:53,528
-Yes.

172
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,395
-He was able to
dodge the attack.

173
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,528
Inuyasha's faster than
that stupid thing.

174
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:01,095
-(VOICEOVER) Even if the
demonic energy is gone,

175
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,928
this Tetsusaiga is
an extension of me.

176
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,395
This is the real one.

177
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:05,795
I cannot lose!

178
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:09,595
I got it.

179
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:16,728
What?

180
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:17,728
This thing's invincible.

181
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:27,562
That crack.

182
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,495
That's exactly where I
cut the mirror demon.

183
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:33,728
-It seems Kanna is taking the
damage inflicted on the demon.

184
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,928
-That explains why
she's all beat up.

185
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,895
-Kanna, you don't
have to do this.

186
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,728
-Please, you'll die if
you keep on fighting.

187
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,228
Stop now, while you
still have a chance!

188
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,862
-Aren't we confident to be
showing such concern for

189
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,862
the enemy?

190
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,695
-I'm saying this
fighting is unnecessary!

191
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:50,295
-Kanna, it'll only
take one more hit

192
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:51,762
and you'll be
completely destroyed.

193
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,728
[groan]

194
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,795
-Is this the shadow
of Kanna's mirror?

195
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:11,562
-Inuyasha!

196
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:12,862
-It's just too strong.

197
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:20,395
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): The demon
and the sky are connected.

198
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,695
-Hurry up, Inuyasha!

199
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,862
Get out of there!

200
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:28,328
-It's no use.

201
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,562
He'll never outrun the shadow.

202
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:31,728
-Let's try something new.

203
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:38,662
-Unbelievable.

204
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,462
This time his own
attack was reflected.

205
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,462
-How about that?

206
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:42,928
It appears that
you're in no position

207
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,028
to be worrying about
Kanna after all.

208
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:47,595
-Honestly, what a
toothless bunch you are.

209
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,395
-Personally, the
instant I found out

210
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,862
Kanna was connected
to the demon,

211
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,528
I would have reduced
the girl to rubble,

212
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,262
not stopped to warn her.

213
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:55,762
Whoa, don't get upset .

214
00:11:55,795 --> 00:12:00,162
That's only if I was
your enemy, of course.

215
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,862
(VOICEOVER) She's not upset.

216
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,162
She really doesn't feel
anything, does she?

217
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,762
-(VOICEOVER) That was too close.

218
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,928
I would have been a goner if
Tetsusaiga had its usual power.

219
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:16,295
Go figure.

220
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:18,895
Saved by the fact that this
demon stole its demonic energy.

221
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,328
Huh?

222
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,328
[laughter]

223
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,270
-Here goes nothin'!

224
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,770
All right.

225
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,537
Tetsusaiga's barrier worked.

226
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,037
[groaning]

227
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,937
-Kanna's falling apart.

228
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:15,570
-Huh?

229
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:16,837
A crack in Tetsusaiga.

230
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,237
-That's it.

231
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,704
Don't let up, Kanna.

232
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:29,637
Continue until there's
nothing left of Tetsusaiga.

233
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,204
Know that this is the very
purpose of your existence.

234
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,737
-The blade's cracking.

235
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,637
-Yeah, it looks
like Kanna is, too.

236
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,970
-Why didn't I see it?

237
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,970
Naraku intends for Kanna and
Inuyasha to kill each other.

238
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,037
-In demon form, Inuyasha
will be able to endure

239
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,037
this attack for a while.

240
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,904
But still, he
won't last forever.

241
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,704
-If this keeps up, Tetsusaiga
is gonna snap in half!

242
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:57,337
-Then I have no choice but
to use the Wind Tunnel.

243
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,537
(VOICEOVER) No.

244
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,604
I'd end up sucking in
the demonic energy stolen

245
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:01,604
from Tetsusaiga.

246
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,837
If I do that,
Inuyasha's Tetsusaiga

247
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,970
could never be restored.

248
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:10,704
-(VOICEOVER) This
is getting ugly.

249
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:14,837
He's not showing Kanna any
mercy, and she won't stop.

250
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,970
It looks like this
is the end for her.

251
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:17,804
-Kanna!

252
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:20,804
You have to stop attacking, now!

253
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,370
I didn't wanna have to do this.

254
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,970
-The shadows disappeared.

255
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:37,470
-He managed to
stop it this time.

256
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,937
-There are far too many
cracks in Tetsusaiga.

257
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,604
We need to end this
battle immediately.

258
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:46,037
-I'm taking back
Tetsusaiga's demonic energy.

259
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,004
If I can just cut
through this blade.

260
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:02,337
Kanna, why are you
doing this to yourself?

261
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,237
You won't stop me, so there's no
point in sacrificing your life.

262
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,604
-Of course.

263
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:09,570
Tetsusaiga takes demonic energy
from anything that it cuts.

264
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,770
If Inuyasha can cut
into the demon's sword,

265
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,937
he can reclaim the
demonic energy it stole!

266
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,337
-It appears they have no
intention of killing you.

267
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,337
For the life of me,
I can't fathom why.

268
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,537
I mean, Kagome could have
fired her sacred arrow

269
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,437
into the hole in the
sky and killed you,

270
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,237
but instead she chose
to warn everyone.

271
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,670
These people are
completely insane.

272
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,804
-What are you fools thinking?

273
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:34,404
Do you pity Kanna?

274
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:35,737
Is that it?

275
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,670
Don't you realize she cannot
feel a thing, be it pain,

276
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:42,804
or sorrow, or even fear?

277
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:43,604
Yes.

278
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,437
Your pity is wasted on her.

279
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,704
She doesn't even
understand the concept.

280
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,837
-Kanna, you idiot!

281
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,104
-Kanna!

282
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,304
Why are you doing this?

283
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:15,104
Inuyasha!

284
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,737
-He's back to normal.

285
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,004
-Inuyasha, you OK?

286
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,370
-Yeah.

287
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:32,604
I've never felt a rush of
power like that before.

288
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,204
Huh?

289
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,804
The cracks in the
blade disappeared.

290
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:39,837
Does that mean it worked?

291
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,704
-Tetsusaiga's back
to its old self!

292
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,137
-Huh?

293
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,637
-Kanna.

294
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:05,637
-Kanna.

295
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,870
It looks to me as if
this fight is over.

296
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,037
-Inuyasha.

297
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,070
-You think he'll do it?

298
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:21,970
-You should go.

299
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,004
-Hm.

300
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:29,304
Another opportunity wasted.

301
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,670
-The mirror demon's
Tetsusaiga is gone.

302
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:32,937
Just like that.

303
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,837
-Kanna, I know you were
probably ordered by Naraku

304
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,470
to fight to the death, right?

305
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,837
Well, I'm not interested.

306
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,404
Killing you would only
give me nightmares.

307
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,437
-Indeed.

308
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,704
Any further fighting
would be pointless.

309
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:46,837
Besides.

310
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,937
Now she's been half
destroyed, Naraku

311
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,837
won't bother looking for her.

312
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,204
-It's true.

313
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,437
She may be able to survive.

314
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,037
-Go on, Kanna.

315
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,904
It's all over now.

316
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,337
-Over?

317
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,170
NARAKU: It isn't over, Kanna.

318
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,604
Far from it.

319
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,604
I've never seen
such foolishness.

320
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:09,737
Allowing Kanna to escape
after all the suffering

321
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,304
she caused you.

322
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,370
Your forgiveness and
compassion truly sickens me.

323
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,470
This is your final task, Kanna.

324
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:18,937
You will take the lives of
Inuyasha and his friends

325
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,937
with you own.

326
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,704
-What is it, Kanna?

327
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:22,970
Don't you understand?

328
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,270
You're free now.

329
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:25,770
-Free.

330
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,204
Kagura.

331
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:40,704
-Now walk over to
Inuyasha and his friends.

332
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,670
I shall be watching
over you until the end.

333
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,137
-It's cracking!

334
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,604
What's going on, Kanna?

335
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:53,570
Do you know why
this is happening?

336
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:54,537
-Move.

337
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,504
You must get closer
to them, Kanna.

338
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,704
-Huh?

339
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:08,970
I can't-- What is it
you're trying to tell me?

340
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,937
-Huh?

341
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,970
Look out!

342
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,670
-Kanna!

343
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,670
My eye!

344
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,904
-Kagome, are you OK?

345
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:31,770
-It's my eye!

346
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,204
KANNA: The light.

347
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:34,170
-Huh?

348
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:37,537
KANNA: The light
will destroy Naraku.

349
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,770
-It's Kanna's voice.

350
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:43,037
I can see something.

351
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,970
Is that the Shikon jewel?

352
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:53,304
There's a light at the center.

353
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:57,704
Kanna, are you the one
showing this to me?

354
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,504
This light.

355
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,437
Is this what will
destroy Naraku?

356
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,704
-There's nothing left of her.

357
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:16,737
-Nothing but fragments.

358
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,437
-Aw.

359
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,337
The poor little thing.

360
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,870
Naraku's got a
cruel streak in him.

361
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,437
I suppose I should be careful.

362
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:33,070
-So, Kanna, now you're
dead, without having killed

363
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,470
a single one of
them, I might add.

364
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:38,604
Do you regret your failure?

365
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,970
What am I saying?

366
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:43,470
How could you feel regret when
you don't even have a heart?

367
00:20:58,204 --> 00:20:59,237
-You didn't have to die.

368
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,170
-Do you think maybe Kanna was
trying to take us with her?

369
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:09,770
Is that why she did that?

370
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:10,637
KAGOME: No.

371
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,504
-Huh?

372
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,904
-How can you be so sure?

373
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:17,804
-The truth is, she never
actually wanted to die.

374
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:22,737
That's why she wanted me
to hear her final words.

375
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,070
-The light will destroy Naraku.

376
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,870
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Kanna.

377
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:49,904
Wherever you are, I heard
your heart's last wish.

378
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,637
[theme music]

379
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,685
INUYASHA: Sango must undergo a
trial for the master of potions

380
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,051
to repair Hiraikotsu.

381
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:51,285
Meanwhile, Miroku risks
his life by testing

382
00:23:51,318 --> 00:23:52,985
the master's strong poison.

383
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:55,885
MAN: Even if Hiraikotsu
were to be repaired,

384
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:58,451
Sango wouldn't think twice
about sacrificing it again

385
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,285
if it meant saving your life.

386
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:03,251
SANGO: Because I won't be
able to live if Miroku dies.

387
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,618
INUYASHA: Next time on
"Inuyasha, The Final Act."

388
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:07,651
Sango's Feelings,
Miroku's Resolve.

389
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,551
MIROKU: I want to
fight so I can survive.

390
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:11,985
So I can protect her.
