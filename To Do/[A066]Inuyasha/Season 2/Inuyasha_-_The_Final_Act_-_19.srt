KAGOME'S MOM: Hello,
Higurashi residence.

4
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:48,695
Oh, Kagome, how
did your test go?

5
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:50,495
That's good to hear.

6
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,728
-Anyway, mom, have you
started cooking dinner yet?

7
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:54,562
Good.

8
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:56,617
Because I want to have a fest.

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,450
-Sure.

10
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,717
But can do the shopping, dear?

11
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,517
-Ah, excellent.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,883
My bonsai make me
grateful to be alive.

13
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,483
Gazing at the magnificent
foliage soothes the soul.

14
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:11,850
Huh?

15
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,417
-Stupid Kagome still
hasn't come back.

16
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,383
I guess I'll just have
to go and get her.

17
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,183
Where'd she go?

18
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:24,050
[sniffing] [gagging]

19
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,650
-Hurt my bonsai,
you suffer my wrath.

20
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:28,817
-[gagging] Stop, please.

21
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,583
-Hey, I'm home.

22
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,850
What are you two doing?

23
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:35,717
If you're wondering where
sis is, she's shopping.

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,083
-She's shopping?

25
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:40,450
-Yep, she's done with exams,
so we're having a huge dinner.

26
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:41,450
-Hah, dinner?

27
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,750
I think I can help with that.

28
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,550
-Uh, hey, what's the hurry?

29
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,550
-I might have bought
too much food.

30
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,617
Oh well.

31
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,117
InuYasha will be with
us tonight anyway.

32
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,650
So--

33
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:55,317
-Delicious.

34
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,317
This meal is so good.

35
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,783
I don't think I've ever enjoyed
such a peaceful and utterly

36
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,517
fulfilling meal in all my life.

37
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,683
-That's so nice.

38
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,417
You just relax, and keep
on eating, all right?

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,917
-This is pure joy.

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,817
I'm so happy.

41
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,517
And the food is so good!

42
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,150
-[giggling] Oh, that InuYahsa.

43
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,983
I swear, he can be
so cute sometimes.

44
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:16,917
Hi, mom.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,150
Sorry I'm late-- uh, pigeons?

46
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,117
-Hey, Kagome.

47
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,683
I heard we're having
a feast tonight.

48
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:24,583
So I got some
ingredients for you.

49
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:26,350
-(THINKING) Pigeons?

50
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:28,683
[cooing]

51
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:31,183
-Am I supposed to clean them?

52
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,650
-Uh, aren't those koi?

53
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:33,717
-Yeah, I caught them.

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,283
-From someone's pond, right?

55
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,717
Go put them back!

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,917
-Are you kidding me?

57
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,917
Those things weren't
easy to catch, you know.

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,250
-Take them back.

59
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:42,617
INUYASHA: (WHIMPERING) OK.

60
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,750
-[screaming]

61
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,183
-What's the matter, mom?

62
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,183
-Cockroach!

63
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:46,917
KAGOME: Cockroach?

64
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:50,350
-Stand aside.

65
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,417
I shall slay the vile creature.

66
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,083
Huh?

67
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,983
-Let me handle this.

68
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:55,683
-Huh?

69
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:56,483
INUYASHA: Wind star!

70
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,917
Oops.

71
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,817
NARRATOR: Kohaku's Shard.

72
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:19,550
-Shippo, I see you're
looking down the well again.

73
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,550
Kagome is supposed
to come back today.

74
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,917
She said so.

75
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,550
-Well, I'll come back as soon
as my entrance exams are done.

76
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,950
-InuYasha went to get her.

77
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,517
But he hasn't come back.

78
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,050
-Ah, yes.

79
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,283
That's right.

80
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:36,183
(THINKING) Sadly, Kagome's
power of purification

81
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:37,650
will still be sealed.

82
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:40,117
And Kohaku will
remain unconscious

83
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,117
with his shard defiled.

84
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,450
-I can't believe he
can continue to sleep

85
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,317
without eating or
drinking anything.

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,283
-That's OK.

87
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,483
Sleeping is good for children.

88
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:49,717
It helps them grow.

89
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,817
You probably didn't get
enough sleep, Master Jaken.

90
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,650
-Huh?

91
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,517
What is that supposed to mean?

92
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,317
-Well, maybe that's
why you didn't grow.

93
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,417
-Look here.

94
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,783
I'll have you know I
am a fully grown demon.

95
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,083
-(THINKING) Until Sesshomaru
destroys Magatsuhi,

96
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:03,517
Kohaku will not wake up.

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,617
It's hard to see him like this.

98
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,217
But it's been so long since we
spent this much time together.

99
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,383
How ironic.

100
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,183
Even though he's
unconscious, just the fact

101
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:15,450
that he's here with me
put my mind at ease.

102
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,383
-Wow.

103
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,517
You know how to
write, good monk?

104
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,883
-Amazing.

105
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,483
-So what's that word mean?

106
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,350
-This is how you write daughter.

107
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:23,650
-How about that one?

108
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,883
-That's princess.

109
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,750
And this is elder sister.

110
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,417
Younger sister is this.

111
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,483
And bride is written like this.

112
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:33,783
-How come all your
words are about girls?

113
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:34,350
-Hmm?

114
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:35,350
-What's that?

115
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:36,417
-It's like the sun
just disappeared.

116
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,550
-Please do something.

117
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,683
-Everybody get inside
the house right now.

118
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,950
(THINKING) Are these Naraku's
minions, or Magatsuhi's?

119
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,750
-(THINKING) Magatsuhi's
scent is near.

120
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,483
-Well, well, you came
flying all this way

121
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:07,217
after catching Magatsuhi's sent?

122
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,583
To the great Lord Sesshomaru
has a sharp nose indeed.

123
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,017
-Byakuha of the dreams.

124
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,117
-Hmm.

125
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,150
A left arm, I thought
you didn't have one.

126
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,450
Did it grow back?

127
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,583
-This has nothing
to do with you.

128
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,383
Be gone.

129
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,550
-I see your manners haven't
improved since last time.

130
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:29,383
You're only interested
in this one, I suppose.

131
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,983
-Magatsuhi.

132
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:31,483
Tenseiga!

133
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,617
It didn't work.

134
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,950
-Swing that sword all
you want, Sesshomaru.

135
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,550
That Magatsuhi is merely
an illusion I've created.

136
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:49,817
By now the real one is right
back where you started.

137
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,550
[screaming]

138
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,717
KAEDE: What an ominous
demonic presence.

139
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,450
-I want to help
Kohaku and the others.

140
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,650
-Not yet, Shippo.

141
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,750
First, you'll take the
villagers to a safe place.

142
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:01,383
-But I--

143
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,517
-Just do as I say.

144
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,250
We don't have much time.

145
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,650
-Wind tunnel.

146
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,083
-Miroku, no!

147
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,017
(THINKING) I can't
let him do this.

148
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,617
If he overuses his wind tunnel,
his wound will open again.

149
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,083
Here I come!

150
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,350
Let me handle the rest.

151
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,617
-Huh?

152
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,750
(THINKING) The shadows
haven't disappeared.

153
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,850
-Miroku?

154
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:29,817
-Damn it.

155
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,283
These demons are
only a distraction.

156
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,983
Their true objective is Kohaku.

157
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,017
-Master Jaken.

158
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,850
-Huh?

159
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,317
-There's a really weird shadow.

160
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,883
-Hmm?

161
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,383
[evil cackle]

162
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:44,883
-What?

163
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:50,850
-Oh no!

164
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:56,850
-You've shown yourself.

165
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:57,883
-Kohaku!

166
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,250
Did Magatsuhi take
over his body?

167
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,250
-This boy possesses within
him the final shard.

168
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,417
It will complete
the Shikon Jewel.

169
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,017
-Kohaku.

170
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,550
Give Kohaku back.

171
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,750
-Worry not.

172
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,550
I shall return his body
when I'm finished with it.

173
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,483
That is, I shall
return his corpse.

174
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,750
Now that I've taken control
of his body, it's clear to me

175
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,683
that the boy's life
is being sustained

176
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:21,250
by the power of the shard.

177
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,517
-He intends to take
Kohaku to Naraku

178
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,317
with the Jewel shard
still inside him.

179
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,783
-I won't let you
take him anywhere.

180
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,283
-Ha!

181
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,283
-[gasps]

182
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:34,983
-Do you hear something?

183
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,450
-Kohaku!

184
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,817
-Wait, Magatsuhi.

185
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,183
-Will you pull the boy to his
death with your wind tunnel?

186
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:46,983
-You are the only one
who will be pulled in.

187
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,383
Wind tunnel!

188
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,317
-Ah!

189
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,283
-I think he got him.

190
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,450
-What were you
hoping to achieve?

191
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:06,150
[evil cackle] As long as this
defiled Jewel shard is here,

192
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,950
my power is infinite.

193
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,950
Did you honestly believe
that you could absorb me?

194
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,083
However, monk, you have taken
in something that was never

195
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:17,450
meant for humans-- the
poison of evil spirits.

196
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:22,017
-Why'd you do that?

197
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,350
-Are you ready?

198
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:30,050
It's time for you
to die, sister.

199
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,350
And you shall die by my hand.

200
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,450
-Magatsuhi, I know it's you!

201
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:39,083
Huh?

202
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,050
Ah!

203
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,483
-Kohaku, stop that!

204
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:42,883
-Come back, Rin!

205
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,383
That isn't Kohaku anymore.

206
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,017
Magatsuhi has possessed
the boy's body.

207
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,250
-Ah!

208
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:49,717
-Rin!

209
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,117
-Way to go.

210
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,350
That dinner was a disaster.

211
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,583
And don't even get me
started on the kitchen wall.

212
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,417
-I get it.

213
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,717
I said I was sorry.

214
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,950
What more do you want from me?

215
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:05,983
-Huh?

216
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,583
Something's not right here.

217
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:10,617
-I smell blood and poison
from Kaede's house.

218
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,550
-Huh?

219
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,217
Hurry, InuYasha.

220
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,217
Kaede's house, it's
been destroyed.

221
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,617
What's going on?

222
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,650
-Where is everyone?

223
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:23,483
Huh?

224
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,350
-[gasp]

225
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,517
-Miroku!

226
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,283
Sango!

227
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,483
-Sango, what happened to you?

228
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,983
-Kohaku.

229
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,383
Please go after him.

230
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,550
-Hey, hang in there.

231
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,150
-I'm sorry, InuYasha.

232
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,850
I don't have much time.

233
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,583
-Miroku, what happened?

234
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:44,183
[gasp] (THINKING) The
scar from the miasma

235
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:46,517
has reached his chest.

236
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,783
-Because of the master
of potions' medicine,

237
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,083
I didn't feel it happening
while I was fighting.

238
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,150
So I ended up overdoing it.

239
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:54,150
[wind howling]

240
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,650
-Huh?

241
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:56,850
What's that sound?

242
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,717
-Miroku, is that
your wind tunnel?

243
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,683
-Huh?

244
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,683
-(THINKING) Will
the miasma kill me,

245
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,550
or will my wind tunnel
tear me apart first?

246
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,483
Either way, I don't
have much time left.

247
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:12,317
INUYASHA: You idiot.

248
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,617
That's why I warned you.

249
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,050
-Listen to me, InuYasha, we
don't have time for this right

250
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,617
now.

251
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,717
Go after Kohaku.

252
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,783
-Damn.

253
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,817
Both of you, sit tight
until we get back.

254
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,917
You got that?

255
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,050
Let's go, Kagome.

256
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,683
-Right.

257
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,383
(THINKING) Miroku!

258
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,119
-(THINKING) that's odd.

259
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,885
This scent is unmistakable.

260
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,919
It must be him.

261
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,485
Now I understand.

262
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,685
How foolish of me.

263
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:55,819
-Whoa.

264
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,185
-So that's where the
scent was coming from.

265
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:06,252
-Yes, of piece of Magatsuhi's
flesh that you sliced off.

266
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:08,185
It carries a fraction
of the soul that

267
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,885
couldn't escape in time, more
than enough to summon you

268
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,085
from a great distance.

269
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,719
Unfortunately, it took
you too long to notice.

270
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,119
My condolences.

271
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,485
But, since you're
here, I figure why not

272
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,619
have you amuse me
a while longer?

273
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:26,352
-You underestimate me, Byakuya.

274
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,952
Do you honestly believe you can
impede me with demons as weak

275
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,152
as these?

276
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:35,619
-Well, that is why I
gathered a thousand of them.

277
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:41,252
-[shouts]

278
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,485
-What?

279
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,752
All of them at once?

280
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,852
-InuYasha, please hurry.

281
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,552
Magatsuhi's influence has
left Kohaku's shard darker

282
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:53,252
than I've ever felt it before.

283
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:56,352
I just hope I can
still purify it.

284
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:57,952
-This is terrible.

285
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,585
-We must rebuild Lady
Kaede's house at once.

286
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:09,885
-Ah.

287
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:15,352
SHIPPO: Sango?

288
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,719
-Yes, Shippo?

289
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,919
-Aren't those wounds painful?

290
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:19,719
-Don't worry.

291
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:20,752
I'm fine.

292
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,585
-But Sango, Miroku's
not doing so well.

293
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,685
Shouldn't you stay
here with him?

294
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,819
-Naraku is certain
to be there to take

295
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:31,019
Kohaku's shard from him.

296
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,719
If I can somehow defeat Naraku,
the curse will be lifted.

297
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:36,319
And Miroku's wind
tunnel will disappear.

298
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:36,819
-Sango.

299
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,885
-Settling things
once and for all

300
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,619
is the only way to fix
this situation now.

301
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,652
-Hey, why are we stuck in
this musty storage shed.

302
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:49,785
-It'll do.

303
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,185
Don't complain, little demon.

304
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,585
[wind howling]

305
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:57,152
-(THINKING) Rin still isn't
showing any signs of waking up.

306
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:58,285
Wait.

307
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,685
If Lord Sesshomaru were
to find out about this,

308
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,519
my life will most
surely be over.

309
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,019
Ah!

310
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,052
He's here!

311
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,319
Oh, please forgive
me, Lord Sesshomaru.

312
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:09,219
How could I let this happen?

313
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,319
I'm so-- it's only
the demon slayer.

314
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,685
Don't scare me like that.

315
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,185
-How is he?

316
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:22,252
-He's still asleep, but
doesn't appear to be in pain.

317
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,085
SAIGO: So he was
unable to feel pain.

318
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,185
He only took the master
potions' medicine

319
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:31,285
so he'd be able to
fight by my side.

320
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:36,852
If only he'd felt it, he never
would have pushed himself

321
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,385
to the point where his
wind tunnel would tear.

322
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:42,085
Lady Kaede?

323
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,419
-Hmm?

324
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:47,052
-If you wouldn't mind, could
you give us a moment alone?

325
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,652
-Really, I still don't
understand why all of us

326
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:53,119
had to be chased out.

327
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:56,185
-Rin must have been infected
by Magatsuhi's poison.

328
00:14:56,219 --> 00:15:00,652
I shall make her an infusion
to ward off evil spirits.

329
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:04,485
-(THINKING) Miroku, you've
always been willing to risk

330
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,952
your life for Kohaku and me.

331
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:09,685
Miroku.

332
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,085
Oh, Miroku.

333
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:26,785
Please don't die.

334
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,452
-Look at that cloud.

335
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:32,919
-It's Naraku.

336
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,585
-He's about to take
Kohaku's shard.

337
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,319
-I won't let that happen.

338
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,285
Adamant barrage!

339
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:46,885
Kohaku!

340
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:54,352
-So you've come back to
take the Jewel shard.

341
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:57,219
Get any closer, and I shall
tear this boy's body apart,

342
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:58,819
limb from limb.

343
00:15:58,852 --> 00:15:59,685
I am immaterial.

344
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,419
I won't hurt me.

345
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:05,652
This boy's body is nothing more
than a vessel for the shard.

346
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:08,285
-(THINKING) The defiled
shard, I have to purify it.

347
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,152
[gasp]

348
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,619
-Foolish girl.

349
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,652
It's hopeless.

350
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,152
Don't tell me you've
already forgotten

351
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,919
that I sealed your
spiritual power.

352
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,952
-Even the sacred
arrow doesn't work.

353
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,352
-Kikyo's magic has
no effect on me.

354
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:30,519
-Now watch as the Shikon Jewel
is made whole once again.

355
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,285
-Kohaku, snap out of it!

356
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,952
-Snap out of it, you say?

357
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,119
Ha.

358
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:43,285
Don't you know what'll
happen when he does?

359
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,685
-What's that?

360
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,885
-Let's just say, if you could
see what the blackened Shikone

361
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,985
Jewel shard was showing Kohaku
right now, you'd understand.

362
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:58,519
--[panting] F-father,
I'm really scared.

363
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:02,452
Oh, sister, please
help me, sister.

364
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:03,885
SANGO: Kohaku!

365
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,485
-Sister!

366
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:05,985
-Kohaku!

367
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:11,785
Why, Kohaku?

368
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,819
-Did I do this?

369
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:18,819
I killed father, and everyone?

370
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,919
MAGATSUHI: All of
Kohaku's dreadful sins,

371
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,285
the power of the
shard is forcing

372
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,352
him to relive the day he
killed his father and clan,

373
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,752
over and over again.

374
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,452
-No way.

375
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,119
-So this entire time?

376
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:32,719
-All this time.

377
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,685
If Kohaku's forced to wake up
now to the reality of his past,

378
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,852
it would break his very soul.

379
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:38,985
No.

380
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:41,885
I'd say that his soul
has already been broken.

381
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,285
SAIGO: Even so, you still
have to wake up, Kohaku.

382
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,385
-Huh?

383
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,552
-Wake up, Kohaku!

384
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,552
-What a cruel sister you are.

385
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,519
If I wake up, I'll die.

386
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:54,952
You should know that.

387
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:56,819
-You have to fight back, Kohaku.

388
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:59,719
-Your words are meaningless now.

389
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:00,985
The damage is done.

390
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,352
-Oh no.

391
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,952
What have I done?

392
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:14,819
[crying] I need help.

393
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,719
Somebody, please help me.

394
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:21,219
Huh?

395
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:42,619
Huh?

396
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,685
Sister.

397
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,019
I'm so glad.

398
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,552
She's OK after all.

399
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:11,385
No.

400
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,219
She's not OK!

401
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,719
I hurt her again!

402
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:23,952
Miroku tried to save me,
and he was hurt, too.

403
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:25,919
Sister, Miroku.

404
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:33,152
-Please help me, Kohaku.

405
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,585
-[gasp]

406
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:37,752
-Help this man.

407
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,485
And help me.

408
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,419
I beg you.

409
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:43,885
-Help?

410
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,385
Me?

411
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:50,319
You think I can help?

412
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,285
-Don't worry.

413
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,785
You can do it.

414
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,285
-Sister, I--

415
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:04,219
-You are my little
brother, after all.

416
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:04,719
-Uh!

417
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:09,219
-Kohaku!

418
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,885
-I'm here, sister.

419
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,352
-Do you recognize me?

420
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:17,052
Kohaku?

421
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,919
-Yes, I recognize you.

422
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,319
-He woke up!

423
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:20,819
How?

424
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,952
-I see it.

425
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:25,885
There's a light inside
Kohaku's shard again.

426
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,219
-Impossible!

427
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,985
-Magatsuhi, you said Kikyo's
magic wouldn't work on you.

428
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,152
But it looks to me
like you were wrong.

429
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:35,719
-Yah!

430
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:40,252
Are you saying Kikyo's light
has moved into Kohaku's shard?

431
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:43,019
-(THINKING) That's right,
the soul collector.

432
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:45,919
Lady Kikyo was the one that
rescued me from the past.

433
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,185
Sister, wait.

434
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:50,685
Are you saying that it
really isn't too late for me?

435
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,585
-No.

436
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,319
It's never too late, Kohaku.

437
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,585
Magatsuhi, so, are
you ready to die?

438
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,819
-How amusing.

439
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,252
You intend to jump, is that it?

440
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:10,519
Do you think I'll get
scared, and escape your body?

441
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,752
It's futile!

442
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:14,819
To be sure, as a vessel,
you will be of no use to me.

443
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:17,485
But rest assured, I will
still control the flesh

444
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,519
around this shard.

445
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:19,952
-I wouldn't be so sure.

446
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:21,919
Because you won't be
able to escape in time.

447
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,285
InuYasha and my sister
will take the shard

448
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,185
before you get the chance.

449
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:30,219
I swear it will never
be yours, Magatsuhi.

450
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:31,652
-Kohaku!

451
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,619
-Damn it.

452
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:34,119
What the hell's
wrong with this kid?

453
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:36,119
-I'm being forced out!

454
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:39,385
-(THINKING) I won't let
you have this shard, never!

455
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,385
-It's Kikyo's light
giving Kohaku his power.

456
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,785
I can feel my grip
on him slipping.

457
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,819
Damn you!

458
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:49,985
-It's working!

459
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,085
-He's been forced out.

460
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,652
-My sister.

461
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,585
-There's still time.

462
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,152
It's not too late.

463
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,707
Kohaku!

464
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,293
[music playing]

465
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:47,795
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sesshomaru
finally corners Magatsuhi.

466
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,662
Naraku appears in pursuit of
the final Shikon Jewel shard,

467
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,695
while Kohaku does
his best to resist.

468
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:55,028
KOHAKU: Naraku, I
will defeat you.

469
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:56,095
I will not die.

470
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,495
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
can't be happening.

471
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:01,762
The shard that was sustaining
his life, it's gone!

472
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:03,295
MALE SPEAKER: Next
time on "InuYasha,

473
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,928
The Final Act: When
the Jewel is Whole."

474
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:09,328
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can see it,
Naraku's blackened Shikone

475
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:10,862
Jewel.
