[music playing]

00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:09,800
[theme music]

3
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:44,242
-Ah!

4
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,609
InuYasha!

5
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:49,876
-Yes, Tessaiga!.

6
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,876
Ah.

7
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,476
-(THINKING) I'll
have only one chance.

8
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,909
Get away!

9
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:58,142
-[gasp] I can't move.

10
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:01,842
-He's trying to move to Kagome.

11
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,209
-It hurts.

12
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:03,742
InuYasha.

13
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,476
Dragon scale Tessaiga?

14
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,409
What?

15
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:12,842
-I'm being forced out.

16
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,142
-What's wrong?

17
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,809
Have you given up hiding
in other people's bodies?

18
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:20,609
-[roaring]

19
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,276
-You couldn't have
picked a worse person

20
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,709
to try and possess.

21
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:24,976
-No.

22
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,976
I can not lose to the demonic
energy of a half demon!

23
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,809
-Tessaiga!

24
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,642
It's over, Magatsuhi.

25
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:35,142
-Impossible!

26
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:48,709
INUYASHA: Naraku,
the trap of light.

27
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,176
-[screaming]

28
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:06,109
-(THINKING) This sensation,
it's like a fog has lifted.

29
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,642
-Kagome.

30
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:11,542
-My spiritual power
is returning to me.

31
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,042
Huh?

32
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,042
-Huh?

33
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:17,676
-Whoa.

34
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:18,242
INUYASHA: Kagome!

35
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,509
Huh?

36
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,009
-InuYasha?

37
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,342
InuYasha, look at you.

38
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,542
-Kagome.

39
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,176
-You're back to normal.

40
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,409
I'm so glad.

41
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,642
-Yeah, I am.

42
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,642
Thanks to your powers
of purification.

43
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:44,109
-It's all because Sesshomaru
cut down Magatsuhi.

44
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,942
Thank you.

45
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,442
Sesshomaru?

46
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,376
-(THINKING) I smell her.

47
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,742
That's Rin's scent.

48
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,209
Everything's much clearer now.

49
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,042
Did Kagome's
spiritual power purge

50
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,476
Naraku's body of demonic energy?

51
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:10,942
-Huh?

52
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:12,276
-What's going on?

53
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:14,842
-You think Naraku's
noticed we're here yet?

54
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:15,409
-Wah!

55
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:16,742
-Master Jaken!

56
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,676
-Whoa!

57
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,709
-Shippo!

58
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:19,576
-I'll be fine.

59
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,309
No need to panic.

60
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,309
Help me, Kohaku!

61
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,442
Jaken!

62
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,942
-Kohaku!

63
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:29,942
Shippo!

64
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,409
I don't want to die alone.

65
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,409
Help!

66
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,842
-Why is he attacking
us all of a sudden?

67
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:42,309
-InuYasha, we have to
find the Shikon Jewel.

68
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:43,142
-Yeah.

69
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,976
We should hurry.

70
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:47,409
All this shaking must mean
that Naraku is finally

71
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,442
getting serious
about eliminating us.

72
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,709
-(THINKING) Although
it is faint,

73
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:07,909
a light has returned
to the Shikon Jewel.

74
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,876
That can only mean that
Magatsuhi has been destroyed.

75
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:15,609
And that Kagome's purification
powers have returned.

76
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:19,076
For InuYasha and his group,
the return of this light

77
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:22,042
would likely be viewed
as a sign of hope.

78
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:25,309
[chuckling] However,
I shall soon

79
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,076
mold it into a ray of despair.

80
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:39,942
-Light?

81
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:41,209
-Huh?

82
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,276
NARAKU: So you've noticed.

83
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,542
-Naraku.

84
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,809
NARAKU: Rejoice.

85
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,276
Light has returned
to the Shikon Jewel.

86
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:50,209
Though I suspect you're
not the only ones

87
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,542
who are going to notice.

88
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:52,642
-Shut up.

89
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,809
I'm tired of listening
to your damn nonsense.

90
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:59,976
NARAKU: I'm sure your friends
will also see this light.

91
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,742
-You mean Miroku and Sango?

92
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,176
NARAKU: [chuckling] Yes.

93
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,542
What do you suppose
they're doing right now?

94
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:11,209
Also, what will they think
upon seeing this light?

95
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:11,909
-Huh?

96
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,109
What are you getting at?

97
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:15,809
NARAKU: I shall give
you a small hint.

98
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,709
Miroku's wind tunnel is
dangerously close to its limit.

99
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,409
I'm sure you know
what will happen

100
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,076
the next time he uses it.

101
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:23,576
-Huh?

102
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:33,276
-The shaking has stopped.

103
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,409
What now?

104
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:38,076
I could open my wind
tunnel right here,

105
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:40,876
do minor damage to
Naraku before perishing.

106
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,142
Pathetic.

107
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,776
Here I am inside Naraku,
yet I'm unable to do

108
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,309
so much as wound him.

109
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:53,276
-Miroku, where are you?

110
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:53,776
Miroku?

111
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,476
-Sango, we must part ways.

112
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,376
-[gasp]

113
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:05,209
-Farewell.

114
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,442
-Wait.

115
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,409
Why?

116
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:11,042
Does he intend to die alone?

117
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,642
I can't go on without him.

118
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,876
I just can't.

119
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,442
-Now then, it looks like
it's beginning to sink in.

120
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,442
You see, Miroku has
parted ways with Sango,

121
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,442
and is now wandering alone.

122
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,542
He's obviously trying to avoid
drawing Sango into his wind

123
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:28,609
tunnel when it
finally destroys him.

124
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,676
-Huh? (THINKING) Light?

125
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,176
Pure light?

126
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,342
Is it-- it must be the
light from the Shikon Jewel.

127
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:45,609
Has Kagome's spiritual
power returned?

128
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:49,976
I can follow it all the way to
the Shikon Jewel, to Naraku.

129
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,342
I can destroy him if my
wind tunnel will just

130
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,476
hold until I get there.

131
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,576
NARAKU: [chuckling]
Assured of his purpose,

132
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,742
he hastens to his death.

133
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:04,476
Meanwhile, there is
another who fears

134
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,042
his death more than anything.

135
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:10,742
-(THINKING) Light?

136
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:13,276
That's, that's from
the Shikon Jewel.

137
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,742
I'm sure of it.

138
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:17,176
That light should lead
me right to Naraku.

139
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:20,276
If I destroy him, the
curse will be lifted.

140
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:21,409
No more wind tunnel.

141
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,176
There's still a chance I
can save Miroku's life.

142
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,909
I have to find that Jewel.

143
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,409
Kirara!

144
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,876
Just you wait, Naraku

145
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,642
-Your friends,
they will no doubt

146
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,542
follow the light to
find me, won't they?

147
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:36,609
But There's no guarantee
that's what they'll find.

148
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,976
-Coward.

149
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,909
You think you can trick Miroku
into opening his wind tunnel

150
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,842
one last time, don't you?

151
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:46,142
--[chuckling] Kagome, your
light will be the death

152
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,076
of your friends.

153
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,276
-Adamant barrage!

154
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:52,542
-Nothing.

155
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:54,276
-Ah, didn't even flinch.

156
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:55,676
Now what?

157
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,876
Do we get out of here, and keep
looking for the Shikon Jewel?

158
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,509
-First, let's find Miroku.

159
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,209
We can't let him
use his wind tunnel.

160
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,509
Right.

161
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,042
--[chucking] You'll
never make it in time.

162
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:14,842
-Found you.

163
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:18,109
-You've done well to reach
me so quickly, Sango.

164
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,509
In fact, you're the
first to arrive.

165
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:25,376
-[gasp] Rin!

166
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:30,209
-Now you can destroy me,
the Shikon Jewel, too.

167
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,709
-You let her go.

168
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:32,842
-I see.

169
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,076
You won't throw
Hiraikotsu if Rin is here.

170
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:38,242
You won't do it, even though
this is the perfect opportunity

171
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:39,876
to kill me.

172
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,709
You are far too gentle.

173
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:46,409
But your gentleness
will kill the monk.

174
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,509
-What do you mean by that?

175
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,909
-Come now, Sango.

176
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:50,542
You should know
very well without my

177
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:52,509
having to explain it.

178
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,909
The monk will follow a light
he believes to be the Jewel.

179
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:59,276
Next he'll encounter an
illusion he believes to be me.

180
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,709
In a futile attempt to
destroy his hated foe,

181
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:05,476
he will open his wind
tunnel one last time.

182
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,142
-The light is glowing brighter.

183
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,342
I'm almost there.

184
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,609
-You've done well to
reach me so quickly, monk.

185
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,942
In fact, you're the
first to arrive.

186
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:27,176
-[grunting]

187
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,942
-We're close.

188
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,509
I can smell Miroku.

189
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,009
-I can sense that
we're moving away

190
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,776
from the real Shikon Jewel.

191
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,576
So Naraku is trying
to trick Miroku

192
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,642
into opening his wind
tunnel, and killing himself.

193
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:50,209
--[chuckling] Tell me, what
does this girl mean to you?

194
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:53,276
Sango, you barely
know her, right?

195
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,676
So I ask you, is it really worth
sacrificing the monk's life

196
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,142
to protect this child?

197
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,842
-(THINKING) My, my.

198
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,342
Naraku's been busy.

199
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,509
It's a lot of work to create all
these illusions for everyone.

200
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,676
Although I see that the Rin
girl is no illusion at all.

201
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,309
-(THINKING) No, I don't
want Miroku to die,

202
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:16,742
even if I go to Hell for this,
I'm going to save his life.

203
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,676
-(THINKING) Very good, Sango.

204
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,609
Kill Rin, and save
your beloved monk.

205
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,209
-(THINKING) Rin.

206
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:29,842
-(THINKING) I don't care if
my wind tunnel tears open,

207
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,676
as long as I'm able to take
Naraku and the Shikon Jewel

208
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:33,876
with me.

209
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:36,442
-(THINKING) Miroku, no
matter what he shows you,

210
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,742
don't open your wind tunnel!

211
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,174
Miroku, you better not
open your wind tunnel.

212
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:51,940
-Miroku!

213
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:54,040
-Don't do it!

214
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,507
-Good.

215
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Now open your wind tunnel.

216
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:59,007
-Miroku, no!

217
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,474
It's an illusion

218
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:03,874
-Adamant barrage!

219
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:07,074
--[chuckling] Why
do you hesitate?

220
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:07,874
Go on.

221
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,307
Or are you too afraid, monk?

222
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,974
-I don't think Miroku's
able to see us.

223
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,040
-Yeah.

224
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:17,107
He didn't react to
adamant barrage, either.

225
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,740
The only thing Miroku can see
is that illusion of Naraku.

226
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,940
And I bet Naraku is hoping
we'll be sucked into the wind

227
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,307
tunnel, along with his illusion.

228
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,407
-Miroku, the great savior.

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,274
Seems you'd rather save
yourself than your friends.

230
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:32,707
MIROKU: Forgive me, Sango.

231
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,040
I wanted to be with you forever.

232
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,240
That's enough, Naraku!

233
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:39,207
Wind tunnel--

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,907
-Miroku!

235
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,907
I won't let you.

236
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:45,974
Kagome, the beads.

237
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:46,874
-Right.

238
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,340
-That was a way too close.

239
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:51,840
If he had opened his wind tunnel
any sooner, we'd all be dead.

240
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:55,374
--[chuckling] In the end,
you chose to save yourself.

241
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,074
You've lost your attachments
to this world, monk.

242
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:58,974
-Silence.

243
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,507
I shall take you with me now.

244
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,874
-Hey, snap out of it.

245
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,707
Don't you recognize me?

246
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,640
-We have to get rid
of this illusion.

247
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,007
-[chuckling]

248
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,407
-It's still there?

249
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
Of course it is.

250
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,340
And it won't disappear,
not until the monk is dead,

251
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:19,374
and I've seen just how far Sango
will go in order to save him.

252
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:20,607
-What does that mean?

253
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:24,940
-What is this?

254
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:33,440
Rin!

255
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:34,607
Sister!

256
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Oh no.

257
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,074
She's about to show
throw Hiraikotsu.

258
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,707
-(THINKING) If I Naraku, than
Miroku's life will be saved.

259
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,374
-Stop!

260
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,240
Don't do it, sister.

261
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,240
Please stop.

262
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,574
BYAKUYA: Hello, Kohaku.

263
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:45,274
-Huh?

264
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,907
What are you doing here?

265
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,640
-Just be quiet, and watch.

266
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:51,740
I assure you, your sister
can't hear your voice, anyway.

267
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,474
KOHAKU: What are
you talking about?

268
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:56,340
-The human heart is
easily manipulated,

269
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:59,540
especially in the case of your
sister, whose heart is consumed

270
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:02,607
with the fear of losing
her beloved monk.

271
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,674
-(THINKING) If I don't
defeat Naraku now,

272
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:07,207
the wind tunnel
will pass its limit.

273
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,707
And Miroku will end up
just like his father.

274
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,307
I can't bear to let that happen.

275
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,640
-(THINKING) Sango, your weakness
is the perfect complement

276
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,040
to the darkness of
the Shikon Jewel.

277
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,107
-(THINKING) The darkness of
the Shikon Jewel has purged

278
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,940
my purifying light.

279
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:29,907
--[chuckling] It appears
Sango has fallen.

280
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,007
KAGOME: (THINKING) The
light will be swallowed.

281
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,074
I have to stop this before
Naraku recovers his power.

282
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,074
But how?

283
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,707
What am I supposed to shoot?

284
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,840
-Kagome?

285
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,240
KAGOME: (THINKING)
Look carefully.

286
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:47,074
I see it, his real boy.

287
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,474
This better work!

288
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:49,907
-Forgive me, Rin!

289
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,340
-Sister!

290
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:56,540
--[chuckling] As soon as Sango's
Hiraikotsu destroys Rin,

291
00:14:56,574 --> 00:15:01,707
the Shikon Jewel will once
again be filled with darkness.

292
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,840
-(THINKING) It disappeared.

293
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:04,474
-(THINKING) It's
just like before,

294
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,674
when I shot Lady Hitomiko.

295
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,874
It'll work.

296
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,307
I just have to wait.

297
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,074
My arrow will hit Naraku.

298
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,074
-Hmm?

299
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,040
-[gasp]

300
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:19,007
-[gasp]

301
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,007
-Rin!

302
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,974
-Kohaku?

303
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,107
-It's OK.

304
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,374
Rin's going to be all right.

305
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,840
-You tried to kill
her, didn't you?

306
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,607
Along with the illusion of
Naraku that I showed you.

307
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,740
-(THINKING) Illusion?

308
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,240
BYAKUYA: You were
going to sacrifice

309
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,440
Rin, if it meant saving the
monk's life, weren't you?

310
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:39,740
-(THINKING) I--

311
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:42,674
-I'm afraid it doesn't really
matter how you spin it.

312
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,607
The fact is, you were
weighing human lives

313
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,240
against one another.

314
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,174
It's fitting, really.

315
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:50,274
The demon slayer
Sango slays herself.

316
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:50,774
Whoopsie.

317
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,807
-Lord Sesshomaru!

318
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
-(THINKING) Sesshomaru.

319
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:00,540
-If that was intended
for me, you've

320
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:02,640
got the wrong
person, Sesshomaru.

321
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:06,040
But my guess is you were
listening to our conversation.

322
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,140
So I'll leave you
two to settle this.

323
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,407
Bye now.

324
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,840
(THINKING) Boy, I sure don't
like the looks of this.

325
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,807
It seems his real body
has taken a serious blow.

326
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,640
But I suppose if
I'm still here, it

327
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,840
must be proof that Naraku
and the Shikon Jewel

328
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,140
are still in one piece.

329
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:23,174
I guess the time has
come to use this.

330
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,440
-Sesshomaru, if you
wish to kill me,

331
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,307
I will not try to resist you.

332
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,307
-Sister, what are you saying?

333
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,774
Lord Sesshomaru, please.

334
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:37,707
Rin is safe.

335
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,807
Forgive my sister.

336
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,807
-There's no excuse.

337
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,707
I tried to kill Rin.

338
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,940
-My sister was deceived
by an illusion of Naraku.

339
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:48,874
-It doesn't change the fact that
I was ready to sacrifice her.

340
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,807
I would've done anything
to defeat Naraku, anything!

341
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,174
-Sister.

342
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,807
-I will not attempt to justify
it, or beg for my life.

343
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,907
But please, let me finish this.

344
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,374
Once the curse has been lifted
from Miroku, I'm all yours.

345
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,874
-Sister.

346
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,807
-InuYasha, please
leave me behind.

347
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,140
-I can't do that.

348
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:16,207
If I leave you alone,
there's a good chance

349
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,340
another illusion of
Naraku might trick you

350
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:19,607
into opening your wind tunnel.

351
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,774
-It could tear
open at any moment.

352
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,874
If it does, you'll
be sucked in with me.

353
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,874
-Hah, it's going to take more
than your dumb wind tunnel

354
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,174
to scare me away.

355
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,940
-Besides, if we ever
make it out of here,

356
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,640
Sango's going to need
you in one piece.

357
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:32,607
-Yeah.

358
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,807
We need you, Miroku.

359
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,940
We're all going home alive.

360
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:44,407
-The light!

361
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,840
-(THINKING) The
smell has changed.

362
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:49,907
Naraku is in the
direction of the light.

363
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,974
Hurry.

364
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,074
-Huh?

365
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:53,840
-You want to find
the monk, don't you?

366
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,374
-Hey, sister, let's go.

367
00:17:58,407 --> 00:17:59,640
-Yes, right.

368
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,174
(THINKING) Does
this mean Sesshomaru

369
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:11,007
is going to wait to kill me
until after Naraku is defeated?

370
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,907
Is Miroku even still alive?

371
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,240
I have to see him one last time.

372
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:25,874
INUYASHA: Naraku!

373
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,174
-The light is
returning to the Jewel.

374
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,340
-I see it, too.

375
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,607
That means your arrow
must have hit him.

376
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,874
-You found me, InuYasha.

377
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:39,274
You do realize this is your
only chance to kill me.

378
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,807
-I don't need you to tell me to
send you and the Shikon Jewel

379
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,040
to the under world.

380
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:45,740
Meido Zangetsuha!

381
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:49,007
-[gasp]

382
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,607
--[chuckling] Looks
like you missed.

383
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,374
-Impossible.

384
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:59,574
-[panting] A light.

385
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,974
Where is it coming from?

386
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:07,007
Huh? [screaming]

387
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,807
It's InuYasha's
Meido Zangetsuha.

388
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,640
That's as close as I
ever want to get to it.

389
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,507
Huh?

390
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,907
[panting] That's
Byakuya of the Dreams.

391
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,607
-I guess the time has
finally come to draw this.

392
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:38,874
-Huh? (THINKING)
There's no blade.

393
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:50,240
What?

394
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,007
How did he just do that?

395
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,574
-Yoohoo.

396
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,574
You can come out now.

397
00:19:57,607 --> 00:20:00,074
-Hey, what did you just do, huh?

398
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,374
-You saw that?

399
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,607
-I took some of Meido
Zangetsuha's demonic energy.

400
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,674
Naraku told me to collect some.

401
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,640
-Collect some?

402
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,274
How dare you do that?

403
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,307
Meido Zangetsuha is a technique
that Sesshomaru and InuYasha

404
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,707
had to work for.

405
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,407
You can't just show
up and take it.

406
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,274
-(THINKING) It's true.

407
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:20,174
That's why this sword
can only be used once.

408
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:24,040
I have no idea how
Naraku intends to use it.

409
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:27,274
But I do know that
the end is near.

410
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:30,274
Oh, this is your last chance to
escape before the hole closes.

411
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:30,740
-Huh?

412
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,607
So you're not going
to capture me?

413
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,040
Why not?

414
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:44,640
--[chuckling] Don't
forget, InuYasha,

415
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:48,107
light and dark may be battling
against each other in here.

416
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,807
But until you defeat me,
I control this place.

417
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,540
-That's enough of your lies.

418
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:54,640
[gasp]

419
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:55,640
-His miasma.

420
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:56,507
-Damn it!

421
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,007
-InuYasha.

422
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:05,940
-Huh?

423
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,307
-Hey, Rin, you're awake.

424
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,807
-Kohaku.

425
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,874
You'll be safe now.

426
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:11,874
-Lord Sesshomaru!

427
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,740
-It's miasma.

428
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:21,974
Sister.

429
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,540
-Rin, I'm sorry.

430
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,040
-Huh?

431
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:29,407
-I'm going ahead.

432
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,540
-You can't go without
your protective mask.

433
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:36,607
-(THINKING) So she's
risking her life.

434
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,807
-Have you noticed
anything different?

435
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,674
This miasma is much more potent.

436
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:44,174
In fact, it is
deadly, especially

437
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,674
for weak humans like
Kagome and the monk.

438
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:48,340
-(THINKING) He's not
taking any chances.

439
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,140
Yo must be getting
desperate, Naraku.

440
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:53,807
-(THINKING) Naraku is
afraid of my arrow.

441
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,674
He doesn't want me to shoot.

442
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,840
-This won't be enough
to get rid of us.

443
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,974
Prepare yourself, Naraku!

444
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,086
I'm coming for you!

445
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:12,338
[music playing]

446
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,021
-It would seem the
time has finally

447
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:48,188
come for me to fulfill my role.

448
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:49,121
-Give up, Naraku.

449
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,388
It's all over.

450
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:51,854
KAGOME: InuYasha's
Meido Zangetsuha

451
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,154
and Sesshomaru's Bakusaiga
are overwhelming Naraku.

452
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:56,554
But why, Naraku?

453
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,021
NARAKU: The Shikon
Jewel will never

454
00:23:58,054 --> 00:23:59,654
disappear from this world.

455
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,954
Even if I am destroyed,
it will live on.

456
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,121
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act"--

457
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,454
Naraku's Uncertain Wish.

458
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,421
KAGOME: Naraku, what were you
even trying to accomplish?
