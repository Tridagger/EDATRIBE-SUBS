1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,733
[music playing]

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,700
-Hm.

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,633
Huh?

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,200
-What?

5
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:11,933
A Meido.

6
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,000
Kagome!

7
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:15,266
-Inuyasha!

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,533
Inuyasha!

9
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,933
-The well.

10
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,500
What happened to the
Bone Eater's Well?

11
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:23,233
-She's right.

12
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,766
It's disappeared.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,900
Meido Zangetsuha!

14
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:34,500
Of course, the Shikon
jewel was afraid of Kagome.

15
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,466
SHIKON JEWEL: Kagome, you never
belonged in the Feudal era.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,933
Return.

17
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:43,333
Return to the world
where you belong.

18
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:48,866
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): If
I wish to return, I can?

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,366
-Kagome!

20
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,900
Don't you make any wishes.

21
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:54,400
Kagome!

22
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:13,244
"Toward Tomorrow."

23
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,683
MIROKU: Shippo.

24
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:27,117
Let us take over, Shippo.

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,450
Your health will suffer if
you don't get some rest.

26
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:32,317
-What happened to them?

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,450
Where did they go?

28
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:37,283
-With Naraku gone, I
thought it'd be over,

29
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,550
but it seems I was wrong.

30
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,883
Our fate remains tied
to the Shikon jewel.

31
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:08,283
-What?

32
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:08,783
A human?

33
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:23,983
-That is the priestess who
created the Shikon jewel.

34
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:35,250
-So that was Midoriko?

35
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:38,683
-She has been locked in battle
with us for hundreds of years,

36
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,650
ever since the jewel was born.

37
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,617
And Kagome will
suffer the same fate.

38
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,583
-There's no way I'm
going to let that happen.

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,017
Huh?

40
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,783
Naraku?

41
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:01,383
You're still alive?

42
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,283
-He's dead, but soon, he
shall come back to life

43
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:08,417
when Kagome gives into
her fear of the darkness

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,483
and falls prey to the
trap set by the jewel.

45
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,983
Naraku will awaken, and
a new battle of the souls

46
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:20,083
will begin within the
Shikon jewel, a battle that

47
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,883
will continue forever
from the very moment

48
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,683
that the Shikon jewel
was first transported

49
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,917
through time to the Feudal era.

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,783
From the beginning, this
has been Kagome's fate.

51
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:34,750
-So that's why the Shikon jewel
brought Kagome and Naraku here?

52
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:37,517
It wants their souls to fight
each other for all eternity?

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,650
-Kagome was born to
become part of the jewel

54
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:41,850
and fight within it.

55
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,317
That is the point
of her existence.

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,683
-You're wrong.

57
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,517
That's not why Kagome
was born, and I'm

58
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,183
going to prove it to you.

59
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:01,283
Kagome taught me how to smile.

60
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:05,417
More than that, she taught
me how to believe in people.

61
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,150
Kagome was the reason I was
able to make friends and rely

62
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:11,283
on those friends, to
shed tears for others,

63
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,050
to understand the meaning of
true strength and kindness.

64
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,650
Those are all things
Kagome taught me.

65
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:20,317
So this, this can't be her fate.

66
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,350
Kagome came into this
world to be with me,

67
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:25,683
and I was born for her as well.

68
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:30,083
SHIKON JEWEL: You're not
going to make a wish?

69
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:33,450
So you're choosing eternal
solitude in this darkness

70
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:33,950
instead.

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,850
-I'm coming.

72
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,483
Can you hear my voice?

73
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,917
Kagome, can you hear me?

74
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,417
Kagome!

75
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,917
-Inuyasha?

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,683
INUYASHA: Kagome!

77
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,717
-I can hear Inuyasha's voice.

78
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,983
-Don't make any wishes.

79
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,617
Promise me you won't.

80
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,017
Just hold on till I get there.

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,483
-Inuyasha!

82
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:09,883
I can hear your voice.

83
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,417
-Do you wish to see Inuyasha?

84
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,683
Answer me, Kagome.

85
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:18,450
Do you wish to see him?

86
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,850
KAGOME: Just like Kikyo.

87
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:23,350
She wished to see
Inuyasha again.

88
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:24,817
And even Naraku.

89
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,983
I'm sure his wish
was a modest one too.

90
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,183
What they didn't know is
that the Shikon jewel never

91
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:36,050
grants your real wish.

92
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,483
-Then what will you do?

93
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,917
-It is as we've told you.

94
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,817
There is only one way for
the two of you to meet again.

95
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,417
And that is for Kagome
to wish upon the jewel

96
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,717
and be trapped within it
as a fallen priestess.

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,650
You've made it
worse, half-demon.

98
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:59,517
For the sound of your voice has
only given Kagome false hope.

99
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,983
-What?

100
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,917
DEMON: Now, she will
undoubtedly make a wish.

101
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,050
Inuyasha, I want
to see you again.

102
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,417
-Kagome!

103
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,083
-We will not let her
hear your voice again.

104
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:14,017
-Shut up!

105
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,483
-Kagome!

106
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,450
SHIKON JEWEL: Be true
to your heart, Kagome.

107
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,917
You want to see Inuyasha.

108
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,850
Wish it, and it shall be so.

109
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,717
-Is that the one and
only correct wish?

110
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,750
-It is said that in the
end when the person who

111
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:35,217
obtains the Shikon jewel makes
the one and only correct wish,

112
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,117
the jewel will be purified
and disappear from this world

113
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,050
forever.

114
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,950
The one and only correct wish.

115
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:44,050
I just figured it out.

116
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,217
I understand now.

117
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,483
-Where are you?

118
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:52,983
Kagome!

119
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,550
What is this?

120
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,183
I can't see a way out.

121
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:11,317
Inuyasha has always come for me.

122
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,183
I've made my choice.

123
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,150
I have no wish.

124
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:19,583
Inuyasha will come for me.

125
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:20,683
I believe in him.

126
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,417
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Meido Tessaiga.

127
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:46,817
Are you telling me that's
where I'm supposed to cut?

128
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,250
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
It'll be fine.

129
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:51,750
I believe in you, Inuyasha.

130
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:52,483
-Meido Zangetsuha!

131
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:08,183
Kagome.

132
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,817
-Inuyasha.

133
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,250
It's not an illusion.

134
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:28,717
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Kagome.

135
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,717
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha,
I wanted to see you.

136
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,983
Shikon jewel, I'm
ready to make my wish.

137
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:56,017
If Inuyasha hadn't
come, I would have

138
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,450
given in to my fear
of the darkness.

139
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,317
I never would have
found the correct wish.

140
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,550
But now, with Inuyasha beside
me, I am not afraid anymore.

141
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:13,517
Shikon jewel, disappear forever.

142
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,217
-I feel so warm.

143
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,617
So this is how it
feels to be at peace.

144
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,583
-It's over now.

145
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,283
-Yeah.

146
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:54,117
It's over.

147
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,435
-Lady Kaede, hurry.

148
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:12,868
-Don't rush me, child.

149
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,735
-But the baby's coming soon.

150
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,901
-Where is the
master of the house?

151
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:18,535
-He had to go to work.

152
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,335
-Ah well, I guess it is
their third child after all.

153
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,168
That's right.

154
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,068
It has already been three years.

155
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:29,835
MIROKU: Not to worry, gentleman.

156
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:32,368
Soon your houses will
be rid of demons.

157
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,901
-But a whole bale of
rice for each charm.

158
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,435
-Oh, this is much too expensive.

159
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:42,535
-[gasp] He used three.

160
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:45,268
-Inuyasha, here it comes.

161
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,235
-Huh?

162
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:48,735
Tessaiga!

163
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:58,368
Man, you totally ripped
those people off.

164
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,768
You were always greedy, but
this is a whole new level.

165
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,201
-I have to take what
I can get, my friend.

166
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,868
I have a lot of expenses now.

167
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,735
-Speaking of which,
shouldn't your baby

168
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:10,668
be coming any moment now?

169
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,068
[baby crying]

170
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:12,735
KAEDE: There.

171
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,435
You did well, Sango.

172
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,768
-It's a healthy baby boy.

173
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,535
-That was such a fast delivery.

174
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:24,901
-Everyone OK?

175
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,868
-Hm.

176
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,335
-Come hold your son.

177
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,868
-I wonder how Kagome's
doing these days.

178
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,035
-Yes.

179
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:40,701
Three years is a long time.

180
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,001
I remember waiting
for three days

181
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,735
right in the spot where the
Bone Eater's Well had been.

182
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,335
Then there was that
pillar of light,

183
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,735
and the well just reappeared.

184
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,968
And there was Inuyasha
without Kagome.

185
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:02,235
-Kagome is safe.

186
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,735
-Do you think she returned
to the other world

187
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,101
that Inuyasha spoke of?

188
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,535
-Well, it's not something
he likes to talk about,

189
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:14,735
but he once told me, as
much as he needs her here,

190
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,868
there are others who need
her and love her as he does.

191
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,268
-I feel for him.

192
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:21,268
Inuyasha must be lonely.

193
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,735
MALE SPEAKER (ON
LOUDSPEAKER): Congratulations

194
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:36,668
to our new graduates.

195
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:44,468
GRADUATE: Kagome!

196
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,401
-Hey.

197
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,668
-Hi, Mrs. Higurashi.

198
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,501
-Congratulations, girls.

199
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,701
-We all got accepted
into University.

200
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:52,401
-My.

201
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:53,535
That's wonderful news.

202
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,168
-I want to become
an interpreter.

203
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,101
-News anchor for me.

204
00:12:57,135 --> 00:12:58,601
-Well, try student
president first.

205
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,901
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
It's been three years.

206
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,801
Three days after the well
disappeared, a pillar of light

207
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,435
emerged, and the Bone
Eater's Well was back

208
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:17,801
and Inuyashi and I back with it.

209
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,401
-Sis, you're back.

210
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:19,835
-Kagome!

211
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:22,668
-Kagome!

212
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,068
-Mom.

213
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,235
-I was so worried about you.

214
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,035
-Inuyashi saved my life.

215
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,635
Inuyashi, thank you so--

216
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:33,135
-Huh?

217
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:40,668
-Inuyasha.

218
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,868
Since that day, the
well hasn't worked.

219
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,168
I can't see Inuyasha anymore.

220
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:52,335
INUYASHA: It was strange.

221
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:54,235
One minute I was there
in Kagome's world,

222
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,868
feeling so relieved.

223
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,901
KAEDE: And the next, you
found yourself back here.

224
00:13:58,935 --> 00:13:59,468
-Yeah.

225
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,968
Just like that.

226
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,868
I remember how Kagome's
mother, brother, and grandpa

227
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:05,768
were crying.

228
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,135
When I saw that, I realized
I wasn't the only one who

229
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:11,235
cared about Kagome
and needed her.

230
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,135
-Inuyasha, I'm speechless.

231
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,368
When did you become
such an understanding

232
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,501
and caring person?

233
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:17,668
SHIPPO: Weird, huh?

234
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:18,968
-Oh, Shippo.

235
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,701
You were off taking the Fox
Demon Exam, were you not?

236
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:25,735
-I just got promoted.

237
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,668
-Inuyasha, you're still going to
the well once every three days,

238
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,668
aren't you?

239
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,201
-Every three days?

240
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:33,635
Your devotion is
quite remarkable.

241
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:34,268
-Ahh!

242
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,035
So sunny up here.

243
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,601
KAEDE (VOICEOVER): Yet
they still cannot meet.

244
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:43,235
Kagome was cast into this
world with the Shikon jewel

245
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:48,068
and cast from it the
moment it ceased to exist.

246
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,701
She came here to destroy
the Shikon jewel.

247
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:54,835
Though I wish it
were not so, it may

248
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:57,568
be that Kagome's role
in this world is over.

249
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,201
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Why
did the well stop working?

250
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,801
Was it because of
the feelings I had.

251
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:24,901
Did I do it?

252
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:27,835
When the Bone Eater's Well
disappeared and I was left

253
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:33,035
stranded alone in the darkness,
I felt so scared and sad.

254
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,435
What I didn't
realize at the time

255
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,335
was that I'd been in the
darkness for three whole days.

256
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,668
Poor Mom, Grandpa, and Sota.

257
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:43,401
With me gone, they felt as
scared and sad as I did.

258
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,235
I felt really bad about
what I put them through,

259
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,835
and I was just so
happy to be back here.

260
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,201
I felt so relieved.

261
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,368
And then the well closed.

262
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,235
Inuyasha, ever
since then, I can't

263
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:58,968
stop thinking that
maybe the reason I

264
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,468
went to the Feudal
era and the reason

265
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,535
the well stopped working after
the Shikon jewel disappeared

266
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:07,935
was that my job was
done and I'm meant

267
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:15,501
to spend the rest of my
life in this world, a world

268
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:18,601
without you.

269
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:26,135
But Inuyasha, I want to see you.

270
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:39,035
-Kagome?

271
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,068
What's wrong?

272
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:41,601
-Mom.

273
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:49,868
The sky.

274
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:57,168
-Hm.

275
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:03,635
-Mom, I-- I've been thinking.

276
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:07,435
-Kagome, I understand.

277
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:17,605
TWINS: Doggie, doggie.

278
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:18,838
-You make a good toy.

279
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,438
-Hey, would you do
something about the twins?

280
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,138
-Girls, leave his ears alone.

281
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,605
-I'm sorry, Inuyasha.

282
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:28,138
-All right, girls.

283
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,105
Go slay the fox.

284
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:31,938
-No way.

285
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,138
I didn't sign up for this.

286
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,205
-Oh, Shippo.

287
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,472
-We slayed you.

288
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:36,872
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
This scent.

289
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:37,938
There's no mistake.

290
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,838
-Inuyasha, I'm so sorry.

291
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:09,805
Were you waiting here for me?

292
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,272
-Kagome, you idiot.

293
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,138
What have you been
doing all this time?

294
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:20,638
-Kogame!

295
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:23,038
-You made it back.

296
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,005
-It's been much
too long, Kagome.

297
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,072
-Miroku, Sango, Shippo,
it's good to see you.

298
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:29,605
-Hey.

299
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,505
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): I'm back.

300
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:40,872
[theme music]

301
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:51,005
-So, uh, what movie
do you want to go see?

302
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:51,838
-Hey, Sota.

303
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,105
I hear your sister's pretty hot.

304
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:54,705
Is that true or what?

305
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,572
-You should introduce
us sometime.

306
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,038
-That would be hard to do.

307
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,038
She got married right
after high school.

308
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:00,738
-That's fast.

309
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,038
-She's married already?

310
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,305
-Oh hey, Grandpa.

311
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,105
How'd your check-up go?

312
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,872
-Ah, uric acid
levels, but that's it.

313
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:09,805
-Welcome home.

314
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:10,738
Dinner's ready.

315
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,505
Come on up.

316
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:13,005
-Later.

317
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:13,505
-Later.

318
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:20,138
-Hey, Rukeichi.

319
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,238
You're working hard
today, my friend.

320
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:23,005
-Ha.

321
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,438
Just keeping up with you.

322
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:26,672
[twins singing]

323
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,105
KAGOME: A lot has changed
since I've been gone.

324
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:32,338
But I guess that's to be
expected after three years.

325
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,072
Shippo leaves the village
at least a few times a month

326
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,872
to continue his training to
become a full-fledged fox

327
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,238
demon.

328
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:41,772
Miroku and Sango have
a growing family,

329
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,205
and that keeps them busier
than fighting demons ever did.

330
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:48,338
And as for Sango's
little brother, Kohaku--

331
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:49,472
-Master Totosai.

332
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,172
-Ah hello, Kohaku.

333
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,938
I brought the weapon
you requested.

334
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:56,172
It's a bit heavy.

335
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,038
-Thanks, Totosai.

336
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,438
-Tell me.

337
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,238
Do you still go and visit
Sango and her brood from time

338
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:02,305
to time?

339
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:03,105
-No.

340
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:04,872
It's too crowded there.

341
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,738
KAGOME: He's training to become
a mighty demon slayer, so

342
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:10,438
that he can help those who
are troubled by demons.

343
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:13,305
And if you're wondering
about that old flea Myoga.

344
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,138
-Come on.

345
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:14,938
Come on.

346
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,672
I'm right here.

347
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,105
KAGOME: I've also heard rumors
that Koga and Ayame were

348
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:22,105
married and that now he's become
the chief of the Wolf Demon

349
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,138
Tribe.

350
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,005
-Miss Ayame, take
good care of Koga.

351
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,472
All right.

352
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,538
-Oh, she'll take care of him and
keep him on a nice short leash

353
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:30,905
too.

354
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,605
-Both of you better shut up if
you know what's good for you.

355
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:36,305
Don't think I won't
beat you down--

356
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,638
-Is this one medicinal too?

357
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,605
Jinenji and Lady Kaede
have been teaching

358
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:41,772
me a lot of new things.

359
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,905
I'm even helping them to
make antidotes and perform

360
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:44,972
exorcisms.

361
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:47,305
-You're taking this
stuff seriously, huh?

362
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:48,438
-Yep.

363
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,738
I need to hurry up and
get used to this world.

364
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:55,338
As for Rin, she's been living
with Kaede in the village.

365
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:57,805
I thought Sesshomaru
would take her with me.

366
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,872
-Well, Kaede told him that
first she needed practice living

367
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,372
with humans, so Rin could
make the choice herself.

368
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,705
-Oh look, Sesshomaru.

369
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:10,972
I see that Kagome has returned.

370
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,272
-Hm.

371
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,872
-Big brother!

372
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,705
[growl]

373
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,605
-That's weird.

374
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:18,572
He looked like he was annoyed.

375
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:19,672
Huh, you too.

376
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:21,038
-That just sounded really wrong.

377
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:21,972
OK.

378
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:24,138
-How dare she be
so disrespectful.

379
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,038
We must reprimand her
for such behavior.

380
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:30,672
-Shut your mouth,
or I'll kill you.

381
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:31,772
-My, my.

382
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:34,138
Has Sesshomaru brought
you another present?

383
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:35,572
-He brought me a new kimono.

384
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:39,905
KAGOME: As I live
in this world, I

385
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:42,072
know that things will
continue to change,

386
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:45,605
but I'm not worried
about the future.

387
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,172
I'm going to spend
every day with Inuyasha.

388
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,872
No matter what, now
I know the two of us

389
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:55,638
will be together as we
head toward tomorrow.

390
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:10,905
