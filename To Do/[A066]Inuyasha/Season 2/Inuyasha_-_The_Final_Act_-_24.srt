[music playing]

00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:10,300
[theme music]

3
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,631
-Found you.

4
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:53,498
[gasp] Rin!

5
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:58,931
-(THINKING) Miroku, you better
not open your wind tunnel.

6
00:01:58,964 --> 00:01:59,698
-Miroku!

7
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,464
-Don't do it.!

8
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:03,864
-That's enough, Naraku!

9
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:04,864
Wind tunnel--

10
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:05,864
-Miroku!

11
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:08,498
I won't let you.

12
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:09,998
Kagome, the beads.

13
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:10,898
-Right.

14
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,298
(THINKING) I see
it, his real body.

15
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,598
This better work.

16
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,964
-Forgive me, Rin!

17
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:18,439
-Hmm?

18
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:24,198
-Huh?

19
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,131
-You tried to kill
her, didn't you,

20
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:29,664
along with the illusion of
Naraku that I created for you?

21
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:34,364
It's fitting, really, the demon
slayer Sango slays herself.

22
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:38,198
-I will not attempt to justify
it, or beg for my life.

23
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,764
But please, let me finish this.

24
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:46,264
Once the curse has been lifted
from Miroku, I'm all yours.

25
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,231
-[chuckling]

26
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,231
-His miasma!

27
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,198
-Damn it!

28
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,664
-Have you noticed
anything different?

29
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:55,231
This miasma is much more potent.

30
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,598
In fact, it is
deadly, especially

31
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:00,364
for weak humans like
Kagome and the monk.

32
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,031
-(THINKING) He's not
taking any chances.

33
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:04,764
You must be getting
desperate, Naraku.

34
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,164
-(THINKING) Naraku is
afraid of my arrow.

35
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:08,831
He doesn't want me to shoot.

36
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,131
-This won't be enough
to get rid of us.

37
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:12,864
Prepare yourself, Naraku.

38
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:14,698
I'm coming for you!

39
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,198
INUYASHA: Narku's
Uncertain Wish.

40
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,164
-Lord InuYasha!

41
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:33,631
-You'd better make it
out of there, InuYasha.

42
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:37,364
You have inherited Meido
Zangetsuha from your brother.

43
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:40,964
But now it is up to you to
make the technique your own.

44
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:42,831
Do that, and you can not lose.

45
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:52,564
-(THINKING) The miasma
is getting stronger.

46
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,998
-Lord Sesshomaru, please
catch up to Sango.

47
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:56,498
-Hmm.

48
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:03,864
-What?

49
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:08,198
-So he doesn't want us to
catch up to her, does he?

50
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,131
-(THINKING) Wait for me, Miroku.

51
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,364
-Whoa.

52
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:22,231
It'll take more than
that to defeat me.

53
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,064
Good.

54
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,698
I still have Genenges antidote.

55
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,031
As long as I take
this, I don't have

56
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,964
to be afraid of the miasma.

57
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,831
Only the three left.

58
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:34,798
That's OK.

59
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,164
I'll just go as far as I can.

60
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:40,764
-Damn.

61
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:42,964
Can't get a solid footing.

62
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,398
-Whoa!

63
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:45,364
-Don't worry.

64
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,831
I've got you, Kagome.

65
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:48,231
-Thank you.

66
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:48,798
Huh?

67
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,131
[wind howling]

68
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,831
-(THINKING) I can hear the
sound of Miroku's wind tunnel,

69
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,398
even when it's closed.

70
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:55,664
We don't have much time.

71
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,198
--[chuckling] InuYasha, as your
bitterness towards me grows

72
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:06,231
and gets stronger, so too does
the darkness within the Shikon

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,364
Jewel.

74
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,064
So struggle more,
suffer more, and lament

75
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,231
your own powerlessness.

76
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,631
-Naraku!

77
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,231
-Ah, Sango.

78
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,698
I've been waiting.

79
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,064
-Sango!

80
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,398
-(THINKING) Sango.

81
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:30,131
-(THINKING) Miroku, I found you.

82
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,664
-Sango, where is
your protective mask?

83
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,998
You won't be able to
survive the miasma.

84
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,464
-I'll shatter any miasma
or demonic energy.

85
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:40,164
Hiraikotsu.

86
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:41,264
-What's that?

87
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:44,431
-Miasma tornadoes.

88
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,898
-Have you've forgotten?

89
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,198
Hiraikotsu can shatter
your demonic energy.

90
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,031
-It worked.

91
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,864
-[labored breathing]

92
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:00,864
-Oh no!

93
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,764
NARAKU: It's too late for that.

94
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:09,164
Sango has already been
thoroughly exposed

95
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,498
to my miasma.

96
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,131
She should never
have given the mask,

97
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,664
her only means of
protection, to Rin.

98
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,464
It was a foolish
decision based on guilt.

99
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:20,331
And it will cost Sango her life.

100
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,731
-Sango!

101
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:23,164
Ah!

102
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,431
-Sango, Miroku!

103
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,364
Whoa.

104
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:33,764
InuYasha, we have to save them.

105
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:34,264
-Right.

106
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,064
--[chuckling] The least you
can do is allow them to spend

107
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,964
their last moments
alive in privacy.

108
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,831
-Sango!

109
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,264
Please, wake up, Sango.

110
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,031
Why?

111
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,631
Why did you do that?

112
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:05,331
[wind howling]

113
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:10,798
-(THINKING) I can still hear
it, Miroku's wind tunnel.

114
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,864
I, I failed, didn't I?

115
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:18,598
-Please forgive me
for abandoning you.

116
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:19,098
-Miroku?

117
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:24,531
Take me with you.

118
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:27,598
Promise me that
we'll die together.

119
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:31,798
-Sango.

120
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:43,031
-[chuckling]

121
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,931
-The hell is going on, Kagome?

122
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,331
-It's the Jewel.

123
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:47,831
It's been taken
over by darkness.

124
00:07:55,064 --> 00:08:00,531
-The power of darkness feeds
off the monk and Sango's sorrow.

125
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,931
-Damn you, Naraku!

126
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,798
-Ironic, isn't it?

127
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,998
The stronger their
love is for each other,

128
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,598
the greater their despair.

129
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,198
The monk and Sango
will soon be no more.

130
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,098
They have chosen
to die together.

131
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,564
Even now, they wait for his wind
tunnel to swallow them both.

132
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:18,698
Do you understand, InuYasha?

133
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,631
The two of them will
soon be consumed

134
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:23,098
by the darkness of
the Shikon Jewel.

135
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:24,631
-I'm not going to
let that happen.

136
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,231
Naraku, I'll defeat
you here and now,

137
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:30,398
and lift the curse of
the wind tunnel for good.

138
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:33,398
Meido Zangetsuha!

139
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,864
-(THINKING) Naraku is joining
with the Shikon Jewel.

140
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,831
-He's not being sucked into it.

141
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:46,831
-Is that the power of the Jewel?

142
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,898
-All those years
ago, the Shikon Jewel

143
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:56,331
was supposed to have
burned with Kikyo's corpse,

144
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,431
and been obliterated
from this world.

145
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:02,698
Even so, the Shikon Jewel used
Kikyo's lingering feelings

146
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:07,398
for InuYasha, as well Kagome's,
her own reincarnation,

147
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,564
to return to this world.

148
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:11,998
Shattered but not
destroyed, the Jewel

149
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,298
continued to bring
new disaster, as it

150
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:18,431
slowly but surely reassembled.

151
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:21,564
The Shikon Jewel will never
disappear from this world.

152
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:25,131
Even if I am destroyed,
it will live on.

153
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,064
-(THINKING) Huh?

154
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:32,898
Naraku, what were-- what were
you even trying to accomplish?

155
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,131
-(THINKING) Huh?

156
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,498
Kagome?

157
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,498
-The whole time you've
been fighting against us,

158
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,598
it's always the same
thing, over and over again.

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,531
First, you tore Kikyo
and InuYasha apart,

160
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:49,931
forced Sango and Kohaku to
fight against each other.

161
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,931
And now you're trying to use the
love between Miroku and Sango

162
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,931
to destroy them.

163
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,931
You can't stand
love and friendship.

164
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,064
So you've devoted
your entire life

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,431
trying to break people apart.

166
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:04,331
But why?

167
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:07,731
Is that all you really wanted?

168
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,198
-Why ask me now?

169
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:10,998
-You couldn't have done
any of those things

170
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:13,198
if you didn't understand
the human heart.

171
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,098
The pain of loss wouldn't
mean anything to you

172
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,164
if you didn't know
what if it felt

173
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,598
like to have a
bond with someone.

174
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:21,031
-(THINKING) Kagome,
what are you doing?

175
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:24,198
-Nothing will ever satisfy you,
because the Shikon Jewel didn't

176
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,598
grant your real wish.

177
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:29,498
-(THINKING) This woman.

178
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,798
-You were hesitating,
weren't you?

179
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,464
Because you know
the Shikon Jewel

180
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:36,598
turns every body that it
absorbs into a true monster.

181
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:39,264
-(THINKING) My hesitation.

182
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,798
-You have a complete
Shikon Jewel in your hands.

183
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:44,698
And yet we both know you still
haven't tried to absorb it.

184
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,564
-That changes nothing.

185
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:48,364
Are you so naive
that you think you

186
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,631
can purify my heart
with your empty words?

187
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:51,898
Well, you are sadly mistaken!

188
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,464
-Kagome, stand back!

189
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:56,431
Meido Zangetsuha!

190
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:56,864
Naraku!

191
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,531
You and I may be nothing alike.

192
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,531
But we are both half demons.

193
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,531
That means that in
both of us there

194
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:13,498
is a human heart and
a demon heart, Naraku.

195
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:17,398
But you have betrayed that.

196
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,731
We were both given
the freedom to choose,

197
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,131
to follow our human
heart or our demon heart.

198
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,264
And you chose to
live as a demon,

199
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:27,664
ignoring all that
was human in you.

200
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,898
You chose to hurt
others, and curse them

201
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,664
with misery and suffering.

202
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,364
But your days of
hurting my friends

203
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,331
are over, you miserable bastard!

204
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:36,831
-Huh?

205
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,964
-(THINKING) Meido took
the form of blades.

206
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,598
-(THINKING) Impossible.

207
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:49,398
My tentacles are gone!

208
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:52,364
-So Meido Zangetsuha
has evolved.

209
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,398
-Wonderful!

210
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,231
Does this mean that
the technique now

211
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,798
truly belongs to
Master InuYasha?

212
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,198
-Yes.

213
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,031
As you know, Meido
Zangetsuha was first

214
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:04,098
achieved using
Sesshomaru's Tessaiga,

215
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,264
a sword that can not cut.

216
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:09,031
Thus, the original method
of opening the Meido

217
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:13,631
and sending foes to their death
was best suited to that sword.

218
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,664
-So the fact that InuYasha
was able to produce this new

219
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,031
Meido--

220
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,231
-InuYasha's sword and technique
have finally united as one.

221
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:22,198
-Yes?

222
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,098
-Miedo has taken
the form of a blade.

223
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,298
-Yes?

224
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,698
-And that is a reflection
of InuYasha's Tessaiga.

225
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:28,698
-Oh, yes.

226
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,131
-The Shikon Jewel?

227
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,064
If I can just pierce it.

228
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,835
If I can just pierce it.

229
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,768
(THINKING) If I can
pierce the Shikon Jewel,

230
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:53,701
Naraku will be destroyed.

231
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:55,368
Ah!

232
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:55,868
-Kagome!

233
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,635
-It's futile.

234
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,068
Attack me all you like.

235
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,501
But you are still inside
my body, you fool.

236
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,368
I'll only keep regenerating.

237
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,768
-Fine by me.

238
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:13,501
I'll keep slicing
you up all day.

239
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:16,868
Naraku, I'm going to sever
you from those tentacles,

240
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,068
and every other attachment
you ever had to this world,

241
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,101
and that includes any ties
you still have to the Jewel.

242
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,401
Prepare yourself.

243
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,301
Meido Zangetsuha!

244
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,068
-Damn you, InuYasha!

245
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:39,735
-Ah!

246
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:49,001
-(THINKING) No.

247
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:52,968
If Sango's exposed to any more
miasma, she won't survive.

248
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,368
SANGO'S VOICE: Promise me
that we'll die together.

249
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:01,368
-You can't die.

250
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,601
I won't let you!

251
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,668
You are going to
survive this, Sango!

252
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,201
-What now?

253
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:13,835
Ah!

254
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,001
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

255
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,135
It's miasma.

256
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,335
I never should have come
here in the first place.

257
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,435
I'm so alone!

258
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,568
-(THINKING) Utter nonsense.

259
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,501
The Shikon Jewel didn't
grant my real wish.

260
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,635
InuYasha thinks he
and I are the same.

261
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,068
How dare you?

262
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,135
-Lord Sesshomaru,
there's so much miasma.

263
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:43,201
-(THINKING) It seems
you've reached the point

264
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,101
of desperation, Naraku.

265
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:49,268
In that case, I shall
perform your last rites.

266
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:49,768
Bakusaiga!

267
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:58,135
-Amazing!

268
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,601
-A path has opened.

269
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,601
-Only Bakusaiga could do this.

270
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,501
The damage will
continue to spread.

271
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,901
Any piece of flesh it
touches will be destroyed,

272
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,068
and will in turn
destroy all that it

273
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,735
comes into contact with.

274
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:23,668
Well, then.

275
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:24,835
It would seem the
time has finally

276
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:27,135
come for me to fulfill my role.

277
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:34,968
-What is it this time?

278
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:43,001
[screaming] Lord Sesshomaru!

279
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,901
-Master Jaken, you came?

280
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,968
-What have you been
doing all this time?

281
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:51,701
-Many things.

282
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,168
-Are you OK, Kagome?

283
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,401
-Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:04,101
Huh?

285
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,135
-Sesshomaru must
be getting closer.

286
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,235
-Then this sound--

287
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,435
-That must be Bakusaiga.

288
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:15,201
Naraku, your body can
no longer regenerate.

289
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,901
-It's just as I
told you, InuYasha.

290
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,201
You may destroy me,
but the Shikon Jewel

291
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,068
will never disappear
from this world.

292
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,868
-[coughing] It's a dead end.

293
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,135
Oh.

294
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,401
Should I use the wind tunnel?

295
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:38,101
Even if it tears open,
and I'm sucked into it,

296
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,935
I have to at least try
to save Sango's life.

297
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,468
I will not let her die here.

298
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:48,968
It's getting quieter.

299
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,801
Whoa!

300
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:58,235
-[panting]

301
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,235
-Oh no!

302
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,701
Naraku's breaking up.

303
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,835
Aw, man, it's getting closer.

304
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:06,235
I have to keep going, or
I'll get caught in that mess.

305
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,435
Huh?

306
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:07,935
Whoa!

307
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,535
Watch it Kirara.

308
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:14,035
Whoa!

309
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:21,168
[screaming]

310
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,168
-Incredible.

311
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,501
-That one swing sure
did a lot of damage.

312
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:28,835
-Naturally.

313
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:31,935
Lord Sesshomaru's Bakusaiga
is in a class unto itself.

314
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,535
-If you insist on struggling,
Naraku, Bakusaiga!

315
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,368
-Give it up, Naraku!

316
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:43,301
It's all over.

317
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:45,135
So it would seem.

318
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:48,635
However, InuYasha, I'm
afraid that there's still

319
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,735
one thing that not even you
Tessaiga or Sesshomaru's

320
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,701
Bakusaiga can cut.

321
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:54,735
-What?

322
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,768
Why don't you just
admit that you lost?

323
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:59,068
-[chuckling]

324
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,768
-Your soul, is that what
you're talking about?

325
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,568
I'm pretty sure
that's why I'm here.

326
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,501
I'm here to purify
your soul, Naraku!

327
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,735
-Hah. (THINKING) Give it
your best shot, Kagome.

328
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:14,968
This will end with a
battle between souls.

329
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:15,568
-It's Byakuya.

330
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:18,701
-Huh?

331
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,135
-[chuckling]

332
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:26,635
-Bastard!

333
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,601
-I am but an
incarnation of Naraku

334
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:33,235
that will die when he does.

335
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:36,001
I have no regrets.

336
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:37,435
I have fulfilled my role.

337
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:42,335
-Kagome!

338
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,601
-Are you OK?

339
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:44,635
-I think.

340
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,868
(THINKING) Did he cut me or not?

341
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:50,735
-(THINKING) The technique he
just used was Meido Zangetsuha.

342
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:51,801
But why?

343
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:53,635
What was he trying to do?

344
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:56,535
-[chuckling]

345
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:01,368
-[panting]

346
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,901
-Thank you so much, Shippo.

347
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,168
You're a true lifesaver.

348
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,835
-I a-am.

349
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,468
But are you sure
you want to give us

350
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,101
the rest of your antidote?

351
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,168
-Of course.

352
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,568
Don't worry about me.

353
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,801
Just hurry up and take it.

354
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,635
-Well, I very much
appreciate it.

355
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:23,635
Sango.

356
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:24,668
You're awake.

357
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:26,668
-I am, Miroku.

358
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:30,368
-Please try not to move
around, not until the antidote

359
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,668
I gave you starts
to take effect.

360
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,601
-It's a good thing that
I brought the antidote

361
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,468
that Genenge gave me, huh?

362
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,468
-Miroku, the antidote
won't be enough for you.

363
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,368
-There's hope.

364
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:42,535
Haven't you noticed?

365
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,368
You can barely hear anymore.

366
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:46,035
-You think?

367
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,368
-Yes, presumably
InuYasha and the others

368
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,768
have fatally wounded Naraku.

369
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,635
And the power of the
curse of the wind tunnel

370
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,335
has been weakened.

371
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,701
-In that case, we must
hurry, and join them.

372
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:56,901
-Indeed.

373
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,501
We shall settle this
Naraku once and for all.

374
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,801
-(THINKING) Naraku
is still alive.

375
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,868
What's taking you
so long, InuYasha?

376
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:19,968
-Kagome, get on!

377
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:24,668
There's nowhere left to stand.

378
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:28,268
It's time to end this.

379
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,201
Meido Zangetsuha!

380
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:36,468
Kagome, shoot!

381
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,935
-Whoa!

382
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,401
-Bastard's still
trying to resist.

383
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:41,901
-InuYasha, look out!

384
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:45,835
-Huh?

385
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:46,335
-Huh?

386
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,735
Sango, Miroku!

387
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:54,701
-Kagome!

388
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:56,035
-Shippo?

389
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,468
-What are you doing here?

390
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,768
-A thanks would be nice.

391
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:02,001
I came to help you guys.

392
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:02,935
-Wind tunnel!

393
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,535
-Miroku!

394
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:08,401
-It's OK.

395
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,601
I'm fine now.

396
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:14,435
The curse of the wind
tunnel is already fading.

397
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:14,935
-Sesshomaru?

398
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:19,401
-Sister.

399
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:20,401
-Sango!

400
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,401
-Kohaku, Rin!

401
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,768
-(THINKING) I'm so
glad sister is safe.

402
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:30,035
-Bakusaiga's destruction
is spreading!

403
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:34,335
I knew Lord Sesshomaru would
be the one to defeat Naraku.

404
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,668
-(THINKING) So you're all here.

405
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:43,435
You and your worthless
group of so-called friends.

406
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:43,935
-Yeah.

407
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:54,435
All of us, everyone survived.

408
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:13,112
[music playing]

409
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,004
The well has been sealed.

410
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:50,237
Kagome, there is
nowhere for you to go.

411
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,171
KAGOME: That is the
wish of the Shikon Jewel

412
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:54,104
that Naraku was forced to make.

413
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,604
I was drawn into the Meido.

414
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:56,804
But-- huh?

415
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,771
I'm in high school already?

416
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,604
Oh, grandpa, this is bad!

417
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:03,071
GRANDPA HIGURASHI: The
well has disappeared.

418
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:05,737
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act--

419
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:10,971
Thoughts Fall Short" Please,
Tessaiga, take me to Kagome!
