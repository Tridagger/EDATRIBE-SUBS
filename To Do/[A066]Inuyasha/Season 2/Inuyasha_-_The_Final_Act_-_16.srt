00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:46,347
[children playing]

3
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:55,381
(SINGING) Ka- go-
me, Ka- go- me,

4
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:59,681
you are no more than
a bird in a cage.

5
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,881
(CHILDREN SINGING) Crane and
a turtle gonna slip and fall.

6
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,147
Who's behind you now?

7
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,147
Are they big or small?

8
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,914
-It's Mitsko!

9
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:13,214
[gasp]

10
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:18,414
-My name is Naraku, I have come
for your life, Lady Hitomiko.

11
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,347
Do not be afraid.

12
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,881
My, my, very impressive, indeed.

13
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,714
Your barrier withstood
my miasma with ease.

14
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,447
If this is any
indication, it would

15
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,514
be both dangerous
and unwise for me

16
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,647
to ignore your spiritual power.

17
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,547
-Hitomiko, run home!

18
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,781
-Master, help me!

19
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,581
-What you see here is a demon!

20
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:49,014
I summon the divine
to drive you from us!

21
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:53,347
-(CHUCKLING) Is that the
extent of your spiritual power?

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:53,847
-Augh!

23
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,481
[gasping]

24
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,014
-Master, no!

25
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:00,847
Are you OK?

26
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,147
[evil laughter]

27
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,547
-You hurt him!

28
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:07,514
Now demon-- be gone!

29
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:08,747
-Ugh!

30
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,714
Ahh!

31
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:13,747
-Mm, it escaped, huh?

32
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,547
-Master, be strong!

33
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,747
-Hitomiko, though you are
young, your spiritual powers

34
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,014
rival that of Lady Kikyo, who
passed away many years ago.

35
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:27,847
Your gift makes you a threat
to evil spirits and demons,

36
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,314
and they will seek
to destroy you.

37
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:33,481
Promise me that you will
not neglect your training.

38
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,447
-Master, please.

39
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:40,981
-Though you did not choose
this fight, it is yours.

40
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:45,914
[mournful cry]

41
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,147
-That was 15 years ago.

42
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,281
He was right.

43
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,147
Since then I have spent
my life fighting demons.

44
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:56,481
I did not choose this life, but
such is my fate as a priestess.

45
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,547
-Lady Hitomiko!

46
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:00,081
Lady Hitomiko!

47
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,347
It's terrible.

48
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:03,247
We found a traveler who's
collapsed by the entrance

49
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,847
to the village!

50
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,747
-If we try to carry
him into the village,

51
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,381
there's a good chance the
disease may end up spreading.

52
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:11,947
-Perhaps we should just
put him out of his misery.

53
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:15,281
-Let me see him.

54
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,247
Tell me, traveler.

55
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,647
What is it that ails you?

56
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,081
[loud roar]

57
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:20,581
-Aahh!

58
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,881
-Lady Hitomiko, what happened?

59
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:28,847
-Do not worry.

60
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,281
The village is safe.

61
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:31,614
I have slain the demon.

62
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,214
[gasp]

63
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,514
[evil laughter]

64
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,047
-I know that voice.

65
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,647
-Is she breathing?

66
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:52,947
-Hitomiko's Barrier

67
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,214
-I'm positive.

68
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:55,681
Those are Naraku's spider webs.

69
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:56,647
-Really?

70
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,114
I can't see a thing!

71
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,547
-Only Kagome is able
to see them, Shippo.

72
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,181
-Damn you, Naraku!

73
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:05,581
Those webs are what he used
to defile and kill Kikyo!

74
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,914
What's he plotting this time?

75
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,947
-This is where they
originate from?

76
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,281
-Yes, up there by the shrine.

77
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,481
-Uh, who are you people?

78
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,214
-Are you from the village?

79
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,814
I don't mean to pry, but
I feel I must ask you.

80
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:26,281
Has anything unusual happened
here in the past few days.

81
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,414
Something happened
here didn't it?

82
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,847
-Actually, something did
happen to Lady Hitomiko--

83
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:36,947
the priestess who used
to protect our village.

84
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:38,947
-I was too careless.

85
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,347
It seems a thread
from that demon's web

86
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,147
has fastened to my back.

87
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,947
-Lady Hitomiko!

88
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:47,681
-I don't have long to live now.

89
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,781
-That can't be!

90
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:50,447
-You mustn't lose hope.

91
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:54,247
It has been so
long, and I'm tired.

92
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,081
Besides, I was supposed
to have died 15 years ago.

93
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:03,314
If I die, I want you to
promise me you'll sever my head

94
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:06,847
and bury it separately
from my body.

95
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,481
VILLAGER: And with those
final instructions,

96
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:12,014
Lady Hitomiko passed away.

97
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:13,714
However, none of us
could bring ourselves

98
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,381
to do what she'd asked.

99
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,847
So we buried her whole.

100
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:20,147
And then something happened.

101
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,081
[gasps]

102
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,014
-What is this?

103
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,047
Do we have visitors?

104
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:24,881
[recoiling in fear]

105
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:25,981
-Lady Hitomiko!

106
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,681
-I take it this is the
priestess who died.

107
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:29,281
-She came back to life?

108
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,481
-No, she's dead--
no doubt about it.

109
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:33,281
There's no mistaking
the smell of a corpse.

110
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,481
-Spider webs!

111
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,381
-Hey!

112
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,814
Even I can see them this time.

113
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,114
-So I gather you must be Kagome.

114
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:42,947
-Huh?

115
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,047
Wait, how do you know my name?

116
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:48,747
-Listen, Kagome, you must
leave this place immediately.

117
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,247
Turn away and never look back.

118
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,447
Otherwise, I'll be
forced to kill you.

119
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,347
-Ha!

120
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,747
Is that supposed to scare us?

121
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:56,714
Yaaa!

122
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:58,114
-You are a fool!

123
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:02,547
You will never destroy me
by severing the spider webs!

124
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,881
-Was that her?

125
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,747
-It must be a demon that's
taken the form of Lady Hitomiko.

126
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:07,781
-Not quite.

127
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:09,947
A demon named Naraku
has taken control

128
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:11,747
of Lady Hitomiko's body.

129
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,914
-Isn't there anything
we can do to save her?

130
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:17,714
-At this point, all we can
do is recover her remains.

131
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:20,747
-Whatever the case, we must
do what we can to help her.

132
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,714
She would not have wanted this.

133
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,447
I presume she made
that dying wish

134
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,847
to avoid this very situation.

135
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,514
-I beg of you, if we could
at least honor her remains,

136
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:33,147
it would mean everything.

137
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:34,581
-I understand.

138
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,414
We'll do what we
can to help you.

139
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,714
-NARAKU: Hitomiko, how
things have changed.

140
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,747
Now that I hold the
Shikon Jewel, not even

141
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,614
you can overcome my power.

142
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,114
-Damn you, Naraku.

143
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,814
-Don't be unkind.

144
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,547
After all, you were
tired from battling

145
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,414
demons all those years.

146
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:05,414
You wished it would end, and
now I've granted your wish.

147
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,147
And now, as a token
of your gratitude,

148
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,414
there's something I
need you to do for me.

149
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:15,714
Yes, Hitomiko, there's one
final task you must perform.

150
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:19,681
You will steal Kagome's power,
and then you'll destroy her.

151
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:23,481
It should be easy for you.

152
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:24,747
-Oh no!

153
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:27,247
Lady Hitomiko's shrine is
covered with spider webs!

154
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:31,381
-Well, It looks like
an invitation to me.

155
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:32,114
-Aahh!

156
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:33,081
-The webs!

157
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:36,447
-Everyone stand back!

158
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:37,914
-Tessaiga is not working!

159
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,181
-[inaudible] did it!

160
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:50,847
-A barrier!

161
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,581
-Your weapons are
powerless against me.

162
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:58,147
A priestess's barrier can
only be broken by a priestess.

163
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,647
-What are those?

164
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:02,181
[bells ringing]

165
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:03,447
-Bells?

166
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,947
It looks like they're
holding the barrier together.

167
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:09,181
All I have to do is shoot one,
and the barrier will collapse.

168
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:13,481
-You got it!

169
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:17,281
-Hm, we are connected.

170
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:18,614
-Huh?

171
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,481
-Kagome!

172
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:23,247
-I'm being sucked in!

173
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,047
-Kagome!

174
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,247
-She vanished!

175
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:25,747
-Damn it!

176
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,914
Inuyasha, we can't do
anything about this barrier.

177
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,214
Naraku, that bastard!

178
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,147
He was after Kagome
from the very beginning?

179
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,547
-Lady Hitomiko!

180
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,614
-I don't understand.

181
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,947
What point is there in
stealing your feeble power?

182
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:52,014
I wonder what Naraku was
hoping to accomplish.

183
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,481
-Lady Hitomiko, I
came to your shrine

184
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,214
because I want to save you!

185
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,047
-Oh really?

186
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,381
You propose to save me, do you?

187
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:00,314
How absurd!

188
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,014
-Kagome, do you think it
was by chance that you

189
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,781
were given the name Kagome?

190
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:09,881
-Huh?

191
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:13,147
-That name you bear
holds a special power--

192
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:16,114
a power hidden within you
since the day you were born.

193
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,547
-I don't understand.

194
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,881
Why is she telling me this?

195
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:19,881
-Humph!

196
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:22,881
You are no more than
a bird in a cage.

197
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,781
You shall never leave-- never.

198
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:29,981
-I can't move!

199
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,214
Naraku!

200
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:35,214
Stop hiding up there
and show yourself!

201
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,147
You're a coward!

202
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:38,214
-She can still move?

203
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:47,581
Now I see it is not
you he is after.

204
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:52,314
I am supposed to steal the power
that resides within that bow.

205
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,481
-This bow?

206
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,247
The bow I received
on Mount Azusa.

207
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,914
-If I'm not mistaken,
that bow was originally

208
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:02,314
meant to be wielded by another.

209
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:05,547
A person who would have been
able to master the use of it.

210
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,847
[gasp]

211
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,947
-Kikyo!

212
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:11,747
-You merely aim and
release with it,

213
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:14,214
unable to harness
its spiritual power.

214
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:18,081
And yet, you believe
you can save me?

215
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:21,147
Leave the bow here,
and be on your way.

216
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,081
Do so, and your
life will be spared.

217
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:26,081
But take it with you,
and you shall die.

218
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:28,247
-NARAKU: You'll spare
her life, will you?

219
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,814
Then you leave me no choice!

220
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:31,247
-Show yourself, Naraku!

221
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,547
-Do not waste your arrows.

222
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:34,514
-NARAKU: Indeed.

223
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,381
If you must shoot, aim here.

224
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,447
-There's a spider in her chest!

225
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,514
-NARAKU: Shoot the
arrow through her chest.

226
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,581
Once you do, Hitomiko
will finally die,

227
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,881
and you will be saved.

228
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,381
-I won't do it!

229
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:50,347
I won't take orders
from you, Naraku!

230
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,814
-Then you leave me no
choice, but to kill you.

231
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,747
[gasps]

232
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,947
-NARAKU: Now then,
will you shoot

233
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,147
her to save your own life?

234
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,847
-It broke the spell!

235
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:20,814
-It's use!

236
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:27,747
[evil laughter]

237
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,447
-You cannot escape
Hitomiko's barrier!

238
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:31,714
-Naraku!

239
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,847
-NARAKU: The only way to
escape is to destroy Hitomiko!

240
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,514
Will you refuse to fight,
and allow her to kill you?

241
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,247
Or will you shoot the
spider nesting within her,

242
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,081
and win your freedom?

243
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,714
You can only choose one.

244
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,214
But before you do, I
should tell you this.

245
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:50,047
If you destroy Hitomiko
with your sacred arrow,

246
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,581
her soul can never be saved.

247
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:53,981
[gasp]

248
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:58,014
-NARAKU: The priestess will die
a demon, and so will her soul.

249
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,447
Which means it will be
cursed to join my spider

250
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,514
webs in the fires of
hell for all eternity.

251
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,914
You'd do well to
keep that in mind.

252
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,414
One more thing.

253
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:09,481
Now that I've told
you this, should you

254
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:12,014
choose to shoot
Hitomiko, your heart

255
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,381
will be corrupted for
all eternity, as well.

256
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,414
-Shut up!

257
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,281
I've heard enough of
your talk, Naraku!

258
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,514
-NARAKU: Either
outcome suits me fine.

259
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:22,214
You surrender and allow
Himotiko to kill you,

260
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:25,781
or you sacrifice Hitomiko to
save your own life, thereby

261
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:28,981
corrupting your heart.

262
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,447
A heart so vile that it is
capable of condemning Hitomiko

263
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,414
to hell for personal
gain, will surely

264
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,981
fall victim to my spider webs.

265
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:40,881
Corrupt Kagome, and steal her
spiritual power, Hitomiko.

266
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:43,781
And you, Kagome, know that
within Hitomiko's barrier,

267
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,481
you must kill or be killed.

268
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:56,747
-Those flames are made
with your blood, Kagome.

269
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,614
I'm afraid they'll only
intensify as you get closer.

270
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:03,947
If I use my bow
and fight, I won't

271
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,428
be able to save Lady Hitomiku!

272
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,394
What should I do?

273
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:17,897
-Yaaa!

274
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:18,831
Ugh!

275
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:19,997
Damn it!

276
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:23,032
-Even the barrier-breaking
tessaiga can't break it?

277
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,266
-Kagome!

278
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:31,732
-I'm sure Lady Hitomiko was
trying to tell me something.

279
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,865
-You merely aim and
release with it--

280
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,799
unable to harness
its spiritual power.

281
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,132
-So if I learn how to
use the bow properly,

282
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:42,465
I can save Lady Hitomiko?

283
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,832
I already know that Naraku
wants me to shoot her.

284
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,099
But I would never
be able to do that.

285
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:50,265
Besides, even if it got me out
of this situation, then what?

286
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,365
My heart would be so
corrupt that I'd never

287
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,232
be able to escape
Naraku's spider webs.

288
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:12,665
What is this?

289
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:14,799
An illusion?

290
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,999
-This is no illusion.

291
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,232
You are in hell!

292
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,632
You will answer me!

293
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,199
Why were you given
the name Kagome?

294
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:24,765
If you cannot understand
that, you are destined to be

295
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,599
incinerated by
the fires of hell!

296
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,132
You must remember!

297
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:28,632
-Stop!

298
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,099
This is the hand of the demon!

299
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:39,265
-Can you feel the pain?

300
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,499
Are you burning up?

301
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:44,965
Though it may feel that way,
this fire will never kill you.

302
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,899
But you will suffer this
pain for all eternity.

303
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:48,865
-It's so hot!

304
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,132
Please help me!

305
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,432
-Cry all you want.

306
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,899
But no one can save
you now, foolish girl!

307
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,999
You dare to talk of
saving me, but you

308
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,599
have no power to speak of.

309
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,299
You can't even save yourself!

310
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:03,499
-Maybe shooting that
spider is my only choice.

311
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:06,065
But when she was choking me
just now, with this hand,

312
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,465
I sensed a strong
emotion from her.

313
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,732
But what was it?

314
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,565
Was it fear?

315
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,065
No.

316
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,632
No, worse!

317
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:16,565
It was a deep sorrow.

318
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,332
I can't allow myself to
leave this person here.

319
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:21,732
-Why were you given
the name Kagome?

320
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:24,532
-Why was I given
the name Kagome?

321
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:25,432
-There, there.

322
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,232
That's a good girl.

323
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,132
You're my precious
little Kagome.

324
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,432
Ka- go- me.

325
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:32,532
Hello there, Kagome.

326
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,999
-There, there.

327
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,499
That's right.

328
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,632
Mama, um, how come
I was named Kagome?

329
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,065
-Huh?

330
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,465
Why do you ask, sweetheart?

331
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:47,099
Well, you see, everyone
makes fun of me.

332
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,832
They sing, Ka- go-
me, Ka- go- me.

333
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,565
-(SIGHING) I see.

334
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:56,232
I'm sorry, but
that's what I saw.

335
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,965
-What did you see?

336
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,465
-Well, it might sound silly,
but when you were born,

337
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,165
I saw something like this
shining on your chest.

338
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,565
And the star-like shape
is known as a kagome.

339
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,065
-Oh.

340
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,999
What are you doing?

341
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:17,032
Let go of me!

342
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:20,899
The Shikon Jewel had been hidden
within my body from birth.

343
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:24,432
When I was born, my mom must've
been able to see its light.

344
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:27,665
Which means, my name,
Kagome, actually

345
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,332
came from the Shikon Jewel.

346
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,699
But so what?

347
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:35,432
It still doesn't mean I was
born with any special powers.

348
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,499
I don't understand!

349
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,632
I don't know what
you're talking about!

350
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,032
-In that case, down
into hell you go!

351
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,865
-(CHILD'S TAUNTING
VOICE) Kagome!

352
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,299
Let's play Kago- me, Kagome!

353
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:52,365
-I always hated
that game so much!

354
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,099
The other kids would
make a circle--

355
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:59,065
-(CHILDREN SINGING)
Ka- gome, Ka- go- me,

356
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,399
you are no more than a bird--

357
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,165
-LADY HITOMIKO: You
merely aim and release

358
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,232
with it-- unable to harness
it's spiritual power.

359
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,832
--who's behind you now?

360
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,865
Are they big or small?

361
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,465
LADY HITOMIKO:
You must remember!

362
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:12,132
Why?

363
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,099
Why are you Kagome?

364
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,832
-Who's behind you now?

365
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,265
Are they big or small?

366
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,099
-It's Heedae!

367
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:22,932
-Huh?

368
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,099
But how did you know it was me?

369
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:25,299
-I don't know how.

370
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,465
I just knew.

371
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,065
I can't help it, all right?

372
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,665
I couldn't explain
it, but I knew.

373
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:34,099
Every time we played, I knew
exactly who was behind me.

374
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:35,065
[gasp]

375
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,132
-Is that it?

376
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,732
Could that be the
power I was born with?

377
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,199
Who's behind me?

378
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:47,432
Naraku!

379
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,565
I want to save Lady Hitomiko.

380
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,799
If I can somehow combine the
spiritual power of this bow

381
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,965
with my power, I can do it!

382
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:01,365
The shape of that
light-- I see it!

383
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,299
This is what Lady
Hitomiko was trying

384
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,965
to tell me when she
asked about my name!

385
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,365
Please bow of Mount
Azusa I'm begging

386
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:12,932
you to lend me your strength.

387
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,365
Pierce the light of that
star, and set her free!

388
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,232
Take this!

389
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:29,132
[evil laughter]

390
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,065
-The arrow disappeared?

391
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:35,032
[gasp]

392
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,032
-Augh!

393
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,499
[groan]

394
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,465
-I did it!

395
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,665
Amazing!

396
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,965
So this is the true
spiritual power of the bow!

397
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:55,299
[gasps]

398
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,032
-What's this?

399
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,932
-The spider webs
are disappearing,

400
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,365
-And the barrier has vanished.

401
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,432
-It must've been Kagome!

402
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:05,932
-Let's go!

403
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,532
[moaning]

404
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:18,499
-Huh?

405
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,832
-It is all over.

406
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,132
You are a true mystery.

407
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,199
[gasp]

408
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:28,165
-In the end, you
were able to combine

409
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:30,765
your own power and the
spiritual power of the bow

410
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,865
to shatter the evil
presence that bound me.

411
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,632
You saved me, Kagome--
that much I understand.

412
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,232
However, it was
only in the moment

413
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:42,099
you released the arrow that
your power became visible.

414
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,299
Something is sealing
your true power--

415
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,765
what it is, I do not know.

416
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,265
-Huh?

417
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,132
-Lady Hitomiko!

418
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:58,165
-Kagome, you are such a
mysterious person-- the source

419
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,999
of your power, and
even your name.

420
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,065
-Kagome!

421
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,465
-Kagome, are you OK?

422
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:08,965
-Inuyasha!

423
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,265
-She is already passed on.

424
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,732
-But it seems that
she's finally at peace.

425
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,799
[chattering]

426
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:28,765
-VILLAGER: At last, Lady
Hitomiko can rest in peace.

427
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,665
-Please erect a memorial to
honor her life in service

428
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,065
to this village.

429
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:38,899
[sound of birds]

430
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,199
-What's the matter, Kagome?

431
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,565
You haven't said a
word since we left.

432
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,499
-It's nothing.

433
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:44,732
I'm fine.

434
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,399
LADY HITOMIKO: It was
only in the moment

435
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:50,732
you released the arrow, that
your power became visible.

436
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:53,599
-If what Lady Hitomiko
said was true,

437
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:57,832
my power is being sealed
by something-- or someone.

438
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,632
Kikyo, maybe?

439
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:00,365
Or perhaps--

440
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:12,040
[theme music]

441
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,101
-You are weak!

442
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,501
The evil will of the demon
sealed within the Shikon Jewel

443
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:51,334
called Magatsuhi borrows the
bodies of Naraku's demons

444
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,267
to appear in this
world, and attacks

445
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,767
the Shubaru, and his companions.

446
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,767
You must escape, Master Shubaru!

447
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,234
If you were to lose
your right arm,

448
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,867
you would no longer
be able to fight!

449
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,267
Next time on Iriasha--
The Final Act.

450
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,367
Magatsuhi's Evil Will.

451
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,867
MAGATSUHI: You must
die by my hand!

452
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,334
My very pride is at stake.
