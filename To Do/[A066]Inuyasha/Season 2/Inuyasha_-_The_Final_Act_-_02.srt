00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:10,800
[theme music]

2
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:47,124
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
I'm going to make sure

3
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,990
that we get your heart
back from Naraku.

4
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:54,257
Just promise me you won't
die before it happens!

5
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,790
-(VOICEOVER) I'll
run for my life.

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,490
I'll go as far as I have to.

7
00:01:58,524 --> 00:01:59,957
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Kagura's Wind.

8
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,690
SANGO: This one here
is father's grave.

9
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:20,857
The others are
buried beside him.

10
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,190
So you see, they're
resting in peace, Kohaku.

11
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:28,790
-But I can't forgive myself.

12
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:36,057
-(VOICEOVER) I guess he
wasn't ready to see this yet.

13
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,624
MIROKU: Myoga, is
this the location

14
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,557
of the anomaly you spoke of?

15
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,057
MYOGA: Mm-hm.

16
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,424
-This is Midoriko's cave.

17
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:46,524
Midoriko was a priestess who
lived hundreds of years ago.

18
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,224
She was a demon slayer.

19
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,790
Eventually, she found a
way to destroy the demons,

20
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,824
but it cost her her life.

21
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:55,157
She absorbed the demons'
souls into herself,

22
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,890
forcing out her own.

23
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:00,157
The crystallization of her soul
is known as the Shikon jewel.

24
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:06,890
-That hole in her chest-- is
it supposed to be doing that?

25
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:07,524
-You're right.

26
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,357
It's shining.

27
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,624
-There's something inside it.

28
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,090
It looks like a chrysalis.

29
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,624
-I'll take a closer look.

30
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:16,690
-Huh?

31
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:18,524
-There's some kind
of barrier around it.

32
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:19,290
-Oh, dear!

33
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,457
This must be an ill omen.

34
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,890
There can be no
other explanation.

35
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,224
-Yeah.

36
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,690
We should probably keep an
eye on this place for a while.

37
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,990
(VOICEOVER) That scent.

38
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,724
Could it be?

39
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,224
BOY: Are you serious
about this, Koga?

40
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:35,424
BOY: The most powerful weapon
known to the wolf demon

41
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,324
tribe, the Goraishi,
is enshrined

42
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,124
in the deepest part
of this burial ground.

43
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,357
-That's perfect.

44
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,924
Once I can get my
hands on Gorai-thing,

45
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,090
I should have no problem
beating the life out

46
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,990
of Naraku and Moryomaru.

47
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,057
-It's as if he's not
listening to a word we say.

48
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,557
-Careful not to incite
the wrath of the gods.

49
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,224
-Great.

50
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,757
Let's get going.

51
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,557
-Aw.

52
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,924
-I'd never leave you behind.

53
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:59,724
-So, Inuyasha stayed behind?

54
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:00,857
-Yeah.

55
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,624
-It could just be me, but
it seemed like he really

56
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,090
didn't want anyone else around.

57
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:04,790
-What?

58
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:05,957
-It's not just you.

59
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,890
I valiantly offered
my unwavering support

60
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:12,090
to stay with Inuyasha, and he
all but chased me away, too.

61
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,157
-You know, come to think
of it, that barrier

62
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,790
didn't strike me as evil.

63
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,790
In truth, it felt pure to me.

64
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,924
-Huh?

65
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,090
(VOICEOVER) Does that mean--

66
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:26,890
-Huh?

67
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:27,390
Huh?

68
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:36,257
A soul collector!

69
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,424
So it was Kikyo, after all.

70
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:57,357
-(VOICEOVER) Naraku's
miasma is persistent.

71
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,290
Even Kagome's purification
was not enough.

72
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:02,657
-Kikyo!

73
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,857
Inuyasha.

74
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,557
I take it you followed
the soul collector?

75
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,057
-Kikyo, what do you intend
to do with Midoriko's soul?

76
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,690
-This is what Naraku inflicted
upon me at Mount Hakurei.

77
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,124
-But weren't you healed?

78
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,990
-For a short time, yes.

79
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,590
But as you can see, the
wound has now reopened.

80
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:25,090
This is the reason why I
have taken Midoriko's soul.

81
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,024
Using it is the
only option I have.

82
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,724
Otherwise, I'll be
consumed by the miasma.

83
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:35,557
This body will return to the
earth before I defeat Naraku.

84
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,957
Even though Midoriko's
soul is dead,

85
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,990
I know that it will
help me stay alive long

86
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,790
enough to complete my task.

87
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:46,357
Midoriko was a priestess
who died slaying demons.

88
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,690
In many ways, you could say
that we share the same soul.

89
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:59,224
I am sure she'd understand
my reasons for doing this.

90
00:05:59,257 --> 00:05:59,724
-Kikyo.

91
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,657
Kikyo!

92
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,224
(VOICEOVER) Her
wound is healing.

93
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,357
-What?

94
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,590
Huh?

95
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:27,257
(VOICEOVER) Kohaku's Shikon
jewel shard is-- Kohaku!

96
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,824
-This is going to
hurt for a while.

97
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,557
-Kohaku!

98
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,424
Wait!

99
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:34,324
-Those are Kikyo's
soul collectors!

100
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:35,324
-That's right.

101
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,924
And thy appear to
be guiding Kohaku.

102
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,290
A barrier?

103
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,224
Do you think this
is Kikyo's to doing?

104
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,624
-No.

105
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,690
It's not. (VOICEOVER) I think
I know who put this barrier up.

106
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,024
-Kohaku, come back!

107
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,157
-Don't worry, sister!

108
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,890
(VOICEOVER) The shard
is telling me to go.

109
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:51,890
It's telling me defeat Naraku.

110
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,424
I don't care what it takes.

111
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:54,924
I'll do anything
to accomplish that!

112
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,157
-What is it, Koga?

113
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,924
-It's nothing.

114
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:03,990
-(VOICEOVER) What is this?

115
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,557
My legs-- the
Shikon jewel shards

116
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,290
feel so heavy all of a sudden.

117
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,190
-Are you gonna be OK?

118
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,924
That wound isn't gonna
reopen again, is it?

119
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:15,424
-I cannot be sure.

120
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:19,224
That is why I must make haste.

121
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:22,490
-Can't you just wait
until I defeat Naraku?

122
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,090
-You cannot defeat
Naraku with a sword.

123
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:25,824
-Huh?

124
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,757
-Please, listen to me.

125
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,957
Defeating Naraku
requires the obliteration

126
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,090
of his entire being,
including his soul.

127
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:35,524
It doesn't make a
difference how many times

128
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,590
you destroy his body.

129
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,424
Naraku was created
when demons were

130
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:42,990
merged into the vile soul
of the thief Onigumo.

131
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,890
From the beginning,
he's had no true body,

132
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,590
so the Shikon jewel is
perhaps one and only power

133
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:52,857
great enough to
eradicate Naraku's soul.

134
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,357
The Shikon jewel must
be restored at once.

135
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,590
There is no other way.

136
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,490
There will only be one chance.

137
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:02,390
When Naraku obtains the
restored Shikon jewel,

138
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,957
the jewel will be defiled
within Naraku's hands

139
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,424
as it fuses with him.

140
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:10,524
In that instant, we must purify
Naraku, along with the jewel.

141
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,324
And only I am capable of this.

142
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:13,824
-Wait!

143
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:14,324
Kikyo!

144
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,757
-Inuyasha, now is not
the time for hesitation.

145
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,257
And it is too late
now to turn back.

146
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,824
(VOICEOVER) Restoring
the Shikon jewel

147
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:28,157
would mean taking
Kohaku's shard.

148
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,890
And to do that, you'd
have to take his life.

149
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,890
Kikyo, you're not
the kind of person

150
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,790
who's capable of that-- are you?

151
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,024
Huh?

152
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,590
-I understand now.

153
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,057
I know what I have to do.

154
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,390
So I'm going.

155
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,857
-(VOICEOVER) I don't get it.

156
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,090
Why didn't I notice Kohaku's
scent when he was so close?

157
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,890
-Please explain to the others.

158
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:52,557
-Huh?

159
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,057
Kohaku!

160
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,890
-I'm not going there to die.

161
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,124
I'm going there
to defeat Naraku.

162
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:04,524
Please, take care of my sister.

163
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:05,024
-Kohaku.

164
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,090
-Who dares wake me
from my slumber?

165
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,490
-Meioju, I am here
because your shell

166
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,357
is said to be the
ultimate armor.

167
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,990
You will give it to me.

168
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,357
-Devour him, Moryomaru.

169
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:31,224
Very good, Meioju.

170
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,524
Now you've become
my ultimate armor.

171
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:46,124
-It feels like we're grave
robbers, or something.

172
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:46,990
-Koga!

173
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:47,657
Over there!

174
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,790
-That's it!

175
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:52,157
KOGA: The Goraishi of
the wolf demon tribe.

176
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,024
-Whoa!

177
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:57,390
-None shall pass
beyond this point.

178
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,124
-It talked!

179
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:02,490
-Let's get this over with. 'Kay?

180
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,524
-Look, we aren't
thieves, or anything.

181
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,590
-We've just come to
borrow the Goraishi.

182
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:07,590
-Never!

183
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,290
It belongs to the
wolf demon tribe,

184
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,390
and contains centuries
of our brethrens' souls.

185
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,490
If you desire it--

186
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:17,157
-I have to defeat you.

187
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,024
Right?

188
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:20,990
-Prepare to be incinerated!

189
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:21,990
-Not again!

190
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:25,924
[shouting]

191
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:26,957
-He got him!

192
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,390
-That's Koga for you.

193
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,657
-Cursed rat!

194
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,257
You're using Shikon
jewel shards?

195
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,390
-So what if I am?

196
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,390
What did you think, I
was gonna take 'em out?

197
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:41,124
They're part of me.

198
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:42,557
-Part of your body?

199
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,590
Those shards you
possess are controlled

200
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,324
by the will of that which is
no longer part of this world.

201
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,490
And the Goraishi you
desire is controlled

202
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,290
by souls which have rested
here since ancient times.

203
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:57,790
Souls that are also no
longer part of this world.

204
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,157
Like those jewel
shards, the Goraishi

205
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,990
is not for you to weild.

206
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:04,590
-Enough of this nonsense!

207
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,590
-Now burn!

208
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,390
-Too slow!

209
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:11,890
-You cannot win.

210
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:13,457
-We'll see about that!

211
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,657
-Whoa!

212
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,424
-All right.

213
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:23,390
I've almost got him.

214
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,324
-You shall not pass!

215
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,557
-Ah!

216
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,024
Get back!

217
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:39,990
[nervous shouts]

218
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,424
-Whoa!

219
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,057
-Gotcha.

220
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,057
[screaming]

221
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,524
-Huh?

222
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:50,990
[screaming]

223
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:51,990
-I'm comin'!

224
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,524
I almost lost you two.

225
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,324
-Sorry about that.

226
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,790
-Pathetic fools.

227
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,190
Behold!

228
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,090
-Koga, the Goraishi!

229
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:13,290
It's gone!

230
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,157
-You should have
abandoned your friends

231
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,324
and obtained the Goraishi
when you had the chance.

232
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:19,990
-If you think I
regret my choice,

233
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,724
then you don't know me at all.

234
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:22,657
-What?

235
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,857
-Listen up!

236
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,290
The only reason I came
for your precious Goraishi

237
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:29,157
is because I plan to use
it to avenge my tribe.

238
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,590
But if it means
sacrificing my comrades,

239
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:33,557
then I don't need the Goraishi.

240
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,424
Got it, moron?

241
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,557
-Koga.

242
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,490
I'd follow you anywhere.

243
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,690
-Enough of your preaching!

244
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,824
You shall pay for desecrating
this burial ground

245
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:46,424
and disturbing the ancient ones!

246
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:47,624
-I'll show you disturbing!

247
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,690
-Whoa!

248
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:55,424
-The Goraishi!

249
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:56,857
-When did that happen?

250
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,957
-Take this!

251
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,590
[scream]

252
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,190
-(VOICEOVER) How did I--

253
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,957
-The Goraishi will
be your claws.

254
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,157
From this day forth,
you shall have

255
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,790
the protection of our souls.

256
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:30,924
-(VOICEOVER) It disappeared?

257
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:33,757
But no-- it merged with my body.

258
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,390
It's part of me now.

259
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:37,024
-What was all that about?

260
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,890
-Does this mean our ancestors
will watch over him?

261
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:42,657
GORAISHI SPIRIT: However, know
that we can only protect you

262
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,724
once from the power which
controls the Shikon jewel

263
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,324
shards in your legs.

264
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,357
The power which is not
a part of this world.

265
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,790
-(VOICEOVER) I'll be
sure to remember that.

266
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:59,157
[gasp]

267
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,090
-Naraku.

268
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:04,557
-Kagua, apparently
Hakudoshi has died.

269
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:09,924
-(VOICEOVER) You know it
couldn't have happened if you

270
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,190
didn't want it to.

271
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:15,024
-He was nothing but a
fool, that Hakudoshi.

272
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:18,790
It seems that he thought
he could destroy me.

273
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,790
Kagura, I shall grant
you your freedom.

274
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:23,290
-Huh?

275
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:31,919
So, you'll grant me my freedom?

276
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:34,313
-You wish to be
liberated from me.

277
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:35,413
Do you not?

278
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:37,946
Isn't that why you
disobeyed my orders,

279
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,513
allowed Goryomaru to escape, and
allied yourself with Hakudoshi?

280
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:48,146
-If you were aware of it,
then why-- m-- my heart!

281
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,380
-That's right.

282
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:51,713
If I were to return
this to your body,

283
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,613
you would no longer be
under anyone's control.

284
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,980
Not even mine.

285
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,480
You'd be free at last.

286
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,146
-(VOICEOVER) It's back.

287
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,513
[gasp]

288
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,180
-Not to worry.

289
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:10,113
I was careful to avoid
hitting your precious heart.

290
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,146
-Naraku-- you bastard!

291
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,646
[laughter]

292
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,446
-Now you may go.

293
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,646
Wherever you wish.

294
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,313
-Damn.

295
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,346
That-- that bastard.

296
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,146
He's cursed my body with miasma.

297
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,546
NARAKU: Enjoy what little
time you have left to live.

298
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,380
Of course, it will be filled
with only pain and despair.

299
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,046
You didn't honestly believe
you deserved a better

300
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,346
fate than this, did you, Kagura?

301
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,013
You longed for freedom.

302
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:40,646
Well, now you have it.

303
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,946
-Lord Sesshomaru, the
demonic aura from the crystal

304
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,146
is weakening.

305
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,346
That can only mean that
Naraku's heart is nearby.

306
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,313
-Oh. look.

307
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,746
There's a cave up ahead.

308
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,346
-Stay back.

309
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,746
-Hm.

310
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,746
You're Inuyasha's
brother, aren't you?

311
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,380
-I have never considered
that lowly half demon

312
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,113
to be my brother.

313
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:10,013
But the fact that you know
even that much tells me

314
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:11,580
that you are Naraku's heart.

315
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:12,746
Are you not?

316
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,580
-Hmph.

317
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:16,280
Sesshomaru, you'll regret that.

318
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,413
Wielding your sword
before greeting me?

319
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,780
-That I doubt.

320
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,146
But you will regret uttering
Inuyasha's name in my presence.

321
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,413
That much I promise you.

322
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,713
-Ah-- only need a day to
recover from these wounds.

323
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:38,013
[heartbeat]
(VOICEOVER) My heart.

324
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,413
I can feel it beating.

325
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,446
I can go wherever I want.

326
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,946
I'm-- free.

327
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:53,813
-That armor!

328
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,713
The Tokijin didn't
even scratch it.

329
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:02,846
-Keep swinging that
sword of yours.

330
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,680
In time, I will absorb all
of your demonic energy.

331
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,180
I suppose I can't let
you have all the fun.

332
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,646
-This is terrible.

333
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,380
He's getting stronger
with every one

334
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:30,646
of Lord Sesshomaru's attacks.

335
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,613
Aren't we supposed
to be helping him?

336
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:33,980
-You fool!

337
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,813
Can't you see this is all part
of Lord Sesshomaru's master

338
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,746
plan?

339
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,080
-So what's his plan?

340
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:39,446
-Idiot!

341
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,213
If I knew that, you think my
life would be this difficult?

342
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,613
-It won't work, Sesshomaru.

343
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:55,613
-Hm?

344
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,946
-I shall absorb
your demonic energy.

345
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,780
No sense prolonging
this any further.

346
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:16,480
-No-- why is my body failing me?

347
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:22,046
The wound has reopened.

348
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,946
And I don't have enough
energy left in me to heal it.

349
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,746
[shivering]

350
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,513
-This scent.

351
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:37,480
-Hm?

352
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:40,846
So that useless
woman died, did she?

353
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,313
First she betrayed
Naraku, and then me.

354
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,313
All because she
wanted her freedom.

355
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,846
And then when she finally
gets it, what does she do?

356
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
She dies.

357
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:51,946
And dies in vain, at that.

358
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,446
-Silence.

359
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,580
-But-- that's impossible.

360
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,180
My shell is impenetrable.

361
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:00,846
-See?

362
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,513
Just as I expected.

363
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,413
-Way to go!

364
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:07,080
You've almost got him!

365
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,813
-The demonic energy
that I absorbed!

366
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,613
-The demonic energy you
absorbed could never

367
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:14,946
be contained in that pitiful
vessel you call a body.

368
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,446
Take this.

369
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,180
Azure Dragonwave!

370
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,513
-Argh!

371
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,513
This isn't good.

372
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:22,980
The Shikon jewel shard--

373
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:27,280
-The Tokijin!

374
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,180
-It snapped?

375
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,180
-This isn't over.

376
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,613
I will be back for you.

377
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,913
-Hmph.

378
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:40,913
-Lord Sesshomaru!

379
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,480
-I'm so glad you're safe!

380
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:43,746
Hello?

381
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,913
Lord Sesshomaru?

382
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,346
-You're not going to
leave your sword, are you?

383
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,046
-I have no attachment
to a broken sword.

384
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,946
I will find a replacement.

385
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,880
-I don't understand.

386
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,680
Where is Lord Sesshomaru going?

387
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,046
-A flower?

388
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,180
INUYASHA: I'm sure of it.

389
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,680
That's the scent
of Kagura's blood.

390
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,880
-Perhaps Naraku found out
that she betrayed him.

391
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,313
-Let us hurry.

392
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,480
-(VOICEOVER) Why did't we
force her to stay with us?

393
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,880
We should've known better than
to let Kagura go off alone.

394
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,013
KAGURA: It's so quiet.

395
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,980
No one is in sight.

396
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,980
Is this how it ends?

397
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,446
All by myself?

398
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,213
Is this the freedom
that I longed for?

399
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,313
You-- you came.

400
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:42,480
-I followed this scent
of blood and miasma.

401
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:43,446
-Oh.

402
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,913
I see.

403
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,980
You thought I was Naraku.

404
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:52,280
Disappointed that it's not him?

405
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:53,246
-No.

406
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,313
I knew it was you.

407
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,813
-I see.

408
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,046
(VOICEOVER) So you came.

409
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,446
You came here to see me.

410
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:14,213
-(VOICEOVER) Even
Tenseiga cannot save her.

411
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,946
Are you leaving?

412
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,446
-Yes.

413
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,780
I've had enough.

414
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:29,046
(VOICEOVER) Now that I've
seen you one last time.

415
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,213
INUYASHA: Wait!

416
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,546
Sesshomaru.

417
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,480
-Inuyasha?

418
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,913
-Kagura.

419
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:47,746
Did she suffer?

420
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:51,513
-She was smiling.

421
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,246
KAGURA: I am the wind.

422
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,213
The free wind.

423
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,155
[theme music]

424
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,935
KAGOME: Shippo attempts the
Fox Demon Promotion Exam

425
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,768
at the demon mansion
known as the Fox Inn.

426
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,035
-That must be it.

427
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,502
Does that mean I'll
advance in rank

428
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,235
every time I beat up Inuyasha?

429
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,868
KAGOME: Meanwhile,
Tenseiga is making

430
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,568
life difficult for Sesshomaru.

431
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,235
What's gonna happen
now, Totosai?

432
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,268
INUYASHA: Next time on
Inuyasha, The Final Act,

433
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:06,135
Meido Zangetsuha.

434
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,368
SESSHOMARU: I now
wield the Tenseiga.

435
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,502
Ready for battle.
