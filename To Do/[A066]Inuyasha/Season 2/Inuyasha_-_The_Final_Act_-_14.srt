00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,833
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,881
-Judging by the damage, this
must've been quite the battle.

3
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:02,243
Now then, rock children.

4
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,509
What happened here?

5
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:07,809
I want you to tell me
everything you saw and heard.

6
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,910
-To the underworld with you!

7
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:12,710
How long can you keep this up?

8
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,277
-My life won't be
taken by scum like you.

9
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,710
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
In Pursuit of Naraku.

10
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:46,943
[sigh]

11
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:48,077
-Hey.

12
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,410
Uh, Master Jaken, where
did Lord Sesshumaru go?

13
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:51,310
He's been gone a while.

14
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,710
[sigh]

15
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,343
-It pains me to consider
how Lord Sesshomaru must

16
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:57,310
be feeling right now.

17
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,910
After painstakingly
training with Tenseiga,

18
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,110
he learns that it was
but a part of Tetsusaiga,

19
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:06,843
the sword bequeathed to
Inuyasha of all people.

20
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,210
I cannot be sure where
Lord Sesshomaru went.

21
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:12,110
Having said that, I've
got a pretty good idea.

22
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,343
-I've moved.

23
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,877
Well, that should do it.

24
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,043
What have you done to my home?

25
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,377
-Did you really think you
could escape, Totosai?

26
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,877
-No.

27
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,877
I figured you'd show up
here sooner or later.

28
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,743
-Hmph.

29
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,643
RIN (SINGING): Lord
Sesshomaru's late.

30
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,710
I wonder where he is.

31
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,443
-Will you shut up?

32
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,377
How many times do you
need to repeat that song?

33
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,910
-I'll sing one
about you instead.

34
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,743
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER):
What is this sensation?

35
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,077
-Hey, what's the matter, Kohaku?

36
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:54,777
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): My Shikon
jewel shard is being defiled.

37
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,377
An evil presence is nearby.

38
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:00,543
Both of you, run!

39
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,077
-Kohaku.

40
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,443
It's been too long.

41
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,577
-Naraku!

42
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,177
-Well, Totosai, you've
known about this

43
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,543
from the very
beginning, haven't you?

44
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,010
-Of course I did.

45
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,843
After all, I was the one
who separated Tenseiga

46
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,577
from Tetsusaiga and forged
it into a weapon all

47
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,977
those years ago, Sesshomaru.

48
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,010
So what are you
going to do about it?

49
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,210
Kill me?

50
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,343
Hold on!

51
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,843
Now, let me guess, you
met Shishinki, right?

52
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,777
SHISHINKI: Now, then, I
presume the old man was

53
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,310
unable to control Meido
Zangetsuha after stealing it

54
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,310
from me, its rightful owner.

55
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,710
That is why he cast it
away from Tetsusaiga.

56
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:42,277
And so, that unwanted technique
the one Tetsusaiga had no use

57
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,077
for, was given to
your Tenseiga instead.

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,677
TOTOSAI: Look here, I don't
know what kind of nonsense

59
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,077
that troublemaker
Shishinki told you,

60
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,977
but you were able to master
Meido Zangetsuha in the end,

61
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,977
were you not?

62
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,910
Your father was
correct when he judged

63
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,410
that you would be able to do so.

64
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:02,043
You have lived up to
his every expectation.

65
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,443
-Totosai, do you
honestly believe

66
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:07,677
I haven't realied what the
next step in all of this is?

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,177
-Next step, you say?

68
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,177
-I've never known you to
be this careless, Kohaku.

69
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,210
-What do you want?

70
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,677
Have you come for my shard?

71
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,443
-Of course.

72
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,910
Why else would I be here?

73
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,643
Yours is the last one.

74
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:23,610
With it, the Shikon
jewel will be complete.

75
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:26,410
Kikyo, who once purified
and protected your shard,

76
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,643
is no longer around to help you.

77
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:31,143
I'm afraid there's nowhere
for you to run now.

78
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:44,010
-Kohaku!

79
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,977
[groaning]

80
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,910
-Kohaku, hurry!

81
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:53,877
Now's your chance!

82
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,110
-Tetsusaiga has the
ability to steal techniques

83
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:07,243
from the weapons of its foes.

84
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:11,110
Tenseiga, on the other
hand, has no such power.

85
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:12,977
-I pity you, Sesshomaru!

86
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,377
What your father did was cruel!

87
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,643
It was cruel, you hear?

88
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,243
-Both of us know that
Father's true intention

89
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:24,810
from the beginning was for me
to perfect Meido Zangetsuha,

90
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,977
but only so that
Tenseiga could then

91
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,077
be absorbed back into Tetsusiga.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,777
That is the truth, isn't it?

93
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,277
-Ah-- wow, I'm impressed.

94
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,410
-Hm?

95
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:37,577
-You figured that out
all by yourself, huh?

96
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,843
Well, you are exactly right.

97
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,343
Are you disappointed?

98
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:42,543
-Huh.

99
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:45,043
I'd be disappointed if
Tetsusaiga could actually

100
00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:46,177
cut me down.

101
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,010
But that shall never happen!

102
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,877
-Whoa there!

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,377
-Huh?

104
00:06:54,143 --> 00:06:56,710
TOTOSAI: Say, Sesshomaru?

105
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,643
Why do you think your father
set up your swords this way

106
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,243
in the first place, huh?

107
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:05,110
Do you really believe
he favored Inuyasha,

108
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,343
and simply left with you
the short end of the stick,

109
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,643
so to speak?

110
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,043
Either way, your
thoughts are too

111
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,877
clouded right now
to see the truth.

112
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,010
As long as you remain
so narrowly focused

113
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:17,210
on the heirloom
Tetsusaiga, you will never

114
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,943
understand your
father's long term plan.

115
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:20,443
-Silence!

116
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:30,777
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): What
was Father's long term plan?

117
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,777
TOTOSAI: Sesshomaru,
abandon these attachments.

118
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,577
Abandon your attachment
to the sword,

119
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,210
as well as your hatred
toward Inuyasha.

120
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:42,477
Once you do, you may very
well surpass your father.

121
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,977
-Hm.

122
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:49,577
-Wel, I thought
that was it for us.

123
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,510
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER):
What was that light?

124
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,443
Where did it come frmo?

125
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,477
The shard was defiled by
Naraku's mere presence,

126
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,410
but as soon as he
touched it, I could

127
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,543
feel a pure light
flowing into it.

128
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,310
Like it was being purified.

129
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:07,543
Was it her?

130
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,877
Could it have been
Lady Kikyo's power

131
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,310
protecting my shard from Naraku?

132
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,043
NARAKU (VOICEOVER): Kikyo.

133
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,777
This was your doing, wasn't it?

134
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,110
You planted a single speck
of purity in my Shikon jewel.

135
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,177
One point of light.

136
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,310
Somehow that was enough
to purify Kohaku's shard.

137
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,877
-Well, it looks like
we managed to get away.

138
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,610
-Didn't I tell you there
was nowhere for you to run?

139
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,477
-He doesn't give up!

140
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,410
-Kohaku, do you have any idea
what Kikwho was planning?

141
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:45,743
Shall I tell you?

142
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,977
It's true that she purified
your Shikon jewel shard,

143
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,177
but she didn't do it
to save your life.

144
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,243
She did it because
she wanted to plunge

145
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:56,843
that one remaining pure
shard into my Shikon jewel,

146
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,743
and purify me along with it.

147
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,877
-Aun, please go faster!

148
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,243
-Yes.

149
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,743
Even in death, that Kikyo is
still a threat to my existence.

150
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,210
KOHAKU (VIOCEOVER):
In other words,

151
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:13,577
my shard can still be used
as a weapon to defeat Naraku.

152
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,143
-Now, now, Kahoku,
don't get your hopes up.

153
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:19,677
I have ways of
retrieving the Shikon

154
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,710
jewel short without
even touching it.

155
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:25,110
[screaming]

156
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:25,610
-Fly lower!

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,143
-What does Naraku intend to do?

158
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,910
-He's going to try to cut off
my head and take it with him.

159
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:35,643
-What?

160
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:36,977
-Exactly.

161
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,677
I will take your head with
the shard still in your neck,

162
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,677
allowing me to slowly defile it.

163
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,110
-That's Naraku's miasma.

164
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,877
-I think Kohaku's there, too.

165
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,677
I think his Shikon jewel shard.

166
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,177
-Kohaku?

167
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,943
-Let's go.

168
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,010
-So, if Kohaku's there,
shouldn't Sesshomaru

169
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,377
be there, too?

170
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,310
-He was.

171
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,743
But I can't smell
Sesshomaru now.

172
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,243
He probably ditched
them and ran off.

173
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:02,577
-We need to hurry.

174
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,177
If his shard is taken,
Kohaku will surely die.

175
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,710
-You're right.

176
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,477
-My, imagine meeting you here.

177
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,910
-Is that Byakuya?

178
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:17,743
-Sorry, but I'm afraid this
is as far as you go right now.

179
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:18,577
Nothing personal.

180
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,210
Naraku's orders, you understand.

181
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,843
-We don't have time to
play games with you!

182
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:25,043
-Same here.

183
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:27,543
I don't intend to stay
any longer than I have to.

184
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:30,243
Just until Naraku is
finished with his business.

185
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,243
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): The
shard is being defiled again.

186
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,543
-Hpmh.

187
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:43,910
Enough of this.

188
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:44,943
Wind Scar!

189
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,377
-Miasma!

190
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,043
-Everyone stay back.

191
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,710
I'm gonna use my Wind
Scar to blow away

192
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,410
the rest of this miasma.

193
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:58,210
-I don't think so.

194
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,310
-He's right.

195
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,277
You can't stop them
from producing miasma.

196
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,277
-Stand back, Inuyasha.

197
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,177
-Miroku!

198
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,710
-Wind Tunnel!

199
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:11,177
-You crazy monk.

200
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,810
Don't you realize
you'll never survives

201
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,543
if you suck in all this miasma?

202
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:15,877
Oh!

203
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,643
-Sango, now's your chance!

204
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,010
Go find Kohaku!

205
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,743
-Thanks, Kagome.

206
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:21,643
Let's go, Kirara.

207
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,510
-Prepare to die, Byakuya!

208
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,310
-Ready and waiting.

209
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,377
-Dammit.

210
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,743
-Miroku, are you in pain?

211
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:42,810
-No.

212
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:46,077
Let's go after Sango.

213
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,710
-Just so we're clear, the
monk's body hasn't recovered.

214
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:50,477
You understand that, right?

215
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,810
He merely can't feel the
pain from his wounds anymore.

216
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,577
The damage from
the miasma remains.

217
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,777
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): I know.

218
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,577
Stupid Miroku.

219
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,677
He looks totally fine.

220
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,277
I guess he really can't
feel the pain anymore.

221
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,077
Still, the damage
from the miasma

222
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,477
must have spread just now.

223
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,580
JAKEN (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

224
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:34,413
If I allow Rin to get mixed up
in this and she gets killed,

225
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,880
Lord Sesshomaru
will slaughter me!

226
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:40,446
-Listen, Master Jaken,
we have to split up.

227
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,213
Take Rin with you and
go someplace safe.

228
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,180
-Kohaku?

229
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:43,813
-What?

230
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,746
I couldn't.

231
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,146
Is that OK?

232
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,846
-No!

233
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,046
We can't, Master Jaken!

234
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,446
[laughter]

235
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,380
NARAKU: You're in no position to
be worrying about your friends.

236
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:52,880
-No!

237
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,780
-Kohaku!

238
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,746
[screaming]

239
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:08,446
-Rin, put this on, and don't
take it off, no matter what.

240
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,646
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): The
shard is being defiled again.

241
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,780
I can feel it getting worse.

242
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:13,646
-Kohaku, are you OK?

243
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,646
-Get away!

244
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Get away from here, Rin.

245
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,113
-Kohaku.

246
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:23,046
[laughter]

247
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,613
NARAKU: Are you scared, Kohaku?

248
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:28,580
Scared that my demonic
energy will manipulate you

249
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:30,913
into harming that girl?

250
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,413
Perhaps you're afraid you'll
lose control and kill her,

251
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,446
just like you killed
your father and comrades.

252
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,080
Do not be afraid.

253
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,980
You will no longer
have to suffer

254
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:44,846
when I am through with you.

255
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:51,280
-Kohaku!

256
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:53,180
[laughter]

257
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:02,846
-Naraku!

258
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,546
-Sister, it's you!

259
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,013
-Sango.

260
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,180
If you truly care
for your brother,

261
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,346
end his life, so that he
may finally rest in peace.

262
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,680
-Don't be ridiculous.

263
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,713
-Do you know not
understand, Sango?

264
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:19,746
Death is the only way to save
Kohaku's soul from its torment.

265
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,946
I want you to think about it.

266
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,746
Your brother managed to escape
my control and come to his

267
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,280
senses, yet you siblings
still cannot be together.

268
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:32,713
Why is that?

269
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,280
It's because Kohaku
is avoiding you.

270
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:38,446
You, his loving
and devoted sister.

271
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,113
But who can blame him?

272
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,013
After all, Sango,
you saw everything.

273
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:44,980
Every shameful act he committed.

274
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,846
Like it or not,
your very presence

275
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,680
reminds Kohaku of
his hateful past.

276
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:02,213
-Is that all you have to say?

277
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:02,980
-Hm?

278
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:05,313
-That Kohaku is avoiding me?

279
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:06,446
What's your point?

280
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,246
I knew that already.

281
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,180
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): Sister.

282
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:14,780
-Naraku, Kohaku may have
been under your control,

283
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,446
but that doesn't
change the fact he

284
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,613
killed our father in cold blood.

285
00:15:19,646 --> 00:15:22,780
I too relive that day
over and over again,

286
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:25,213
just as Kohaku must.

287
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:28,313
I know he feels anguish
and shame for what he did,

288
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:32,113
and that is exactly why
I will not let him die.

289
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,313
Until Kohaku can overcome
that pain, until he is free,

290
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:38,180
I will continue to
fight you, Naraku!

291
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,380
[laughter]

292
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,113
-Your resolve is admirable.

293
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,746
Though sadly, it won't
be of much use to you.

294
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,880
-The demonic energy
grows stronger!

295
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,080
-Hurry, Inuyasha.

296
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:56,746
I can feel Kohaku's shard
continuing to be defiled.

297
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,046
-Sister-- please,
get out of here.

298
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,546
-Kohaku!

299
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,146
-Sister--

300
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,313
-You're able to speak
while under the control

301
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,480
of my demonic energy.

302
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:15,646
How amusing.

303
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,146
With that jewel shard
in you, your body

304
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,780
will be under my
control, and yet you

305
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,246
shall remain conscious
of if the entire time.

306
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,746
-Damn you!

307
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,713
-What will you do, Sango?

308
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:30,146
How do you plan to save
your precious Kohaku now?

309
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,213
-Silence, Naraku!

310
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:34,880
I am sick of listening
to your nonsense!

311
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:35,746
-Sango!

312
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,713
-Sango!

313
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,013
-Come, now.

314
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,413
You don't actually expect to
defeat me with Hiraikotsu,

315
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:42,080
do you?

316
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:47,646
NARAKU (VOICEOVER): Impossible.

317
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,246
I am a mass of demonic energy.

318
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,146
I cannot be shattered
by the same energy.

319
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,346
No.

320
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,913
There is more than
just my demonic energy.

321
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,113
Something new.

322
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:01,013
An entirely different poison.

323
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:06,780
[groan] My body
isn't recovering!

324
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,313
-Yes!

325
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,013
Adamant Barrage!

326
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,546
[scream]

327
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,013
-Where are you going?

328
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:18,946
-Wind Tunnel!

329
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,613
-Dammit!

330
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,246
he got away.

331
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,046
-Hiraikotsu.

332
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
-Sango, are you all right?

333
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:38,446
-That was incredible, Sango.

334
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,380
It seems like Hiraikotsu is way
stronger than it was before.

335
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:43,113
-Yes.

336
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,413
I sure didn't expect that.

337
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,980
-Smells like the master
of potions' liquor.

338
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,246
-You're right.

339
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,980
-You forget that your Hiraikotsu
has been swimming around

340
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,113
in my herbs and poisons.

341
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:57,313
it will never be the
way it was, as you say.

342
00:17:57,346 --> 00:18:00,746
However, it won't be evident
to you until you fight again.

343
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,646
When you do, don't be surprised
by how it may have changed.

344
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,146
SANGO (VOICEOVER): Hiraikotsu
can now draw in demonic energy

345
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,246
and shatter it.

346
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,846
-Thanks to you, I actually
stand a chance against Naraku.

347
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,180
JAKEN: Where's Rin?

348
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:15,213
is she OK?

349
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,180
-Hm?

350
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:17,346
Oh, hey, Jaken.

351
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,713
How'd you end up getting
stuck to my foot?

352
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,780
-Because you stepped on me!

353
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,213
-Kohaku, are you OK?

354
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:26,313
-Kohaku's unable to move.

355
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,446
-Kohaku?

356
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,246
KAGOME: It must be
because the Shikon jewel

357
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,680
shard has been defiled.

358
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:33,080
we need to purify it.

359
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,780
-That didn't exactly
go as planned, do it?

360
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,380
-Shut your mouth, Byakuya.

361
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:39,546
-OK, fine.

362
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,680
Hm?

363
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:43,746
What's this?

364
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,980
NARAKU: A remaining fragment
of the mirror demon.

365
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,213
A memento of Kanna.

366
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,413
I want you to go and
give it to Sesshomaru.

367
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,280
-To Sesshomaru?

368
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,813
-Yes, that's right.

369
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,646
What no one knows is that
Sesshomaru is but a pawn.

370
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,813
My pawn.

371
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,480
The time has come to make
Inuyasha and the others

372
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,280
aware of that.

373
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:06,246
-OK, how's that feel?

374
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,946
-Good It feels a lot better.

375
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,180
I might not be able to purify
it as well as Kikyo could.

376
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,046
-Kikyo's light.

377
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,346
-Huh?

378
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,980
-It happened when Naraku
tried to take my jewel shard.

379
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,513
I'm not sure why, but the minute
his tentacles made contact,

380
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,746
this pure light started
flowing into him.

381
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,680
-From Naraku's tentacles?

382
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,480
-It almost felt as though
Lady Kikyo was purifying me.

383
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:31,913
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
Does that mean

384
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:34,946
Kikyo's power somehow entered
Naraku and remains there even

385
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,146
now?

386
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,113
KANNA (VOICEOVER): The
light will destroy Naraku.

387
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,613
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): The
image Kanna showed me

388
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,046
before she died.

389
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
It was the Shikon jewel.

390
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:47,546
It was defiled, but
in the center of it,

391
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,380
there was a light.

392
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:52,680
That must've been Kikyo's light!

393
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,480
-And so--

394
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:54,980
-Huh?

395
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:56,180
-Kohaku.

396
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:57,580
Are you suggesting you'd
be able to use your shard

397
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,346
to defeat Naraku?

398
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
-Well, I--

399
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:04,013
-Naraku said he was going
to take Kohaku's head.

400
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:07,580
He said once he did that, he
could slowly defile the shard.

401
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:08,380
-Rin!

402
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:09,680
-Well, you almost died, Kohaku!

403
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:11,846
-Don't listen to her.

404
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,980
Look, sister.

405
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:17,246
It's clear that my shard
can cause Naraku pain.

406
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,180
I know Lady Kikyo's
power is protecting me.

407
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,613
That's why--

408
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:24,713
INUYASHA: Stop your babbling.

409
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:25,546
-Inuyasha.

410
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,680
-Give me a break.

411
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:29,146
Why do we have to keep
tip toeing around him?

412
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,980
Sango.

413
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,246
Just tell it to him straight.

414
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,446
It's a pain in the butt when
he wanders off by himself,

415
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,446
isn't it?

416
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,180
-Inuyasha.

417
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,646
Sit, boy.

418
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,646
-Why?

419
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,713
-It wasn't Kohaku's
fault this time.

420
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:42,480
Sesshomaru left
them there alone,

421
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,213
so it was just Kohaku
and the little ones

422
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,380
around when he was attacked.

423
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,446
-The little ones, who
are you calling little?

424
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,280
-Well, your height, your
heart, your personality.

425
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:53,313
So many things about
you are little.

426
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:54,113
-No.

427
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,946
It's just as Inuyasha says.

428
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,646
This isn't the first
time it's happened.

429
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,746
Kohaku.

430
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,880
You know you're weak
of heart and strength.

431
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:05,713
That is why Naraku can
take advantage of you.

432
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:10,213
If you fight alone, you don't
stand a chance against him.

433
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:13,880
Please tell me you
understand that much.

434
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,813
-It's true.

435
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,446
You're right.

436
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,146
-I believe that Kikyo left
her power in your shard,

437
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,313
but I don't think she
wanted you to sacrifice it.

438
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:24,446
I think she'd want
you to treasure it.

439
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Protect it like the
beautiful gift that it is.

440
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:28,046
-Yes.

441
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,813
You're right.

442
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,946
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER): Lady Kikyo.

443
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,980
-Heh.

444
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:35,880
What a joke.

445
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:37,613
They still end up babying him.

446
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:40,346
-Must be nice to have all
those girls fawning over you.

447
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,513
MIROKU (VOICEOVER): I
shouldn't be surprised.

448
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:50,980
The damage from the miasma
continues to spread.

449
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:54,413
Please-- let me hold
on until it's over.

450
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,494
[theme music]

451
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:47,144
RIN: I'm begging
you, Lord Sesshomaru!

452
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,244
Please don't listen
to what Naraku says!

453
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:51,677
KAGOME: Sesshomaru joins
in Naraku's scheme,

454
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,677
he takes Tetsusaiga's
demonic energy,

455
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,910
and strands Inuyasha on
the path to the underworld!

456
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,277
SESSHOMARU: Prove it, Inuyasha.

457
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,877
Prove that it is you who is the
rightful heir to Tetsusaiga.

458
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,610
That is all I ask.

459
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:05,810
INUYASHA: Next Time on
"Inuyasha, The Final Act."

460
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:06,777
True Air.

461
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,244
Come on, Tetsusaiga.

462
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:11,244
I believe in you!
