[theme music]

2
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,082
-I know why you've come.

3
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,615
-I'm here because I want
you to use my shard.

4
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:58,682
-Is that so?

5
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,082
I'm aware that you've
been following me

6
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,415
for quite some time.

7
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:03,882
Do you understand what it
will mean if I use your shard?

8
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,515
Do you realize what
will happen to you?

9
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:06,848
-I understand.

10
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,548
I'm willing to
sacrifice my life.

11
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:12,215
-Am I to believe, then,
that you do not fear death?

12
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:14,948
-I do not.

13
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,148
-(VOICEOVER) His
eyes show no fear.

14
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,615
Not even the
slightest hesitation.

15
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:23,415
Is life so painful for you
that you welcome death?

16
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,415
It saddens me greatly
to think that if we

17
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,048
had met under different
circumstances,

18
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,682
my only instinct would have
been to heal this child's

19
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:34,115
broken soul and encourage
him to live his life.

20
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:37,982
But my duty now forbids me
from doing that for him.

21
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:38,948
Forgive me, Kohaku.

22
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:43,148
-You're leaving us behind?

23
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:44,582
After all we've
been through, Koga?

24
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,115
-You're wasting your breath.

25
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,482
My mind's already made up.

26
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,882
I'm going after
Naraku on my own.

27
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,982
These Shikon jewel shards have
gotten the whole wolf demon

28
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,282
tribe involved now.

29
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:57,015
Plus, I don't know when my
legs will stop moving again

30
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:59,082
because of Midoriko's will.

31
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,248
It's nothing personal.

32
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,248
It's just too dangerous
for you to be around me.

33
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,648
Besides, you'd
only get in my way.

34
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,582
-That's it!

35
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:05,782
You can't do
anything without us!

36
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:06,582
-He's right!

37
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:07,782
You'll never make it without us.

38
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:08,782
-Wow.

39
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,248
You actually believe
that, don't you?

40
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:11,448
-Wait a sec, Koga.

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,415
-Look.

42
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:13,515
Both of us are after
the same thing,

43
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,348
so you know we'll be
crossing paths again.

44
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:20,082
You better not try to beat me
to the punch, scrawny, wolf boy.

45
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:23,015
-In that case, you better learn
to use that sword of yours.

46
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:24,682
-Yeah, yeah, you smart ass.

47
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:28,215
I know it won't be easy, Kagome,
but I'll be back for you.

48
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,282
See you.

49
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,248
-Bye you guys.

50
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,148
Thanks for helping us!

51
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,315
-You take care, little lady!

52
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,148
Until next time!

53
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:40,848
-You too!

54
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:41,882
Take care of yourselves!

55
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,948
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER) The
Great Holy Demon Spirit's Test.

56
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:01,948
-You ready, Kinka?

57
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,582
Today I shatter that skull
of yours once and for all.

58
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:05,848
-Silence, Ginka!

59
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:07,982
I'm gonna burn you alive
before you get the chance!

60
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,215
-Moryomaru.

61
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,515
Kinka and Ginka are forever
bound to one another.

62
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,748
You must obtain the power
of this bond between them.

63
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,615
Do that, and you
shall strengthen

64
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:25,682
the bond between you
and your new shell.

65
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,148
Consume them.

66
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,082
-Come on, boy.

67
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:29,848
Out with it.

68
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:30,815
What did he do this time?

69
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:32,115
-No, it's Tetsusaiga.

70
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,148
It hurt Inuyasha.

71
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,215
It tried to burn him.

72
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:38,315
I've never seen
anything like it.

73
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:42,048
-Oh, hello again, Totosai.

74
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,415
-Hm.

75
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:44,648
Here, let me have a look.

76
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:54,648
I see it's now capable of
absorbing demonic energy.

77
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:55,815
So?

78
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:58,082
-So I'm asking you what
the problem is, old man.

79
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,948
-There is nothing
wrong with Tetsusaiga.

80
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,815
If there's a problem, the
problem is you, Inuyasha.

81
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,282
-What are you talking about?

82
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,315
-Listen carefully.

83
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,315
Demonic energy is like
a poison of sorts.

84
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,282
Originally,
Tetsusaiga was forged

85
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,515
from the fang of your father,
who was a mighty demon.

86
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,348
He had the capacity to
absorb an infinite amount

87
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:18,948
of demonic energy.

88
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,982
However, you, who
are half human,

89
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,715
simply do not possess
the power to restrain

90
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,615
the demonic energy
absorbed by your own sword.

91
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:27,282
Now then.

92
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,248
Show me your hands.

93
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,415
-Ha.

94
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,848
What are you, gonna ready
my fortune or something?

95
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,215
-(VOICEOVER) Stubborn boy.

96
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:36,782
This much damage and you still
refuse to let go of the sword?

97
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:39,348
-The Dragon Scale
Tetsusaiga grew hotter

98
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,515
as it absorbed more
demonic energy.

99
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,648
-It was warning you of
the danger you faced.

100
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,982
A warning you would
have been wise to heed!

101
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:49,382
-(VOICEOVER) So Tetsusaiga
never wanted to hurt Inuyasha.

102
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,115
-All right.

103
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,182
What should I do?

104
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:53,515
-Now that Tetsusaiga
has become stronger,

105
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:56,515
you too must become
stronger to handle it.

106
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:57,648
-But how?

107
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,715
-It's going to take
extensive training.

108
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:02,115
-We don't have time for any
of that, and you know it.

109
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,115
-That is unfortunate,
but it's your fault

110
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,015
for ignoring my warning
in the first place.

111
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,315
-My fault?

112
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,215
I'm begging you for help,
and that's all you can say?

113
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,115
-Well, if this is
your idea of begging,

114
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:15,115
I'd have to see what
demanding looks like.

115
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:18,982
Since you insist, go meet
the great holy spirit!

116
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,748
-Holy demon spirit?

117
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:24,015
-He's the demon equivalent
of a wise old hermit.

118
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,615
If you want to master the
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga,

119
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,882
you have no choice but
to go train under him.

120
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:36,348
-My turn!

121
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:41,715
What's this?

122
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,882
-Who dares to interfere
in our battle?

123
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,648
-(VOICEOVER) A few drops of
their blood are this effective?

124
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,582
Oh, I'll make good
use of you two.

125
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,182
I'm going to devour you both.

126
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,882
-You have wounded our body.

127
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,682
-You're going to regret it!

128
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,115
-Where is it?

129
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,082
-You idiot!

130
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,782
-What's this?

131
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:10,348
-Now, it's only a matter
of time before one of us

132
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,415
takes over your body.

133
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,115
-It is laughable
that a creature like

134
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,515
you would attempt to consume us.

135
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:17,148
-That armor of yours
won't protect you either.

136
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:20,048
-As we speak, fire and lightning
are penetrating your body.

137
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,048
You shall burn from
the inside out!

138
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,982
-Interesting.

139
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,315
If things continue this
way, even Naraku's heart

140
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:33,048
will be in danger.

141
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,948
You could at least
introduce yourself

142
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,348
before trying to kill me.

143
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:43,515
-I can smell Naraku's
scent on you.

144
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,315
That is all the reason I need.

145
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,215
-Is that so?

146
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,215
You must be Lord Sesshomaru.

147
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,515
-Tell me what Moryomaru
is doing here.

148
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,615
-Alas, I am but a
distant spectator.

149
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,548
-Kinka wasn't able
to break free.

150
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:02,515
Now's my chance to kill you!

151
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,648
-Ginka, you coward!

152
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:12,315
-You made it easy for me.

153
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,882
-Bastard.

154
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:16,182
-It was Ginka who chose
this fate for you,

155
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:18,582
not I. He could
have easily escaped,

156
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,915
but instead, he
chose to attack you.

157
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:21,748
-Shut up!

158
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,282
-You're no threat to me anymore.

159
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:40,248
-He was after the
power that connects

160
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,715
Kinka and Ginka's
demonic energy.

161
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,315
Not a bad acquisition.

162
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:47,915
Naraku might get more than he
bargained for with this one.

163
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,215
Huh?

164
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,715
Lord Sesshomaru?

165
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:52,782
-Sesshomaru.

166
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,182
-Moryomaru.

167
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,582
Why not test your newly acquired
power on me, if you're able to.

168
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,015
-I can see you've
got a new blade,

169
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,415
and I bet you're just itching
to try it out, aren't you?

170
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:10,448
As you wish!

171
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:11,215
-Meido Zangetsuha!

172
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:18,882
He's fleeing?

173
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,382
-It's nothing personal.

174
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:25,382
Naraku ordered me to
let him escape, you see.

175
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,782
Farewell, Lord Sesshomaru.

176
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,148
-If he's a hermit,
why live here?

177
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,182
-Good point.

178
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:46,048
It isn't very hermit-like.

179
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:46,982
-Hey.

180
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,248
Are you sure this
is the right way?

181
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:53,448
-Here?

182
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:54,582
MAN: Help!

183
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,148
Somebody help me!

184
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,648
-What?

185
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:05,515
-Now, this is what I'd expect
the residence of a demon hermit

186
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,448
to look like.

187
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,782
-Where was that
voice coming from?

188
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:09,515
MAN: Hey!

189
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,582
I'm over here!

190
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,515
You must help me
before I blow away.

191
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,482
-Is it laundry?

192
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,182
-No.

193
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,515
Laundry cannot speak.

194
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,648
-I do't suppose
that's the hermit?

195
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:22,748
-I think it might be.

196
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:23,415
-Thanks.

197
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:24,882
The wind was picking up.

198
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,815
So you're Inuyasha, are you?

199
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,015
I shall train you well, my boy.

200
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:31,348
At least that's what
I'd like to say, but--

201
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:31,915
-What?

202
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,482
-I can't.

203
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,282
Please leave.

204
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:34,282
-Bastard!

205
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,248
Why not?

206
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:36,348
Tell me!

207
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,882
-Sit, boy!

208
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:40,648
So, why can't you?

209
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,315
-Well, it happened last night.

210
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:45,782
I was preparing for
my evening meditation

211
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:48,215
when a demon attacked
me from behind,

212
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,948
and made off with all
my internal organs.

213
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,348
That's how I eneded
up like this.

214
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:54,215
-I see.

215
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:56,148
In that case, let us help you.

216
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,648
We just have to recover
your internal organs, right?

217
00:10:58,682 --> 00:10:59,415
-No way!

218
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:00,715
I didn't sign up for that.

219
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,448
-It's a very nice though,
but this is not an opponent

220
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:06,715
that a half demon and a
bunch of humans can handle.

221
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:10,448
-Well, excuse me for only being
a half demon, oh wise one.

222
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:13,448
-You are not helping things.

223
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:14,915
-What is it, Kirara?

224
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:21,282
-Huh?

225
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,215
-This place is
crawling with demons!

226
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,648
-I'll cut every single
one of 'em down!

227
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:27,548
-Somebody stop that fool.

228
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:28,048
-Huh?

229
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,282
Sit, boy!

230
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,648
-What was that for?

231
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,282
-Isn't it obvious, boy?

232
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:34,282
Those aren't demons.

233
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,448
They're villagers.

234
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:36,715
-What?

235
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,882
-Their appearance has been
altered by demonic magic.

236
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,048
The demonic energy
drifting in the air

237
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,615
is from my missing organs.

238
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,515
-I thought the demon took them.

239
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:48,948
-While it absorbs the
energy, the demon can't move.

240
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,415
It is likely still in
the village somewhere.

241
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:53,248
-So it transformed the
villagers' appearance

242
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:55,782
to make htem look like demons
in order to hide amongst them.

243
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,082
-It requires less effort to
blend in than it does to hide.

244
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,548
-Look, If that's true, it
means that there's a real demon

245
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,248
somewhere nearby, right?

246
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,548
It seems simple to me.

247
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,282
We just have to find the demon
and get your organs back.

248
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,848
-What you're saying
makes a lot of sense.

249
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:10,348
-Huh?

250
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,115
-You bastard!

251
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,548
What the hell did
you do to my sword?

252
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,848
-It's a precaution.

253
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:20,964
I can't let you go around
attacking people at random.

254
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,157
-Hold it right there!

255
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,757
-Are you speaking to us, mister?

256
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,790
-We are just two
simple travelers.

257
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,824
-You two can pretend to
be human all you want,

258
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,457
but you can't fool my nose.

259
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,557
-And what are you
gonna do about it?

260
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,990
-(VOICEOVER) I
can't draw my sword.

261
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:43,524
But they're real demons!

262
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:47,324
Aw, who are you kidding?

263
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:48,624
-Oh, dear.

264
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:51,257
-All right, what the hell's
going on, you dish rag?

265
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,890
Those were real
demons, and you still

266
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,490
wouldn't let me draw Tetsusaiga.

267
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,457
-That's because
neither of these demons

268
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,457
was the one who stole my organs.

269
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,290
-Well, that's confusing.

270
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:01,624
-Indeed.

271
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,757
Not only have the villagers
been changed to look demons,

272
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,057
but there are unrelated
demons in the mix, too.

273
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,624
-Great.

274
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:08,257
More chains.

275
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,324
Just what I need.

276
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,224
-Those are for assaulting
innocent demons.

277
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,724
-This is an outrage!

278
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,824
You have disrupted the
tranquility of our village.

279
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:17,024
-Lay down your
weapons and surrender.

280
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,324
-Get on, Kagome.

281
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,624
-OK.

282
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:23,090
[groanign]

283
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:25,590
-Keep this up, and your
sword will disappear.

284
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:26,457
-Shut up.

285
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,390
-This way!

286
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:33,857
-So why did you help us, kid?

287
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,657
-Because I was scared.

288
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,990
My mother's not well.

289
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,257
She's been bedridden
since last night.

290
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,257
So I went out to get
her some medicine.

291
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,924
When I returned,
the whole village

292
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,224
was swarming with demons.

293
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:48,824
-I can't take it.

294
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:51,724
-She must have been transformed
by some demonic magic,

295
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:54,457
like all the other villagers.

296
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,324
WOMAN: Genosuke.

297
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:56,190
-Huh?

298
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:57,990
WOMAN: Is that you, my son?

299
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:01,090
-The demonic energy that
is emanating from your body

300
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,590
is most certainly that
of my internal organs.

301
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,324
-Ha.

302
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:08,190
So what if it is, old man?

303
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,257
Are you going to
cut open my belly

304
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,890
and try to take them back?

305
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:14,090
-So, this is your
true form, huh?

306
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,290
I can't use my sword.

307
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:20,457
What's going on?

308
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,490
-Do you need your sword,
or do you want it?

309
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,290
-What?

310
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:24,724
-Just stand back, Inuyasha.

311
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,157
-We can take care of this one.

312
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,257
-Whoa!

313
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,124
-Miroku!

314
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:30,990
Sango!

315
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,224
(VOICEOVER) What just happened?

316
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,424
Did the demon do that?

317
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,124
-Looks lke your friends
have flown away.

318
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,724
-I think now would
be a good time

319
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:38,857
to get rid of those chains.

320
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,490
-Ha.

321
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,057
You read my mind.

322
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,790
-Ah!

323
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:42,590
Huh?

324
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:43,857
It burned me.

325
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,390
Tetsusaiga doesn't
want me to draw.

326
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,390
[laughter]

327
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:49,057
-What are you waiting for?

328
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,690
Or is that sword on your
hip just decoration?

329
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,524
-Iron Reaver Soul Stealer!

330
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:00,724
-You cannot just
slash at the thing.

331
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,557
Find the demon vortex.

332
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,690
-Demon vortex?

333
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,590
-Silence, you old wind bag!

334
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:06,557
-Why me?

335
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,590
-Iron Reaver Soul Stealer!

336
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:14,924
It's useless.

337
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,590
What was that demon
vortex nonsense

338
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,257
the old dish rag
was talking about?

339
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,124
Demonic energy?

340
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,924
[laughter]

341
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,690
-My demonic venom shall
dissolve your flesh.

342
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:27,624
-Inuyasha!

343
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:28,990
Hang in there.

344
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:29,890
Huh?

345
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,824
-Huh?

346
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:32,757
-Oh, no!

347
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,590
Genosuke?

348
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:37,057
-You must not interfere.

349
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,024
-Wah!

350
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:38,957
-Kagome!

351
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,524
I'm coming!

352
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:41,424
(VOICEOVER) Damn.

353
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,857
It's filling up
with demonic venom.

354
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,357
Huh?

355
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,757
Spirals of demonic energy?

356
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,490
The demon vortex!

357
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,157
-Ha ha ha!

358
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,557
Nice try, but you don't even
know what you're looking for.

359
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,357
-(VOICEOVER) One of
these is the real one.

360
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,857
Where?

361
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,557
Where is it?

362
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,490
Where's the real vortex?

363
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:09,357
I smell it.

364
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,190
Blades of Blood!

365
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,124
One of them smells
different than the others.

366
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:24,090
[scream]

367
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,390
-Inuyasha!

368
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:27,757
-Kagome, are you OK?

369
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,424
Huh?

370
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:29,390
Insense.

371
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,257
This must have
been what I smelled

372
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,524
coming from the demon vortex.

373
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,424
The demonic energy
hasn't changed,

374
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,024
which means the real demon
must be hiding somewhere else.

375
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:40,724
-You're right.

376
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:41,790
Nothing's changed.

377
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,424
The villagers are
still under that spell.

378
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:47,490
-And the seal on Tetsusaiga
hasn't been broken yet.

379
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:48,590
It's that smell again.

380
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,624
-Huh?

381
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:58,590
-Huh?

382
00:16:58,624 --> 00:16:59,857
-Dish rag.

383
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,457
-What's happened to you?

384
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,457
-While the snake woman kept
you busy, I dispoed of him.

385
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,657
-So, you two were
working together.

386
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,857
-Now his organs are part
of my own flesh and blood.

387
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,290
-How dare you do that
to the old dish rag.

388
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,357
-You are the one at
fault, half demon.

389
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,390
We know your sword has the
power to absorb demonic energy.

390
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:24,424
Naturally, we cannot afford
to ignore such a weapon,

391
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:28,857
nor can we allow your technique
with it to be perfected.

392
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,790
That's why you attacked
a defenseless old man

393
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:31,790
and stole his organs?

394
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:34,124
-A necessary sacrifice.

395
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:35,657
-You're going to pay for that!

396
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,857
-You can't draw your sword
until the seal of the Great Holy

397
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,157
Demon Spirit placed
on it has been lifted.

398
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,257
-That won't matter if you're
the one we've been looking for.

399
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,490
If the dish rag was killed
for trying to help me,

400
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,224
the least I can do
is avenge his death.

401
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,190
The seal will break!

402
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:52,224
Huh?

403
00:17:52,257 --> 00:18:00,490
Tetsusaiga-- Dragon
Scale Tetsusaiga!

404
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:03,257
-You can see my demon
vorteces, but you

405
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,024
can't tell which one
is real, can you?

406
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,024
INUYASHA: It's that one.

407
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:09,957
I'm sure of it.

408
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,690
Prepare yourself!

409
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,890
I can't move my sword.

410
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:19,157
I'm not going as easily
as the snake woman.

411
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,590
-The demonic energy--

412
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,124
-It seems you're giong to
need a better strategy.

413
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,957
-One way or another,
I'm gonna cut you down!

414
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,857
[coughing]

415
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,990
-This smell--

416
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,324
-Every attack on
me only increases

417
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:39,090
the damange to you and
your sword, you fool.

418
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,824
-Tetsusaiga's cracking.

419
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:44,357
-The demonic energy that I have
consumed from the Great Holy

420
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,457
Demon Spirit is inexhaustible!

421
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,257
-(VOICEOVER) The real demon
vortex is somewhere else.

422
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,090
-Take this!

423
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,124
-(VOICEOVER) The demonic
energy I was exposed

424
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:57,057
to, and the demonic
energy coming from the ox

425
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,390
demon's body.

426
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:02,557
They smell the same, but I
smell something stronger, too.

427
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,557
It's behind him!

428
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,257
Kagome, let go of
the dish rag, now!

429
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,024
-Huh?

430
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,424
-Turning your back on me?

431
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,524
-I can't see it, but
I know it's there.

432
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,124
I see it.

433
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,624
One strike will end this.

434
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,057
Hang in there, Tetsusaiga!

435
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,957
KAGOME: Everything's
back to normal.

436
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,657
-Kagome.

437
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,357
-Looks like we all made it.

438
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,690
-The spell that was on the
village has been broken, too.

439
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,390
-You did well to find
the real demon vortex.

440
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,490
-Dish rag?

441
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:43,557
You're still alive?

442
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,757
-Yes.

443
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,157
And the time has finally
come to you my true form.

444
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,390
Well, here it is.

445
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,524
I am sorry to have deceived you.

446
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,524
-I hate to break it to
you, but you don't really

447
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:55,490
look any different.

448
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,390
-Well, this one's less flat.

449
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:58,990
-Given your sudden
transformation,

450
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,357
I'm assuming you
weren't entirely

451
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,324
honest about your
organs being still.

452
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,524
-Correct.

453
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,357
-But what about the snake
woman and the ox demon?

454
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,157
-All a part of my illusion.

455
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,357
-You bastard.

456
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,224
What was the point of
this whole charade, then?

457
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:11,324
-What was the point?

458
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,724
To retrain you, of course.

459
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,357
-To retrain me?

460
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,590
-Isn't that why you came
to me in the first place?

461
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:19,390
I had to teach you how to
find true demonic energy.

462
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:21,957
But there was the other
thing you needed to learn.

463
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,524
-What is the other thing?

464
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,257
-Yes, what is it?

465
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,557
-Well, knowledge is
a river whose waters

466
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,757
must be drunk slowly.

467
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,890
-Tell me now.

468
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:31,890
-As you wish.

469
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:34,224
Basically, in the
illusionary world

470
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:36,690
that I created as a
backdrop for your training,

471
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,857
you were constantly exposed
to my demonic energy.

472
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,790
As a result, your
eyes were quickly

473
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,124
trained to spot demon vortices.

474
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,990
-Why all the chains
on his sword?

475
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:49,457
-I arranged for it to snap if
it were drawn unnecessarily.

476
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,857
-(VOICEOVER) So that's why
Tetsusaiga wouldn't allow me

477
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,824
to draw.

478
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:54,157
-But the real
purpose of all this

479
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,690
was to teach you how to use
the Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga.

480
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,324
-How to use it?

481
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,124
-I have a message
for you from Totosai.

482
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,657
Tetsusaiga is not meant
to absorb demonic energy.

483
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,924
Rather, the sword is
meant to cut through it.

484
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,957
-(VOICEOVER) It
cuts demonic energy?

485
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,157
-Tell me this.

486
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,824
Why did you decide to cut
that last demon vortex?

487
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,457
-Well, I noticed
Tetsusaiga was cracked.

488
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,590
So I needed to end the
fight in one strike.

489
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:19,457
-Oh, I can see the
theory was lost on you.

490
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,090
Still, what is truly important
is that you and your sword

491
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:23,357
are connected.

492
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,490
That is all.

493
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,124
Go on.

494
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:25,790
Draw Tetsusaiga.

495
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,924
-That's demonic energy.

496
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:37,190
-Did that all come from the
Great Holy Demon Spirit?

497
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:39,690
-It is because you cut
through my demon vortex.

498
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,424
My demonic energy
is strong enough

499
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:44,157
to slice your average
demon vortex in two.

500
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,557
-Great Holy Demon Spirit,
I'm sorry for judging you

501
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,790
by your appearance.

502
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,557
-Don't you mean, thank
you very much, Inuyasha?

503
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,357
-(VOICEOVER) I took him to be
an unreliable half demon brat.

504
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,857
But he did complete my training.

505
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,957
However, Tetsusaiga still
has one last form left,

506
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,690
and Inuyasha, I'm
afraid you'll have

507
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:04,324
to discover that
one on your own.

508
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:13,891
[theme music]

509
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,867
NARAKU: I had this specially
prepared just for you.

510
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,667
You'd be wise to accept
it and return to my body.

511
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,067
KAGOME: Naraku has absorbed
the demon tree Yomeiju.

512
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,033
It's all a part of a
secret plan to get closer

513
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,500
to the infant, his heart.

514
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,867
Now, with Koga and his
Shikon jewel shards,

515
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,333
along with Inuyasha
and company, it

516
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,200
looks like the battle
between the three groups

517
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,500
will finally come to an end.

518
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,267
INUYASHA: Next time on
"Inuyasha, The Final

519
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,733
Act," the End of Moryomaru.

520
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:07,867
-Damn you, Naraku.

521
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,900
-So you intend to
take me down with you.
