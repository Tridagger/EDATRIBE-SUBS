TO NARAKU'S EVIL TRICKS.

360
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,703
- YEAH, WHO DID?

361
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,903
- TSUBAKI...
AND THE REST OF US, AS WELL.

362
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:31,669
- HMPH!

363
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:32,836
- AND NARAKU'S THE ONE

364
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,436
WHO POSSESSES
THE SACRED JEWEL ONCE AGAIN.

365
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:36,969
- I'LL GET IT BACK FROM HIM.

366
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,869
- YEAH. I'M SURE
YOU'RE RIGHT, INUYASHA.

367
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:42,003
- OH, BOY, I'M SO TIRED.

368
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,769
- WELL, SHALL WE GO BACK, THEN?

369
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,469
- HMM?

370
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,969
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, INUYASHA?

371
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:53,369
- FORGET IT. PROBABLY NOTHING.

372
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,369
GUESS I IMAGINED IT.

373
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:00,869
- TSUBAKI WAS ENTIRELY OBSESSED
WITH THE SACRED JEWEL,

374
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,503
SO SHE WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.

375
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:06,069
OBSESSED...

376
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:08,869
JUST AS I AM OBSESSED.

377
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:12,703
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
TURNER ENTERTAINMENT GROUP

378
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,303

CAPTIONING INSTITUTE
--www.ncicap.org--

379
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:28,530
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

380
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:00,899
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MYOGA?

381
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,666
YOU USUALLY TRY TO AVOID US,

382
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:06,532
BUT TODAY YOU'VE ACTUALLY
HUNTED US DOWN.

383
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,666
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

384
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,266
MIROKU IS ATTACKING SANGO!

385
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,099
AND EVEN INUYASHA
IS ACTING STRANGE.

386
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:16,099
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

387
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:18,666
WITH THE CURSE
OF THE GIANT CENTIPEDE?

388
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:19,866
NEXT TIME...

389
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,766
"FAREWELL, DAYS OF MY YOUTH."

390
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,799
WHOSE YOUTH ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT ANYWAY?
