196
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,500
PROTECT THE TREE.

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,267
IF THE WIND-SCAR WON'T WORK,

198
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,834

00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,634
>> DON'T MOVE, YOU BASTARD.

00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:35,900
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY

205
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,167
VILLAGES WERE DEVOURED BY YOUR

206
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,900

208
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,234
>> COME NOW.

209
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,734
IS THAT REALLY WHAT'S UPSETTING

210
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,767
YOU?

211
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,234
WHY MUST YOU PERSIST IN

00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,534
INTERFERING WITH THINGS THAT

213
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,300
AREN'T YOUR CONCERN?

214

00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,200
FROM NARAKU, THE SAME THING WILL

227
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,567
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

MAYBE THE SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE

240

THE RATS ARE ALL COMING BACK.

262
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,667
[THINKING] THE ZUSHI NEZUMI ARE

304
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,495
SHIPPO, SNAP OUT OF IT AND

305
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,362
TRANSFORM.

306
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,562

KOHAKU DID IS UNFORGIVABLE.

458

BEING CRUSHED.

462
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,607
THEN WHEN I SAW THAT HE WAS OK,

463
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,173
I FELT RELIEF FROM THE BOTTOM OF

464
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:49,773

465
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:52,773

468
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,807
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HATE HIM.

00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,607
>> YES, BUT AFTER ALL OF THIS--
