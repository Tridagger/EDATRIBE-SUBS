1
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,662
- WHY WAS I DEFEATED?

2
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:02,195
- AAH!

3
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:04,128
- VICTORY IS MINE!

4
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:06,462
[GROWLING]

5
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:08,095
- OH, NO!

6
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,062
AAH!

7
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:15,462
DID I MAKE A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE?

8
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,895
NO. I'VE MADE NO ERRORS.

9
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:31,295
AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS SACRED
JEWEL, I CAN START OVER.

10
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,562
- WHO'S THERE?

11
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:33,228
- HMM?

12
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,362
- HOW DARE YOU TRESPASS HERE?

13
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:36,562
- IF YOU ARE HUMAN, BEGONE,

14
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,328
AND IF YOU ARE A DEMON,
WE WILL SLAY YOU!

15
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,528
- STAND DOWN!

16
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,962
I AM PRIESTESS TSUBAKI.

17
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,395
I TRAINED AT THIS SHRINE.

18
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,828
- OH, HOW NOSTALGIC.

19
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:04,662
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED
SINCE I WAS LAST HERE.

20
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,362
- MY NAME IS MOMIJI.

21
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,595
- AND MY NAME IS BOTAN.

22
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,895
- ONLY YOU TWO PROTECT
THE SHRINE NOW?

23
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:15,028
- YES. YOU SEE,
THE TWO OF US WERE THE LAST
OF OUR MASTER'S DISCIPLES.

24
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,295
- I SEE.

25
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:17,695
- EXCUSE ME, PRIESTESS TSUBAKI.

26
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,962
WERE YOU ONCE ONE OF
THE MASTER'S DISCIPLES, AS WELL?

27
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:23,795
PARDON MY RUDENESS, BUT WOULD
YOU MIND IF I ASK YOUR AGE?

28
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,128
- YES, IT'S TRUE.
YOU LOOK VERY YOUNG.

29
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,662
- I AM MUCH OLDER THAN
BOTH OF YOU, OF COURSE.

30
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:32,162
MY YOUTHFULNESS IS
DUE TO MY TRAINING.

31
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,495
- IS THERE A SKILL
TO KEEP ONE YOUNG?

32
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,395
- OF SORTS. AND YOU, TOO,
MIGHT REAP SUCH BENEFITS

33
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,095
IF YOU CONTINUE YOUR TRAINING.

34
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:39,928
- HUH?
- HUH?

35
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:42,395
- HMM. IT'S NOT
VERY EASY, THOUGH.

36
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:47,928
- PRIESTESS TSUBAKI, WHY DID YOU
RETURN TO THIS SHRINE?

37
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,528
- IT'S BECAUSE I AM
BEING HUNTED BY A DEMON.

38
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:52,695
[GASP]
- A DEMON?

39
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:54,928
- WHAT SHALL I DO
WITH THESE TWO?

40
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:57,262
SHOULD I KILL THEM HERE AND NOW?

41
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,628
- WE WILL ASSIST YOU,
PRIESTESS TSUBAKI,

42
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:03,895
BECAUSE YOU ARE
OUR SISTER DISCIPLE.

43
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,462
- OH?

44
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:15,562
- I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED NOW.

45
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:21,395
I WAS PLACED UNDER A CURSE
BY THE DARK PRIESTESS TSUBAKI.

46
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,562
- HEY.
[GASP]

47
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,562
ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?

48
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,195
- YES. I'M OK NOW.

49
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:39,462
- KAGOME!

50
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,962
- YOU'RE AWAKE, KAGOME.

51
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:42,728
- FEELING BETTER?
- KAGOME!

52
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,962
- LOOK, I'M ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

53
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,162
I'M JUST FINE!

54
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,462
- WAS THE DARK PRIESTESS WHO
PLACED THE CURSE NAMED TSUBAKI?

55
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:53,362
50 YEARS AGO, THERE WAS
A PRIESTESS BY THAT NAME

56
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,028
WHO WAS EQUAL
IN STATUS TO KIKYO.

57
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,862
- WHY DID SHE TURN INTO
AN EVIL PRIESTESS?

58
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,128
- THAT I DO NOT KNOW.

59
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:04,028
PERHAPS SHE MERELY SHARES
THE SAME NAME WITH ONE.

60
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:04,928
- HUH?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

61
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:08,062
- I SENSE THE PRESENCE
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

62
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:10,662
- ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT, KAGOME?

63
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,262
- YES. I CAN FEEL IT CLEARLY.

64
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,962
- IT'S A HUGE SHARD,
THAT'S WHY.

65
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,062
- WHICH WAY IS IT?

66
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,095
- IT'S THAT WAY.

67
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:22,262
- WE'LL HAVE TO GO AFTER IT.

68
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,895
- CORRECT. WE MUSTN'T
PASS UP THIS CHANCE

69
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:27,128
TO GET A SACRED
JEWEL SHARD BACK.

70
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,595
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KAEDE?

71
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,328
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE COMING WITH US!

72
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,128
- SHE IS A DARK PRIESTESS,
AFTER ALL,

73
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:35,428
SO I THOUGHT I, AS A PRIESTESS,
SHOULD ACCOMPANY YOU.

74
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:38,628
- DOESN'T "PRIESTESS"
BRING SOMEONE YOUNG TO MIND?

75
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:39,428
- KAGOME.

76
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:41,762
- INUYASHA--SIT, BOY!

77
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:42,762
- UNH!

78
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:45,195
- SUCH AN IMPUDENT FELLOW.

79
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,095
ONWARD WE GO!

80
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,995
- KIRARA!

81
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:50,895
- COME ON, INUYASHA.

82
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,262
- UNH! WHY, YOU...

83
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:55,595
[GIGGLES]
- THAT WAY.

84
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:56,828
- UNH!

85
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,962
- HUH? HEY, WAIT UP!

86
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:01,895
DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME!

87
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,162
- YOU LEARN QUICKLY, TSUBAKI.

88
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:15,428
- DO YOU MEAN THAT, MASTER?

89
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,462
- YES.

90
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,595
[LAUGHS]

91
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:24,195
- HMM. 60 YEARS HAVE PASSED.

92
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:28,095
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT
MY MASTER HAS DIED.

93
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:29,528
- PRIESTESS TSUBAKI.

94
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,595
- HMM?

95
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,762
SPECIAL CHARMS THAT ARE
UNIQUE TO THIS SHRINE

96
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:36,028
KEEP ANY DEMONS FROM ENTERING.

97
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,528
WHERE COULD THEY BE LOCATED?

98
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:40,328
- LET US TAKE CARE OF THE DEMON,
PRIESTESS TSUBAKI.

99
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:44,328
- EVEN IF WE CANNOT SLAY IT,
WE CAN AT LEAST SLOW IT DOWN.

100
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,462
- ARE YOU CERTAIN?

101
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,795
THE ENEMY IS A TERRIBLE
EVIL DEMON.

102
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,062
- BUT WE HAVE TRAINED
HARD AND LONG, AS WELL.

103
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:54,428
- AND THEREFORE IT IS OUR DUTY
TO FIGHT EVIL DEMONS.

104
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,062
- THEN YOU MUST KEEP
THE DEMONS AT BAY

105
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,495
FOR AS LONG AS
YOU BOTH ARE ABLE.

106
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,362
- OF COURSE!
- OF COURSE!

107
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:08,228
- DO YOU THINK THESE ARE GOING
TO BE ENOUGH, MOMIJI?

108
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,328
- I THINK ALL OF THESE
WILL WORK JUST FINE, BOTAN.

109
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,628
- IT'S OUR VERY
FIRST TIME, THOUGH.

110
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:16,428
- AND THAT'S ALL THE MORE
REASON FOR DOING IT.

111
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:21,262
- YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S ALL PART OF
TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE.

112
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:26,728
- ONWARD!
- TO SLAY THE DEMON!

113
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:47,462
- YOU MUST NEVER
OPEN THESE DOORS.

114
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:52,362
THIS IS THE FORBIDDEN
TOWER OF MANY TREASURES.

115
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,028
- AHH!

116
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,928
FORBIDDEN, IS IT?

117
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:01,095
[WIND BLOWS]

118
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:04,395
IT'S YOU!

119
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,662
- NARAKU SENT ME TO GET
THE SACRED JEWEL BACK.

120
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,328
- THIS JEWEL BELONGS TO ME!

121
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:13,828
- I COULD BE WRONG, BUT DIDN'T
HE PROMISE TO GIVE IT TO YOU

122
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,028
IF YOU FULFILLED HIS WISH?

123
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,695
- I WILL FULFILL HIS WISH.

124
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,195
I'LL KILL BOTH
KAGOME AND INUYASHA.

125
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:23,595
BUT TO DO SO, I REQUIRE
THE SACRED JEWEL.

126
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,395
- HOW WILL YOU KILL THEM?

127
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,728
THEY DEFEATED YOU ONCE ALREADY.

128
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,595
- A GREAT POWER LIES WITHIN...

129
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:34,328
POWER THAT I PLAN TO USE
WITH THIS SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

130
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:37,328
- IT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY HOPEFUL TO ME AT ALL.

131
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,095
SHALL I TELL YOU
SOMETHING INTERESTING?
- WHAT IS IT?

132
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:45,162
- DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE ULTIMATE WAY TO USE
THE SACRED JEWEL?

133
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,995
[GASP]

134
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,962
- OVER THERE.

135
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:53,995
- I GOTCHA.

136
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:54,928
[SNARLING]

137
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,895
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KIRARA?

138
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,528
- DOWN THERE.

139
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:07,362
- HUH? WHAT IS THAT THING?

140
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,462
- A BARRIER.

141
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:12,795
WE PRIESTESSES PUT UP
SUCH PAPER TALISMANS

142
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,395
TO PREVENT DEMONS FROM ENTERING.

143
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,162
- DO YOU THINK THIS
IS TSUBAKI'S DOING?

144
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:18,495
- I SENSE THE SACRED JEWEL
BEYOND THIS BARRIER.

145
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:23,728
- DAMN. I'M GONNA TEAR
THIS STUPID BARRIER APART!

146
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,662
AAH!

147
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,462
OW! WHAT IS THIS?

148
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:32,195
- UH...UH...

149
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:33,628
WHOA!

150
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,028
- THIS IS NO TIME
FOR HORSING AROUND.
- HUH?

151
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,028
- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BARRIER
TO WARD AWAY DEMONS.

152
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:43,562
YOU SHOULD ALL STAND
BACK AND LET KAEDE
AND I DISMANTLE IT.

153
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:44,528
- MM-HMM.

154
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,228
- YOU'VE ARRIVED, DEMON!

155
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,562
WE'VE BEEN WAITING!

156
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:52,462
ARE YOU INUYASHA, THE DEMON
WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY
PRIESTESS TSUBAKI?

157
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:55,328
- WHAT? YOU'RE BOTH
ON TSUBAKI'S SIDE?

158
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,028
- PRIESTESS TSUBAKI
IS A SISTER DISCIPLE.

159
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,662
- OF COURSE WE'RE HER ALLIES!

160
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,362
- SO YOU'RE DARK PRIESTESSES.

161
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,262
I WON'T SPARE YOU EITHER, THEN.

162
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:04,828
- UH! A DARK PRIESTESS?

163
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:06,495
- HOW DARE YOU INSULT US?

164
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,528
- YOU'RE NOT DARK PRIESTESSES?

165
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:10,862
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

166
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,295
I AM MOMIJI.

167
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:13,728
- AND I AM BOTAN.

168
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:17,862
- WE ARE PRIESTESSES
WHO HAVE TRAINED HARD IN
THE ART OF SLAYING DEMONS.

169
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:21,395
- DON'T EVEN MENTION US
IN THE SAME BREATH
AS A DARK PRIESTESS.

170
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:24,962
- THEY DON'T REALLY
LOOK LIKE BAD PEOPLE.

171
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:27,128
- SO THEY'RE NOT
TSUBAKI'S HELPERS?

172
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:30,362
- SLOW DOWN AND HOLD ON
A MINUTE, YOU TWO.

347
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,530
- STUBBORN DEMON.

348
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:34,763
- WE WON'T BE DEFEATED.

349
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:36,230
- YOU THERE!
- HMM?

350
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:38,030
- COMING IN!

351
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:38,997
UNH!

352
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,163
- AAH!
- AAH!

353
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:45,163
- HEY, YOU GUYS,
I CAN MOVE AGAIN!

354

[GRUNTING]

355
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:51,830

WIND SCAR!

358
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,030
- AAH!
- AAH!

359
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:18,330
- SO MUCH FOR THEM.

360
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,897
- NAH, THEY'VE JUST
FAINTED, THAT'S ALL.

361
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,330
FEAR NOT. THEIR LIVES
AREN'T IN DANGER,

362
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,030
AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE HURT.

363
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:28,830
AAH!

364
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:31,530
[SIGH]
- WHAT'LL WE DO WITH THESE TWO?

365
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:34,930
- KAGOME, DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL ATTACK US AGAIN
WHEN THEY COME TO?

366
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:38,130
- TSUBAKI MUST HAVE
EITHER SWEET-TALKED THEM
OR DECEIVED THEM.

367
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:40,563
IN ANY CASE, I THINK
THEY'D UNDERSTAND

368
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,297
IF WE EXPLAINED
OURSELVES TO THEM.

369
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,230
- RIGHT. AND WHO'S GONNA
TAKE ON SUCH A SILLY TASK?

370
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:47,830
- NATURALLY, I WILL
HAVE TO HANDLE THIS.
- HUH?

371
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:50,763
- I WILL TAKE THEM BOTH INTO
CUSTODY AND STAY WITH THEM

372
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:51,863
UNTIL EVERYTHING IS IN THE OPEN.

373
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:55,397
- HEY, SHIPPO, WILL YOU STAY
HERE WITH MIROKU, PLEASE?

374
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,530
- WHO, ME? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH MIROKU?

375
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:01,897
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
KEEP AN EYE ON THE MONK.

376
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,363
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

377
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:08,197
AND IF YOU'RE HERE, IT'LL
BE EASIER TO CONVINCE THEM
THAT YOU'RE NOT EVIL.

378
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,230
- I'LL HAVE TO BE ON MY TOES.

379
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:12,530
- KIRARA, YOU STAY, TOO.

380
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:16,363
- YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.
I'M GOING AFTER TSUBAKI.

381
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,997
- WAIT, INUYASHA!

[GROANING]

384
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,163
- WAIT UNTIL I BRING
DOWN THE BARRIER.

385
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,063
- IT WILL BE OPEN SOON.

386
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:34,430
- WHAT'S INSIDE
THAT TOWER ANYWAY?

387
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,597
- A DEMON.

388
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:40,930
- 100 YEARS AGO, THE HEAD PRIEST
LOST MANY OF HIS MEN,

389
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:45,830
AND IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO
TO SEAL THIS FEARSOME DEMON
IN THIS TOWER.

390
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,297
- YOU MEAN, A TERRIBLE
DEMON IS INSIDE?

391
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,063
- YES, AND EACH GENERATION MAKES
SURE THE DOOR REMAINS SEALED.

392
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:56,697
TSUBAKI, IN TIME,
THIS DUTY WILL BE YOURS.

393
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,930
- I UNDERSTAND, MASTER.

394
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:05,897
- YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THE DOOR
OF THE FORBIDDEN TOWER, TSUBAKI.

395
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,797
- THE DEMON SEALED INSIDE
HAS ENORMOUS POWERS.

396
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,897
- YOU INTEND TO USE THE SACRED
JEWEL TO MAKE HIM OBEY YOU?

397
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,330
- YES, I WILL INDEED.

398
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:30,297
I REFUSE TO GIVE IN YET.

399
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,497
- HEY! I SEE SOMETHING UP AHEAD!

400
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,730
- I SENSE THE SACRED
JEWEL NEARBY.

401
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,030
- DO YOU THINK
TSUBAKI'S IN THERE?

402
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:41,997
- HMPH!

403
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,597
UNH!

[GRUNTING]
WHAT IS THIS?

405
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:49,763
- INUYASHA!

406
00:21:49,797 --> 00:21:53,330
- EVEN THE GATE TO THE SHRINE
HAS A BARRIER.

408
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:58,930

- HE BROKE THROUGH THAT BARRIER?

- SHOW YOURSELF, TSUBAKI!

00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,663

- WHY? WHY DID I LOSE TO KIKYO?

415
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:02,351
- WHAT'S WITH THAT TOWER?

416
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:05,851
IS THAT WHERE TSUBAKI
HAS ESCAPED TO?

417
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:08,518
- WHAT IS IT THAT I AM LACKING?

418
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:09,451
- THAT'S KAGURA.

419
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:12,618
SO NARAKU AND TSUBAKI
ARE WORKING TOGETHER!

420
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,918
- OH, DEMON, IF YOU DESIRE
THE SACRED JEWEL,

421
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:17,918
YOU WILL OBEY ME!

422
