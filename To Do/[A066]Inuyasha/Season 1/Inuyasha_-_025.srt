YOU'VE COME TO BELIEVE

THAT THE SACRED JEWEL
IS ONLY USED FOR EVIL,

108
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:13,648
BUT IT MAY BE USED
FOR GOOD AS WELL.

- UHH! DAMN IT.

113
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,615
- YOU THINK IT'S HOPELESS?

114
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,082
- WELL, I CAN'T FORCE
MY WAY IN,

115
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,615
AND ANY OF THE VILLAGERS
WHO MIGHT HAVE KNOWN

116
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:28,182
HOW TO GET PAST THE BARRIER
ARE NOW GONE.

117
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,382
- NOT ALL OF THEM WERE KILLED.
- WHAT?

118
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,848
- I REMEMBER
THE BEST OF THEIR SLAYERS

119
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:35,148
WERE AT SOME CASTLE
DURING THE ATTACK.

120
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:35,948
- RIGHT.

121
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:37,215
THE DEMONS DECIMATED
THE VILLAGE

122
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,548
BECAUSE IT LACKED
THEIR MOST TALENTED SLAYERS.

123
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:43,448
OTHERWISE, THEIR ATTACK
WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY THWARTED.

124
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,348
- GOT IT.

125
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,448
SO WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHERE THAT CASTLE IS

126
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:47,782
AND SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY SURVIVING SLAYERS

127
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,915
WHO CAN TELL US MORE
ABOUT THE SECRET OF
THE SACRED JEWEL.

128
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:54,082
HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THEM ALSO
KNOWS THE MAGIC TRICK FOR
ENTERING THIS STUPID CAVE.

WAIT UP! I'M COMING!

133
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,582
- UH, MYOGA,
A LITTLE HELP.

134
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:16,548
WHERE EXACTLY
IS THIS CASTLE?

135
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:19,082

WHO'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW.

139
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:26,515
I CAN'T THINK OF EVERYTHING.

140
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,182
- WHY NOT FOLLOW YOUR NOSE,
INUYASHA?

141
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:31,382
THE CASTLE CAN'T BE
TOO FAR AWAY.

142
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,348
YOU'RE A DEMON.

143
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:33,882
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
SNIFF IT OUT FROM HERE.

144
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:38,015
- YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T REALLY GET
A WHIFF OF ANYTHING FROM HERE.

00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,782
- ARE YOU INUYASHA?

149
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,248
I'VE COME TO GAIN MY REVENGE.

150
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,348
- OH, YEAH?
AND WHO ARE YOU?

151
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:03,415
- SANGO.
- IS SHE FROM THE VILLAGE?

152
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,482
- MASTER INUYASHA, TRUST ME.
YOU MUST NOT FIGHT HER.

153
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,148
- HERE IT COMES. YAAH!

154
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,582

WORK ON YOUR TIMING.

[GRUNTING]

156
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,215
- THE TETSUSAIGA
IS BEING PUSHED BACK.

157
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,982
- INUYASHA!

158
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:26,115
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
COMING AFTER ME FOR?

159
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,115
- SILENCE!
I'M HERE TO AVENGE MY PEOPLE!

160
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,548
- UNH!

161
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:32,415
UNH!

162
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,348
MYOGA, WHAT'S SHE
TALKING ABOUT, ANYWAY?

163
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,515
- I HAVEN'T
THE FAINTEST IDEA.

164

BUT HERE IT COMES AGAIN!

165
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:39,482

- WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT HER WEAPON.

167

- I AGREE.
WIND TUNNEL!

168
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,448
I GOT IT!

- MIROKU, LOOK OUT!
IT'S NARAKU'S INSECTS!

170
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,982
YOU'LL BE POISONED
IF YOU SUCK THEM IN!

171
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:56,648
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

172
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,782
- WHAT? NO WAY!

173
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:01,782
NARAKU.

174
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:04,048
- INUYASHA,
SHE WILL DESTROY YOU,

175
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,648
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
ACCEPT YOUR FATE.

LIKE THIS,

180
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:21,348
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU!

181
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,548
- JUST TRY IT!

182
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,148
MAYBE MY DEFENSELESS VILLAGE
WAS QUICK FOR YOU TO SLAUGHTER,

183
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,348
BUT I WON'T DIE SO EASILY.

184
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:30,548
- HEY, THAT SLAYER BELIEVES
INUYASHA ATTACKED HER VILLAGE.

185
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:33,915
- I BET NARAKU LIED TO HER
ABOUT THAT.

186
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,415
- HYAH!

NOW, BEFORE HER WEAPON
RETURNS.

- AAH! MIASMA!

193
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:49,148
- IT'S EASY TO OVERWHELM
THE DELICATE SENSES

194
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,082
OF A DOG-EARED MONGREL
LIKE YOU.

195
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,082
- I CAN'T GET CLOSE.

196
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:55,882
- HA! THE SLAYER WILL
FINISH HIM OFF IN NO TIME.

197
00:10:55,915 --> 00:11:00,482
WELL, WELL,
IF IT ISN'T THE HOLY MONK.

198
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,415
- NARAKU, PREPARE TO DIE.

199
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,515
- MY APOLOGIES
FOR NOT OBLIGING YOU,

200
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,815
BUT ALL I SHALL PREPARE TO DO IS
GATHER THE JEWEL SHARDS.

- THIS SHARD
IS NOT FOR THE LIKES OF YOU.

210
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:44,282
NOW THAT I POSSESS IT,
THERE'S NO REASON TO LINGER.

211
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,015
- NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT,
NARAKU!

212
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,748
- I BID YOU FAREWELL.

213
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:52,148

- PREPARE TO FIGHT, INUYASHA,
OR DIE ON THE SPOT.

00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,115
- LISTEN,
WHY DON'T YOU BACK OFF?

230
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,315
I'M NOT INTERESTED!

231
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,782
- I HAVE TO GET HIM NOW

232
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:43,915
WHILE I STILL HAVE
SOME LIFE LEFT IN ME.

233
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,582
HYAH!

- WILL YOU CUT IT OUT?!

235
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:53,048
- NO!

236
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,848
- NOT SO TOUGH NOW,
ARE YOU?

237
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,882
- POISON POWDER!

238
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,315

WHAT'S HE DOING?

241
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,815
HE--HE'S NOT TRYING
TO SAVE ME, IS HE?

242
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,782
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

243
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:13,748

HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED THAT MAYBE
NARAKU HAS BEEN TRICKING YOU?

248

GIVE IT UP!

00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,348
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT STARTED,
AND YOU'RE COVERED IN BLOOD.

I LOST SO MUCH BLOOD.

- KOHAKU, ARE YOU AFRAID OF
BECOMING A SLAYER?

256
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:58,348
- N-NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I'M NOT AFRAID.

AND ALL OF THE OTHERS, TOO.

- IS SHE DEAD?

272
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,415
- I THINK SHE JUST FAINTED.

273
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,082
SHE HAS A SACRED JEWEL SHARD
EMBEDDED IN HER BACK.

274
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,615
I CAN SEE IT.

275
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,648
- NO WONDER.

276
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,015
I COULD TELL FROM THE START
SHE WAS BADLY INJURED

277
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,248
FROM THE SMELL OF HER BLOOD.

278
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:49,782
NARAKU MUST HAVE USED
THE SACRED JEWEL

279
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:54,248
TO MANIPULATE HER INTO
FIGHTING ME TO THE DEATH.

00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:10,415
WE'RE GOING AFTER NARAKU BECAUSE
HE STOLE A JEWEL SHARD FROM US.

YOU WERE LOSING TO
A WOUNDED SLAYER.

336
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,832
- SHUT UP!

337
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,066
ADMIT IT, NARAKU.

338
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,866
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TURNED THAT
PACK OF DEMONS ONTO THE VILLAGE

339
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,099
AND ANNIHILATED EVERYONE!

340
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,032
- ALL I DID WAS MENTION
TO THE DEMONS

341
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,966
THAT THE VILLAGE GUARD HAPPENED
TO BE THIN THAT DAY.

342
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,466
- HUH? IT WAS HIM!

343
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,599
- YOU WERE AFTER
THE JEWEL SHARDS

344
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:53,932
IN THE VILLAGE,
WEREN'T YOU?

345
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,366
- YOU'RE NOT AS SLOW
AS YOU LOOK, MONK.

00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:00,899
THE VILLAGERS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN PREPARED TO DEFEND
