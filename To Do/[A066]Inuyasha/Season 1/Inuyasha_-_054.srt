181
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,844
STABBED IN THE HEART,

182
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,177
AND HE ACTS
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

183
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,877
- RYUKOTSUSEI WAS A HANDFUL
EVEN FOR INUYASHA'S FATHER,
REMEMBER?

184
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,777
HE WON'T DIE UNLESS
HE'S HACKED INTO PIECES.

185
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,744
- OH, NO!

186
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:28,910
- NOW IT'S MY TURN!

187
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:30,544
UNH!

188
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:32,310
AAH!

189
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:35,844
- [LAUGHING]

190
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:39,710
- DAMN! HIS BODY'S HARD AS ROCK.

191
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,710
- I WARNED YOU ONCE BEFORE.

192
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,710
THAT TOY SWORD IS USELESS.

193
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,677
- HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON?

194
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,210
THE SCENT OF THE WINDSCAR.

195
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,710
THE WINDSCAR IS TWISTING
AROUND THE TETSUSAIGA.

196
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,410
HUH?

197
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:09,344
- YOU'RE THROUGH, LITTLE MAN.

198
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:10,244
- HUH!

199
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:11,944
RYUKOTSUSEI, YOU'RE IN
FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

200
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:15,177
BECAUSE THINGS ARE
GONNA BE DIFFERENT NOW.

201
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:17,477
HUH!

202
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,044
WINDSCAR!

203
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,510
- [SCREAMING]

204
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,644
- LOOK. THE WINDSCAR.

205
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:33,810
- AMAZING.

206
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:34,877
- INUYASHA!

207
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,777
- DID HE BEAT HIM?

208
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:50,977
- NOT ONLY DID IT GET LIGHTER,

209
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,310
BUT NOW I CAN INVOKE
THE WINDSCAR ANYTIME I WANT.

210
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,644
DID YOU SEE THIS, TOTOSAI?
I WASTED THAT DEMON.

211
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,377
- WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CREDIT YOU DESERVE,

212
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,977
BUT IT'S TOO EARLY
TO REST ON YOUR LAURELS.

213
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,177
- HUH?

214
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,510
- HUH?

215
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:13,077
[RUMBLING]

216
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,744
- HUH?

217
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:30,310
- IS THAT YOUR BEST?

218
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:33,344
YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

219
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,444
- HUH?

220
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:37,910
- DID YOU THINK THAT DISMAL
ATTEMPT WOULD DESTROY ME?

221
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,177
- WHAT'S WITH HIM, ANYWAY?

222
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,777
- HE WAS HIT WITH THE WINDSCAR,
AND IT DIDN'T AFFECT HIM AT ALL.

223
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,744
- YUP. DON'T SAY
I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

224
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,010
- I TOLD YOU,

225
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:50,810
MY BODY IS MUCH HARDER
THAN ARMOR.

226
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,910
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

227
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:55,910
- UH-OH.

228
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:58,110
INUYASHA, YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

229
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,510
HE'S SERIOUS!

230
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:01,410
- SO AM I.

231
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,444
HUH?

232
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,044
WHAT'S WITH THAT DEMONIC AURA?

233
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,810
- DON'T JUST
STAND THERE TALKING!

234
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,310
HURRY UP AND RUN!

235
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,277
- NO CHANCE.

236
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,610
I'M CONFIDENT I CAN
FINISH HIM OFF THIS TIME.

237
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:19,177
- JUST BE GLAD YOU CAN
WIELD THE TETSUSAIGA NOW.

238
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,010
LEAVE WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD!

239
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:21,877
- TOTOSAI'S RIGHT.

240
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,910
- YOU PEOPLE JUST
DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

241
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:27,244
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT.

242
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,110
AND BESIDES,
IF I KILL THIS THING,

243
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:44,410
I'LL SURPASS
MY OLD MAN IN POWER.

244
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,877
UNH!

245
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:47,944
- SPEAKING OF WHOM,

246
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:50,577
WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND JOIN HIM IN HELL.

247
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,444
- IT'S HUGE!

248
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:53,344
- WE'LL ALL GET
CAUGHT UP IN THE BLAST.

249
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,544
KIRARA, MOVE AWAY.

250
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,177
- [YELLS]

251
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:11,310
- HUH? I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH
A HUGE BLAST OF DEMONIC ENERGY.

252
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,044
- GET OUT OF THERE!

253
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:14,710
- THE FOOL!

254
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:18,810
IN ORDER TO DESTROY
RYUKOTSUSEI'S ROCK-HARD BODY,

255
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,044
INUYASHA MUST SUMMON
THE BACKLASH WAVE.

256
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:24,177
HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

257
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,277
- I CAN'T AVOID IT!

258
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,044
- [LAUGHING]

259
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,844
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME NOW.

260
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:31,477
- THAT LEAVES ONE CHOICE.

261
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,677
I'VE GOT TO CUT THROUGH IT!

262
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,710
AAH!

263
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:56,084
- I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH
A HUGE BLAST OF DEMONIC ENERGY.

264
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,484
- [LAUGHING]

265
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,284
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME NOW.

266
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,917
- THAT LEAVES ONE CHOICE.

267
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,184
I'VE GOTTA CUT THROUGH IT.

268
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,084
AAH!

269
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,984
- LOOK! WHAT IS THAT?

270
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,851
- HMM? IT CAN'T BE.

271
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,284
- [GASPS]

272
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:23,617
- INCREDIBLE.
THAT'S THE BACKLASH WAVE.

273
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,417
- I SEE IT.

274
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:30,384
I NEED TO CUT THROUGH
THAT SMOLDERING SPOT
WITH THE WINDSCAR.

275
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,351
RIGHT ABOUT HERE!

276
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:44,517
- WHAT?

277
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:48,051
HIS SWORD HAS TAKEN CONTROL
OF MY ENERGY BLAST.

278
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:01,651
IMPOSSIBLE!

279
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:03,951
THIS CANNOT BE!

280
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:12,751
- AHH!

281
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,751
- THE WHIRLPOOL
AT THE TETSUSAIGA'S AURA

282
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,317
IS PUSHING BACK
RYUKOTSUSEI'S ENERGY BLAST.

283
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:30,151
- THIS CAN'T BE!

284
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,784
AAH!

285
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:35,784
AAH! MY BODY!

286
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:39,984
HE SLASHED MY INVINCIBLE,
ROCK-HARD BODY!

287
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:02,284
- WHAT HAPPENED?

288
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:06,284
THAT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHER WINDSCARS.

289
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:09,417
- INUYASHA!

290
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:10,584
- HUH? KAGOME.

291
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,084
- INUYASHA!

292
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,084
YOU DID IT!

293
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:17,684
THERE'S HIDE NOR HAIR
LEFT OF THAT RYUKOTSUSEI!

294
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,351
- OH! THAT WAS SO AWESOME!

295
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,517
HOW IN THE WORLD
WERE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT?

296
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:25,784
- UH, WHO, ME?

297
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:28,051
- VERY IMPRESSIVE,
MASTER INUYASHA.

298
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:32,284
I KNEW FROM THE START YOU HAD
THE STRENGTH TO DEFEAT HIM.

299
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:35,951
- WE HAD TO PRACTICALLY
DRAG HIM BACK HERE.

300
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,051
- HMM.

301
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:39,617
- I UNDERSTAND NOW, TOTOSAI.

302
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:40,951
- HMM?

303
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:43,851
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MORE GENEROUS
THAN I GAVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

304
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,217
[LAUGHS]

305
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,717
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THE TETSUSAIGA, ANYWAY?

306
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,084
IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE.

307
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,351
- WAIT A MINUTE.

308
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:54,951
YOU USED THE TECHNIQUE
WITHOUT REALIZING?

309
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:55,817
- HUH?

310
00:19:55,851 --> 00:20:00,351
- THE TETSUSAIGA'S
ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE:

311
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,584
THE BACKLASH WAVE.

312
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,817
- THE BACKLASH WAVE? HUH?

313
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,684
- HUH?

314
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,551
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
WAS THE BACKLASH WAVE?

315
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,651
- PRECISELY. LET ME EXPLAIN.

316
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,951
IT USES THE ENEMY'S
BLAST OF DEMONIC ENERGY,

317
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:16,584
ENSNARING IT WITH THE WINDSCAR
AND REVERSING THE FLOW.

318
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,684
- SO IT ENSNARES
THE ENEMY'S ENERGY

319
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,784
AND SENDS IT BACK AT THEM?

320
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,751
- THE WINDSCAR
AND THE DEMON'S ENERGY BLAST

321
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,584
BECOME LIKE WHIRLPOOLS.

322
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:28,584
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ENEMY
IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BLASTED

323
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:33,017
BY THE WINDSCAR
AND BY HIS OWN DEMONIC AURA.

324
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,551
ANYWAY, THAT'S THE THEORY.

325
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:36,917
- HUH?

326
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:37,951
- THE TRICK IS HOW TO DISCERN

327
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,651
PRECISELY WHERE TO CUT THROUGH
THE BLAST OF ENERGY,

328
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:44,917
AND HIS AURA MUST BE
MUCH STRONGER THAN HIS ENEMY'S

329
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,884
FOR THE TECHNIQUE TO SUCCEED.

330
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,917
- I'M SO IMPRESSED, INUYASHA.

331
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,551
- WHY? ALL I DID BACK THERE

332
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,784
WAS USE MY INSTINCTS
AND FOLLOW MY NOSE.

333
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:54,651
- HMM.

334
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:56,184
HE'S SURPASSED MERE THEORY.

335
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:59,884
PERHAPS HE'S DESTINED
FOR GREATER THINGS
THAN I IMAGINED.

336
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:03,051
- INUYASHA, NOW IT APPEARS
IT WON'T BE SO HARD FOR YOU

337
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,117
TO WIELD THE TETSUSAIGA
IN BATTLE.

338
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,251
- IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THAT.

339
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:10,084
HA HA! WATCH THIS!

340
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:12,684
HERE GOES NOTHING!

341
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,317
AAH!

342
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,317
- THE WINDSCAR.

343
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,217
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

344
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:26,984
I CAN INVOKE THE WINDSCAR
ANYTIME I WANT.

345
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,417
UNH!

346
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,784
AH!

347
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:35,584
[LAUGHTER]

348
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,817
- AAH! NO!

349
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:39,551
- HEY, WE GET
YOUR POINT ALREADY.

350
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,451
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING
YOU WANT TO BE FLINGING AROUND

351
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,317
LIKE SOME KIND OF TOY.

352
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,451
- HA HA!

353
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,751
THERE'S NO ONE
WHO CAN BEAT ME NOW.

354
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:50,217
I DARE ANYONE TO STOP ME.

355
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:51,817
- INUYASHA.

356
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,251
- HUH?

00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:55,384
- UNH!

359
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,584
- ONE VICTORY,
AND HE THINKS HE'S INVINCIBLE.

360
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,051
- I'LL SAY. SUCH A SIMPLETON.

361
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,217
- NOT TO MENTION A SHOW-OFF.

362
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,951
- [GROANS]

363
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,651
KAGOME HAD TO SAY IT.

364
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:14,717
- WELL, HE'S STILL
A RUFFIAN, ALL RIGHT.

365
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,817
LET'S GO.

366
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,417
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

367
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,999
- A GIRL NAMED SATSUKI
HOLDS A LONE VIGIL

368
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,466
FOR HER WAR-BOUND BROTHER.

369
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,733
SHE POSSESSES A FRAGMENT
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

370
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:08,233
AND USES IT AS A CHARM.

371
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:12,033
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL,
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM HER.

372
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:15,566
POOR SHIPPO.
HAS HE FALLEN FOR SATSUKI?

373
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,799
BEFORE WE HAVE TIME
TO FIGURE IT OUT,

374
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,033
A DEMON LAYS A CRUEL TRAP

375
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,466
IN ORDER TO GET
THE FRAGMENT FROM HER.

376
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:25,233
NEXT TIME...

377
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,266
SEE YOU SOON.
