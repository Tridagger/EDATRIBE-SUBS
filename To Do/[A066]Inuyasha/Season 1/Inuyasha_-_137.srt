1
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:45,224
THE SACRED JEWEL; SAID TO

2
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:47,857
GRANT ONE'S EVERY WISH.

3
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,857
IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR THE

4
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,390
SHARDS OF THE SHATTERED JEWEL,

5
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,824
I BEGAN CROSSING BETWEEN THE

6
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,557
PRESENT AND THE FEUDAL ERA

7
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:54,524
THROUGH THE HIDDEN WELL IN MY

8
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:57,890
FAMILY'S SHRINE.

9
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,424
WHENEVER I CAN, I RETURN TO THE

10
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,024
PRESENT TO ATTEND CLASSES LIKE

11
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,190
ANY NORMAL JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT.

12
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,257
I'VE GOT TO STUDY AND TRY TO GET

13
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,257
THROUGH MY TESTS, AFTER ALL.

14
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:09,790
NONE OF MY SCHOOL FRIENDS KNOW

15
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,390
ABOUT MY DOUBLE LIFE.

16
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,657
THEN AGAIN, I KIND OF DOUBT

17
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:13,657
THEY'D BELIEVE ME EVEN IF

18
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:22,824
I TOLD THEM.

19
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,057
OH, NO.

20
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,190
I DON'T GET THIS.

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,790
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

22
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,190
[SIGHS]

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,890
>> ALL RIGHT.

24
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,490
TIME'S UP.

25
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,757
>> WHAT A DISASTER.

26
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:39,924
I WAS SO CONFIDENT ABOUT MY

27
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,790
HISTORY TEST--ESPECIALLY SINCE

28
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,824
IT WAS ON THE FEUDAL ERA.

29
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,657
WHAT A SHOCKER.

30
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,057
>> COME ON, CHEER UP, WILL YOU,

31
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:49,624
KAGOME?

32
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:51,157
>> REALLY, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

33
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,857
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY SO MUCH LATELY.

34
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:55,390
>> OH, I'LL HAVE TO RETAKE IT.

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,190
>> WANT ME TO TAKE THE MAKEUP

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,957
TEST WITH YOU, KAGOME?

37
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,757
>> HI THERE, KAGOME.

38
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,090
YOU MADE IT TO SCHOOL TODAY.

39
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,757
SO, ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER?

40
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,557
>> OH, HEY THERE, HOJO.

41
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:05,990
>> HEY, KAGOME, YOU WON'T

42
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,424
BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND.

43
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:09,324
>> HUH?

44
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,124
WHAT'S THIS?

45
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,357
>> IT'S A SCROLL OF THE HOJO

46
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,390
FAMILY TREE.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,257
>> IT'S LONG.

48
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,057
>> AND...HERE.

49
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,024
LOOK AT THE WIFE'S NAME OF MY

50
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,190
ANCESTOR AKITOKI HOJO, WHO

51
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,657
LIVED 500 YEARS AGO DURING

52
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,857
THE FEUDAL ERA.

53
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,590
>> HIS WIFE?

54
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,490
FOR REAL?

55
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,424
>> SEE?

56
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,090
>> IT SAYS KAGOME.

57
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,824
NO WAY, THAT CAN'T BE.

58
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:30,290
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

59
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,190
>> HE'S RIGHT.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,778
THAT'S MY NAME ON THE HOJO

61
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:41,845
FAMILY TREE.

62
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:42,611
>> WOW.

63
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,545
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ONE OF

64
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,411
HOJO'S ANCESTOR'S IS ACTUALLY

65
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,411
NAMED KAGOME HOJO.

66
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,611
>> IF KAGOME BREAKS UP WITH THAT

67
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,011
NO-GOOD BOYFRIEND OF HERS AND

68
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,511
HOOKS UP WITH HOJO, HER NAME

69
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,811
WOULD BE KAGOME HOJO, TOO!

70
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:54,611
>> MAYBE THAT'S NOT JUST

71
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,445
A FAMILY TREE,

72
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,145
BUT A FORTUNE-TELLING SCROLL.

73
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,178
>> I BET HOJO'S THINKING

74
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,011
THE SAME THING HIMSELF.

75
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,078
>> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

76
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,611
IT, KAGOME?

77
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:03,645
>> OH, WELL.

78
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,545
I BETTER BRUSH UP ON HISTORY

79
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,611
AGAIN.

80
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,878
>> GUESS SHE'S NOT IN THE MOOD

81
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:07,911
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

82
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,345
>> OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

83
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,345
I BROUGHT THE PICTURES I TOOK

84
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:12,111
AT THE CULTURAL FESTIVAL.

85
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:12,878
>> HUH?

86
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,845
PICTURES?

87
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:14,745
>> SEE?

88
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,578
>> WOW, NICE SHOTS.

89
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:17,711
>> YOU SAID IT.

90
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,111
KAGOME LOOKS GREAT.

91
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,545
>> OH, NO.

92
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,611
THAT'S A REAL DEMON IN THE

93
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:28,278
PICTURE!

94
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:29,311
>> HEY, MISTER, DROP YOUR

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,211
BELONGINGS AND GET OUT OF HERE.

96
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,511
>> HUH?

97
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,845
>> DO IT FAST BEFORE YOU WIND UP

98
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:35,811
GETTING HURT.

99
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:36,811
>> HAND OVER YOUR MONEY AND YOUR

100
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,145
VALUABLES.

101
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,111
>> YOU'LL NEVER MAKE FRIENDS

102
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,445
WITH THAT ATTITUDE.

103
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,911
YOU SOUND EXACTLY LIKE BANDITS

104
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:44,078
BOSSING ME AROUND.

105
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,045
>> THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE

106
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:46,411
BANDITS, YOU IDIOT!

107
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,645
>> STOP ACTING SO DENSE AND HAND

108
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,245
OVER THE MONEY!

109
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:50,611
>> AH--

110
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:51,545
>> WHAT, GOT YOURSELF INTO

111
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:52,511
TROUBLE AGAIN?

112
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,411
>> WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK

113
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,445
YOU ARE?

114
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,645
UGH!

115
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:58,011
UGH!

116
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,145
>> WAIT, I KNOW YOU.

117
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,045
>> HEY, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD,

118
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,178
AKITOKI.

119
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,311
>> MY OLD FRIENDS, SHIPPO

120
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,645
AND INUYASHA!

121
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:05,678
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY

122
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,111
RESCUE.

123
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,811
>> OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

124
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:10,945
HAVE SOME.

125
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,211
>> PICKLED PLUMS?

126
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,111
>> TRY ONE.

127
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,011
I HEAR THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOUR

128
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:14,845
HEALTH.

129
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:15,845
>> SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WAY

130
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,478
OUT HERE, ANYWAY?

131
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:18,378
>> OH, RIGHT.

132
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,311
IT'S A LONG STORY, SO I'LL

133
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,745
EXPLAIN IT LATER.

134
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:22,078
FIRST I NEED TO ASK SOMETHING

135
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:24,545
OF THE PRIESTESS KAEDE.

136
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:25,845
>> WHAT, OLD KAEDE?

137
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:26,611
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO TALK

138
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,045
TO HER?

139
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,545
>> OH.

140
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:31,578
SO YOU'RE ON SOME KIND OF

141
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,811
MISSION THEN, ARE YOU, AKITOKI?

142
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:34,811
>> I AM.

143
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,878
IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED

144
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,145
KENKON, THE NAGINATA OF HEAVEN

145
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,311
AND EARTH.

146
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,278
THE NAGINATA IS A DEMONIC WEAPON

147
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,578
WHICH HAS A BLADE AFFIXED

148
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:44,145
TO EITHER END.

149
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,711
>> A DEMONIC WEAPON?

150
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,111
>> RECENTLY, THE HOJO FAMILY HAS

151
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,078
BEEN PLAGUED WITH TERRIBLE

152
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,711
MISFORTUNE, AND THE SOURCE OF

153
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:51,611
THIS MISFORTUNE IS SUPPOSEDLY

154
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,045
THE BLADE, NAGINATA OF HEAVEN

155
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:55,145
AND EARTH.

156
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,045
>> HMM.

157
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,611
INCREDIBLE.

158
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,311
>> A DEMONIC AURA.

159
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:03,311
>> HOW OMINOUS.

160
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,378
>> LOOK AT INUYASHA.

161
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,311
PUT IT AWAY.

162
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,145
>> YES, UH, OF COURSE.

163
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,478
>> INUYASHA--

164
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,611
>> HEY, SNAP OUT OF IT!

165
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,611
WAKE UP!

166
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,611
>> HUH?

167
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:15,178
WHAT HAPPENED?

168
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,045
>> THE SWORD WAS STARTING TO

169
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,611
POSSESS YOU.

170
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,811
>> WE WERE TOLD AN EXORCISM WAS

171
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,178
NECESSARY TO DISPERSE THE

172
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:21,811
DEMONIC AURA FROM AROUND THIS

173
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,611
WEAPON, BUT AS YOU WITNESSED,

174
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:24,678
THE POWER OF THE BLADE IS

175
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,311
TOO STRONG.

176
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:28,145
SO, IT WAS DECIDED THAT SOMEONE

177
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,745
SHOULD JOURNEY TO MOUNT HAKUREI

178
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,478
TO PURIFY IT, AND I WAS THE ONE

179
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,811
WHO WAS CHOSEN TO DO SO.

180
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,645
>> BUT THAT MOUNTAIN ISN'T THERE

181
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,645
ANYMORE.

182
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,145
>> I KNOW.

183
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,045
NOT LONG AGO, A NATURAL DISASTER

184
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,811
CAUSED THE MOUNTAIN TO COLLAPSE,

185
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:41,978
LEAVING NOT A TRACE OF ITS

186
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,878
FORMER GLORY OR ITS POWERS OF

187
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,445
PURIFICATION.

188
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,645
>> HMM.

189
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:47,778
>> IF THE BLADE CANNOT BE

190
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,611

LOOK AT HER.

378
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:06,445
KAGOME'S SMILE IS SO ADORABLE.

379
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:10,511
>> HOJO'S ANCESTOR, HUH?

380
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,078
THE NAME KAGOME WAS LISTED ON

381
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,611
THE FAMILY TREE SCROLL

382
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:15,578
HOJO SHOWED ME AT SCHOOL.

383
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:16,811
WHAT IF...

384
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:17,978
WHAT IF I COULDN'T RETURN TO THE

385
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:20,145
MODERN AGE AND ENDED UP MARRYING

386
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:21,978
THIS HOJO?

387
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:27,078
NAH.

388
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:29,311
>> HMM, LOOK, MIROKU, A RIVER.

389
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,078
>> HUH?

390
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,011
THAT MUST BE THE RIVER LADY

391
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,557
KAEDE TOLD US ABOUT THAT FLOWS

392
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:38,824
EAST OF THE MOUNTAIN.

393
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,324
>> HEY, AKITOKI, WHY DIDN'T YOU

394
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,591
JUST THROW AWAY THE BLADE OR

395
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,424
LOSE IT SOMEHOW?

396
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:44,757
>> IF I DID THAT, THEN ANOTHER

397
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,924
FAMILY WOULD SUFFER MISFORTUNE.

398
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,757
I MUST HAVE IT PURIFIED.

399
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:51,057
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

400
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:52,557
OOH.

401
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,891
>> YOU KNOW, HOJO, YOU'RE BRAVER

402
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,457
THAN I WOULD'VE FIGURED.

403
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:56,424
>> OH?

404
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:59,757
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

405
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:00,791
>> HOW COULD YOU BE SO MEAN,

406
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,957
INUYASHA?

407
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:02,724
>> THE GUY'S A WIMP.

408
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,691
HE SHOULD STOP ACTING SO BRAVE.

409
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,024
>> NOW YOU'RE REALLY BEING MEAN.

410
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,024
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

411
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:13,157
>> MORE OR LESS.

412
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:27,891
>> THEY'RE FINALLY COMING.

413
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,257
>> HUH?

414
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:30,757
A TEA HOUSE.

415
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,157
MIROKU, THERE'S A TEA HOUSE UP

416
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:33,391
AHEAD.

417
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,391
>> THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.

418
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,857
I COULD CERTAINLY USE A REST.

419
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,524
>> UGH.

[GROANING]

421
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:42,957

422
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:43,824
>> OH, NO.

423
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,591
LOOK AT MY SANDALS.

424
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,057
THEY'RE BOTH BROKEN.

OH, THIS ACCURSED BLADE BRINGS

427
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,057

WE'RE TAKING A BREAK ALREADY?

430
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:57,524
YOU HUMANS ARE SUCH A PAIN

431
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:58,924
TO BE WITH.

432
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,457
>> COME, COME, INUYASHA.

433
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,491
YOU CAN'T JUDGE US AGAINST YOUR

THESE SWEET DUMPLINGS ARE

440
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:09,724
DELICIOUS.

441
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,824
>> TEA, YOUNG MAN?

442
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:13,757

>> KAGOME, WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT?

453
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,491
>> A COLD COMPRESS.

454
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:35,591
IT'S THE PERFECT THING FOR

455
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,224
COOLING DOWN A BURN.

456
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,257

OF ACCIDENTS.

490
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,824
