00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:52,955
DESCENDED FROM THE NORTHERN

191
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,388
MOUNTAINS, AS DID THE DEMONS

192
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,821
THAT ATTACKED US.

193
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,455
>> YOU FLED FROM YOUR LAND?

194
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,555
>> FLED FROM WHAT?

195
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:01,988
>> FROM A SPECTER.

196
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,588
>> SPECTER?

197
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,155
>> IT CAME FROM FAR BEYOND OUR

198
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,888
NORTHERN BORDER.

199
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,521
IT IS NEITHER A DEMON NOR A

200
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:11,764
HUMAN, YET ITS BODY REEKED OF

201
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:17,930
DEAD MEN AND GRAVEYARD SOIL.

202
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,264
AND IT STARTED TO EAT THE DEMONS

203
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:36,564
CLOSE BY.

204
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,230
>> WHAT DO WE DO NOW, KOGA?

205
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,097
>> I'M GOING.

206
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:39,864
>> WHERE?

207
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:40,764
>> TO FIND THE SPECTER THAT HE

208
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:41,764
SPOKE OF?

209
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:42,530
>> WE'RE ALREADY PRETTY BUSY

210
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,064
SEARCHING FOR NARAKU.

211
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,130
>> THIS SPECTER HAS NOTHING TO

212
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,197
DO WITH US.

213
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,230
>> WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT OUR

214
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,764
BRETHREN WERE SLAUGHTERED.

215
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:50,897
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS SEE WHAT

216
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:52,530
THIS IS ABOUT.

217
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,897
BESIDES, THE MUTT'S HEADED THIS

218
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,097
WAY, SO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING

219
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,097
TO IT.

220
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,064
>> INUYASHA?

221
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,130
>> I'D KNOW THE STENCH OF THAT

222
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,030
MANGY MUTT ANYWHERE.

223
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,330
I AIN'T GONNA STAND AROUND AND

224
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,864
BE UPSTAGED BY HIM.

225
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,097
LET'S GO.

226
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:10,464
>> WAIT UP, KOGA!

227
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:11,997
>> IT SMELLS OF WOLVES HERE.

228
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,397
>> IT DOES?

229
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:14,830
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE WOLF AROUND

230
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,264
WITH THIS DISTINCT SMELL.

231
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:17,630
IT HAS TO BE KOGA.

232
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,764
>> IF YOUR SENSES ARE CORRECT

233
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,030
AND IT IS INDEED HIM, THEN HE

234
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,464
MUST BE HEADED FOR THE NORTHEAST

235
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:22,830
JUST AS WE ARE.

236
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,897
>> I WONDER IF HE'S COME ACROSS

237
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,497
SOME KIND OF CLUE.

238
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:28,064
>> DID SOMEONE MENTION KOGA?

239
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,564
>> THAT VOICE IS FAMILIAR.

240
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:34,164
>> UH!

241
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:37,264
WHOA!

242
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:40,164
>> YOU AGAIN.

243
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,230
>> AYAME, IT'S YOU!

244
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,497
>> AYAME?

245
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:44,764
>> INDEED.

246
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:46,364
>> SHE'S THE WOLF DEMON GIRL

247
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,397
FROM KOGA'S TRIBE WHO WAS

248
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,364
JEALOUS OF YOU, KAGOME.

249
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:50,864
>> UH, HERE.

250
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:52,164
>> THANK YOU.

251
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:53,064
I THOUGHT YOU WENT BACK TO THE

252
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:54,797
NORTHERN MOUNTAINS.

253
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,497
>> I DID, BUT--

254
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:57,830
>> BUT WHAT?

255
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,897
>> WE FLED WHEN THE BEAST CAME

256
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:00,197
AFTER US.

257
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:01,330
>> BEAST?

258
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,964
>> A BEAST WHO DEVOURS DEMONS.

259
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,797
>> I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF

260
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:13,964
THAT.

261
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,364
>> MASTER, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

262
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:16,597
WE MUST REACH THE MOUNTAINS, OR

263
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:17,797
WE'LL BE FORCED TO SLEEP OUT IN

264
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,630
THE OPEN.

265
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,764
SHOULDN'T WE TURN BACK TOWARD

266
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,297
THE VILLAGE AND FIND AN INN?

267
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,730
>> OH, DON'T BE SUCH A COWARD.

268
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,430
COME.

269

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,730
I SHALL SUPPRESS ANY DEMON WITH

>> A SPECTER?

287
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,797
>> THAT'S RIGHT, AND IT DOESN'T

APPEAR TO BE EITHER DEMON OR

289
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,564

OF OUR OWN TERRITORY.

300

DEVOURED.
