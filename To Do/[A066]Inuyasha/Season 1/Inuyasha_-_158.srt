CASTLE, WHERE WERE YOU SUPPOSED

64
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:57,974

REMOVE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

76
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,008

00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:34,974
WANTS TO BETRAY NARAKU, BUT...

83
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,674

SLAVE, I'LL EVENTUALLY COME

92
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:59,908
ACROSS THAT INFANT AGAIN.

93
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,341

LAST SAW HER.

AGAIN.

118
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,751
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVEN'T REGAINED

119

HAVE GONE WITH INUYASHA?

125
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,451

YOU'D THINK HE'D KNOW BETTER

133
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:45,018
THAN TO KEEP RUNNING OFF ALL THE

134
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:46,751
TIME AFTER A GIRL WHO'S LONG

135
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,018

TRUTH, KAGOME?

149
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,051
QUIT BEING SO STUPID!

150
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,384

TO YOU, JUST MAKE SURE THAT

183
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,651
KIKYO CANNOT STAY IN HIDING.

184
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:27,151

378
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,838
>> HUH? KIKYO.

379
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:52,004
>> [THINKING] HE'S RIGHT.

380
00:15:52,004 --> 00:16:00,438

381
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,604
>> LADY KIKYO.

382
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:08,538
KOCHO HAS RETURNED.

383
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,504
>> HERE, LADY KIKYO, I BROUGHT

384
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,671
IT FOR YOU.

385
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,604
THE BRANCH OF OGATAMA THAT YOU

386
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,804
ASKED ME TO FIND.

387
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,238
>> GOOD.

388
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,438
ASKA, KOCHO, IT IS TIME TO

389
00:16:19,438 --> 00:17:16,371
LEAVE.

390
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,838
>> WHAT IS THIS?

391
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,038
>> LOOKS LIKE THE SCATTERED

392
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,371
HORDES OF RATS ARE BEGINNING TO

393
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:22,771
GATHER.

394
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,171
>> THEY SEEM TO BE HEADED FOR

395
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,571

396
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,304
>> YES, THEY'RE FORMING ONE

397
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:30,871

398
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,538
>> THIS CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

399
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:34,338
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE HAS CAST A

400
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,638
MAYOSE.

401
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,671
>> MAYOSE?

402
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,904
>> IT'S A SPELL THAT LURES

403
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,104
DEMONS TOGETHER AND DESTROYS

404
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,238
THEM.

405
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:41,738
BUT ONLY ONE WITH IMMENSE

406
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,238
SPIRITUAL POWER CAN CAST SUCH A

407
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:44,738
SPELL.

408
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:45,771
[THINKING] THE ONLY ONE CAPABLE

409
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:48,004
OF THIS IS KIKYO.

410
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,238
SO, THEN KIKYO IS AT THE END OF

411
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:51,204
THIS FLOW OF RATS.

412
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,838
>> OK, INUYASHA, LET'S GET

413
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,804
GOING.

414
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:54,871
>> HUH? KAGOME?

415
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,771
>> I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND THE

416
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,871
SOURCE OF WHERE THE RATS ARE

417
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:57,904
COMING FROM.

418
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:58,838
>> ARE YOU SURE?

419
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,371
>> SOMEONE HAS TO.

420
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,538
THE RATS JUST KEEP ON COMING AND

421
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,104
THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.

422
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,604
WHICH MEANS THAT THE SHRINE IS

423
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:07,371
STILL RELEASING RATS.

424
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:08,871
>> SO, WE MUST STOP THE SOURCE

425
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,671
OR IT WILL NOT END.

426
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,504
LET'S SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS.

427
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:16,971
I'LL GO ALONG WITH SANGO.

428
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,638
>> HUH?

429
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:23,471
KIKYO HAS FINALLY MADE HER MOVE.

430
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:26,004
KOHAKU, I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE.

431
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,771
GUARD THE SHRINE CLOSELY.

432
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:31,338
AND DON'T CLOSE THE DOORS.

433
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:38,438
>> YES.

434
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,071
>> HEY, KAGOME, IF KIKYO IS

435
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:41,671
REALLY UP AHEAD, YOU THINK THAT

436
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,638

437
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,138
>> HUH?

[THINKING] PROBABLY.

439
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,304

440
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:48,704

443
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,204
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH

444
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:54,504
MIROKU AND SANGO INSTEAD OF

445
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,471
COMING WITH US.

446
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,504
