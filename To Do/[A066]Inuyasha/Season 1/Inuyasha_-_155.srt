I'M SURPRISED.

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,472
WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?

382
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,806
>> DAMMIT!

383
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:51,139
>> [ROARS]

384
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,472
>> THE ATTACKS ARE RELENTLESS.

385
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,972
INUYASHA HAS NOTHING TO LAND ON!

386
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:56,806
>> PLEASE, HOSENKI,

387
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:57,972
TELL ME YOU AREN'T SERIOUSLY

388
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,602

HOSENKI'S SACRED JEWEL SHARD

394
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,170
HAS SUDDENLY TURNED BLACK!

395
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:33,970
>> HUH?

396
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,670

GOOD OR EVIL DEPENDING ON

400

THE HEART OF ITS POSSESSOR.

401
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,337
AND JUDGING BY HOSENKI'S STORY,

402
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,670
I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE

403
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,670
HE BROUGHT THE SHARD HERE

404
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,544

AND IT'S HUGE!

408
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,170
IT MUST BE NARAKU'S.

409
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,170
>> NARAKU'S SHARDS ARE

410
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,504
INFLUENCING HOSENKI?

411
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,670
>> HEY, KAGOME, WHERE IS HE?

412
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,604
WHERE IS NARAKU HIDING?

413
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:09,737
>> I CAN'T TELL.

414
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,970
THE PRESENCE IS COMING FROM

415
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,437
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

416
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:14,937
I CAN'T TELL WHERE HE IS.

417
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:16,604
>> DID YOU HEAR THAT, HOSENKI?

418
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:17,770
YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG ON

419
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,070
TO THAT THING!

420
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,437
YOUR SOUL WILL BE CORRUPTED

421
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:22,104
BY THE TAINTED JEWEL SHARD.

422
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,104
GIVE IT UP NOW--

423
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:24,070
WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

424
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,937
>> DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

425
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:27,604
I'M NOT SO WEAK AS TO LOSE

426
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,770
MY SOUL TO A MINOR IRRITANT

427
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,270
AS THIS.

428
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,970
I WILL NOT GIVE IT UP TO ANYONE.

429
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,937
>> DAMN!

430
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,437
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

431
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:43,937
TO TAKE IT BY FORCE.

432
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,604
HEY, HOSENKI, I'LL CUT

433
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:46,937
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD OUT

434
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:48,604
OF YOU MYSELF BEFORE YOUR SOUL

435
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,937
IS TOTALLY DEVOURED!

436
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,604
>> TAKE IT, IF YOU THINK

437
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,204
YOU CAN.

438

BLACK.

440

441
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,204
BE CORRUPTING HIM.

444
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,637
GO EASY ON HIM!

445
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:07,204
