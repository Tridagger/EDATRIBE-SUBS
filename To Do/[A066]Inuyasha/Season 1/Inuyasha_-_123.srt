BE ABLE TO DISPERSE IT.

379
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:10,186
AND ALSO, I SEE SOMETHING.

380
00:19:10,186 --> 00:19:11,386
THERE ARE TWO SHIKON JEWEL

381
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,352
SHARDS AT NARAKU'S FEET.

382
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,286
>> TWO?

383
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,452
YOU MEAN THE WOLF'S?

384
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:18,952
>> I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

385
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:20,719
KOGA IS A DEMON, SO NARAKU MIGHT

386
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,319
TRY TO ABSORB HIM INTO HIS BODY

387
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,986
TO GET THE JEWEL SHARDS.

>> HMM?

406
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:10,952
>> STAY FOCUSED.

407
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:11,886
AIM YOUR ARROW STRAIGHT FOR

408
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,586
NARAKU AND TAKE HIM DOWN.

409
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,286

410
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,548
TAKE THIS!

OH, LOOK, IT'S KOGA!

414
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,586
>> HEH HEH HEH.

415
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:56,619
YOU BOTHER TO WORRY ABOUT A

416
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,686
FRIEND AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

417
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,652
YOUR UNFAILING STUPIDITY

418
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:03,419
THOROUGHLY DISGUSTS ME.

ABLE TO ENDURE IT.

450
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,044
KIKYO, THIS WILL BE YOUR GRAVE.
