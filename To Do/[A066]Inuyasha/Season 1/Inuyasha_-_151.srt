380
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,354
>> YOU MEAN KIKYO WAS ACTUALLY

381
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,887
HERE?

382
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,587
>> YES, BUT SHE LEFT AWHILE AGO.

383
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,587
I TOLD HER TO STAY AND SEE YOU,

384
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,020
REALLY.

385
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,154
>> HUH?

386
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,920
>> I KNEW IT.

387
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,987
HE'S HAPPY.

388
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,887
>> INUYASHA, WHAT'LL YOU DO?

389
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:08,720
GO AFTER HER?

390
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,654
>> KAGOME, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN

391
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:15,254
WITH YOU AND KIKYO?

392
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:16,487
>> I FELT SO DETERMINED WHEN IT

393
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,054
WAS HAPPENING.

394
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,020
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FEEL LIKE

395
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,420
THIS NOW.

396
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,254
>> KAGOME!

397
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,687
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

398
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,854
WHAT'S WITH THE LONG FACE?

399
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,920
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU!

400
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,987
>> OH, BE QUIET.

401
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:28,787
>> HUH?

402
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:29,687
>> THIS WHOLE MESS IS ALL YOUR

403
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:30,687
FAULT!

404
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:31,587
ARGH!

405
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,654
I HATE YOUR GUTS!

406
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,887
>> WHAT'S WITH KAGOME?

407
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:38,187
>> SHE LOOKS SCARY.

408
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,154
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK I

409
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:40,520
DID, BUT YOU BETTER KNOCK IT OFF

410
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,820
BEFORE I GET SERIOUSLY MAD!

411
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,887
>> INUYASHA, STAY--

412
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,254
>> HUH?

413
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,654
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIROKU?

414
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:48,754
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

415
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,854
BUT I'M GUESSING IT'S INUYASHA'S

416
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,054
FAULT.

417
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,254
>> KAGOME'S USUALLY RIGHT ABOUT

418
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:55,920
THESE THINGS.

419
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,454
>> APOLOGIZE?

420
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:58,987
FOR WHAT?

421
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,587
>> LOOK AT POOR KAGOME.

422
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,187
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER LOOK SO

423
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,520
SAD AND DEJECTED?

424
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,820
>> YEAH, SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

425
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,487
>> INUYASHA, LET ME ASK YOU ONE

426
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,287
QUESTION.

427
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,354
ARE YOUR SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO

428
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:14,954
GO AFTER KIKYO?

429
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,087
>> IT'S HARDLY EVEN AN OPTION.

430
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:18,987
NOT WITH KAGOME LIKE THIS.

431
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,420
>> SO YOU MEAN IF KAGOME HAD

432
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,020
SENT YOU OFF WITH A SMILE, YOU'D

433
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:31,454
HAVE GONE?

434
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,120
>> I'M TOTALLY THE WORST.

435
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,554
I WAS UPSET AND TOOK IT ALL OUT

436
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,287
ON INUYASHA.

437
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:42,587
OH, MAYBE HE HATES ME NOW.

438
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,654
HUH?

439
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:46,854
WHAT IS IT?

440
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,354
>> ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

441
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:57,554
>> AREN'T YOU GOING AFTER KIKYO?

442
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,720
>> WHEN I WAS UP THERE ALONE AT

443
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,187
THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN, I MET

444
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,420
SAINT HAJIDI, BUT IT TURNED OUT

445
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,120
TO BE KIKYO'S PUPPET.

446
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,020
I FOUND OUT THAT THE REAL KIKYO

447
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,354
WAS OVERCOME BY NARAKU'S MIASMA

448
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,687
AND THAT HER LIFE WAS NEARING

449
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:18,620
ITS END.

450
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
HOW'S KIKYO?

451
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,454
I MEAN HOW DID SHE SEEM?

452
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,520
>> BADLY INJURED AND

453
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
UNCONSCIOUS.

454
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,820
BUT THEN...

455
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,720
I MANAGED TO PURIFY THE MIASMA,

456
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,820
SO I THINK SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

457
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,854
>> YOU MEAN YOU DID THAT FOR

458
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,520
HER?

459
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,454
>> YEAH.

460
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,654
>> HMM.

461
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,854
I SEE.

462
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,287
>> IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

463
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,254
OF COURSE HE'D BE WORRIED ABOUT

464
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,987
HER.

465
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,354
INUYASHA, GO AFTER KIKYO.

466
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,787
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

467
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,387
>> I'M NOT!

468
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:53,854
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULDN'T BE

469
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:54,987
WORRIED.

470
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,087
YOU SAVED KIKYO, DIDN'T YOU?

471
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:58,420
>> UH-HUH.

472
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,187
>> WELL, THEN SHE'S GOTTA BE OK.

473
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,720
I WON'T GO AFTER HER.

474
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,020
>> ARE YOU SURE?

475
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,187
SERIOUSLY?

476
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,687
>> YEAH!

477
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,320
SO TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID

478
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,587
EARLIER.

479
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:11,620
>> HUH?

480
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,487
>> DON'T PRETEND YOU FORGOT

481
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:13,354
ALREADY.

482
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:14,420
YOU SAID THAT YOU HATED ME A

483
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,920
LITTLE WHILE AGO.

484
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,087
>> REALLY?

485
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,187
DID I SAY THAT?

486
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,620
>> GAA!

487
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,554
>> SORRY.

488
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,687
I GUESS I DID FORGET.

489
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,320
>> DO YOU--DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

490
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,654
HOW MUCH THAT HURT?

491
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,087
>> SO IT DID BOTHER HIM.

492
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,254
>> GUESS HE'S THE SENSITIVE

493
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:31,287
TYPE.

494
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,887
>> THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY IN

495
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,220
KAGOME'S HEART WHEN SHE SAVED

496
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,320
ME.

497
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,020
IF THERE HAD BEEN, THE WOUND IN

498
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,554
MY CHEST WOULD NOT HAVE HEALED.

499
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:43,835
I CAN STILL FEEL HER WARM TOUCH.

500
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:57,611
[MUSIC]

501
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,443
>> AROUND THE TIME SAINT HAJIDI

502
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:34,976
APPEARED, PRINCESS ABI'S MOTHER

503
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,776
NOTICED A LOCATION THAT DEMON'S

504
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:37,810
AVOIDED.

505
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,110
>> I'LL KILL NARAKU.

506
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,510
>> HE'S CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT

507
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,610
TROUBLE.

508
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,776
>> PRINCESS ABI SENDS HER BIRDS

00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:44,176
TO ATTACK, AND AMONG THOSE

510
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,410
DEFENDING THE PLACE IS KOHAKU!

00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:49,710
THIS A LONG TIME AGO, FIGHTING

513

ALONGSIDE MY COMRADES.

INFANT.
