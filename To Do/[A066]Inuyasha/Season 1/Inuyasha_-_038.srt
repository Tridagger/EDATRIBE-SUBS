300
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:59,802
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

301
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,602
THERE ONCE WAS A DOG.

302
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:03,768
HE HAPPENED TO BE FRIENDS
WITH A CAT,

303
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:06,668
BUT THEN A WOLF APPEARED
AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CAT.

304
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,702
THE DOG WAS
VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE CAT,

305
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,668
AND HE FOUGHT WITH
THE WOLF CONSTANTLY.

306
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:14,268
ONE DAY, THE WOLF STOLE THE CAT
AND WHISKED HER AWAY.

307
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:17,735
BUT THEN SOME BIG, UGLY BIRD
SWOOPED DOWN FROM THE SKY

308
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,368
AND PECKED AT THE WOLF
AND HURT HIM VERY BADLY.

309
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:22,535
MEANWHILE, THE DOG CAME
TO RESCUE THE CAT,

310
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,602
BUT WHEN HE GOT THERE,
HE NOTICED ALL THESE UGLY BIRDS,

311
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:26,535
SO HE KILLED THEM.

312
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,035
THE DOG WANTED TO KILL
THE INJURED WOLF NEXT,

313
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,468
BUT THE CAT PRACTICALLY
SCRATCHED HIS EYES OUT

314
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:34,002
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE WOLF
AND LET HIM ESCAPE.

315
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:38,068
YOU SEE, THE CAT WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP THE INJURED WOLF,

316
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:39,968
BUT THE DOG SUSPECTED
THAT THE CAT

317
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,635
HAD ACTUALLY FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE WOLF.

318
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,668
SO, THE DOG WAS
A REAL JERK ABOUT IT,

319
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:49,368
AND THE CAT HISSED AT HIM
AND RAN DOWN A WELL BACK HOME.

320
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:52,335
SO THAT'S THE BASIC STORY
FOR YOU, KAEDE.

321
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,968
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW WE CAN GET THE CAT AND DOG

BACK TOGETHER AS FRIENDS AGAIN.

323
00:16:56,135 --> 00:17:00,335

THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE.

00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:03,868
- WHAT MISTAKE?
- WHY ARE YE WHINING?
