1
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,934
>> INUYASHA BROKE THROUGH

2
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,767
NARAKU'S BARRIER, BUT BEFORE

3
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,601
INUYASHA COULD FINISH HIM OFF,

4
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,501
NARAKU ESCAPED SERIOUSLY

5
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,434
INJURED.

6
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,267
THE ONLY REASON HE GOT AWAY WAS

7
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,967
BECAUSE HE RESORTED TO A DIRTY

8
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,434
TRICK--USING KOHAKU.

9
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,301
SURPRISINGLY, IT WAS SESSHOMARU

10
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,922
THAT SAVED KOHAKU.

11
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,367
NARAKU HAD DISAPPEARED, AND WE

12
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,867
WERE ACTUALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE A

13
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,567
BIT OF A BREATHER, ESPECIALLY

14
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,934
INUYASHA.

15
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,801
SO ON WE GO, CONTINUING OUR

16
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,867
JOURNEY TO DESTROY NARAKU AND

17
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,667
GATHER ALL THE SHARDS OF THE

18
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,149

GET SERIOUS.

24

>> YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE ME FOR

GET LOST, WILL YOU?

74
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,434

WEREN'T EVEN ANY RUMORS

>> I SEE.

98
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,567
IT SEEMS INUYASHA HASN'T BEEN

99
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:27,734
ABLE TO PICK UP ANY SCENT OF

100
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,167
NARAKU, EITHER.

101
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,667
>> NOT A WHIFF.

102
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,867
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A DEMONIC

103
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,534
AURA THAT STRONG COULD DISAPPEAR

104
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,967
SO EASILY, THOUGH.

105
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,334
>> NOT MUCH WE CAN DO, I GUESS.

>> KAGOME, I DON'T SUPPOSE

107
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,967
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SENSE THE

OVERLY WORRIED.

113
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,701

00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,334
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS AS USUAL,

115
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,567
I'M SURE NARAKU WILL EVENTUALLY

116
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,667
COME AFTER THEM HIMSELF.

DON'T YOU WORRY.

138
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:01,467

THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO IF

143
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:23,334
KOGA DOESN'T REMEMBER.

144
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,667
MAYBE I SHOULD RETURN TO THE

WITHOUT THE SACRED JEWEL, WE

149
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,201
CANNOT OVERCOME THIS STRUGGLE.

150
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,867
FIND KOGA AND BRING HIM HERE AS
