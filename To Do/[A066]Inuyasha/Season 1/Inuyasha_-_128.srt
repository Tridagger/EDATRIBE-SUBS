>> I HEARD IT.

568
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,566
IT WAS VERY FAINT, BUT I'M

569
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,266
CERTAIN I HEARD IT.

570
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:55,566
STILL, IT WON'T BE EASY TO LAY

571
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,466
YOUR HANDS ON IT.

572
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,132
>> DON'T STALL, OR I'LL

573
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:02,366
KILL YOU.

574
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:04,099
TELL ME, WHERE CAN I FIND THE

575
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,566
LAST SHARD OF THE JEWEL?

576
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:09,999
>> THE LAST OF THE JEWEL SHARDS

577
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:12,066
IS AT THE BORDER OF THIS WORLD

578
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,432
AND THE NETHERWORLD.

579
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,632
>> AT THE BORDER OF THIS WORLD

580
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:22,223
AND THE NETHERWORLD.

581
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:23,690
>> THE SHRINE IS DESTROYED, AND

582
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,057
THE DEMON SEALED INSIDE IS

583
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:26,490
REAWAKENED.

584
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,590
>> WHENEVER THAT DEMON SEES A

585
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,157
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, HE ASKS

586
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,857
HER TO BEAR HIS CHILD.

587
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:32,023
AND THEN HE ABDUCTS HER!

588
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:32,723
>> HORRIBLE!

589
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,123
NO, DESPICABLE!

590
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:36,523
>> MIROKU, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

591
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,790
>> FAIR LADIES, REST ASSURED,

592
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,157
YOU SHALL BE SAFE UNDER MY

593
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,157
PROTECTION.

594
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,890
>> NEXT TIME, "CHOKYUKAI AND

595
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,957
THE ABDUCTED BRIDE."

596
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,257
I LOVE PORK CUTLETS, BUT I

597
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,790
REFUSE TO BECOME A PIG DEMON'S

598
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,790
BRIDE!
