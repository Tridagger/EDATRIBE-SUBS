00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,143
>> I HEARD THAT BEFORE, BUT I

191
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,743
NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD IT.

192
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,943
>> ME, EITHER.

193
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,110
>> HOW ABOUT YOU START

194
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,343
EXPLAINING THE PART WHERE THAT

195
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,643
DEMON GOT HOLD OF THE FAKE

196
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,010
SACRED JEWEL?

197
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,343
>> SOMEONE GAVE IT TO HIM.

198
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,443
>> WHO DID?

199
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,077
>> IT WAS A DEMON.

200
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,710
>> ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A FIGHT?

201
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,410
>> NO, NOTHING OF THE SORT.

202
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,810
>> STOP IT, INUYASHA.

203
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,977
>> HUH?

204
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:04,077
>> SO TELL ME, IZUMO, WHY WAS

205
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,143
THAT DEMON CHASING YOU, ANYWAY?

206
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,143
>> BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO COME

207
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,243
ACROSS SOME DEMONS AND THEIR

208
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,977
FAKE SACRED JEWELS.

209
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:12,010
>> WHAT?

210
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,077
>> I HEARD THAT THERE WAS A

211
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,443
SHRINE WHICH TOLD THE LEGEND OF

212
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,343
THE SACRED JEWEL, AND I MADE MY

213
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,210
WAY TO THE MOUNTAIN PATH.

214
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,971
EVENTUALLY, THOUGH, I GOT LOST.

215
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:26,277
THAT'S WHEN I CAME UPON A DEMON

216
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,977
HANDING THE SACRED JEWEL TO THAT

217
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:31,410
WORM DEMON.

218
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,977
>> WAS THIS DEMON CALLED NARAKU?

219
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:35,210
>> NO.

220
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,310
HE CALLED HIMSELF ORUCHIDIU, AND

221
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,710
HE SAID THAT THE JEWEL WAS NOT

222
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,543
YET COMPLETE, BUT THAT SOON, A

223
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,943
TRUE SACRED JEWEL WOULD BE MADE.

224
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:44,677
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

225
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:45,777
>> SO THAT MEANS A DEMON IS

226
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,477
MAKING SACRED JEWELS?

227
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:49,210
>> UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS ALL I

228
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,498
WAS ABLE TO OVERHEAR.

229
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,177
>> STRANGE, I DON'T SENSE THE

230
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:58,910
PRESENCE OF ANY DEMONS.

231
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,210
>> IT WAS JUST AROUND HERE THAT

232
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,143
I CAME UPON THE DEMON.

233
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,343
>> [SNIFFS]

234
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,410
I'M NOT CATCHING ANY SCENT OF

235
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,610
NARAKU.

236
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,743
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE'S

237
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,010
INVOLVED IN THIS.

238
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,810
>> HOW ABOUT YOU, KAGOME?

239
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,243
DO YOU SENSE THE SACRED JEWEL?

240
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,510
>> UH-UH. NO, NOT AT ALL.

241
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,577
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS REALLY A

242
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,843
STRONG FEELING TO BEGIN WITH.

243
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:19,810
>> HA! BECAUSE IT'S A FAKE.

244
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,110
>> IT PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK ALL

245
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,277
THAT WELL, EITHER.

246
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:23,677
>> LOOK!

247
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:29,677
THERE'S A VILLAGE OVER THERE.

248
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,143
>> NO ONE IS AROUND.

249
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:33,043
>> THERE'S NO SIGN OF ANYONE.

250
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,077
I WONDER IF SOMETHING HAPPENED

251
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,143
HERE.

252
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:36,177
>> WAIT.

253
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,743
WHERE DID THE PRIEST GO?

254
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,777
>> HUH?

255
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:39,898
>> IZUMO.

256
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,010
>> HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

257
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,743
>> OHH.

258
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:51,043
>> WELL?

259
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,210
>> WORD HAS IT THAT THIS SHRINE

260
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,010
HOUSES THE DEITY OF ORIGIN.

261
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,543
>> HUH?

262
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:04,777
IT'S EMPTY.

263
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,110
>> WHAT IS THE DEITY OF ORIGIN?

264
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,643
>> THERE IS A LEGEND THAT CLAIMS

265
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,943
THAT THE SPIRITS KUSHIMITAMA AND

266
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,777
SAKIMITAMA WERE BORN FROM THE

267
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,177
HEART OF THIS DEITY.

268
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:16,343
>> OH, IS THAT SO?

269
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,143
>> KUSHIMITAMA EMBODIES CHI, OR

270
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,543
KNOWLEDGE, AND SAKIMITAMA

271
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,477
EMBODIES AI, OR LOVE.

272
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,877
>> ARAMITAMA, OR YUU, AND

273
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,777
NIGIMITAMA, OR SHIN--

274
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:27,543
YUU, SHIN, CHI, AI.

275
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,910
THESE ARE THE 4 SPIRITS THAT

276
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,810
MAKE UP THE SACRED JEWEL.

277
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,310
>> OHH, MY HEAD.

278
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,177
>> LET'S SAVE ALL THIS TALK FOR

279
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,343
LATER.

280
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,710
I'M GETTING A WEIRD FEELING FROM

281
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,143
THIS PLACE, AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

282
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,277
>> I THINK WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE

283
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,010
A LITTLE MORE AROUND HERE.

284
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,077
>> I'LL CHECK JUST OUTSIDE THE

285
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,077
VILLAGE.

286
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,310
>> MM-HMM.

287
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,577
>> HUH, WE HAVEN'T FOUND A THING

288
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,177
YET.

289
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:53,310
>> OHH.

290
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,377
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

291
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,677
>> I WONDER HOW IT IS THAT THE

292
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:59,777
SUN CAN BE SO WARM AND BLINDING.

293
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:00,677
>> WHO KNOWS?

294
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:01,643
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE NATURAL

295
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:02,977
THINGS.

296
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,810
>> NATURAL?

297
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,110
NOT TO ME, IT ISN'T.

298
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,310
IS SOMETHING BURNING ON THE

299
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,343
OTHER SIDE OF THE SUN, AND WHAT

300
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:14,277
IS THE DISTANCE FROM US TO THE

301
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,910
SUN?

302
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,510
>> THIS GUY THINKS UP SUCH WEIRD

303
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,377
STUFF.

304
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,410
>> NO.

305
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,743
I'VE NEVER MET A MAN IN THIS ERA

306
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,410
WHO THINKS LIKE HE DOES.

307
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,677
I GOT TO SAY, I'M IMPRESSED.

308
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,077
>> ARE THERE A LOT OF GUYS LIKE

309
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,310
HIM IN YOUR WORLD?

310
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,243
>> HMM.

311
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,210
>> WHY DOES THE NIGHT FALL AT

312
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,777
THE DAY'S END?

313
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:31,943
>> IZUMO IS TALKING LIKE THAT

314
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:33,443
BECAUSE HE'S A SCHOLAR.

315
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,743
>> OK.

316
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:35,877
SAY...

317
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:36,910
>> YES?

318
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,110
>> THOSE 4 SPIRITS YOU WERE

319
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,843
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, WHAT DO

320
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:43,143
THEY MEAN, THE YUU AND CHI?

321
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:45,210
>> DO YOU MEAN YUU, SHIN, CHI,

322
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,743
AND AI, FOX DEMON?

323
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,543
>> YEAH, THOSE ONES.

324
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,410
>> ARAMITAMA, OR YUU, REPRESENTS

325
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,143
THE SPIRIT OF COURAGE.

326
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,077
>> THAT'S GOOD.

327
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,310
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE WITH

328
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,477
ALL OF THIS.

329
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,743
>> YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

330
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,643
>> SHIN REPRESENTS FRIENDSHIP.

331
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:01,477
CHI REPRESENTS KNOWLEDGE, OR

KNOWING THE WAYS OF THE WORLD,

333
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,743
AND AI IS, OF COURSE, LOVE.

334
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,643
>> OK.

335
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,010
THAT STUFF ALL MAKE SENSE.

336
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,377
THAT MITAMA SOMETHING OR OTHER

337
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:10,810
YOU WERE SAYING WAS STARTING TO

338
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,277
GIVE ME A HEADACHE.

KUSHIMITAMA OF KNOWLEDGE,

SAKIMITAMA OF LOVE.

343
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,743
WHEN THESE 4 SPIRITS ARE

344
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,577
GATHERED INTO ONE AND GOOD AND

345
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:23,877

OH, NO. THERE HE GOES.
