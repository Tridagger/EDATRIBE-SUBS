569
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,626
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT SOME USE

570
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:40,960
FOR ME YET.

571
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,926
I GUESS I GOT A REPRIEVE THIS

572
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:59,126

573
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,760

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,093
>> LOOK AT THIS.

00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,126
THE PATH ENDS.

576
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,493
IT'S ALMOST AS IF SOMEONE HACKED

577
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:08,060
OFF PART OF THE MOUNTAIN.

578
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,893

00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:14,293
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PATH USED TO

582
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,960
LEAD UP TO THAT CAVE.

583
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,993
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO IN?

584
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,260

LET'S GO, SANGO.

600
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:05,993
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

601
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:08,093
NARAKU IS DEEP INSIDE THIS CAVE.

602
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:09,060

HOW LONG IS HE GOING TO KEEP ME

607
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,826
SHUT UP IN THIS PLACE?

608
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,326
>> KAGURA.

609
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,260
>> OH, KANNA, IT'S YOU.

610
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,660
