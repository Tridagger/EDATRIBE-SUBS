GET OFF OF ME!

105
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:46,854
>> THAT'S IT.

106
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:47,587
I'M GOING TO TRY AND FIND

107
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,087
KILALA.

108
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,120
>> WAIT.

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,187
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND HER

110
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:54,287
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF A LEAD.

111
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,054
>> NOW INUYASHA DECIDES TO COME

112
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,220
TO THE RESCUE.

113
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,520
>> HUH?

114
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
AND YOU'RE SHOWING ME THIS

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,387
BECAUSE...

116
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,554
>> IT'S KILALA'S FOOD DISH.

117
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,787
THIS IS WHAT SHE EATS HER CAT

118
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,254
FOOD OUT OF.

119
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,154
>> GREAT, BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED

120
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,354
TO DO WITH IT?

121
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:09,287
>> WELL, I FIGURED YOU MIGHT

122
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,120
WANT TO TAKE A SNIFF OF IT.

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,254
>> LIKE I DON'T ALREADY KNOW

124
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:15,654
KILALA'S SCENT?

125
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,753
>> YOU CAN DO IT, INUYASHA.

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,620
WELL? DID YOU GET ANYTHING?

127
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,654
>> NOT REALLY.

128
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:31,020
THE SCENT ENDS RIGHT HERE.

129
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,387
>> SO WE'RE 3 STEPS CLOSER TO

130
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:35,754
FINDING HER.

131
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:36,987
>> I THINK WE'D BETTER SPLIT UP

132
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,054
AND KEEP SEARCHING.

133
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,687
>> IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

134
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,020
HER SCENT ENDED, SO THAT MEANS

135
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,987
SHE MUST HAVE TAKEN OFF AND

136
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,220
FLOWN SOMEWHERE.

137
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,987
BESIDES, I'M NOT PICKING UP ANY

138
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:46,487
OF HER SCENT AROUND HERE.

139
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:47,420
>> SO WHAT?

140
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,354
KEEP LOOKING.

141
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,487
WE CAN'T JUST CARRY ON WITHOUT

142
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:50,520
HER.

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,387
>> YEAH, I FIGURED THAT MUCH.

144
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,520
>> WELL, THEN.

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
>> YO, SANGO, ARE YOU SURE THERE

146
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,987
ISN'T SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT

147
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:57,454
TELLING US?

148
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:58,587
>> HMM?

149
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,520
>> LIKE MAYBE YOU TWO HAD A

150
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,220
FIGHT AND SHE TOOK OFF TO STAY

151
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,687
WITH A FRIEND FOR A WHILE.

152
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:03,520
COME ON, THERE MUST BE

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,420
SOMETHING.

154
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,254
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

155
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,620
AT, BUT--

156
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,387
>> ANYTHING AT ALL WOULD HELP.

157
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:09,320
DID SHE LOSE HER APPETITE

158
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,254
LATELY?

159
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,187
OR PERHAPS SHE STARTED GETTING A

160
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,787
BIT MOODY.

161
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,087
OR MAYBE THERE'S A LARGE PATCH

162
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,420
OF CATNIP GROWING NEAR HERE.

163
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,487
>> NO, NO, BUT MAYBE IT'S MY

164
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,620
FAULT.

165
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,754
>> HUH?

166
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,154
>> IT'S JUST THAT EVERY TIME I

167
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,654
GO INTO BATTLE, I DRAG HER

168
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,154
ALONG WITH ME.

169
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,120
WHEN WE NEED TO TRAVEL A

170
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,387
DISTANCE, WE TAKE HER FOR

171
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,554
GRANTED AND RIDE ON HER BACK.

172
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:30,854
I MAKE HER GO ON ERRANDS AND

173
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:32,820
DON'T EVEN THINK TO REWARD HER.

174
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,087
SHE LOVES FISH, AND YET I ALMOST

175
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,720
NEVER TREAT HER TO SOME.

176
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,320
>> SANGO, DON'T PIN THE BLAME

177
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,154
ON

178
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,254
YOURSELF.

179
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:39,387
>> KILALA'S NOT THE TYPE TO RUN

180
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,887
AWAY OVER THOSE THINGS.

181
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,487
>> I GOT IT!

182
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,320
>> YOU GOT WHAT?

183
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,487
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

184
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,754
>> I THINK I KNOW WHY KILALA

185
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:46,854
DISAPPEARED.

186
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:47,620
>> HMM?

187
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,854
>> IT CAME TO ME RIGHT AFTER

188
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,820
INUYASHA GAVE ME A NOOGIE.

189
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,554
I GAVE IT SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT,

190
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:54,154
AND THE ANSWER CAME TO ME.

191

FOR THE BALD SPOTS, AND THAT'S

257
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,320
WHY SHE RAN AWAY.

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,187
SOME FUR WENT FLYING.

262
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,254
