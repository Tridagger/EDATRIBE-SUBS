00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:28,187
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GET AWAY!

382
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:31,254
HUH?

383
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:34,521
[LAUGHTER]

384
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,654
HUH?

385
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:41,221
>> INUYASHA, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

386
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,343
>> IT'S NARAKU!

387
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,849
>> I'M SO SORRY.

388
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:54,982
PLEASE FORGIVE ME, LORD

389
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,149
SESSHOMARU.

390
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,782
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

391
00:14:57,782 --> 00:14:59,149
RIN RAN OFF BEFORE I COULD STOP

392
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,282
HER.

393
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,115
[SOBBING]

394
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,949
>> WHERE IS SHE?

395
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,682
INSIDE THE BARRIER?

396
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:08,715
>> AAH!

397
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,482
YOU MUSTN'T GO IN THERE, MASTER!

398
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,049
IF YOU ENTER SACRED GROUNDS,

399
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,115
EVEN YOU'LL BE INSTANTLY

400
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,449
PURIFIED!

401
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:17,915
>> BE QUIET AND LOOK BEHIND YOU.

402
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:20,215
>> HUH?

403
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,715
IS THAT RIN?

404
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,682
>> LORD SESSHOMARU!

405
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:27,782
>> KOHAKU WAS THERE, WASN'T HE?

406
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:31,415
>> HUH?

407
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:34,582
>> UH, NOW BE HONEST, RIN.

408
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,182
YOU CAN'T DECEIVE MASTER'S KEEN

409
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,782
NOSE.

410
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,315
>> DOES LORD SESSHOMARU ACTUALLY

411
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:42,415
INTEND TO KILL KOHAKU?

412
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,415
UH, THE TRUTH IS, KOHAKU HELPED

413
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,815
ME ESCAPE.

414
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:46,749
THERE WERE LOTS AND LOTS OF

415
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,582
DEMONS IN THE CAVE.

416
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,115
>> WHAT'S THAT?

417
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,982
DEMONS?

418
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:52,915
>> KOHAKU PROTECTED ME FROM THE

419
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,582
DEMONS.

420
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:57,715
SO, UM...

421
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,982
>> DEMONS BEHIND THE SACRED

422
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,215
BARRIER?

423
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,249
>> LORD SESSHOMARU?

424
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,049
>> NOW I UNDERSTAND.

425
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:08,515
NARAKU'S LITTLE TRICK.

426
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,249
>> HA HA HA!

427
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,615
WELL, I MUST GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR

428
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,015
COMING THIS FAR.

429
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,749
>> WHY, YOU!

430
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:16,782
>> INUYASHA, I DON'T THINK

431
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:17,982
IT'S ACTUALLY HIM.

432
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:18,749
>> YEAH.

433
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,315
IT'S ONE OF HIS DEMON PUPPETS.

434
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:21,749
>> BUYING TIME FOR THE BAND OF 7

435
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,482
TO ESCAPE, ARE YOU?

436
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,715
>> HA HA HA!

437
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,515
>> HUH?

438
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,749
WHAT IS THIS?

439
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,115
SANGO, THAT'S A PUPPET, RIGHT?

440
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:30,882
>> YES.

441
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,215
IT HAS TO BE A DECOY THAT NARAKU

442
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:33,515
CREATED.

443
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:36,282
>> WHY DO YOU ASK THAT, KAGOME?

444
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:37,349
>> THIS DEMON PUPPET IS

445
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:38,582
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS HE'S

446
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,749
USED.

447
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,082
>> I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR FAKES!

448
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,744
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KOGA?

449
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,515
>> HA HA HA!

450
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,049
I WON'T LET YOU PASS.

451
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:57,749
>> WHOA!

452
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,915
HE'S GIGANTIC!

453
00:16:58,915 --> 00:16:59,749
>> STAND BACK.

454
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,115
BE CAREFUL.

455
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:01,915
>> UNH!

456
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,682
HAH!

457
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:06,924
>> TIME TO USE MY WIND SCAR!

458
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:17,249
>> HUH?

459
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:22,115
>> I WON'T LET YOU PASS.

460
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:22,749
>> YOU TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF

461
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,015
US, KOGA?

462
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,749
>> SHUT UP, MUTT!

463
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,015
AN INCOMPETENT HALF-BREED LIKE

464
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,715
YOU WOULD ONLY LET THE BAND OF 7

465
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,515
GET AWAY!

466
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,449
THEY CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR YET,

467
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:37,349
AND THEY WON'T GET AWAY FROM ME.

468
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,849
>> HEY! HOLD ON A SECOND!

469
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,815
>> WAIT, INUYASHA.

470
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:41,115
>> HMM?

471
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:42,115
>> SO YOU NOTICED IT, TOO,

472
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,582
KAGOME?

473
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:44,882
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

474
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:45,715
>> THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE

475
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,249
ABOUT THIS DEMON PUPPET.

476
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:48,849
IT SEEMS CLEAN.

477
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,849
>> HUH?

478
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:50,815
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NARAKU'S

479
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:52,515
PUPPET SEEMS CLEAN?

480
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:53,882
>> IT SEEMS PURE, LIKE THE

481
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,749
BARRIER AROUND MOUNT HAKUREI.

482
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,482
>> MOUNT HAKUREI?

483
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:58,182
>> HEY!

484
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:01,515
IT SMELLS--IT SMELLS NICE.

485
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,049
>> IT SMELLS OF--

486
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,882
OF WATER AND FLOWERS.

487
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:06,249
>> WATER AND FLOWERS?

488
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,015
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

489
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,182
>> HMM?

490
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:09,782
>> BUT WHY WOULD NARAKU'S DEMON

491
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:15,515
PUPPET SMELL LIKE THIS?

492
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:16,682
>> WHERE ARE YOU?

493
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:19,649
WHERE'D YOU GO?

494
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:20,349
UNH!

495
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,249
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

496
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,282
UNH!

497
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:29,449
IT'S SOME KIND OF BARRIER.

498
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,249
>> WE CAN SEE IT NOW,

499
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:33,515
BANKOTSU--MOUNT HAKUREI.

500
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:34,449
JEEZ!

501
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,815
WHAT'S WITH THIS AIR?

502
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,115
IT MADE ME SICK THE LAST TIME WE

503
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,715
CAME HERE, TOO.

504
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,149
>> IT SEEMS TO EXTEND FURTHER

505
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,449
NOW.

506
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,949
>> I SUSPECT THE SACRED BARRIER

507
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,615
HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED.

508
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,315
THIS WAY, NEITHER INUYASHA NOR

509
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:49,382
KOGA CAN COME AFTER US.

510
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:50,615
>> BUT IT'LL BE TOUGH FOR US,

511
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,682
TOO, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE HUMAN.

512
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:54,915
>> YES.

513
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:58,049
>> WAIT!

514
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,615
IT SEEMS WE WON'T HAVE TO GO ALL

515
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:00,515
THE WAY TO THE BASE OF THE

516
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:04,949
MOUNTAIN.

517
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,482
>> BANKOSTU, SIR.

518
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,682
>> HI, KOHAKU.

519
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,549
SO WHO'S THIS ALBINO CHILD?

520
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,515
>> SHE'S KANNA.

521
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:16,549
>> WHAT'S THIS?

522
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:17,615
HUH?

523
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,549
HEY!

524
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,749
HIM AGAIN?

525
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:20,849
>> WHAT, DO YOU KNOW HIM?

526
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,115
>> THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

527
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:24,049
HE'S THE ONE WHO KILLED MUKOTSU.

528
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:24,782
>> IT'S INUYASHA'S OLDER

529
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:26,615
BROTHER, SESSHOMARU.

530
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,582
>> AH, SO HE WAS INUYASHA'S

531
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,049
OLDER BROTHER.

532
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,582
>> YES, I SEE.

533
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,715
SO WHAT?

534
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,549
>> YOU ARE TO FIND HIM AND KILL

535
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,882
HIM, TOO.

536
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,282
>> HEY!

537
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:37,449
YOU'D BETTER NOT TELL ME YOU

538
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,715
DRAGGED US ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

539
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,215
JUST TO TELL US THAT.

540
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:40,915
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

541
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,415
DESTROYING INUYASHA.

542
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,415
>> IF YOU HAD CONTINUED

543
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,949
FIGHTING, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN

544
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,482
KILLED.

545
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,115
>> WHAT?

546
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,915
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, KID?

547
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:51,549
>> YOUR HALBERD CANNOT DEFEAT

548
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,615
INUYASHA'S TETSAIGA.

549
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:57,282
>> HMM!

550
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:58,449
WHAT, YOU MEAN BECAUSE OF

551
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,515
THIS MEASLY SCRATCH ON BANRYU?

552
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,915
WHY, IT HARDLY EVEN--HUH?

553
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:07,515
>> IT CAN BECOME MUCH STRONGER.

554
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,649
>> HUH?

555
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,349
>> YES.

556
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,249
>> OHH.

557
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:13,815

FROM ME.

565
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,415
IF YOU PREFER, I COULD CUT THEM

566
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:31,349
OUT OF YOUR NECK.

567
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:34,515
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

568
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:35,515
