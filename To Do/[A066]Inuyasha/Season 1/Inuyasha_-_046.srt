- SURE IS
QUIET AND PEACEFUL OUT.

00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:49,706
- YOU SAID IT.
OUR BATTLES SEEM JUST LIKE
A BAD DREAM.

[GASP]

00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:52,873
I CAN SENSE
A SHIKON JEWEL SHARD.

00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:55,739
- WHAT?
- AND IT'S CLOSING IN, FAST!

[ALL SCREAM]

7
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,239
- YO.
- IT'S KOGA.

8
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,039
- I PICKED UP ON
YOUR SCENT, KAGOME,

9
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,939
SO I CAME TO SEE YA.
YOU'VE BEEN WELL, I HOPE?

10
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,131
- WHAT DO YOU WANT,
YOU MANGY WOLF?

[GROWLS]

12
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,631
- COME ON, DON'T GO
PICKING A FIGHT ALREADY.

13
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:16,397
- STAY OUT OF IT.
I MAY HAVE TO KILL HIM,
OR WORSE.

14
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,931
- PSHAW.
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
ONE BIT, MUTT.

15
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,297
YOU'D THINK YOU COULD LOSE
THE ARROGANCE ONCE IN A WHILE.

16
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:25,731
KAGOME, DON'T YOU GET TIRED
OF BEING WITH THIS GUY?

17
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:27,764
- UH-OH.
- YOU--
- DON'T BE SO RUDE

18
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,197
TO MY POOR FRIEND, KOGA.

19
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,931
YOU SEE, HE'S NOT
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

20
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,931
HE JUST GETS UPTIGHT
WHEN YOU COME AROUND,

21
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:36,331
BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO STEAL KAGOME AWAY.

22
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,031
- SAVE IT!
- OWWW!

23
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,397
- TRUE AS THAT MAY BE,
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

24
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:44,197
- YOU REALLY NEED TO GROW UP,
MUTT FACE.

25
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,097
- YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHERE NARAKU LIVES?

26
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,597
IF I KNEW THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE WASTING MY TIME
BATTLING HIS DEMONS.

27
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,331
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?

28
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,664
- IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND.

29
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:03,097
NARAKU'S PROJECTED A BARRIER
AROUND HIS CASTLE.

30
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,597
LET US AVENGE THE DEATH
OF YOUR COMRADES.

31
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:09,831
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU HAND OVER
THOSE JEWEL SHARDS IN YOUR LEGS.

AND HIGHTAIL IT BACK
TO YOUR DEN!

YOU'RE SWINGING YOUR SWORD
AWFULLY SLOWLY.
[GRUNTS]

35
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:23,097
- THE TETSUSAIGA'S
STILL TOO HEAVY FOR HIM.

- AND IT WON'T GET
ANY LIGHTER OVERNIGHT.

00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,397
- COME BACK AND FIGHT!

00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:32,531
- SORRY, DOG BREATH,
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME
TO WASTE SPARRING WITH YOU

JUST RAN AWAY FROM A BATTLE

[SIGH]

- HIS JEALOUSY
IS FLATTERING, SURE,

IF HE WAS A BIT NICER.

OF BEING WITH ME?

ALL DEPRESSED FOR?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT
KOGA TOLD YOU, INUYASHA.

IDENTICAL TO KAGURA'S.

COULDN'T BE BETTER.

I'M THE ONE WHO'S GOING

HE MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.

139

- EVEN IF NARAKU
WAS A DEMON PUPPET,

IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
HE JUST BEHEADED HIS OWN ALLY.

- PERHAPS NO ONE IS HIS ALLY.

00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:09,997
- THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NARAKU

143
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,997
KEPT HIM SHACKLED AND BRIDLED.

00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,997
HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO DODGE MY ATTACK.

00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,531
IS THIS A TRAP?

NO, THAT DEMON'S ALL BRAWN.

00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,831
DID HIS ARMS JUST GROW?

161
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,997
CAN HE TRANSFORM OR SOMETHING?

162
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,264
- DID YOU FIND NARAKU?

163
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,797
- YEAH.
HOW COME YOU CAME BACK?

164
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,264
- DON'T TELL ME YOU RAN AWAY.
- HA.
NO CHANCE.

165
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:11,997
THAT NARAKU BROUGHT ANOTHER
STUPID-LOOKING SIDEKICK
ALONG WITH HIM.

166
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,264
- THAT GUY GAVE ME
A BAD FEELING,

167
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:16,531
AND I'VE LEARNED
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

168
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,264
I BET INUYASHA WISHES
HE'D DONE THE SAME.

169
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:23,731
HE'S PROBABLY GETTING
BEATEN TO A PULP BY JUROMARU
