1
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,381
>> WHAT THE HECK ARE

2
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:10,147
THOSE THINGS?

3
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:17,514
>> SHIPPO, KIRARA, GET DOWN!

4
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,736
WHAT THE...

5
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:36,014
DAMN IT.

6
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,381
>> GRRR!

7
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,447
QUIT JUMPING AROUND SO MUCH.

8
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:40,514
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR FRIENDS

9
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:44,281
TO DIE ALONE, NOW, DO YOU?

10
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,947
>> YOU ARE AWAKE.

11
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,114
I'M SO GLAD.

12
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:49,555
NOW JUST RELAX AND RECUPERATE.

13
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,547
>> A SACRED JEWEL SHARD?

14
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,047
THEN THIS MAN IS ONE OF THE BAND

15
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:07,281
OF 7?

16
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,381
>> WHAT DO I DO?

17
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,381
I KNOW I CAN'T USE

18
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:10,981
THE WIND SCAR.

19
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:15,781
SO WHAT CAN I...

20
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:21,981
I GOT AN IDEA.

21
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,947
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED DOWN.

22
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:30,747
IT'S USELESS.

23
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,481
>> UP HERE, CREEP!

24
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,014
>> HUH?

25
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,214
WIND SCAR!

26
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:47,181
>> [SCREAMING]

27
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:53,481
KAGOME...

28
00:03:53,481 --> 00:04:03,014
HANG IN THERE, KAGOME.

29
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,108
I KNOW THIS SMELL.

30
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,242
IT'S THE SMELL OF DEAD BODIES

31
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:20,042
AND GRAVEYARD DIRT.

32
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,308
DOES THAT MEAN ONE OF THE BAND

33
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,708
OF 7 IS JUST UP AHEAD?

34
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,430
NO, IT'S DIFFERENT.

35
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:49,542
I'M VERY CLOSE.

36
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:56,808
>> HMM?

37
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,375
TELL ME, ARE YOU INUYASHA

38
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,942
BY ANY CHANCE?

39
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:00,842
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

40
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,342
TO ARRIVE.

41
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:12,708
>> WAITING FOR ME?

42
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:22,175
HUH?

43
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,742
GOOD, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

44
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:24,742
>> I TAKE IT THAT YOU'RE BEING

45
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,175
PURSUED.

46
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,608
>> WHO ARE YOU?

47
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,808
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM THE HEAD

48
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,942
MONK OF THIS TOWN.

49
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,375
LATELY THERE HAS BEEN TALK IN

50
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,175
THE VILLAGE NEARBY THAT THE

51
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:38,875
SPIRITS OF THE BAND OF 7 WHO

52
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,275
WERE AMBUSHED AND PUT TO DEATH

53
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,142
OVER 10 YEARS AGO HAVE SOMEHOW

54
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,675
BEEN RESURRECTED, BRINGING GREAT

55
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,808
CALAMITY TO THIS REGION.

56
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:49,008
>> SO HE KNOWS OF THEM.

57
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,142
>> THE DEAD THAT YOU SAW ME

58
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,508
BURYING WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED

59
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:52,775
WERE BURNED TO DEATH BY THESE

60
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,275
RESURRECTED SPIRITS.

61
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,942
>> AND YET YOU SOMEHOW SURVIVED

62
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:57,808
THE ATTACK?

63
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,308
>> I WAS FILLED WITH SUCH FEAR

64
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,708
THAT I HID LIKE A COWARD BEHIND

65
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,408
A STATUE OF BUDDHA.

66
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:06,475
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE BEING

67
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:09,608
PURSUED BY THESE 7 EVIL SPIRITS.

68
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,308
>> LOOK, I'M NOT BEING PURSUED.

69
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,175
I'M THE ONE DOING THE PURSUING.

70
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:14,475
SO GET IT STRAIGHT.

71
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,308
>> I MEANT YOU NO OFFENSE.

72
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,842
BUT PLEASE ANSWER ME THIS.

73
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,575
WHY HAS THE BAND OF 7

74
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,408
BEEN RESURRECTED?

75
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:26,908
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT?

76
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,575
>> AS YOU KNOW, I SERVE BUDDHA,

77
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:29,642
BUT I WAS HELPLESS TO STOP

78
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:32,575
THE SLAUGHTER OF MY BRETHREN.

79
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,175
AND SO I WISH TO MAKE AMENDS.

80
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:36,475
IF I'M ABLE, I WISH TO PUT AT

81
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,842
PEACE THE SOULS OF THE DEAD.

82
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:43,642
>> THE SMELL.

83
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:45,375
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,875
THIS IS NO BUSINESS FOR A MONK

85
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,008
LIKE YOU.

86
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,975
I DEFINITELY SMELL A LIVING

87
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,675
PERSON.

88
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,908
THE OTHER SMELL MUST BE FROM

89
00:06:53,908 --> 00:07:00,342
THE PEOPLE HE BURIED OUTSIDE.

90
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,208
>> WHAT IS THAT?

91
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:08,342
TAKE ME DOWN LOWER, BIRD.

92
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,175
YEP, I'D RECOGNIZE THAT SWAMP

93
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:11,675
OF DEVASTATION ANYWHERE.

94
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:12,742
THAT'S THE AFTER EFFECT OF

95
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:15,008
MASTER INUYASHA'S WIND SCAR.

96
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:16,675
OOH, I GUESS MASTER INUYASHA

97
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,008
DIDN'T COME NORTH SIMPLY TO

98
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,375
ENJOY THE DELIGHTFUL HOT SPRINGS

99
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:26,075
AND MOUNTAIN SCENERY.

100
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:26,942
AAH!

101
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,108
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING?

102
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,008
FLY HIGHER!

103
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:29,975
FLY HIGHER!

104
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:39,108
[SCREAMING]

105
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,008
FLY AWAY!

106
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:40,708
FLY AWAY!

107
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:48,642
GET GOING, YOU STUPID CROW!

108
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:49,775
>> KOGA, PLEASE!

109
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,075
WAIT FOR US!

110
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,008
>> WHEN IT'S FOR KAGOME,

111
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:57,508
HE ALWAYS RUNS SO MUCH FASTER.

112
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:00,808
>> WHERE IS INUYASHA'S SCENT?

113
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:01,742
WAIT.

114
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:02,708
IT'S THE SMELL

115
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:07,608
OF GRAVEYARD DIRT.

116
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,808
>> SOMEONE NAMED NARAKU

117
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,808
CALLED FORTH THE DEAD SOULS.

118
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,842
TELL ME, WHO IS THIS NARAKU?

119
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,742
>> HE'S SORT OF LIKE A DEMON.

120
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,542
>> HOW DO YOU MEAN "SORT OF?"

121
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,008
>> NARAKU IS NOT A COMPLETE

122
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,808
DEMON.

123
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,775
RIGHT NOW, I WOULD IMAGINE

124
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,608
HE'S HIDING HIMSELF SOMEWHERE.

125
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:30,542
HE'S UNDERGOING ANOTHER

126
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,042
TRANSFORMATION AND INCREASING

127
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,108
HIS POWER.

128
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:35,642
AND HE'S USING THE BAND OF 7

129
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:44,075
AS A DECOY TO BUY TIME.

130
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:47,775
HUH?

131
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:53,608
>> [GRUNTS]

132
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:54,742
>> THAT SOUNDED A LOT

133
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,775
LIKE GINKOTSU.

134
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,808
HOW IN THE HECK COULD HE STILL

135
00:08:56,808 --> 00:09:01,475
BE ALIVE?

136
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,675
LISTEN, MONK, IF YOU WANT

137
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:12,508
TO STAY ALIVE, STAY HIDDEN.

138
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,308
>> DAMN, GINKOTSU.

139
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,408
HE SHOULD HAVE WAITED LONGER

140
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,408
BEFORE COMING.

141
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,642
I'VE LEARNED ONE IMPORTANT

142
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,375
THING, THOUGH.

143
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:33,608
NARAKU CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

144
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:38,942
>> YOU CAN ALL DIE NOW.

145
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,342
>> INUYASHA!

146
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:44,108
>> GINKOTSU!

147
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,908
THIS TIME I'M GONNA TAKE YOU

148
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,542
DOWN.

149
00:09:47,542 --> 00:10:01,075
>> GRRR!

150
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:03,842
>> THOSE METAL THREADS AGAIN.

151
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:05,808
>> I GOTCHA.

152
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,242
>> IF YOU THINK THESE THINGS

153
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:11,208
CAN HOLD ME DOWN...

154
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:22,608
THEN THINK AGAIN!

155
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,642
HUH.

156
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:26,108
YOU HAD IT COMING TO YOU.

157
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,775
I SMELL SMOKE.

158
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,808
KAGOME.

159
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:36,542
HUH?

160
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,908
>> [LAUGHS]

161
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:41,375
I AM RENKOTSU OF THE BAND OF 7.

162
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,242
>> WHY, YOU...

163
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,308
LIAR.

164
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,475
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

165
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:46,708
HE SMELLS LIKE AN ORDINARY

166
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,275
HUMAN.

167
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,042
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, INUYASHA?

168
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,342
I DARE SAY YOU LOOK JUST

169
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:53,408
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

170
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:54,575
YOUR NOSE IS EXTREMELY

171
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,475
SENSITIVE.

172
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,608
AM I RIGHT?

173
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:57,808
I HONESTLY THOUGHT YOU WERE ON

174
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,008
TO ME EARLIER.

175
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,108
BUT THEN I SUSPECT THAT I DIDN'T

176
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,675
EMANATE THE SCENT OF DEAD BODIES

177
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,808
OR GRAVEYARD DIRT.

178
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:06,442
AM I CORRECT, INUYASHA?

179
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,408
>> DAMN IT.

180
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,342
I GET IT.

181
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:13,142
IT'S THIS PLACE.

182
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:14,642
>> IT SEEMS THAT TAKING OVER

183
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,475
THIS TEMPLE WAS A WISE MOVE.

184
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,008
IT'S SURROUNDED BY GRAVEYARD

185
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:19,275
DIRT, OF COURSE.

186
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,542
SO YOU WOULDN'T REALIZE

187
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,508
THE SCENT CAME FROM ME.

188
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,708
I WORE THE CLOTHING THAT THE

189
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,575
REAL MONK KINDLY LEFT BEHIND.

190
