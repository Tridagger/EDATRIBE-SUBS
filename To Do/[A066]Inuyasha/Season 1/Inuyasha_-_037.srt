[GROANS]

346
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,730
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE
AND QUICK.

347
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,697
- OK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

348
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,530
KOGA, TAKE MY ARM.

349
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,397
- HEY! COME BACK!

350
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,463
COWARDS!

351
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:33,863
WHY'D YOU LET THEM GO?

352
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:36,330
- HE WASN'T FIT TO FIGHT.
KOGA WAS HURT.

353
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,897
HE WAS GOOD TO ME,
SO I RETURNED THE FAVOR.

354
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,163
- GOOD TO YOU?
ARE YOU NUTS?

355
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:44,030
DON'T TELL ME YOU GET OFF
ON THAT KIND OF THING!

356
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,997
YOU WERE KIDNAPPED
AND ALMOST KILLED!

357

358
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,997
HE, UH, PROTECTED ME
A LOT, YOU KNOW.

359
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,030
- YOU THINK SHE'S DEVELOPED
FEELINGS FOR HIM?

360
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,263
- HOW COULD SHE RESIST?

361
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:57,897
HE'S LAVISHED HER WITH
BOLD DECLARATIONS
OF LOVE AND LOYALTY.

00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:12,530
- THE BIRD OF PARADISE TORE
ONE OF THESE FROM KOGA'S ARM.

366
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:15,597
- WON'T HE COME AFTER US
IN SEARCH FOR IT?

367
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,630
- PROBABLY.

368
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:19,163
- I WONDER IF KOGA AND INUYASHA
WILL KEEP FIGHTING

369
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,830
OR IF THEY CAN GET OVER
THEIR DIFFERENCES.

370
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:23,763
- KAGOME.

371
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:27,063
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TO CALM DOWN INUYASHA?

372
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,330
- HUH?

373
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:31,197

AND THIS WHOLE EVENT UPSET HIM.

374
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,797
- I FEEL BAD FOR HIM,
CONSIDERING HOW THINGS ENDED UP.

IT IF I DIDN'T SHOW UP AT ALL.

DOESN'T TAKE MUCH, DOES IT?
A FEW SWEET WORDS.

380
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,730
- WHAT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH?

381
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,030
DOES IT BUG YOU THAT
KOGA SAID HE LOVED ME?

382
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:58,130
IS THAT IT?
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE JEALOUS.
