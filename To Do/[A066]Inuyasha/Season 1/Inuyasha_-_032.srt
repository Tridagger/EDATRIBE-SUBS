1
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,994
- OH, I'M TIRED.

2
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:27,327
- AT LEAST WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

3
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:28,994
- I'M A FARMER,
NOT A SOLDIER.

4
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:31,860
- RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST
HAPPY TO BE BREATHING.

5
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:36,094
- WHICH WE WOULDN'T BE,
IF NOT FOR THAT PRIESTESS.

6
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:40,627
- LET'S GIVE THANKS
FOR HER, HUH?

7
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,027
[MOANING]

8
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,394
LOOK! HEY!
I THINK HE'S WAKING UP!

9
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:45,894
- GOOD NEWS.
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

10
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,794
[CHUCKLES]
GUESS HER MEDICINE
DID THE TRICK.

11
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:53,060
- PRIESTESS! LOOK!
OUR FRIEND HERE IS ALIVE!

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,327
- NEE!

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
- STILL, EVIL SEEKS
THIS MAN'S LIFE.

14
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:14,994
- PRIESTESS, YOU OK?

15
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,027
- YOUR FRIEND
WILL BE JUST FINE,

16
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,194
MAY EVEN BE UP
AS EARLY AS TOMORROW.

17
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:25,194
- WE ARE SEEKING
THE PRIESTESS CALLED KIKYO!

18
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:33,160
- THE MEN TELL ME OF ONE
WHO TENDS TO SOLDIERS

19
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:37,627
INJURED ON BOTH SIDES OF BATTLE,
WHOSE STRANGE MAGICS CAN REVIVE

20
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,527
EVEN THOSE
ON THE BRINK OF DEATH.

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,794
- I AM SKILLED IN NO SUCH MAGICS
BUT ONLY IN THE ART OF HEALING.

22
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,327
- WE SHALL HEAR
MORE AT THE CASTLE.

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,594
PREPARE TO LEAVE.

24
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:58,494
- LORD KAGEWAKI,
MASTER OF THE HITOMI CLAN,

25
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,394
HAS BEEN IN DELICATE
HEALTH SINCE BIRTH.

26
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:04,960
SINCE HIS FATHER'S DEATH
AND OWN SUCCESSION,

27
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,660
HIS HEALTH HAS WORSENED.

28
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:13,260
NOW HE REFUSES
BOTH CLAN PHYSICIAN
AND HIS NEAREST VASSALS.

29
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,294
- NONE MAY ENTER.
I'M SORRY.

30
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:19,760
- BUT I HAVE BROUGHT
THE PRIESTESS WHO WILL
CURE LORD KAGEWAKI.

31
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,094
- THE LORD HAS FORBIDDEN
ENTRY TO ANYONE.

32
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,427
FURTHER, HE REFUSES
ALL VISITORS...

33
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,727
- I SENSE
A GREAT WRONGNESS,

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,527
ALMOST A VEIL.

35
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,727
- WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU--

36
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,860
- SO, HE'S THE LORD.

37
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:50,027
HE HAS NO LIFE IN HIM, AS THOUGH
HE IS DEAD FROM THE NECK DOWN.

38
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,527
- KIKYO.

39
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,660
- WE HAVE FAILED, MY LORD.
FORGIVE US.

40
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:03,460
SHE'S COME DESPITE
YOUR ORDERS.

41
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,194
- SHE CLAIMS SHE CAN
HEAL YOU, MY LORD.

42
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,294
- BE QUIET.

43
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,594
LEAVE ME!

44
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,160
- YES, LORD.

45
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:14,927
- TELL ME YOUR NAME,
NOW THAT YOU'VE DISTURBED ME.

46
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,094
- MY NAME IS KIKYO.

47
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:21,027
- KIKYO IS ALIVE.

48
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,360
THE WOMAN I MYSELF
TRAPPED 50 YEARS AGO.

49
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:30,660
THE WOMAN WHO DIED, TAKING
THE SACRED JEWEL WITH HER.

50
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:33,927
HOW CAN SHE BE--

51
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,460
[THUNDER]

52
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,460
- HUH?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

53
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:44,494
- OVER HERE, TOO.
ALL DRIED UP.

54
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:48,860
- BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF RAIN.

55
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,794
- IT STARTED ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

56
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:53,360
- OH.
- IT'S RAIN!

57
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:57,227
- THAT'S NOT RAIN.
- AND IT'S RED, LIKE BLOOD.

58
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,860
WHAT IN THE NAME OF--

59
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,460
[SHOUTING]

60
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:09,527
- RAINING DEMON PARTS, WAS IT?

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,727
HOW ODD.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,127
- IT WAS AWFUL!

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,960
AND NOT JUST THAT.

64
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,960
IT COMPLETELY RUINED
ALL OF OUR FIELDS.

65
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:19,227
- WOULD THAT IT WERE
ONLY THE FIELDS.

66
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,027
THE OLD, THE YOUNG, THE WEAK--
SO MANY HAVE BECOME SICKENED.

67
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,160
- I SHOULD THINK SO.

68
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:30,727
I AM DEFINITELY DETECTING
AN EVIL PRESENCE IN THIS AREA.

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,127
LEAVE IT TO ME.

70
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,994
- SO HERE WE COME
TO SAVE THE DAY AGAIN.

71
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,160
DO WE HAVE TIME FOR THIS?

72
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,227
WHAT ABOUT NARAKU, HUH?
OR DOES HE NOT MATTER ANYMORE?

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,894
- I WON'T LET YOU GO!
EVEN IF YOU BEG FOR FORGIVENESS!

74
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:46,960
HA!

75
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,694
- NOBODY'S FORGOTTEN ANYONE,

76
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,694
BUT KAGOME'S ARROW--IT REALLY
DID HIM SOME DAMAGE.

77
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:56,827
EVEN NARAKU WOULD BE
DOWN FOR A WHILE AFTER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

78
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:09,527
BESIDES, I'VE ALREADY
ACCEPTED PAYMENT FOR
SERVICES RENDERED, SO...

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,494
- WHEN'D THAT HAPPEN?

80
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:11,827
- YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET!

81
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,560
THE PAYING PART OF IT DON'T
USUALLY COME UNTIL AFTERWARDS!

82
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:18,794
- IF YOU WAIT, YOU'LL GET
CHEATED ON THE TIP.

83
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,494
- TAKING BRIBES!

84
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,894
- NOT BRIBES.
TITHES.

85
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,827
- HUH? SANGO?

86
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,094
WHAT'S WRONG?

87
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:26,994
- THE MIASMA.

88
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:30,294
I THINK IT'S AT THE BASE
OF THAT MOUNTAIN.

89
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:34,160
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF SOMEONE OTHER THAN NARAKU

90
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,960
COULD PRODUCE SUCH POISON.

91
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,827
- SOMEONE OTHER THAN NARAKU?

92
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:46,127
- WELL, KIKYO?
HE'S BEYOND YOUR HELP THEN?

93
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,860
- YES. I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO.

94
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:53,660
- REALLY. SO IT IS
NO ORDINARY ILLNESS.

95
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:56,760
YOU, TOO, WILL ABANDON HIM.

96
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,394
- I AM MERELY A PRIESTESS.

97
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:02,494
MIGHTN'T I BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE?

98
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:05,994
HMM?

99
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,394
- YOU MOST CERTAINLY MAY NOT BE
ALLOWED TO LEAVE THIS PLACE.

100
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:12,727
IT IS THE LORD'S WISH
THAT YOU STAY.

101
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,027
- HMM.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,727
- KIKYO OUGHT
TO HAVE DIED.

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,860
I'LL KILL HER AGAIN,

104
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:23,494
BUT NOT UNTIL I'VE
DISCOVERED HER TRUE SELF.

105
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:27,394
TONIGHT MY DREAMS
BECOME REALITY,

106
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:31,260
AND WHO BETTER
THAN SHE TO SEE THEM.

107
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,927
- THE POISON EVEN
KILLED THE GRASS.

108
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,960
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

109
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,827
WHATEVER'S GOING ON HERE,
I DON'T LIKE IT.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,294
HUH?

111
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:55,260
- LOOK! I THINK THAT'S WHERE
THE MIASMA'S COMING FROM.

[COUGHING]

113
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,327
SANGO?

[COUGHING]

115
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:00,960
ARE YOU OK?

116
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:03,727
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
YOU'RE STILL SICK.

117
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,527
- SANGO, KAGOME,
YOU STAY HERE.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
IT'S JUST A DEMON HUNT.

119
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:10,760
THERE'S NO SENSE
DRAGGING EVERYONE ALONG.

120
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,960
MIROKU, YOU COMING?

121
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,960
- YOU SEEM RESISTANT
TO THE POISON, SHIPPO.

122
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,360
WILL YOU LOOK AFTER THINGS?

123
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,060
- LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.

124
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,294
BUT PROMISE YOU'LL BE CAREFUL.

125
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,694
THAT MIASMA'S PRETTY STRONG.

126
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,027
- I CAN FEEL IT,

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,194
THE PULL OF A STRONG
MIASMA COMING CLOSER.

128
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,760
- AAH! AAH!

129
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,560
- OPEN UP.

130
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,727
AFTER THAT, BRING ME
A BOW AND AN ARROW.

131
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,927
- THE POISON IS
GETTING WORSE, SANGO.

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,060
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

133
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,760
- I'M OK.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

134
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:03,360
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M FINE.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,794
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
IT'S LIKE I'M BEING PULLED IN.

00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,560
SOMETHING REALLY BAD
MUST BE HAPPENING.

137
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:16,894
- I WISH INUYASHA AND MIROKU
WEREN'T IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

138
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,594
- WE REALLY MUST BE
CLOSE BY NOW.

TO GO A BIT SLOWER.

- BUT...WHY ARE THEY
FIGHTING EACH OTHER?

156

- THERE MUST HAVE
BEEN A BATTLE,

157
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,527
HUNDREDS OF THEM FIGHTING,
KILLING, DYING.

158
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,227
THE LOSERS' BODIES
WERE THROWN INTO HERE.

159
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,327
WHAT'S LEFT OF
THEIR BODIES, THAT IS.

160
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,960
- BUT THERE'S GOT
TO BE A REASON.

161
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,160
- SO THEN THE LAST ONE
STANDING--

162
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:12,060
- GETS TO KEEP ALL THE PARTS.

THE PROMISE WAS THAT
THE FINAL WINNER

00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,260
WOULD LEAVE
THIS PLACE ALIVE.

- OH, NO!
