EXACTLY WHAT DID

BUT TSUKUYOMARU WAS
NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.

00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:15,474
MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER WAS
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER DEMONS.

00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,307
HE DID NOT KILL HUMANS,

127
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,574
AND AFTER SHIORI WAS BORN,

128
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:21,307
THE OTHER BATS STOPPED
ATTACKING OUR VILLAGE.

129
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:25,274

THEM TO DO SO.

NO ONE TO STOP THEM.

134

TAIGOKUMARU, CAME TO SEE ME.

139
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:05,441
HE PROMISED TO LEAVE
OUR VILLAGE ALONE

140
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,941
IF I GAVE HIM MY DAUGHTER.

141
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,874
YOU SEE, HE AND SHIORI'S FATHER

142
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:11,174
WERE GUARDIANS OF THE BARRIER,

143
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:14,241
A DUTY PASSED DOWN
THROUGH GENERATIONS.

144
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:15,874
AS TSUKUYOMARU'S DAUGHTER,

145
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:20,541
SHIORI HAD INHERITED
HIS GUARDIAN POWERS.

146
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:23,374
- HUH?

147
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,574
- BUT WHY DID IT HAVE TO
BE YOUR DAUGHTER SHIORI?

148
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,074
IF HER GRANDFATHER HAD
THE GUARDIAN POWER ALREADY,

149
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,141
THEN HOW COME--

150
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,141
- THEIR POWER TO CREATE
THE BARRIER WANES WITH AGE,

151
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:36,007
AND ONCE THE GUARDIAN
PASSES ON HIS DUTY,

152
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,474
HE LOSES THE POWER.

153
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,474
- IN OTHER WORDS,

154
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:40,274
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR DAUGHTER
IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT

155
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:44,174
WHO HAS THE POWER TO
PROTECT THE BARRIER.

156
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,574
- EWW!

157
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,474
LOOK AT THE DEMON GIRL!

158
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,274
HA HA HA!

159
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:52,141
- SHE'S A HALF-DEMON!

160
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,541
- UNH!

161
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:56,141
- [LAUGHTER]

162
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:14,441
- [CRYING]

163
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,607
I'M HOME, MOMMY.

164
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,041
- WELCOME HOME, DEAR.

165
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:24,774
SHIORI, HOW DID YOU GET ALL
THOSE CUTS ON YOUR FACE?

166
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,107
- IT'S NOTHING.

167
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,907
I JUST FELL ON THE BEACH.

168
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,474
- [CRYING]

169
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,407
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:38,274
I TOLD YOU, I JUST FELL,
THAT'S ALL.

171
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:41,241
- SHIORI, I'M SO SORRY.

00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,807
- [CRYING]

173
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,274
- I AGONIZED OVER WHAT TO DO,

174
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:54,741
BUT IN THE END, I GAVE
MY GIRL TO TAIGOKUMARU.

00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:57,674
- [SHOUTING]

176
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:00,074

177
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:02,441
- AS PROMISED, I BROUGHT SHIORI.

IN RETURN, NEVER ATTACK
OUR VILLAGE AGAIN.

180
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,007
- YOU MUST GO WITH HIM, SHIORI.

181

YOU'LL BE HAPPIER WITH THEM.

IS A HALF-DEMON, RIGHT?

189
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:39,674
- HOW CAN A HALF-DEMON CHILD
HAVE SUCH POWERS?

190
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:42,674

- HMPH. DON'T KNOW.

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,330
- HALF-BREED?

357
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:58,830
MOTHER...

358
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:01,730
WHAT'S A HALF-BREED?

359
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,697
- INUYASHA?

360
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,130
- HUH?

361
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:10,197
IT'S YOU.

362
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:14,697
- I GUESS YOU'RE PROBABLY
THINKING ABOUT SHIORI.

363
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,697
- NOT JUST HER.

364
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,363
- YOU'VE GOT A BIG HEART,
YOU KNOW.

365
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,430
- COME ON, KAGOME.

366
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,263
DON'T BE STUPID.

367
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:24,397
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD.

368
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,663
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT
MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE.

369
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:32,863
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

370
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:34,830
I THINK...

371
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:36,263
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

372
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:38,930
I MEAN, MIROKU AND SANGO,
SHIPPO,

YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALL THINK?

375
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,630
- YEAH, I KNOW.

376
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,797
- WHAT A GOOD BOY.

377
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,297
- STOP TREATING ME LIKE A DOG!

378
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,763
HUH?

379
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,530

00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,972
SO PLEASE SPARE MY MOMMY
AND THE VILLAGERS.

387
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,106
- LITTLE SHIORI--
SO YOUNG AND SINCERE.

388
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:08,572
UNLESS INUYASHA KILLS
THIS INNOCENT CHILD,

389
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,806
THE TETSUSAIGA CAN'T
INCREASE ITS POWER.

390
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,739
THERE'S NO WAY INUYASHA COULD
DO SUCH A HORRIBLE THING.

391
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:15,506
- WAIT.

392
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,172
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

393
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:21,472

THE TETSUSAIGA.
