>> I SEE.

197
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,301
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE A GREAT

198

DEMON WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE.

199
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,601
I'M QUITE IMPRESSED AND

200
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,034
SURPRISED YOU STILL HAVE THE

201
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:32,801

205
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,901
>> KAGOME'S ARROW!

208
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:47,234
>> UH, YEAH.

209
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,901
THANK YOU.

210
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:52,968
HUH?

211
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,001
THE LIGHT FROM THE SHARD HAS

212
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:58,601
TURNED JET BLACK.

213
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,834
THE IMPURITY FROM THE JEWEL

214
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:00,768

217
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,268
IT WOULD SEEM YOU HAVE HELPED

218
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,568
ME OUT IMMENSELY.

219
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:09,568
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD WAS

220
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,234
HIDDEN DEEP IN THE ARMOR OF

221
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:12,501
ADAMANT AND PROTECTED BY HIS

222
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,734
DEMONIC POWERS.

223
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,268
AS CORRUPT AS I AM, IT WAS EVEN

224
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,768
BEYOND MY REACH.

225
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:17,868
>> SO THE ONLY REASON YOU COULD

226
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,168
GET IT IS BECAUSE WE SHATTERED

227
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,401
HOUSENKI'S BODY?

228
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:21,734
>> HEH HEH HEH!

229
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,068
YOU BROKE OPEN HOUSENKI'S

230
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,301
ARMOR, AND HOUSENKI IN TURN

231
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,234
WOUNDED INUYASHA.

232
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,968
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD REACTED

233
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:30,701
TO ALL THAT HATRED AND BECAME

234
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,968
EVEN MORE TAINTED.

235
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:34,968
>> IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAD THIS

236
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:36,734
WHOLE THING PLANNED IN ADVANCE.

237
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,701
>> YES. MY PLAN WORKED

PERFECTLY.

239
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,068
>> EERGH.

240

>> THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD WANTS

241
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:51,368
TO BECOME WHOLE.

242
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,034
>> WASN'T THAT THE WINDSCAR?

243
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,801
>> THAT MUST MEAN HE'S BACK!

RIGHT!

248

257
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:19,768
OUT OF YOUR HOLE.

258
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:20,801
THIS IS THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN

259
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,668

>> THINK HE CAN DO IT?

265
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:34,868
IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF VICTORY

266
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,768
WITH THAT ATTACK?

267
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,301

00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,483
>> NICE SHOT, SANGO.

379
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,183
>> THAT MUST MEANS HE'S

380
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:33,783
VULNERABLE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER.

381
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,850
>> A MIASMA.

382
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,216
>> YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

383
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,516
>> OH, NO. THE MIASMA WILL HARM

384
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,583
INUYASHA IN HIS WEAKENED STATE.

385
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:49,416
>> [COUGHING]

386
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,916
>> HEH HEH HEH!

387
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,983
FINALLY, I HAVE IT IN MY GRASP,

388
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:54,583
THE LAST SHARD OF THE SACRED

389
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,450
JEWEL.

390
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,583
>> THE LAST SHARD?

391
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,916
UNH!

392
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,783
AAH!

393
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,150
>> I HAVE NO USE FOR YOU

394
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,216
ANYMORE.

395
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:11,350
>> YOU WON'T ESCAPE.

396
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,583
>> SAIMYOSHO!

397
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,683
>> MIROKU, YOU CAN'T USE THE

398
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:14,916
WIND TUNNEL.

399
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,916
>> HEH HEH HEH!

400
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,316
CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF.

401
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:18,650
WILL IT BE A QUICK DEATH FROM

402
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,083
SUCKING IN THE POISONOUS

403
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,316
SAIMYOSHO, OR WOULD YOU PREFER

404
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,283
TO STAY IN THIS GRAVEYARD AND

405
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,616
LIVE FOR ALL ETERNITY?

406
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:26,750
>> FOR ETERNITY?

407
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,016
>> IN THIS GRAVEYARD?

408
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:28,750
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,

409
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,216
NARAKU?

410
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,283
>> THE RIVER OF BLOOD THAT YOU

411
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,050
AND I CROSSED HAS ALREADY

412
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,083
CEASED TO FLOW.

413
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,416
YOU CANNOT RETURN TO THE WORLD

414
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,850
OF MEN FROM WHENCE YOU CAME.

415
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,516
>> YOU SEE?

416
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,716
I TOLD YOU WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

417
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,050
TO RETURN.

418
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,283
>> YOU SAY THE PATH IS CLOSED,

419
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,250
BUT I DOUBT IT.

420
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,683
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING BACK.

421
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,383
>> YES, I SHALL.

422
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,316
I ALONE.

423
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,983
>> NARAKU'S SO SMUG.

424
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,516
I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF HIS

425
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,883
ATTITUDE.

426
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,916
NARAKU, DON'T THINK YOU'RE

427
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,550
GONNA GET AWAY.

428
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,850
>> DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,

429
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,983
INUYASHA?

430
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,950
IT'S ALL OVER.

431
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,983
HMM?

432
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:13,850
HUH?

433
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,283
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

434
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,683
>> SESSHOMARU.

435
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,283
>> SESSHOMARU?

436
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:25,550
>> HUH?

437
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,416
>> HOW DID HE GET HERE?

438
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,450
SESSHOMARU, DID YOU RUSH OVER

439
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,783
TO SAVE YOUR KID BROTHER?

440
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,350
SUCH A KIND SIBLING, COMING TO

441
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:48,316
THE RESCUE.

442
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:55,883
>> WHAT'S SESSHOMARU DOING HERE?

443
00:20:55,883 --> 00:21:03,350
HUH?

444
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,316
>> INUYASHA.

445
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,150
>> HUH?

446
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,950
>> COME ON.

447
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,316
>> HUH?

448
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:15,483
INUYASHA!

449
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,483
>> WHY YOU?

450
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,383
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

451
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,050
>> HOW DARE YOU, A HALF-DEMON,

452
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,650
DEFILE FATHER'S FINAL RESTING

453
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,450
PLACE?

454
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,383
>> OHH!

455
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:33,150
>> HMM.

456
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:40,250
>> HMM.

457
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,350
VERMIN.

458
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:50,383
>> HEH HEH HEH.

459
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,683
>> LORD SESSHOMARU.

460
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:53,683
>> DAMN IT.

461
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:54,916
>> YOUNG ONE.

462
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,050
>> HUH?

463
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,416
>> DO YOU STILL HAVE THE

464
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,483
STRENGTH TO FIGHT?

465
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,604
>> HUH?

466

00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,704
MIASMA WILL INCREASE, AND

469
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,704
EVENTUALLY, EVERYONE HERE WILL

470
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:02,737
PERISH.

471
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,104
>> I'M NOT SO SENTIMENTAL AS TO

472
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,804
HOLD BACK MY SWORD FOR THE SAKE

473
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,104
OF MERE HUMANS.

479
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,971
BREAK THROUGH NARAKU'S BARRIER.
