00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:35,198
INSIDE THIS MONSTER,
THE REAL LORD'S HEART
IS STILL BEATING.

357
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:36,098
- WHY YOU--

358
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:39,131
MOVE IT LITTLE MAN,
OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO.

359
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,298
- PLEASE, DON'T!

360
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,564
- THEN MOVE IT.

361
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,298
- I CAN'T.

362
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,364
I CANNOT LET YOU KILL HIM

363
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:46,064
WHILE THE REAL LORD'S

364
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,731
BESIDES, EVEN IF
IT WASN'T IN THERE,

365
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:51,331
I CAN'T APPROVE
OF YOUR TAKING LIFE.

366
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:52,498
- NOBUNAGA...

367
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:57,898
- I REALIZE IT'S CRAZY
IN TODAY'S WORLD
TO FEEL THIS WAY,

368
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:59,431
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT.

369
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,464
I CAN'T!

370
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,598
- HMM.

371
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,231
HMM.

372
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:12,898
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

373
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,731
I'LL LET YOU
SETTLE IT YOURSELF.

374
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:17,731
THE RESPONSIBILITY
IS YOURS NOW.

375
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,131
HMPH!

376
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,831

- PRINCESS TSUYU.

388
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:53,798
- LADY KAGOME,
TAKE THE PRINCESS.

389
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,331
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

390
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:57,698

- WELL, HOW 'BOUT IT?

395
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,798
YOU WANT I SHOULD
KILL HIM YET?

396
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:18,298
- NO. NO KILLING.

397
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,564
- IDIOT.

398
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,631
- PRINCESS.

399
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,164

400
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,258
- THINK.

401
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,525
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

402
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,925
- A MONSTER TOAD
IS STILL JUST A TOAD.

403
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,125
TRY SOMETHING HOT.

404
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,491
- HOT?

405
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,591
- LIKE HOT WATER
OR SOMETHING.

406
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,491

407
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,425
- WELL, SURE.

408
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,258
DISTRACT THE TOAD,
AND THE LORD CAN COME OUT.

409
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,758
- TELL ME,
HOW DO YOU SUGGEST
I GET THIS HOT WATER?

410
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,558

IS THERE, LIKE,
A TORCH OR SOMETHING
AROUND HERE?

416
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,558

I'M GONNA EAT
BOTH OF YOU!

421
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,858
- WHAT A SMART MONKEY
YOU ARE!

00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:25,891
IF ONLY IT WEREN'T SO SMALL.

423
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,725

424
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,725
- AAH!

425
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,625
- YOU STILL IN THERE,
TOAD LORD?

- KAGOME, I'M SORRY,

428
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:42,658
BUT MERCY'S A LUXURY
WE CANNOT AFFORD.

429
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:43,758
- LUXURY?

430
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,558
THEN...I KNOW!

431
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,458
AS IN HAIRSPRAY!

432
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:49,291
IT'LL WORK.

433
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:50,291
I CAN STILL SAVE HIM.

434
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,958
- THIS IS IT--
THE ONLY WAY.

435
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,225
- SIT, BOY!

436
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:00,725

438
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,758
INUYASHA, GET THE JEWEL.

THE LORD IS STILL SAFE.

445
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,825
YOU DROVE OUT THE TOAD.

446
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:28,158
YOU WORRIED ME FOR A BIT,
BUT THEN YOU CAME THROUGH.

447
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:30,058
- ACTUALLY, I, UH...

448
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,791

JUST TO LET HIM BELIEVE IT.

IT'S AS THOUGH
YOU WERE NEVER AWAY.

- HE HAD HIS CHANCE.

460
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,391
- WITH THE TOAD GONE,
ALL THE GIRLS WERE SAFE.

461
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:04,225
ISN'T THAT NICE?

462

EVEN THOUGH HE PRACTICALLY
GOT HIMSELF KILLED,

467
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,458
HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO SAVE THE LIFE

468
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:20,625
OF HIS ONLY ROMANTIC RIVAL.
