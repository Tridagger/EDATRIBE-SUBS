HALF-DEMON,

207
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:56,120

YOU INTO A HUMAN, IT WOULD BE

215
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,286
PURIFIED.

216
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:08,720
THE JEWEL OF THE 4 SOULS WOULD

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,886
PROBABLY CEASE TO EXIST.

>> TOMORROW AT NOON.

244
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
IN FRONT OF THE SACRED TREE

245
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,586
IN THE WESTERN FOREST.

00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:42,853
WAIT FOR ME THERE.

247
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:47,053
I'LL BRING THE SACRED JEWEL.

248
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:51,258
>> I'LL BE THERE.

MEDICINAL HERBS FOR YOUR

282
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,758
WOUNDED EYE.

>> MEDICINAL HERBS?

284
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,025
THERE'S ALREADY LOTS RIGHT HERE.

285

I'M GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK

288
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,791

00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,958
>> NO.

293
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,791
IT'S MUCH BETTER TODAY.

294
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,125
>> THAT'S GOOD.

295
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:51,525
I WON'T BE VERY LONG.

296
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,291
>> AT THAT MOMENT, I FELT

LONELIER THAN I'D EVER FELT

298
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,191
BEFORE.

299
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,691
I WANTED MY SISTER TO STAY

308
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,391
MAYBE HE OVERSLEPT.

309
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:39,225

GREAT DEAL OF PAIN AND SUFFERING

330
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,158
WHEN I USE IT TO SLAUGHTER

363
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,425
NOW THE SACRED JEWEL WILL

364
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,591
BE TAINTED WITH HATRED

365
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:58,125

ALL DEMON AT LAST.

380
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,691
HA, I WON'T LET ANYONE CALL ME

381
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:44,291
A HALF-DEMON AGAIN!

382
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,358
>> DIE, INUYASHA!

383
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,025
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

384
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,191
I TRUSTED YOU.

385
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,858
>> I NEVER DOUBTED YOU,

386
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:56,358
NOT FOR A MINUTE!

387
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:59,691
YET YOU DECEIVED ME.

388
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:17,625
>> INUYASHA!

389
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,791
>> KI--KIKYO.

390
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:26,458
HOW COULD--I THOUGHT--

391
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,958
>> SISTER KIKYO!

392
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
>> KIKYO!

393
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,791
>> WHO DID THIS TO YOU, KIKYO?

394
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,458
>> AM I GONNA DIE LIKE THIS?

395
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791
>> STOP, THAT'S ALL I NEED

396
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
TO HEAR.

397
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,125
>> I GUESS THAT'S OK.

398
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,458
KIKYO, EVEN THOUGH IT ENDED LIKE

399
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:55,825
THIS, I STILL LOVE--

400
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,325
>> THE SACRED JEWEL.

401
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,758
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF THIS.

402
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,525
LISTEN TO ME, KAEDE.

403
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,791
TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL

404
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,591
AND BURN IT WITH MY BODY.

405
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,558
THAT WAY IT WILL NEVER FALL INTO

406
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:15,225
THE HANDS OF EVIL AGAIN.

407
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,725
>> KIKYO!

408
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:21,725
KIKYO!

409
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,558
>> I WILL TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL

410
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:26,856
WITH ME TO THE NETHERWORLD.

411
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,091
>> IT HAS BEEN 50 YEARS SINCE

412
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:35,625
INUYASHA WAS SEALED TO

413
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,158
THE SACRED TREE.

414
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,558
HE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME

415
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,325
AS HE DID THEN.

416
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,658
50 YEARS AGO, MY SISTER KNEW

417
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:46,558
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DIE.

418
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,891
SO WHY DID SHE CHOOSE TO USE

419
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,125
THE ARROW OF SEALING RATHER THAN

420
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,891
A SACRED ARROW TO DESTROY HIM?

421
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,525
WHY DID SHE SEAL INUYASHA TO

422
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,925
THE SACRED TREE--A TREE OF AGES

423
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,591
SAID TO BE ABLE TO TRANSCEND

424
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,725
TIME?

425
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,791
AND IF INUYASHA WAS FILLED WITH

426
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,658
HATRED TOWARD MY SISTER,

427
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,091
WHO TOOK BACK THE SACRED JEWEL

428
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,325
AND SEALED HIM TO THE SACRED

429
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,391
TREE, THEN WHY DOES HE WEAR SUCH

430
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,858
A PEACEFUL EXPRESSION?

431
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,525
IT SEEMS I UNDERSTAND

432
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,525
VERY LITTLE AFTER ALL.

433
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,025
I WONDER SOMETIMES IF

434
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:32,625
I EVER WILL.

435
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,358
>> [CRYING]

436
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,858
>> OH, IT'S A BABY!

437
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,025
MY FIRST GRANDCHILD!

438
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,625
A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL!

439
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,791
>> IT'S OK.

440
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,091
GOOD GIRL.

441
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,025
OH, WE'RE GOING TO CALL

442
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,725
YOU KAGOME.

443
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,125
KAGOME.

444
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,025
>> [CRIES]

445
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,858
>> IT'S NICE TO FINALLY SEE YOU,

446
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:57,091
KAGOME.

447
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:57,891
>> KAGOME?

448
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,625
YOUR FRIEND'S ON THE PHONE.

449
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,425
>> THE NOTES FOR PRACTICE?

450
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:04,291
SURE, I'LL BRING THEM TODAY.

451
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,358
I KNOW, I KNOW.
