1
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,562
- I'M KAGOME HIGURASHI,
A NINTH-GRADER.

2
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:51,428
MY FAMILY AND I ARE CARETAKERS
OF A VERY OLD HISTORIC SHRINE,

3
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:54,695
AND UP UNTIL RECENTLY,
I LED A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE.

4
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,962
BUT ON MY 15th BIRTHDAY, I WAS
DRAGGED INTO THE FEUDAL ERA

5
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:02,662
BY A DEMON WHO SUDDENLY EMERGED
FROM THE OLD SHRINE WELL.

6
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:05,862
THERE, COUNTLESS DEMONS WISHING
TO INCREASE THEIR POWER

7
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:09,028
SEARCHED FOR THE SACRED
SHIKON JEWEL.

8
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,262
THIS IS WHERE I MET
A HALF-DEMON NAMED INUYASHA.

9
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:19,228
INUYASHA WANTS THE SACRED JEWEL
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

10
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:25,995
SINCE WE MET,
WE'VE TRAVELED TOGETHER

11
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,295
IN SEARCH OF SACRED JEWEL SHARDS

12
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:30,595
THAT ARE SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

13
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:33,228
WE'VE FOUGHT MANY DEMONS
ON OUR JOURNEY,

14
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:36,695
BUT WE'VE ALSO MADE FRIENDS
ALONG THE WAY...

15
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:40,428
LIKE SHIPPO, A VERY
CUTE FOX DEMON CHILD.

16
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:46,195
HE ALWAYS TRIES SO HARD, AND HE
HELPS US WITH HIS FOX MAGIC.

17
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,895
AND THE MONK, MIROKU.

18
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,995
THE WIND TUNNEL ON HIS PALM,
INFLICTED BY NARAKU'S CURSE,

19
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,995
HAS THE POWER TO SUCK UP
ANYTHING IN ITS PATH.

20
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:58,862
HE'S FAIRLY DEPENDABLE,
AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME.

21
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,962
SANGO IS THE LAST SURVIVOR
OF A TRIBE OF DEMON SLAYERS.

22
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:10,362
HER MISSION IS TO DESTROY NARAKU
TO AVENGE HER PEOPLE.

23
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,928
NARAKU IS THE MOST
DESPICABLE DEMON OF ALL.

24
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,628
HE RESORTS TO DIRTY TRICKS
AND DEVIOUS TRAPS

25
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:22,762
TO BRING DOWN HIS ENEMIES
WITHOUT NEEDING TO SULLY
HIS OWN HANDS.

26
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,595
HE IS STEADILY ACCUMULATING
SHARDS OF THE JEWEL,

27
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,228
GROWING MORE AND MORE
POWERFUL ALL THE WHILE.

28
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:32,895
WE'LL POOL OUR STRENGTH AND
SOMEDAY FIND NARAKU'S CASTLE.

29
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,162
TOGETHER, WE'LL BRING HIM DOWN.

30
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,728
OUR JOURNEY IS FAR FROM OVER.

32
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,662
- I'M SO SORRY.

33
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,128
I WAS OVERCOME BY PAIN.

34
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:03,728
- DON'T MENTION IT.
IT'S ALL PART OF A MONK'S DUTY.

35
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,362
- NOT AGAIN.

36
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,028

00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,928
- YEP. HE'S AT IT AGAIN.

38
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,295
- HOW ARE YOU NOW?

39
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,195
- I FEEL BETTER ALREADY,

40
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,095
THANKS TO YOUR GENTLE
TOUCH AND KINDNESS.

41
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:17,295
- DON'T OVEREXERT YOURSELF.

42
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:19,895
- NO. I'M QUITE FINE NOW.

43
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,428

00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,228
VERY WELL.
BY THE WAY--

45
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,195
- YES?

46
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,562
- WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN BEARING MY CHILD?

47
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,228
- NOT THAT AGAIN.

48
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,595

49
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,662

- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,395
- MIROKU, WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS ACT LIKE THAT

54
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,962
WHEN YOU COME ACROSS
A PRETTY LADY?

55
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,162
- WHAT?

00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,695
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO IGNORE
A FEMALE IN DISTRESS, CAN YOU?

- AH!
HOW ABOUT A SHORT BREAK?

62
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,328

IT'S DISAPPEARED!

I'M SURE I HAD IT
THIS MORNING.

68
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:22,628
- THAT WOMAN AT THE ROADSIDE
MUST HAVE BEEN A PICKPOCKET.

69
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:23,928
- NO WONDER
SHE DIDN'T GO BERSERK

00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:26,995

REAR A GOOD MASSAGE.

- HUH?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:53,228
- HE WAS LAGGING BEHIND
UP UNTIL A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

ABOUT BEING ROBBED.

I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT SANGO.

209
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:18,895
- HE AIN'T FUSSY.

210
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:20,595
HE SEEMS TO LIKE ALL WOMEN.

211
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:24,528
- BUT MAYBE HE FEELS STRONGER
ABOUT SANGO, THOUGH.

212
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,495
- COULD BE.

213
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,628
HE GOES AFTER HER BUTT ENOUGH.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

214
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,395
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT.

- OK, I'M READY
FOR A CHANGE OF TOPIC.

ALL OF YOU ARE THE MEN

FROM THE VILLAGE?

- YEAH, IT WAS LIKE
A DREAM, REALLY.

221
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,428
- I FOUND MYSELF LOST
AND IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

222
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:49,762
THEN SUDDENLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
PRINCESS APPEARED BEFORE ME

224

SHE BROUGHT ME
TO A MAGNIFICENT VILLA,

225
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,428
AND I SPENT SUCH A GRAND TIME.

226
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,895
- A GRAND TIME, YOU SAY?

227
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:00,162
- YES.
IT WAS MOST ENJOYABLE.

228
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,562
- AYE.
ENJOYABLE AND GRAND.

229
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:07,462
- THE NEXT THING WE KNEW, WE ALL
FOUND OURSELVES LIKE THIS.

230
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,128
- THE DEMON DRAINED
THE LIFE SPIRIT,

THE YOUTH OUT OF THESE MEN.

232
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:16,362

HAVE SURVIVED THE WAR.

DID YOU, PRINCESS?

234
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:18,895
- AYE.

I AM ALL ALONE

- HMM?

240
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:32,395
- IT IS MY FATE TO REMAIN HERE.

241
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:36,162
WOULD YOU DO ME THE KINDNESS
OF SPENDING THE NIGHT WITH ME?

SINCE YOU TWO GOT BACK.

348
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:43,556
- UH, NO.

349
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:46,822
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
MIGHT BE BOTHERING HER.

350
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,756
[SIGHS]

351
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,089
- SILLY ME.

352
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,189
HOW COULD I BE SO FOOLISH?

353
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,056
- SANGO?

354
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,656
- HUH?

355
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,022
- WHAT'S WRONG?

356
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:02,956
- I'M SORRY.

357
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,322
I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER FOLLOWED YOU

358
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:06,556
INTO THE MOUNTAINS
LIKE THAT, MIROKU.

359
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,089
- NOW, DON'T BE FOOLISH.

360
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:11,122
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DESTROYED
THE DEMON, AREN'T YOU?

361
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,456
- THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
YOU HELPED ME.

362
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,256
- NO, NO.
I RELIED ON YOUR HELP,

363
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,022
BECAUSE I HAD TRUST
IN YOUR STRENGTH, SANGO.

364
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:20,689
- HUH?

365
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,022
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.

366
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,656
SANGO WOULDN'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH THAT PERVERT.

367
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,722
- NOW, THAT'S ATMOSPHERE.

368
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:31,156
- OK.
I'M READY FOR AN EXPLANATION.

369
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,756
- SANGO, YOU CAME WITH ME,

370
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,189
BECAUSE YOU WERE CONCERNED
ABOUT MY SAFETY.

371
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:37,256
IS THAT CORRECT?

372
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,589
- WELL, SURE THAT'S WHY I CAME.

373
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:42,389
YES, OF COURSE I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

374
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,356
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY REASONABLE

375
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,189
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND WOMEN,
YOU KNOW.

376
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:49,856
I WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
YOU'D GET INTO TROUBLE.

377
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,556
- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

378
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,389
I HAD TO GO INTO
THE DEMON'S LAIR,

379
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:57,422
BECAUSE I COULDN'T IGNORE
A WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE GRIEVING.

380
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,489
- HMM?

381
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:02,922
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

382
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:04,922
HUH?

383
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,956
- SEE? WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

384
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:08,756
IT'S HAPPENING.

385
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,622
- IT MAKES ME HAPPY
THAT YOU WORRY.

386
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:17,156
YOUR CONCERN FOR ME MEANS MORE
THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER WOMAN.

387
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:21,656
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?

388
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,556
OH, NO.
WHAT'LL I DO?

389
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,056
- GO FOR IT, SANGO.

390
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,222
- SANGO?

391
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,356
HMM.

392
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:36,722
- HUH?

393
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,189
THAT HAND AGAIN!

394
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:45,089
WHY CAN'T HE TOUCH MY SHOULDERS
OR SOMEWHERE MORE ROMANTIC?!

SHE WAS PRACTICALLY
BEGGING ME TO FONDLE HER.

400
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:57,856
- SURE. SURE.

401
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,122
YOU SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME
BRUSHING UP ON WOMEN'S FEELINGS

402
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:02,889
AND LESS TIME BRUSHING UP
ON THEIR BUNS.

403
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:03,756
- SEE, KAGOME?

404
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,856
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THAT YOU WERE WRONG?

405
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,089
WELL, DIDN'T I?

406
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:09,289
- HMM. WHAT A DUMMY.

407
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:16,789
- OH, WELL, BETTER GET
THIS THING FIXED.

AGAIN, KAGOME?

DO YOU LIKE THOSE TESTS
OF YOURS THAT MUCH?

00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:07,023
OH, WELL, WHATEVER
MAKES YOU HAPPY.

00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:08,557
I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

THIS CREEPY-LOOKING HUMAN FACE
FRUIT LEADS US TO TOGENKYO.

00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,523
THE GUY THERE CALLS
HIMSELF A SAGE,

415
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:20,090
AND HE'S USING HUMANS TO MAKE
ANTI-AGING MEDICINE.

THE NEW MOON IS COMING.
