00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,428
KAGOME, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR BAG, ROCKS?

170
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,694
IT'S WAY HEAVIER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

171
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:09,628
- I HAVE A TEST NEXT WEEK,

172
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:12,394
SO I BROUGHT AS MANY BOOKS
AS I COULD CARRY.

173
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,561
- IT MUST BE HARD FOR YOU.

174
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:16,694
- MIROKU SAYS YOU SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP ON SCHOOL THIS YEAR

175
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,561
AND FLUNK A GRADE.

176
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:20,994
- DON'T TELL ME MIROKU
THINKS SO, TOO.

177
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,594
MY BROTHER SOTA'S
ONLY IN ELEMENTARY,

178
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,661
AND HE SAYS THINGS LIKE,
"IF YOU FLUNK 6 TIMES,

179
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:25,794
"THEN I'LL BE
IN THE SAME GRADE AS YOU,

180
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:28,794
AND I CAN HELP YOU STUDY,
AND WE CAN GRADUATE TOGETHER."

181
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,728
HE'S SUCH A LITTLE GEEK.

182
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:34,761
HE THINKS HE'S SO HOT.

183
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,761
OHH!

184
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:40,294
- I BET HE ACTS TOUGH
AND PRETENDS TO BE COCKY,

185
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:43,861
BUT HE HATES TO BE LONELY,
AND HE CRIES EASILY.

186
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:48,128
HE'S A VERY GOOD BOY,
THIS LITTLE BROTHER OF YOURS.

187
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,294
- [SIGHS]

188
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:51,028
HMM.

189
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,194
- [GRUNTS]

190
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,128
HEY. LOOK. SOMEBODY'S COMING.

191
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:56,328
- HUH?
- HUH?

192
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,928
- [GRUNTING]

193
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,228
- INUYASHA, HURRY!

194
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:06,394
- HE'S NOT BREATHING.

195
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:09,828
HE SEEMS NOTHING MORE
THAN A SIMPLE VILLAGER.

196
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:13,161
- THOSE WOUNDS WEREN'T
MADE BY A SWORD.

197
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:16,661
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S BEEN KILLED AROUND HERE.

198
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:17,661
- HUH?

199
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:20,828
THE AIR IS FILLED
WITH THE THICK SMELL OF BLOOD,

200
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,294
AND THE BLOOD IS FRESH.

201
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,861
THERE'S BEEN A SLAUGHTER.

202
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:34,461
- A MASSACRE.

203
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,661
- IS ANYONE LEFT ALIVE?

204
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,861
- LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
WE'LL SPLIT UP AND SEARCH.

205
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:43,261
- GOOD IDEA.
- HOLD IT.

206
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,961
HMM.

207
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,594
[ALL MOANING]

208
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:53,228
DON'T MOVE AN INCH.
TRAPS ARE SET EVERYWHERE.

209
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:55,528
ONE STEP, AND YOUR LEG
MIGHT BE BLOWN OFF.

210
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,194
- W-W-WHAT?
TRAPS ARE BURIED UNDERGROUND?

211
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:01,094
- BESIDE ALL THE DEAD BODIES?
- PROBABLY.

212
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:03,494
- I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF ANYTHING SO CRUEL.

213
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,728
- IF YOU TRY TO HELP
OR BURY THE DEAD,

214
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:07,594
YOU GET BLOWN UP, TOO.

215
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,494
- THIS HEARTLESS BASTARD
DOESN'T DESERVE TO LIVE!

216
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,661
LET'S FIND HIM
BEFORE HE MAKES ANOTHER MOVE.

217
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,094
- INUYASHA,
IT'S DANGEROUS TO WALK.

218
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,761
- HUH! IF HE THINKS
I'M THE KIND OF GUY

219
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,194
WHO'S JUST GONNA
STAND STILL AND TAKE IT,

220
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,594
HE'S GOT ANOTHER THING COMING.

221
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:22,261
HUH! AAH!

222
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,528
UNH!

223
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:31,828
IS HE THE ONE?

224
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,694
- HE COULDN'T HAVE KILLED
ALL THE VILLAGERS.

225
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:39,328
HE'S JUST A YOUNG BOY.
- IMPOSSIBLE.

226
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:41,928
- LOOK AT THE CHAIN HE'S GOT
AND ALL THE BLOOD ON HIS BODY.

227
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,961
HE'S COVERED IN IT.
THE KID'S GONE INSANE!

228
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:48,494
YOU MASSACRED A VILLAGE.
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

229
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,961
WHAT ARE YOU AFTER? HEY!

230
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,528
- KOHAKU?

231
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:02,561
- HIS OUTFIT IS LIKE SANGO'S.
HE'S A DEMON SLAYER.

232
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:03,728
[MEOW]

233
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,194
- KIRARA RECOGNIZES HIM,
BUT HOW?

234
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:09,894
IT CAN'T BE KOHAKU.

235
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:13,694
- WHAT DID SANGO JUST SAY?

236
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,061
- HUH? GET BACK HERE!

237
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:21,561
UNH! AAH!

238
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,094
DAMN IT!

239
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:25,928
- KIRARA!

240
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,394
[ROARS]

241
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:36,094
GO!

242
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,894
- WHAT? A SPIRIT SHIELD.

243
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:01,461
- KOHAKU, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

244
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:20,528
- KOHAKU, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

245
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,194
- ALL RIGHT. WE'RE HERE.
GET OFF MY BACK.

246
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:30,561
- SO YOU SAW BOTH OF THEM
ENTER THE SPIRIT SHIELD
AND PASS THROUGH?

247
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,261
- YEAH.

248
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,194
KAGOME, ARE YOU SURE?

249
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,894
MAYBE SHE MUMBLED
SOMETHING ELSE BACK THERE.

250
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:36,961
- I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE.

251
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:40,594
SANGO CALLED OUT THE NAME
OF HER BROTHER--KOHAKU.

252
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:43,228
SHE TOLD ME EARLIER
THAT KOHAKU HAD BEEN KILLED

253
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,261
IN THE CASTLE OCCUPIED
BY NARAKU.

254
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:49,928
- DID YOU NOTICE HE HAD
A SACRED SHIKON JEWEL SHARD
IMBEDDED IN HIS BACK?

255
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,394
WE'VE EXPERIENCED
THAT ONE BEFORE.

256
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:53,994
- IT'S NARAKU'S SAME OLD TRICK.

257
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,461
HE FORCED SANGO TO FIGHT
AGAINST HER WILL

258
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:57,661
IN THE SAME MANNER.

259
00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:01,294
- DO YOU THINK NARAKU
IS MANIPULATING KOHAKU
THE SAME WAY?

260
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:03,494
- SANGO'S PROBABLY AWARE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON,

261
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,828
BUT THEN WHY DID THE SHIELD
ALLOW HER TO PASS THROUGH?

262
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:11,228
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

263
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,828
[PURRING]

264
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,694
- LET ME SEE YOUR FACE.

265
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,694
[GASPS]

266
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:44,961
KOHAKU. YOU'RE ALIVE, KOHAKU!

267
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:49,061
- ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE
YOUR BROTHER ALIVE?

268
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:49,894
- HUH?

269
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:54,861
- IT HAS BEEN SUCH
A LONG TIME, SANGO.

270
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,394
- NARAKU!

271
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,661
- HA HA HA!

272
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,194
AREN'T YOU GOING TO THANK ME?

273
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,361
- HA! FOR WHAT?

274
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,794
- I SALVAGED YOUR BROTHER'S LIFE

275
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:08,128
AFTER HE WAS FELLED
BY THOSE ARROWS
AT THE CASTLE.

276
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:12,328
KOHAKU'S LIFE SHOULD HAVE
ENDED RIGHT THEN AND THERE

277
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:14,828
AS HE LAY BLEEDING,
BUT I SAVED HIM.

278
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:19,461
YOU HAVE ALREADY
PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED
THIS KIND OF SALVATION.

279
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:22,328
IT IS THROUGH THE POWER
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

280
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,194
WHEN YOU HAD THE SHARD
INSIDE YOUR BACK,

281
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:27,161
YOU WERE ABLE TO FIGHT INUYASHA,

282
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,161
AND YOU WERE
HIS EQUAL IN BATTLE.

283
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:30,994
- SILENCE!

284
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,328
- NOW KOHAKU POSSESSES
THAT SAME POWER.

285
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,861
HE STANDS BEFORE YOU
AS AN EQUAL WARRIOR

286
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,161
BECAUSE OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

287
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:40,694
IF IT IS EXTRACTED FROM HIM,
HE WILL SURELY DIE.

288
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,094
DO YOU UNDERSTAND, SANGO?

289
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,428
THINK THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS.

290
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,061
KOHAKU'S LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS.

291
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:51,428
BRING ME THE TETSUSAIGA,
INUYASHA'S PRECIOUS SWORD.

292
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:56,728
ONLY THEN SHALL I LET
KOHAKU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.

293
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,461
HA HA HA!

294
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,428
- I WON'T BE BRIBED!

295
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,894
UNH!

296
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:06,794
KOHAKU, WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING
THAT DEMON--NARAKU?

297
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:08,994
- I'VE ERASED ALL
OF KOHAKU'S MEMORIES OF YOU

298
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,928
AND HIS FORMER LIFE
IN THE VILLAGE.

299
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,461
A FIGHTING MACHINE HAS
NO NEED FOR FEELINGS.

300
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,828
THEY WOULD ONLY GET IN THE WAY.

301
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,328
HE SLAUGHTERED
AN ENTIRE VILLAGE BY HIMSELF.

302
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,361
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

303
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:23,828
HE HAS BECOME A VERY FINE
DEMON SLAYER.

304
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,728
- DAMN YOU!

305
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:29,094
POISON GAS! UNH!

306
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:33,461
- YOU WILL BRING ME
THE TETSUSAIGA.

307
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:36,128
- UNH!

308
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:40,694
- I WILL BE WAITING
FOR YOU, SANGO.

309
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,194
- [SIGHS]

310
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,528
- HUH?
- IT'S SANGO.

311
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,761
SANGO, WAS THAT BOY
YOU WERE CHASING
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER?

312
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:57,861
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO TALK WITH HIM?

313
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,528
- THAT BOY WAS NOT MY BROTHER!

314
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,528
- SORRY, SANGO.

315
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,761
- WELL, THE MAIN THING IS,
YOU'VE RETURNED UNHARMED.

316
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,394
SANGO, THIS WHOLE INCIDENT
WITH THE TRAPS AND BARRIER--

317
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,461
TELL ME, WAS IT NARAKU
WHO WAS BEHIND IT ALL?

318
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:13,494
- MM-HMM.
- I SEE.

319
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:15,728
THEN YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED
FROM THE ENCOUNTER.

320
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,028
LET'S RETURN TO THE VILLAGE
AND GET SOME REST, OK?

321
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,494
- WAIT, MIROKU.

322
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:23,128
I BEG YOU,
PLEASE PERFORM A SERVICE

323
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:27,528
TO HONOR AND COMMEMORATE
THE DEAD.

324
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,528
- HMM.

325
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,894
- THAT'S THE LAST ONE.
YOU'RE AMAZING KIRARA.

326
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:37,061
GROWING UP IN THE SLAYERS'
VILLAGE PAID OFF.

327
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,028
YOU MANAGED TO SNIFF OUT
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE TRAPS.

328
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:43,628
WE'LL GET SANGO TO SAFELY
DESTROY THESE SOMEWHERE LATER.

329
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:48,228
NOW THEN, I'LL GO TELL EVERYBODY
ABOUT WHAT YOU MANAGED TO DO.

330
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:52,594
HUH? HEY, KIRARA,
WHERE DID YOU GO?

331
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:56,494
KIRARA? KIRARA?

332
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,628
- SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF IT ALL, MIROKU?

333
00:18:58,661 --> 00:18:59,394
- WHAT'S THAT?

334
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,028
- ABOUT HER MEETING UP
WITH NARAKU.

335
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,694
I WONDER WHAT SANGO AND NARAKU
ENDED UP TALKING ABOUT.

336
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,261
- HE PROBABLY TOLD SANGO
THAT HE WAS MANIPULATING
HER BROTHER LIKE A PUPPET.

337
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:11,128
- HE TRIED TO GET SANGO
TO FIGHT KOHAKU!

338
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,061
NARAKU IS UNFORGIVABLY CRUEL!

339
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,361
- SANGO CAN'T SLAY
HER OWN BROTHER.

340
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:16,928
LET'S LEAVE HER ALONE
FOR A WHILE,

341
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,061
LEAVE HER WITH HER THOUGHTS
UNTIL SHE'S READY

342
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,894
TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,794
- WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST
LET HIM OFF THE HOOK.

344
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,928
SO WHAT IF HE'S NARAKU'S PUPPET
WITH A JEWEL SHARD IN HIS BACK?

345
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,161
KOHAKU'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR SLAUGHTERING AN ENTIRE TOWN.

346
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:35,061
IF SANGO CAN'T KILL HIM,
THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE HIM DOWN.

347
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:38,661
HEY, SANGO, YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

348
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,494
- UH, INUYASHA, I CAN'T BELIEVE

349
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:47,461
HOW UTTERLY INSENSITIVE
YOU CAN BE.

350
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:48,928
SANGO, WAIT UP!

351
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:52,994
- DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO ABOUT HIM.

352
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,561
DO WE KILL HIM?

353
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,694
- OF COURSE!

354
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,861
- NO MATTER WHAT?

355
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:57,894
- YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT.

356
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,061
NARAKU SENT SANGO'S
ZOMBIE-SHARD-PUPPET BROTHER

357
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:03,094
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
WE'D BE TOO SENTIMENTAL
AND TOO WIMPY ABOUT IT

358
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,328
TO KILL HIM OFF,
AND THERE'S NO WAY

359
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:07,028
I'M GONNA FALL FOR THAT!

360
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:11,528
- HMM. I CAN SEE YOU'RE
REALLY TORN UP ABOUT IT.

361
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:14,861
- SHUT UP, MIROKU! GET LOST!

362
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:19,828
I'M IN A LOUSY POSITION.
NOBODY ELSE WILL TAKE
CARE OF THIS EXCEPT ME,

363
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,994
BUT I FEEL BAD FOR SANGO.

364
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,961
- UNH!

365
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,394
DID IT! UNH!

366
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:36,461
- KOHAKU, YOU'RE NOT
TRYING HARD ENOUGH.

367
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:43,094
- HUH? HEY, KIRARA.
COME ON NOW. CUT THAT OUT.

368
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:44,228
- HOW'S THE WOUND?

369
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,328
- HEY, SANGO.
- ROUGH TRAINING.

370
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,761
- ROUGH FOR ME, THAT IS.
I HAVE SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO.

371
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,594
- FATHER TOLD ME HE'S
BEEN WATCHING YOU,

372
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:55,028
AND HE THINKS YOU'RE GETTING
BETTER EVERY DAY, KOHAKU.

373
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,294
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

374
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:59,994
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER HEARD
OF FATHER PRAISING ME.

375
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:05,161
HA HA! MAKES ME FEEL
KIND OF EMBARRASSED.

376
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,528
HA HA HA!

377
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,028
- I MADE HIM FORGET.

378
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,628
I ERASED ALL THE MEMORIES
OF HIS LIFE.

379
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,494
- KOHAKU DIDN'T REACT AT ALL
WHEN HE SAW ME.

380
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:28,061
HAS HE TRULY FORGOTTEN
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME,
ABOUT HIMSELF?

381
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:32,728
NO. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT NARAKU IS OUR SWORN ENEMY.

382
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:36,061
I WON'T ALLOW NARAKU
TO MANIPULATE KOHAKU.

383
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,728
I MUST RESCUE HIM
FROM NARAKU'S EVIL GRIP.

384
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,394
- BRING ME THE TETSUSAIGA,
INUYASHA'S PRECIOUS SWORD.

385
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:49,361
ONLY THEN SHALL I LET
KOHAKU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.

386
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,761
- I MUST STEAL THE TETSUSAIGA

387
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:56,294
IN ORDER TO SAVE
MY BROTHER--KOHAKU.

388
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:01,528
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

389
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:37,928
- NARAKU TOLD SANGO TO STEAL
INUYASHA'S SWORD IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER BROTHER'S LIFE?

390
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:41,294
NARAKU IS THE ABSOLUTE
WORST SCUM OF THE EARTH.

391
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,661
KOHAKU IS BEING USED
IN THE WORST WAY,

392
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,594
BUT WE CAN'T FIGHT HIM
AND RISK KILLING HIM.

393
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,428
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ATTACK THE CASTLE

394
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,494
AND DESTROY NARAKU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

395
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,028
EVEN I'M ANGRY ENOUGH
TO DO IT NOW.

396
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:57,294
NEXT TIME:
"TETSUSAIGA IS STOLEN!

397
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:59,394
SHOWDOWN AT NARAKU'S CASTLE!"

398
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:00,428
SEE YOU SOON!
