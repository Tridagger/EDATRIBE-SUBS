- [SCREAMING]

5
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:11,329
- I DON'T REMEMBER A THING
FROM WHEN I WAS TRANSFORMED.

6
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:17,563
- THE TETSUSAIGA SUPPRESSES THE
DEMON NATURE IN YOU, INUYASHA.

7
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,663
- YOUR PRECIOUS TETSUSAIGA IS

8
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,496
NOTHING MORE THAN
A DART RIGHT NOW.

9
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,396
- DURING A PREVIOUS BATTLE,

10
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,896
THE TETSUSAIGA WAS BROKEN,

11
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:29,696
AWAKENING INUYASHA'S
DEMON BLOOD.

12
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,429
ONCE IT'S INITIALLY ROUSED,

13
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,829
THE DEMON NATURE
WILL CONTINUE TO SURFACE

14
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,296
BY TRANSFORMING ITS HOST

15
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,329
IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITSELF.

16
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:43,963
THAT'S WHY HE CAN'T EVER
LET GO OF THE TETSUSAIGA.

17
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,129
OTHERWISE, WHEN HIS LIFE
IS ON THE LINE,

18
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:49,363
HIS DEMONIC NATURE
WILL TAKE OVER.

19
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:55,096
- THE NEXT TIME I TRANSFORM,

20
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,629
I MAY EVEN COME AFTER YOU
WITH THESE CLAWS, KAGOME.

21
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:17,629
HEY, YOU THERE, TOTOSAI?

22
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,063
- HMM?

23
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,563
- WE NEED TO TALK.

24
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,129
- AH, YES.

25
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,363
I EXPECTED YOU WOULD COME.

26
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,096
- HMM.

27
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,029
- WHERE COULD INUYASHA
HAVE GOTTEN TO, ANYWAY?

28
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:42,963
- YOU'RE THINKING MAYBE WE
SHOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE, KAGOME?

29
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,063
- MM.

30
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:47,863
- IF YOU ASK ME, INUYASHA WANTS
TO MAKE THE TETSUSAIGA

31
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,796
LIGHTER IN WEIGHT.

32
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,829
COULD IT BE THAT HE'S

33
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,763
JUST OFF TRAINING SOMEWHERE?

34
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:52,529
- THINK SO?

35
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,829
SOUNDS LIKE
WAY TOO MUCH HARD WORK

36
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,563
FOR THE INUYASHA
I KNOW AND LOVE.

37
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:58,863
- NOW, NOW.

38
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,663
IN ANY CASE,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEARCH

39
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:04,396
EVERY SINGLE PLACE
THAT WE CAN THINK OF.

40
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,229
- HMM.

41
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:07,329
I HAVEN'T TOLD THE OTHERS,

42
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,963
BUT INUYASHA IS
REALLY TORMENTED.

43
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,296
IT'D BE BETTER TO LEAVE HIM
ALONE FOR A WHILE

44
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,829
TO SORT THINGS OUT ON HIS OWN.

45
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:17,063
BUT I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF WAITING IT OUT.

46
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,329
I'M SO WORRIED.

47
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:30,296
- I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, INUYASHA.

48
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,163
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
YOU STILL HAVE TROUBLE

49
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,829
WIELDING THE TETSUSAIGA.

50
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:35,929
- THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU

51
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:39,163
TO MAKE MY SWORD LIGHTER,
OLD MAN.

52
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,896
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY.

53
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,596
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
FIGURE IT OUT?

54
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,363
- I'M IN A HURRY, OK?

55
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:50,296
AND BESIDES, I DON'T WANT
TO TRANSFORM ANYMORE.

56
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,729
- UH...

57
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,096
- I COULDN'T MASTER
THE TETSUSAIGA,

58
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,463
SO I WAS TRAPPED
BY THAT PETTY DEMON.

59
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,996
I TOTALLY LOST CONTROL
OF MYSELF.

60
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:07,996
I DON'T WANT TO GO
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

61
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,529
IT WAS TERRIFYING.

62
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:13,296
- HMM.

64
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:18,229

[SLURPING]
- AHH.

66
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:24,629
MASTER INUYASHA,
NICE TO TASTE YOU AGAIN.

67
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:26,829
[GRUNTING]

68
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:29,163
AND HERE I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

69
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,963
- SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING OUT, IS IT?

70
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,996
THANKS A LOT
FOR KEEPING ME IN THE DARK

71
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,263
ABOUT THE SWORD, MYOGA.

72
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,096
- HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

73
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,129
- DON'T ACT INNOCENT!

74
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,963
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD HER
ABOUT THE TETSUSAIGA.

75
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:45,629
KAGOME SAID THAT MY SWORD IS

76
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:49,229
WHAT KEEPS MY DEMON NATURE
IN CHECK.

77
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,263
- HMM.

78
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,329
WELL, THAT FIGURES.

79
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:53,563
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER

80
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:56,296
THAN TO TRUST HER TO SECRECY.

81
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:56,963
- HUH.

82
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,463
YEAH, WELL, KNOWING THE TRUTH

83
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,863
WON'T HELP ME
KEEP HOLD OF MY SWORD.

84
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,763
[CRYING]

85
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,663
- UHH.

86
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,796
- I HAVE TO MASTER
THE TETSUSAIGA, OR ELSE.

87
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:10,329
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

88
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,463
- HMM.

89
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,496
I SEE YOU'VE PUT QUITE A GOOD
DEAL OF THOUGHT INTO THIS.

90
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,463
YOU'VE HAD
ENOUGH TRANSFORMATIONS.

91
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:20,663
- YEAH.

92
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:26,929
- WELL, THAT LEAVES
BUT ONE CHOICE.

93
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:27,896
- HUH?

94
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:32,329
- INUYASHA, YOU MUST
KILL RYUKOTSUSEI.

95
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,996
- RYUKOTSUSEI?

96
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,829
- WHO?
- HMM?

97
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,829
- YOU DIDN'T SAY
RYUKOTSUSEI, DID YOU?

98
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,863
- HE IS THE DEMON
YOUR FATHER BATTLED

99
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:50,829
AND SEALED INTO A DORMANT SLEEP.

100
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,663
INUYASHA, WHY DO YOU THINK

101
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:58,463
THIS NEW TETSUSAIGA IS SO HEAVY?

102
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:01,829
IT IS BECAUSE YOUR FANG
HAS NOT YET REACHED

103
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:05,196
THE POWER OF YOUR FATHER'S.

104
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:12,129
- IN OTHER WORDS, IF I DESTROY
THE DEMON MY FATHER FOUGHT,

105
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,863
THEN I'LL SURPASS
THE OLD MAN IN STRENGTH?

106
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,596
- NOW, LISTEN, MASTER INUYASHA.

107
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,329
BY DESTROY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PIERCE THE DEMON'S HEART

108
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,496
SINCE HIS POWERS
STILL LIE DORMANT.

109
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,029
- WHAT?
I DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT HIM?
[BUZZING]

110
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:27,829
- OF COURSE NOT.

111
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,196
IT TOOK EVERY OUNCE OF STRENGTH

112
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,529
FOR YOUR FATHER TO PUT
THIS DEMON UNDER SEAL.

113
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:34,329
HE WASN'T ABLE TO LEVY
A FINISHING BLOW.

114
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,629
- SO NOW I'M THE ONE
WHO GETS STUCK

115
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,129
SLAYING HIM LIKE A COWARD.

116
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:41,796
- IF YOU KEEP COMPLAINING,
I WILL NOT SHOW YOU THE WAY.
OH!

117
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,696
- JUST WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO, MYOGA?

118
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,529
- OH, I JUST--

[BUZZING]

120
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,163
- HMM.

121
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,629
VERY INTERESTING, KANNA.

122
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,996
I'VE DISPATCHED YOU, KAGURA,

123
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,529
GOSHINKI, JUROMARU,
AND KAGEROMARU,

124
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:06,263
AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF YOU
WERE ABLE TO PUT AN END

125
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,729
TO INUYASHA.
HMM.

126
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:14,463
LET'S GIVE THIS RYUKOTSUSEI
A TRY, SHALL WE?

127
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:18,096
[LAUGHS EVILLY]

128
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:30,129
- UHH. UHH.

129

[GRUNTING]

130
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,829
- HOW MUCH FURTHER
IS IT, MYOGA?

131
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,463
- NOT MUCH.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT SOON.

132
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:47,196
KEEP MOVING.

133
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:51,963
- UHH.
I SHOULD SQUASH YOU.
UHH.

134
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,829
- TOTOSAI.

135
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,463
- HMM?

136
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:01,363
WHAT ARE YOU YOUNGSTERS
DOING HERE?

137
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,263
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR INUYASHA.

138
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,696
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE IS?

139
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,129
- INUYASHA?

140
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:08,996
HMM.

141
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,196
LET ME SEE.

142
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:13,096
INUYASHA, YOU SAY.

143
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,329
- HE'S HAVING TROUBLE
WIELDING THE TETSUSAIGA,

144
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,396
SO WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE
COME TO SEE YOU FOR HELP.

145
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,996
- LET ME SEE.
WHAT TO DO?

146
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,396
- YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

147
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,063
WHERE IS HE?
TELL ME!
[SCREAMING]

148
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,296
- OOH!
[CRASH]

149
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,396
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

150
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,296
- INUYASHA HAS GONE
TO THE VALLEY OF RYUKOTSUSEI.

151
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,629
- THE VALLEY OF RYUKOTSUSEI?

152
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,129
- HUH?

153
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,963
- UHH.
UHH.

154
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:47,096
- LOOK, MASTER INUYASHA,
OVER THERE.

155
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,396
- OH.

156
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,896
SO THAT'S RYUKOTSUSEI.

157
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:07,929
- CORRECT.

158
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:10,696
AND LOOK WHERE YOUR FATHER'S
CLAW HAS PIERCED HIM,

159
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:16,629
RENDERING HIS POWERS DORMANT--
RIGHT ABOVE HIS HEART.

160
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:21,363
- HUH?

161
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,729
[LAUGHING]

162
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,729
- NARAKU.

163
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:32,496
[LAUGHING]

164
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,829
- BUT, MASTER TOTOSAI,

165
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:38,329
IF THERE WAS SUCH A SIMPLE WAY
TO MASTER THE TETSUSAIGA,

166
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,496
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM EARLIER?

167
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,563
[CHEWING]
- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EASY.

168
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:48,296
HE WON'T LEARN IF I HAND HIM
ALL THE ANSWERS, NOW, WILL HE?
HUH?

169
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,963
- I THINK THAT INUYASHA
HAS ALREADY SUFFERED ENOUGH.

170
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:55,029
- POOR THING.

171
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:57,229
- HE AGONIZED
OVER WHAT HE'D DONE.

172
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:59,663
THAT'S WHY HE CAME TO SEE YOU.

173
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:00,563
- THAT'S TRUE.

174
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:01,896
- EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE BANDITS,

175
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,829
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THEY WERE
STILL HUMAN BEINGS
