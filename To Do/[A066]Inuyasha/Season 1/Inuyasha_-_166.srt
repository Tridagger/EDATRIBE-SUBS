126
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,625

STRANGE SHAFTS OF LIGHT THAT

133
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,425

YOU SEE THAT?

141
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:27,692
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE LOOKED LIKE

142
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:28,825

00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,958
>> OH, JEEZ.

150
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,058
THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PAIR OF

151

SHOES.

152
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:42,725
>> HA!

YOU HAVEN'T EVEN WALKED THAT

154
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,725

155
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,558

157
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,358
>> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK,

158
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,425
INUYASHA?

159
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,458
THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE THESE

160
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,725
AESTHETICS ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED

161
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,092
TO NARAKU?

162
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:57,992
>> PROBABLY.

163
00:06:57,992 --> 00:06:59,025
ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY DEFEATED

164
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,458
GAKUSANJIN.

165
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,192

IT'S COMING FROM OVER THAT WAY!

171
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:12,192
>> DARN IT!

172
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,258
WE DIDN'T HIT HIM!

173
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,192
>> IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.

174
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,892
THE TARGET'S SMALLER THAN USUAL.

175
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:16,592
>> WHAT?!

176
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:17,758
THEY'RE THE AESTHETICS?

177
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:18,625
>> THEY'RE STILL JUST YOUNG

178
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,525

NO MISTAKE.

181
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,125
THIS IS THE SAME SCENT THAT WAS

182
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,825
LEFT BEFORE GAKUSANJIN.

183
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:26,625
>> THOSE...

184
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,025
CHILDREN KILLED HIM?

185
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,258
>> HEY, HUMANS ARE WITH HIM,

186
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,125
TOO!

187
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,158
>> WOMAN, YOU BETTER GET AWAY

188
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,658
FROM THAT DEMON--UNLESS YOU WANT

189
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:33,658
TO DIE.

190
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:34,625
>> WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING

191
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,292
ABOUT?!

192
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,825
>> STAY BACK, KAGOME!

395
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,625

433
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,425

THIS IS SOMEONE CAPABLE OF

435
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,992
PUTTING ON QUITE THE CHARADE.

436
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,225
