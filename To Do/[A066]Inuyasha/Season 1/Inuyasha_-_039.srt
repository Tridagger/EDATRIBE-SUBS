- FORGET ABOUT IT, KAGOME.

HE'S GOT A BLOCK OF WOOD
FOR A BRAIN,

328
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:57,730
SO HE CAN'T GRASP
ANYTHING TOO COMPLICATED.

329
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,897
THERE'S NO REASONING
WITH THE MORON.

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,030
ALL HE UNDERSTANDS IS
A FEW PUNCHES IN THE HEAD.

00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,030
- THE DEMON WOLF TRIBES
LIVE IN PACKS,

332
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:07,197
AND THEY CHERISH THEIR
COMRADES LIKE FAMILY.

SEEING SO MANY OF HIS
BROTHERS DEAD ALL AT ONCE

334
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,164
WOULD MAKE HIM INSANE
WITH GRIEF.

HE'S TOO FAR GONE.

- YOU CAN'T BLAME INUYASHA
FOR FIGHTING BACK.

338
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:21,264
HE HAS TO DEFEND HIMSELF
AGAINST KOGA'S ATTACKS.

00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:24,364
- NARAKU IS TRYING
TO MAKE ME FIGHT WITH KOGA.

HE'S PITTED US AGAINST

SHOULD DO? SHOULD WE HELP?

347
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,930
- INUYASHA CAME HERE
LOOKING FOR NARAKU,

348
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,464
THE ONE WHO SET
THIS WHOLE STAGE.

349
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,130
- DO YOU THINK NARAKU'S
INSIDE THE CASTLE SOMEWHERE?

350
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:53,230
- CHARGING RIGHT
INTO THE ENEMY'S TRAP

351
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,897
IS GENERALLY
NOT A WISE STRATEGY.

352
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,230
- WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

353
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:00,864
HERE IT GOES!

354
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,064
[PANTING]

355
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,230
- WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

356
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:27,164
- YOU WANT A FORMAL
INTRODUCTION?

357
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:29,597
GOOD EVENING. MY NAME'S KAGURA.

358
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,897
YOU MUST BE SANGO,
AND YOU'RE MIROKU.

359
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,797
AM I RIGHT?

360
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,464
- YES, AND YOU ARE
ONE OF NARAKU'S MINIONS.

361
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,097
TELL US WHERE HE IS.

362
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,464
- HE'S NOT IN RIGHT NOW,

363
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:41,330
BUT HE LEFT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING

364
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:42,697
TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED.

365
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,330
NARAKU HOPES YOU WILL FIND
HIS LITTLE GIFT AMUSING.

366
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:50,564
- HUH?

367
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:51,430
- DEMON PUPPET!

368
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:53,297
- NOW, THEN,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

369
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,464
I'M OFF TO SEE
THE OUTDOOR ENTERTAINMENT:

370
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,864
KOGA AND INUYASHA.

371
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,764
NEITHER OF THEM TAKE MY FANCY,

372
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:04,464
SO I DON'T CARE WHICH
OF THEM WINS THE DUEL.

373
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:12,197
[GASPING]

374
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,866
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

375
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:00,308
- KOGA HAS BEEN TRICKED INTO
FIGHTING INUYASHA TO THE DEATH!

376
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,774
NARAKU'S GOAL IS TO GET A HOLD

377
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,874
OF THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS
IN KOGA'S LEGS,

378
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,841
BUT RATHER THAN TAKE HIM ON
HIMSELF AND GET HIS HANDS DIRTY,

379
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:08,774
HE'S PITTED KOGA
AGAINST INUYASHA,

380
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,174
HOPING THEY'LL FINISH
EACH OTHER OFF.

381
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,208
TETSUSAIGA GOT THROWN ASIDE?

382
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,308
IS INUYASHA'S ARM BROKEN?

383
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:16,274
HE'S WAY TOO PROUD TO LOSE OUT

384
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:18,841
TO THAT PRIMA DONNA
DEMON KAGURA.

385
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,441
NEXT ON "INUYASHA"...

386
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:24,308
SEE YOU SOON!
