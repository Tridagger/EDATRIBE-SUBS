1
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:31,002
- A SPIDER ON HIS BACK?

2
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:35,135
- YES, INUYASHA SAID HE SAW
A SPIDER-SHAPED BURN MARK

3
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,568
IN THE MIDDLE OF
MIROKU'S BACK.

4
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:40,902
- THE THIEF ONIGUMO
SUFFERED FROM TERRIBLE BURNS.

5
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,968
PERHAPS THAT MEANS
THAT MIROKU IS ONIGUMO.

6
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:51,068
- A SPIDER ON HIS BACK.
THAT SHALL SERVE AS
MIROKU'S OWN SIGN.

7
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:05,868
- KIKYO DIDN'T USE
THE POWER OF THE SHIKON JEWEL

8
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:08,102
TO SAVE HERSELF.

9
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,968
- KIKYO CHOSE DEATH
OVER LIFE.

10
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,202
SHE CHOSE TO FOLLOW INUYASHA.

11
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,802
- THIS MANSION IS ENORMOUS!

12
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:37,968
WHAT DO YOU THINK MIROKU?

13
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:39,502
WILL WE BE STAYING
HERE FOR THE NIGHT?

14
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:44,935
- I'LL WAGER MIROKU TELLS
THE OWNERS AN OMINOUS CLOUD
HANGS OVER THE MANSION.

15
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:45,868
- YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

16
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:49,368
I HAVE A LEGITIMATE
REASON FOR COMING HERE.

17
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:53,902
- SO THESE DEMONS CARRY OFF
THE SOULS OF DEAD GIRLS?

18
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,735
- YES, AS IF LOSING OUR PRINCESS
WASN'T UPSETTING ENOUGH.

19
00:02:56,768 --> 00:03:01,968
I CANNOT HAVE HER SOUL
STOLEN BEFORE IT REACHES
ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE.

20
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,668
- NO SUCH THING WILL OCCUR.

21
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,935
REST ASSURED THAT
MY ASSOCIATES AND I

22
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,802
SHALL PROTECT THE PRINCESSES
SOUL FROM THESE DEMONS.

23
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:09,635
- HMM?

24
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:16,202
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
SAME OLD LINE, SAME
OLD UNWARRANTED FEAST.

25
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:22,335
- PERHAPS, BUT ONE NEEDS
A FULL STOMACH IF HE IS
TO HEAD INTO COMBAT.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,135
THIS PLACE IS TOO QUIET.

27
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,468
THE AIR IS THICK WITH EVIL.

28
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,302
- [LAUGHING]

29
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,935
- [HUMMING]

30
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,968
AHH! OH, I FOUND SOME.

31
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,335
KIKYO!
KIKYO, I FOUND SOME!

32
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,002
LOOK, IS THIS A MEDICINAL HERB?

33
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,668
- YES, WELL DONE, SAYO.

34
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,135
IT'S CALLED A LANTERN PLANT,

35
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,568
AND IT'S USED
TO REDUCE SWELLING.

36
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,635
- KIKYO! KIKYO!
HEY, WHAT ARE THESE?

37
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,335
- DO THESE
GRASSES CURE ANYTHING?

38
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,935
- LET'S SEE.

39
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:04,735
- MASTER SEIKAI,
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THE
YOUNG PRIESTESS IS A DEMON?

40
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:07,702
SHE LOOKS NOTHING MORE
THAN A HUMAN TO MY EYES.

41
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,202
- THEN YOU LACK IN TRAINING.

42
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,268
CAN YOU NOT SENSE IT?

43
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:15,835
THIS AREA RESONATES
WITH A SINISTER EVIL.

44
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,735
- EXCUSE ME, MONK?

45
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:18,735
- HUH?

46
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:19,802
- HUH?

47
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,568
- I SEE YOU HAVE BEEN
WATCHING ME FOR SOME TIME NOW.

48
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:27,768
- HOW VERY AWKWARD.
YOU PERCEIVED US, DID YOU?

49
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,635
YOUR BEAUTY IS SO REMARKABLE,

50
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,635
I COULD NOT HELP
BUT STARE AT YOU.

51
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,768
- SPARE ME YOUR FLATTERY.

52
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:37,368
- APPARENTLY MY ETIQUETTE
IS IN SORE NEED OF REFINEMENT.

53
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,835
OHH!

54
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,135
- HMMM.

55
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,502
- GATHER THE SCROLL
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

56
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,602
IT CONTAINS
A SUTRA WARDING OFF EVIL.

57
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:57,435
SHOULD A DEMON TOUCH IT,
THE BEAST'S TRUE NATURE
WILL BE REVEALED.

58
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,502
- HOW FORTUNATE WE HAVE
SUCH SUTRAS TO PROTECT US.

59
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,602
HERE.
YOUR SCROLL.

60
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:12,668
- [GASP]

61
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,835
SHE TOUCHED THE SUTRA.

62
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:18,802
YET, THERE WAS
NO TRANSFORMATION.

63
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,668
AAHHHH!

64
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:34,002
- NOW, LET US GO, SHALL WE?

65
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,002
- I-I'M NOT
CERTAIN WHAT TRANSPIRED.

66
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:56,068
A TREMENDOUS FORCE
DID PASS THROUGH MY BODY.

67
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,435
NO, IT'S GONE!

68
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:00,135
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT UPSETS YOU, MASTER SEIKAI?

69
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,068
- LOOK AT THE SCROLL.

70
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:04,502
- HUH?

71
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,302
THE SUTRA HAS DISAPPEARED.

72
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,802
- IT'S AS THOUGH
IT HAS BEEN ERASED.

73
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,835
- HUH?

74
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,768
- PRIESTESS!

75
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,235
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT BINDS YOU TO THIS WORLD,

76
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:21,102
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT
A PLACE FOR YOU TO LINGER.

77
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,135
GO, AND RETURN
TO WHERE YOU BELONG!

78
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,835
- WHAT'S HE GOIN' ON ABOUT?

79
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,935
- HE'S A STRANGE MONK.

80
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,202
- THAT WOMAN
IS NO ORDINARY DEMON.

81
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:39,335
SHE IS MUCH STRONGER
AND MUCH MORE SINISTER.

82
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,902
- LOOK YONDER.
IT'S LADY KIKYO.

83
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:44,135
- LUCKILY, WE HAVE
SUCH A TALENTED AND KIND
PRIESTESS IN OUR MIDST.

84
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:47,102
- AYE, SHE CURES OURS AILS
AND CHEERS THE CHILDREN.

85
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:53,168
- IT IS SO.
WE ARE TRULY BLESSED, INDEED.

86
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,668
- THE WITCH URASUE

87
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:59,102
DESIRED THE SPIRITUAL
POWER OF A PRIESTESS,

88
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,535
SO SHE ROBBED THE BONES
AND EARTH FROM MY GRAVE

89
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,902
AND FIRED MY BODY IN HER KILN.

90
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:06,968
THE SOUL THAT HAS TRANSMIGRATED
INTO THIS BODY SUITS ME WELL.

91
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,935
WHY DID YOU BETRAY ME, INUYASHA?

92
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:13,768
FOR A SECOND TIME,
YOU ASKED ME TO DIE, INUYASHA.

93
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,435
SO, WHY DO YOU LOOK SAD?

94
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,135
IS IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL
THE HEAT FROM MY HAND?

95
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:21,968
THE HEAT OF ANGER,
THE FLAMES OF VENGEANCE.

96
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:27,802
- KIKYO!

97
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,135
- KIKYO?

98
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,502
DID YOU HEAR ME?

99
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,068
- SAYO.

100
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:56,535
- KIKYO, YOU WILL ALWAYS
STAY HERE WITH US, WON'T YOU?

101
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,168
- HMM? HMM...

102
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:02,602
TELL ME, SAYO,
ARE YOU FOND OF ME?

103
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:03,568
- MMM-HMM.

104
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:04,768
- THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

105
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:08,302
YOU ARE AS DEAR TO ME AS THOUGH
YOU WERE MY YOUNGER SISTER.

106
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,202
- OHH, TRULY?

107
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,968
- YES.

108
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:22,202
I CAN LIVE HERE.

109
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,735
I CAN RESIDE IN THIS VILLAGE.

110
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,135
I KNOW I CAN DO IT.

111
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:32,302
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS
WILL I BE PERMITTED TO DO IT?

112
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,402
- WELL, EVERYTHING
LOOKS CLEAR OUTSIDE.

113
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,135
ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN HERE?

114
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,435
- NO, SO FAR
EVERYTHING'S BEEN GOOD.

115
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:51,035
- GOOD--
SO, WHERE'D MIROKU GET TO?

116
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,235
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ONE
OTHER PRINCESS LIVING HERE,

117
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,735
SO MIROKU SAID HE WANTED
TO GO MAKE SURE SHE WAS SAFE.

118
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,535
- OH, SURE.

119
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,202
- THE YOUNGER
PRINCESS IS PETRIFIED.

120
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,035
- LEAVE HER--
I MEAN, THINGS--TO ME.

121
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:06,868
IF SHE IS LIKE HER SISTER,
THE YOUNGER PRINCESS MUST
BE A BEAUTY BEYOND COMPARE.

122
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,135
AHH, I LOVE MY JOB.

123
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,568
- MIROKU, AM I SUPPOSED TO HELP
YOU PROTECT THIS YOUNGER SISTER?

124
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:15,668
- FIRST WE MUST DO WHAT WE
CAN TO LAY HER FEARS TO REST.

125
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,968
PERHAPS YOU CAN TRANSFORM
INTO SOMETHING CUTE AND FUZZY.

126
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,002
- WHAT FOR?

127
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:23,202
- A BUNNY.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE ON UP CLOSE!

128
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,268
YOU SEE?

129
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,402
- NO, NOT REALLY.

130
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,635
- I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU ONE
DAY, WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH

131
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,968
TO TALK MAN TO MAN.

132
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:31,935
- HE'S SOME PLAYER.

133
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:33,902
TOO BAD HE HAS
EVERYONE CONVINCED HE'S A SAINT.

134
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,702
OTHERWISE, I'D GIVE
HIM A GOOD STOMPING.

135
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:37,968
HMMM?

136
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,802
UH, ISN'T THIS
A LITTLE CLOSE, KAGOME?

137
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:42,602
- DEAL WITH IT.
SHE'S CREEPING ME OUT.

138
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:46,902
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE COULD
SPRING TO LIFE ANY MINUTE NOW.

139
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:51,435
- HMM? THAT WAS YOUR MOTIVATION?

140
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:52,568
- WHY ELSE WOULD IT BE?

141
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,402
HEY, GET YOUR MIND
OUT OF THE GUTTER,

142
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,168
AND CONCENTRATE ON WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

143
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,302
- GUTTER?! AS IF!

144
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,568
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO JUMPED ME
AND STARTED PRESSING FLESH.

145
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,968
- A-HA! SO YOU DID HAVE
YOUR MIND IN THE TRASH.

146
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,168
- I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS!

147
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,935
- YOU WERE HITTING ON ME.

148
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,035
- I MUST TAKE LEAVE.

149
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,968
YOUR SISTER'S SOUL REQUIRES
MY UNWAVERING PROTECTION.

150
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,702
- DO NOT ABANDON ME,
MASTER MIROKU!

151
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:14,702
I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY.

152
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:18,435
- NO ONE WILL
COME AFTER YOU.
I GUARANTEE IT.

153
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,668
- YOU ARE TOO CRUEL.

154
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,268
- AAAHH!

155
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:40,135
- TIME TO WORK.

156
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,402
AAARRHHH!

157
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,468
- HER SPIRIT IS SAFE AGAIN.

158
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:07,002
- YOU THINK IT'S OVER?
NOT LIKELY.

159
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,535
- WAIT,
THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE.

160
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,468
SO, THERE'S MORE THAN
JUST ONE OF THOSE DEMONS.

161
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:19,935
- LOOK, THEY'RE ALL
CARRYING SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.

162
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:20,935
- THERE'S SO MANY.

163
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:23,435
WHERE COULD THEY BE
GOING WITH ALL THOSE SOULS?

164
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,002
- [PANTING]

165
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,702
AFTER THEM!
QUICKLY!

166
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:30,235
- PLEASE, STAY WITH ME.

167
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:31,702
- MIROKU HAVING
WOMEN TROUBLES AGAIN?

168
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,868
- I THINK SHE MAY BE
A DEMON AND NOT A WOMAN AT ALL.

169
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:40,802
- OOHHH! OH, LITTLE FOX,
HOW CAN YOU TREAT ME SO?

170

- THAT'S WHY IT'S
BETTER TO LEAVE THEM ALONE.

- WHY? WHAT DO THEY
NEED TO BE ALONE FOR?

I UNDERSTAND HER MEANING.

- HUH?

307
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,000
- THE WOMAN HE ONCE LOVED
SO COMPLETELY MAY HAVE CHANGED,

308
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,967
AND IF THAT
WERE INDEED THE CASE,

HE COULD NOT ALLOW OTHERS
TO WITNESS THE CHANGE IN HER

SHE MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.

THEN WHAT DO YOU
THINK WOULD HAPPEN?

BUT ALL WE CAN DO
IS WISH HIM OUR BEST.

340
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,233
THE GRASS
IS REALLY SLIPPERY HERE.

341
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:24,400
HUH? OH, NO,
I MUST HAVE LOST THEM.

342
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,033
[SCREAMING]

343
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,567
MY BACK.

344
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,700
WHERE AM I?

345
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,533
[GASP]

346
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
KIKYO!

347
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:03,661
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

348
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,956
- KIKYO LIVES.

349
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,056
AN EVIL WITCH
HAD TRIED TO STEAL HER SOUL

350
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,890
BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED
IN REVIVING IT.

351
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,623
AND NOW KIKYO'S SOUL
WANDERS THE LAND OF THE LIVING.

352
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:49,856
HER BODY IS MADE OF CLAY
AND HOLDS NO WARMTH.

353
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,356
HER EYES ARE COLD AND DARK.

354
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,523
RUN, INUYASHA!

355
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,023
KIKYO IS TRYING TO HURT YOU!

356
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,556
DON'T DO IT, KIKYO.

357
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,890
INUYASHA'S NOT YOUR ENEMY.

358
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:04,523
NEXT TIME, "KAGOME'S VOICE
AND KIKYO'S KISS."

359
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,556
SEE YOU SOON!
