1
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:46,623
>> IS IT REALLY ALL RIGHT FOR ME

2
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,690
TO GO BACK?

3
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,923
>> SURE, THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU

4
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:51,690
TO DO AROUND HERE, ANYWAY.

5
00:01:51,690 --> 00:02:02,390
>> WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

6
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:23,557
>> HMM.

7
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:27,390
>> SIS, WELCOME HOME.

8
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,857
>> NICE TO BE BACK.

9
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:33,490
>> KAGOME, WELCOME BACK, DEAR.

10
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,790
>> WELL, WELL...YOU WERE GONE

11
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,857
FOR SOME TIME.

12
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,723
IT WAS HARD COMING UP

13
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,623
WITH EXCUSES FOR YOUR SCHOOL.

14
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:40,490
>> I'M JUST GLAD THAT YOU'RE

15
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,757
SAFELY HOME AGAIN, KAGOME.

16
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:44,690
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER,

17
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,257
YOU TIRED OR SOMETHING?

18
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:48,023
>> I'M NOT TIRED, REALLY.

19
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:52,090
OH.

20
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,257
HERE YOU ARE, A PRESENT.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,290
APPARENTLY SOME KIND OF RARE

22
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,623
DRIED FOOD.

23
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:00,123
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT.

24
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:00,823
>> I'M GOING TO GO REST

25
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:12,323
IN MY ROOM.

26
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:13,357
>> I AM NOT!

27
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:14,090
>> JUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

28
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,590
KIDDING, INUYASHA?

29
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,923
AND IF YOU DO GO, THEN I'LL BE

30
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,523
UPSET.

31
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,590
BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED,

32
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,457
RIGHT?

33
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:26,723
>> KAGOME.

34
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,790
>> I CAN'T KEEP PUTTING MYSELF

35
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,023
THROUGH ALL THIS.

36
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:43,790
OK.

37
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,590
>> MAYBE YOU SHOULD PACE

38
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,790
YOURSELF, SIS.

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,023
>> I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL

40
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:50,390
TOMORROW AFTER A LONG ABSENCE.

41
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,457
I NEED TO STORE UP ENERGY.

42
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:56,023
I THINK I'LL BE HERE FOR A WHILE

43
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,623
SO I'M GOING TO KNUCKLE DOWN,

44
00:03:57,623 --> 00:04:00,457
AND STUDY HARD.

45
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,623
I DESPERATELY NEED TO CATCH UP

46
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:04,523
IN ALL MY CLASSES.

47
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:05,990
>> WELL, SHE SEEMS READY TO GO.

48
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,423
>> SECONDS PLEASE!

49
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:11,423
>> COMING UP.

50
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,057
>> UH, WHAT IS IT?

51
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,623
>> UH, NOTHING.

52
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,457
>> I'LL GET A GOOD NIGHT'S

53
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,957
SLEEP AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THE

54
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:22,323
FEUDAL ERA FOR A WHILE.

55
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:23,257
I'LL CONCENTRATE ON WHAT

56
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,757
I REALLY AM,

57
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:31,523
A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

58
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:39,257
>> HUH?

59
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:40,523
WHAT'S GOING ON?

60
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:41,623
>> OH, KAGOME!

61
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:42,723
>> HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

62
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:43,723
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU.

63
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:44,590
SO, YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN

64
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,857
TO SCHOOL?

65
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:47,223
>> UH, YEAH.

66
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,457
>> THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU SURE

67
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,190
WERE GONE A LONG TIME.

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,223
>> WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

69
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,290
AN INNER EAR DISEASE THAT

70
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,223
MADE YOU HEAR ALL KINDS

71
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,490
OF STRANGE THINGS?

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,823
>> UH, NEVER MIND ME,

73
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,123
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

74
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,290
>> OH, JUST MORE PREPARATIONS.

75
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,857
>> HEY, KAGOME HAS BEEN AWAY FOR

76
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,123
SUCH A LONG TIME SHE PROBABLY

77
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:05,857
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

78
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,157
>> OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

79
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:08,057
>> THAT'S TRUE.

80
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,323
>> TELL ME.

81
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,323
>> CULTURAL FESTIVAL.

82
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,357
>> HUH?

83
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,023
>> WE'RE HAVING A

84
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,623
CULTURAL FESTIVAL.

85
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,157
>> A FESTIVAL?

86
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,457
YES, BUT WHAT ABOUT CLASSES?

87
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,757
>> CLASSES? ARE YOU KIDDING?

88
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:21,423
WE'RE TOO BUSY WITH ALL OF THIS.

89
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,190
>> WE JUST HAVE CLASSES

90
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,390
IN THE MORNING.

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,423
>> WHY DID I HAVE TO COME BACK

92
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:29,923
WHEN CLASSES AREN'T CRUCIAL?

93
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,290
>> ARE YOU OK?

94
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,290
>> I'M GOING HOME.

95
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,790
>> HEY, HANG ON A MINUTE.

96
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,790
>> I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY NEEDED

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,923
HERE OR OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.

98
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:40,757
>> WHY ARE YOU SO DEPRESSED,

99
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,157
KAGOME?

100
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:42,990
>> YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND SHAKE

101
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,057
IT OFF.

102
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,923
WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU?

103
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:47,290
>> I KNOW, LET'S SING.

104
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,190
>> SING?

105
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,123
>> YES, THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

106
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,390
>> KNOW WHAT?

107
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,723
KAGOME, YOU SHOULD PARTICIPATE

108
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,857
IN THE FESTIVAL AS WELL.

109
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:56,457
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

110
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,923
WE SURE COULD USE THE HELP.

111
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,623
>> WHAT'S THAT?

112
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:04,590
>> [LAUGHING]

113
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,790
>> AN UNDERSTUDY?

114
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,023
>> YES, THINK OF IT AS BEING

115
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:08,290
LIKE A STAND-IN

116
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,057
OR LIKE A SUBSTITUTE.

117
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,457
>> COME ON, I MEAN HOW HARD

118
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:12,790
CAN IT BE?

119
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,523
>> OK, THEN...I'LL DO IT.

120
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,757
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

121
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:18,990
>> SING IN THE CHOIR.

122
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,157
>> SING?

123
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:21,457
>> HELP WITH THE FOOD.

124
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:22,590
>> THE FOOD?

125
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,757
>> ACTING.

126
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,157
>> ACTING?

127
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:26,657
>> I HAVE A SMALL ROLE FOR YOU.

128
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,490
THE HEROINE'S FRIEND, BRILLIANT.

129
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,490
>> BRILLIANT, YOU SAY?

130
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,357
SO, WHICH SHOULD I DO?

131
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:35,390
>> WELL, ALL OF THEM OF COURSE.

132
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,390
>> ALL 3?

133
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,823
>> YOU'RE THE UNDERSTUDY.

134
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,057
>> DON'T BE SO CHICKEN.

135
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,290
>> LOOK, KAGOME, WE'VE ALL

136
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,557
GONE THROUGH A LOT OF PRACTICE

137
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,257
AND PREPARATION.

138
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:45,090
BUT YOU'LL BE DONE WITH ALL

139
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,457
OF THIS IN A FEW DAYS.

140
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:50,023
DOING ALL 3 SHOULD BE EASY.

141
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,723
>> OK.

142
00:06:52,723 --> 00:07:00,790
>> NOW.

143
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,057
HEY, COME ON, KAGOME,

144
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,690
I WANT YOU TO SING LOUDER.

145
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:12,457
SING IT FROM THE HEART.

146
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:13,423
>> I WANT TO CREATE SOMETHING

147
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,023
EXOTIC AND REFRESHINGLY UNIQUE.

148
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,023
>> WELL, I AM RATHER GOOD

149
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,923
AT OUTDOOR COOKING.

150
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:19,757
>> WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE

151
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,123
BARBECUING?

152
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,190
>> GRILLED RIVER FISH OVER

153
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,923
A WOOD FIRE, OR FERN ROOTS

154
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,057
OVER A WOOD FIRE.

155
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:27,957
>> JUST STICK WITH THE PEELING

156
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,190
THING.

157
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,423
>> OK, WE'LL BEGIN WITH

158
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:33,290
BRILLIANT'S LINE IN ACT 2,

159
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,423
ALL RIGHT?

160
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:35,723
>> EVER SINCE MY GRANDFATHER

161
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,023
COLLAPSED FROM LUMBAGO, I'VE--

162
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,323
>> NO, NO, NO.

163
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,690
YOU NEED TO THROW YOUR ARMS OUT

164
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,957
LIKE THIS, AND SPEAK MORE

165
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:44,590
DRAMATICALLY.

166
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,690
FROM THE TOP.

167
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
>> MY GRANDFATHER COLLAPSED

168
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:52,923
FROM LUMBAGO!

169
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:55,057
>> SO, HOW IS IT?

170
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,090
>> IT'S NOT BAD, IF I MAY

171
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,957
SAY SO.

172
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:58,857
>> THEN I WANT SOME, TOO!

173
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,457
>> I'M HOME.

174
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:06,490
>> HEY, SIS, YOU'RE HOME LATE.

175
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,423
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,323
ENERGY YOU STORED UP?

177
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,457
>> I USED IT ALL UP IN ONE

178
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,723
SINGLE DAY.

179
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,757
>> WERE YOUR CLASSES THAT HARD?

180
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:14,723
>> SCHOOL WORK WOULD'VE

181
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,423
BEEN EASIER.

182
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:19,590
>> KAGOME, THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.

183
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,690
>> HUH?

184
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,857
>> THE DRIED FOODS YOU BROUGHT

185
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:22,657
BACK FOR ME.

186
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,890
THEY GO PERFECTLY WITH SAKE.

187
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,123
>> GOOD.

188
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:30,523
I'M SO GLAD.

189
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,557
>> NARAKU TRIED TO USE

190
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:33,323
KAGOME'S EYES?

191
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:34,923
>> YES, TO HELP HIM FIND

192
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:40,857
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

193
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:41,890
>> THAT MEANS NARAKU

194
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,090
DOESN'T KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS

195
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,223
OF ALL THE REMAINING

196
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,290
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

197
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,223
>> YES.

198
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,123
AND THE FACT THAT HE WENT

199
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,457
TO THE TROUBLE OF KIDNAPPING

200
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,523
KAGOME MUST SIGNIFY THAT THERE

201
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:53,157
ARE SHARDS WHICH EVEN NARAKU

202
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,523
CANNOT FIND.

203
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:55,990
>> HOW COME?

204
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,457
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY.

205
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:58,490
PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING

206
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,323
ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE HIDDEN.

207
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,257
>> IT MEANS NARAKU IS

208
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:19,823
NOT INFALLIBLE.

209
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:21,690
>> HEH HEH HEH.

210
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,290
SO, YOU'VE COME, NARAKU.

211
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,823
ACTUALLY I HEARD YOU COMING

212
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:27,423
FROM SEVERAL LEAGUES AWAY.

213
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,090
>> OH, THEN THAT WILL SAVE ME

214
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:36,057
TIME EXPLAINING MYSELF.

215
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,957
>> MIMISENRI, THEY SAY THAT YOU

216
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,623
POSSESS EARS THAT ARE CAPABLE

217
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,223
OF HEARING ALL THINGS IN THIS

218
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,257
WORLD.

219
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:43,990
>> YES, YOU ARE CORRECT,

220
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,890
AND I HAVE HEARD THINGS

221
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,390
ABOUT YOU, TOO.

222
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,957
DO YOU INTEND TO TAKE MY EARS

223
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:49,090
AND MAKE THEM A PART OF YOU

224
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,890
SO THAT YOU MAY USE THEM?

225
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,957
>> REST ASSURED, YOUR FILTHY

226
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,257
LITTLE BODY DOESN'T INTEREST

227
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,123
ME AT ALL.

228
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:57,557
>> WELL, TELL ME, THEN.

229
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:58,957
WHY HAVE YOU COME ALL THE WAY

230
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,357
HERE TO VISIT ME?

231
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,157
>> WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD

232
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,190
OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF

233
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,023
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS?

234
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:06,457
>> AHH, ACCORDING TO THE RUMORS

235
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:09,490
OF DEMONS, NARAKU, YOU YOURSELF

236
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,890
HAVE APPARENTLY OBTAINED NEARLY

237
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,523
ALL OF THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

238
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,257
>> JUST ONE.

239
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,790
ONE SHARD IS LEFT,

240
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,357
AND SOMEHOW IT HAS ELUDED MY

241
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,490
ATTEMPTS TO FIND IT.

242
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,690
>> AHH, THEN LET'S SEE WHAT

243
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,290
MY EARS CAN FIND FOR YOU.

244
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:32,323
HMM.

245
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,423
>> ALL OF OUR JEWEL SHARDS

246
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,957
ARE NOW IN NARAKU'S POSSESSION.

247
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,057
>> KOGA STILL HAS 2 SHARDS

248
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:40,523
IN HIS LEGS.

249
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,423
>> AND THERE'S THE ONE

250
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:46,423
WHICH KEEPS KOHAKU ALIVE.

251
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,223
>> OF COURSE.

252
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:50,590
>> IF NARAKU SUCCEEDS IN MAKING

253
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,190
THE SACRED JEWEL WHOLE AGAIN,

254
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,557
KOHAKU WILL DIE.

255
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,490
>> DON'T WORRY, SANGO.

256
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,290
WE'LL STOP NARAKU.

257
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,923
>> THANK YOU.

258
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:02,990
>> BELIEVE ME, WE'RE GOING

259
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
TO FIND THE REMAINING

260
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,657
JEWEL SHARDS BEFORE HIM.

261
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,357
>> YES, YOU'RE RIGHT INUYASHA,

262
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:08,857
WE WILL.

263
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,823
>> INUYASHA, I'M SURE I DON'T

264
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:13,557
NEED TO REMIND YOU, BUT YOU MUST

265
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,923
BE MORE CAREFUL WITH KAGOME.

266
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:17,090
MAKE SURE NARAKU NEVER CAPTURES

267
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,557
HER AGAIN.

268
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,723
>> LOOK, I KNOW ALL THAT

269
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:22,523
ALREADY, OK?

270
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:23,757
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU EATING

271
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,623
OVER THERE, SHIPPO?

272
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:27,090
>> WHAT, THIS?

273
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,090
REMEMBER THOSE VILLAGERS AND

274
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,290
ITINERANT PRIESTS WE SAVED

275
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,290
A WHILE AGO?

276
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,257
WELL, THEY GAVE ME SOME OF THEIR

277
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,623
DRIED FOOD IN GRATITUDE.

278
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:33,757
>> OH, BROTHER.

279
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,723
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES

280
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,190
WE DEMON SLAYERS WARN THEM,

281
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,857
THEY NEVER LISTEN.

282
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,190
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

283
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,290
>> NO, KIRARA, THIS FOOD

284
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,523
IS MADE OUT OF DEMONS.

285
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,357
>> WHAT?

286
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:44,790
>> THIS IS A HYPAE OF A FUNGAL

287
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,757
DEMON CALLED SHIRONYUUDOU.

288
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,290
>> SO, IS IT SAFE TO EAT?

289
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,023
>> YES, LIKE THIS IT IS.

290
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:52,757
BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN WATER

291
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:54,223
AND HEAT IT...

292
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:55,657
>> YOU MEAN IF YOU BOIL IT?

293
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:57,123
>> YES, IF YOU BOIL IT,

294
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,990
A NEW SHIRONYUUDOU IS BORN.

295
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,157
>> SO IT ISN'T REALLY DEAD THEN?

296
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,057
>> IT'S BEST IF ALL THIS FOOD

297
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,290
IS DISPOSED OF.

298
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,357
>> HMM, BUT IT WAS SO DARN

299
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:07,790
TASTY.

300
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,523
>> THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH

301
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,157
A NUISANCE.

302
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:10,957
>> UHH!

303
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,590
FORGET ABOUT THE DRIED FOOD.

304
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,823
IF WE CAN FIND THE REMAINING

305
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,323
SACRED JEWEL SHARD,

306
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:16,290
WE CAN PUT AN END TO ALL

307
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,623
OF THIS.

308
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,257
>> HMM, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

309
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,357
THAT WAS THE START OF IT ALL.

310
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,690
>> WHEREVER NARAKU IS HIDING

311
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,457
RIGHT NOW, HE'S SURE TO APPEAR

312
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:31,257
WHERE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD IS.

313
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:35,890
[SINGING]

314
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,090
>> GOOD, NEXT KEY.

315
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,923
HUH?

316
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:42,657
>> I'M SORRY, AYUMI,

317
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,023
I CAUGHT A COLD.

318
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,057
>> OH, NO!

319
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,890
>> I'M SO SORRY.

320
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,890
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT,

321
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,057
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

322
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:53,157
KAGOME!

323
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:53,957
>> HUH?

324
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:56,357
>> YOU WILL SING HER ALTO SOLO.

325
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,423
>> WHAT!

326
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,957
YOU CAN'T REALLY BE SERIOUS.

327
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:03,157
>> UH-HUH!

328
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,057
>> HEY, UH, CAN YOU HAND ME

329
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,523
THAT TAPE PLEASE?

330
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,390
>> YOU MEAN THIS TAPE?

331
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,590
>> YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

332
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,923
>> MOKI, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

333
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:10,623
>> OW!

334
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,990
IT HURTS.

335
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,057
>> TAKE HER TO THE INFIRMARY,

336
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:19,490
RIGHT AWAY.

337
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,823
SO, HOW IS SHE?

338
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:21,790
>> SPRAINED ANKLE.

339
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,557
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND

340
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,057
FOR A WHILE.

341
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,490
>> UHH.

342
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,057
BRILLIANT!

343
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,523
>> HUH...UH, YES?

344
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:31,590
>> FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

345
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,723
YOU ARE NO LONGER PLAYING

346
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:33,690
BRILLIANT.

347
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,623
BUT THE FEMALE LEAD,

348
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:35,957
ESCARGOT PUDDING!

349
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,257
>> WHAT!

350
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:38,157
>> NOW, LET'S CONTINUE

351
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,423
WITH REHEARSAL.

352
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,390
ESCARGOT, GET ON STAGE.

353
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,323
>> NO FAIR.

354
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,657
I CAN'T BELIEVE ARIMI AND ERI,

355
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,790
AFTER ALL, I'M SUPPOSED

356
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,857
TO BE AN UNDERSTUDY,

357
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,657
NOT THE STAR ATTRACTION!

358
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:50,923
RIGHT?

359
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,257
>> IT'S NO GOOD.

360
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,090
I JUST CAN'T FIND

361
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,090
ANY GOOD RECIPES.

362
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,723
HONESTLY, ISN'T THERE ANYTHING

363
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,657
THAT PACKS A REAL PUNCH?

364
00:13:58,657 --> 00:13:59,590
SOMETHING THAT TANTALIZES

365
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,290
THE PALLET, YET SOMETHING NEW,

366
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,190
YOU KNOW?

367
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,223
>> GUESS NOT.

368
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:04,557
>> WELL, CAN YOU FIND SOMETHING?

369
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,490
>> HUH?

370
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,223
BUT I--

371
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,157
AFTER THIS IS DONE,

372
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:08,090
I HAVE TO GO TO A PRACTICE

373
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,457
SINGING LESSON FOR THE CHOIR.

374
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,823
THEN I HAVE TO GO TO REHEARSALS

375
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,023
FOR THE PLAY, AND THEN I--

376
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,690

AS HE PLEASES WHEN HE'S

586
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,813
