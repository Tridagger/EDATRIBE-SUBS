- [CHANTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,994
- [MOANING]

- [SCREAMING]

4
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,494
- WOULD YOU BE TSUBAKI,
THE DARK PRIESTESS?

5
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,727
- IF YOU'VE COME TO BREAK
THE CURSE, IT'S TOO LATE.

6
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,360
THE VICTIM HAS ALREADY PERISHED.

7
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,427
- I'M NOT THE LEAST BIT
INTERESTED.

8
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,094
IT WAS YOU I CAME FOR.

9
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,960
- THEN YOU MUST BE A DEMON!

10
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:54,960
- STOP THIS.

11
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,994
YOU ARE A TROUBLESOME HAG,
INDEED.

12
00:02:57,027 --> 00:03:00,627
MY MASTER HAS ASKED ME
TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE.

13
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,727
- WHAT DOES A DEMON WANT
WITH ME?

14
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,160
- TELL ME, DO YOU STILL BEAR
A GRUDGE AGAINST KIKYO?

15
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,560
- KIKYO, YOU SAY?

16
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,860
- WHAT IS ALL THIS?
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

17
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,860
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A THING!

18
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,127
I DON'T GET IT AT ALL!

19
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:43,260
- KAGOME,
READ THE NEXT LINE OUT LOUD.

20
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:45,794
- UH...

21
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:54,827
OH, I'VE FORGOTTEN
EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED.

22
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,994
I'M FALLING SO FAR BEHIND.

23
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,394
- WOW, KAGOME SURE LOOKS
BUMMED OUT THESE DAYS.

24
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,660
- I'LL BET
IT'S THAT OLD BOYFRIEND OF HERS.

25
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,627
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE ONE
WHO DUMPED HER ONCE BEFORE--

26
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,860
YOU KNOW, THE POSSESSIVE,
BOSSY GUY WITH ATTITUDE?

27
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:14,827
- SHE PROBABLY ISN'T
OVER HIM YET.

28
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,794
- HUH?

29
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,927
- COME ON.
TRY AND CHEER UP, KAGOME.

30
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
- OH, JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE CREEP.

31
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:25,427
- YEAH.
THE JERK'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT.

32
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,960
- WHO ISN'T WORTH IT?

33
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,594
DO THEY MEAN INUYASHA?

34
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,194
- WELL, YOU GUYS BROKE UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

35
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,327
- YOU JUST HAVE TO GET OVER HIM.

36
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,794
- OH, THAT.
WELL, ACTUALLY WE--

37
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,194
- WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS TIME?

38
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,294
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
WE MADE UP AGAIN.

39
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:43,194
- OH.

40
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,660
- YOU'RE BACK TOGETHER?

41
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:45,994
- WITH THAT KNUCKLE DRAGGER?

42
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,760
- HE DOES HAVE
HIS NICE SIDE, TOO, YOU KNOW.

43
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,960
- SERIOUSLY?
- THAT'S TYPICAL.

44
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:53,294
- THEN, HOW COME YOU WERE
SO DOWN?

45
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,360
- I'VE BEEN ABSENT A LOT,

46
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,794
SO IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH SCHOOLWORK.

47
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:57,760
- MAKES SENSE.

48
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:00,160
YOU DO MISS AN AWFUL LOT
OF SCHOOL.

49
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:01,360
- EVEN IF YOU NEVER MISS CLASS,

50
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:04,227
IT'S STILL DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW
SOMETIMES.

51
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,160
- DEFINITELY.

52
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:07,460
- [ALL SIGH]

53
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:10,360
- STILL, IF YOU KEEP UP
AND WORK HARD,

54
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,360
CLASSES SURE ARE FUN,
THOUGH, AREN'T THEY?

55
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,294
- HUH?

56
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,727
- WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT?

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,494
DID I SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,
YOU GUYS?

58
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,727
- NOT AT ALL.

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,027
- YOU ALWAYS WERE GOOD
AT SCHOOL.

60
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,327
- I'VE GOT TO GET GOING.

61
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,360
YOU SEE, WHEN I'M LATE,
HE COMES TO GET ME.

62
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,760
- HE COMES TO MEET YOU?

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,894
HE MUST BE A REALLY NICE GUY,
THEN.

64
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:35,194
- HARDLY, HE'S JUST JEALOUS.
- AND POSSESSIVE.

65
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,894
- LATER!

66
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:40,127
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER.

67
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,294
- I WONDER IF KAGOME
CAN HANDLE IT?

68
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,094
- HUH? HANDLE WHAT?

69
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,760
- THIS NARAKU HAS SURROUNDED
HIMSELF WITH AN OMINOUS BARRIER.

70
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,760
- NOW, HOLD ON TIGHT,
OLD WOMAN.

71
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,494
NARAKU,
I FOUND THE WOMAN.

72
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:10,627
- YOU'VE COME, TSUBAKI,
THE DARK PRIESTESS.

73
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,760
- WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF SUMMONING ME HERE?

74
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:18,894
- DO YOU RECALL BATTLING
A PRIESTESS NAMED KIKYO

75
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,127
HALF A CENTURY AGO?

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,527
YOU WERE TRYING TO STEAL
THE SACRED JEWEL.

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,794
- OH, I'M SURPRISED YOU KNOW
ABOUT SUCH AN OLD INCIDENT.

78
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,894
- NOW, DARK PRIESTESS,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER

79
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,127
USING YOUR EVIL POWERS
TO ASSIST ME?

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,027
- NARAKU, WAS IT?

81
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,827
HOW WOULD ASSISTING YOU BE
A BENEFIT TO ME?

82
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,094
- YOU SHALL HAVE
THE SACRED JEWEL.

83
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,694
- OH?

84
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,894
- THE SACRED JEWEL? OH?

85
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:05,560
YOU HAVE IT
IN YOUR POSSESSION?

86
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,394
- THE OLD HAG TRANSFORMED
HERSELF!

87
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,860
- WATCH YOUR TONGUE, YOU WRETCH,
BECAUSE THIS IS MY TRUE FORM.

88
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:16,060
- THE OLD WOMAN SOLD HER SOUL
TO A DEMON

89
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:18,094
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HER YOUTH.

90
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,127
THE DEMON HAD BUT
MINOR STANDING,

91
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,294
SO NOW SHE MUST SEEK
EVEN MORE POWER.

92
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,627
- SHOW ME THE SACRED JEWEL,
IF YOU TRULY POSSESS IT.

93
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,494
- WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DESIRE

94
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:31,960
FROM THE SACRED JEWEL,
PRIESTESS?

95
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,194
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
YOU WOULD WANT ETERNAL YOUTH.

96
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:38,727
- [GASP]

97
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:44,494
- NARAKU, WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

98
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:50,060
- THIS ONE'S FOR SHIPPO,
AND THIS IS INUYASHA'S FAVORITE.

99
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,194
- DON'T TAKE JUST JUNK FOOD.
HERE.

100
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,927
HOW ABOUT THIS?

101
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,460
- THANKS FOR THE LUNCHBOX, MOM.
- I HAVE LOTS MORE, TOO.

102
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,160
- UH, GREAT. THANKS.

103
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:08,394
- OH, KAGOME, DON'T FORGET
THE SACRED SAKE AND CHARMS!

104
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,360
- UH, THANKS.
I'LL PASS ON THOSE, GRAMPS.

105
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,060
- ARE YOU CERTAIN?

106
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,027
- SIS, ARE YOU GOING ALREADY?
- YEP. I'M LATE.

107
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,127
- INUYASHA'S WAITING?
- YEAH. THEY ALL ARE.

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,360
- I WISH I COULD GO
TO THE FEUDAL ERA, TOO.

109
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:28,094
- YOU'RE SUCH A SCAREDY CAT,
THOUGH.

110
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,227
YOU WOULDN'T LAST 5 MINUTES
BACK THERE.

111
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,827
- SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE STILL SO YOUNG, SOTA.

112
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,994
- DON'T YOU EVER GET SCARED,
SIS?

113
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,794
- YEAH, BUT IT'S OK.

114
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:40,660
I'M SORT OF USED TO IT NOW.

115
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:43,494
UGH, THIS WEIGHS A TON.

116
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,394
- SURE YOU CAN CARRY ALL THAT?

117
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,560
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

118
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,760
I'LL JUST HAVE TO LEAVE
MY TEXTBOOKS BEHIND.

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,094
- KAGOME'S LATE.
SHE SAID SHE'D BACK BY SUNDOWN.

120
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,394
- KAGOME IS LATE.
- HMM?

121
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:09,060
- INUYASHA, SHE SAID
THAT SHE'D BE BACK BY SUNDOWN.

122
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,627
UHHH...

123
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,260
OH! WHY ME?

124
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:16,194
- OH, SAVE IT.

125
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,227
- YOU CREEP! UHHH...

126
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,027
WHAT WAS THAT?

127
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,827
- DO YOU SENSE SOMETHING,
TOO, SHIPPO?

128
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,594
- YES, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

129
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:35,594
- HUH?

130
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:39,260
I DON'T LIKE
THE SMELL OF THAT.

131
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,460
- A DEMON AURA.

132
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,727
- LADY KAEDE.

133
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,960
- OH! MIROKU.

134
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,060
- SO, YOU HAVE SENSED IT, TOO?

135
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,194
- AYE.
EVIL IS LURKING NEARBY.

136
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,627
- [WIND BLOWING]

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,694
- IT SEEMS TO BE SLITHERING
ACROSS THE GROUND.

138
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,760
- WHAT IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

139
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,194
- UP...AND OVER.

140
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:11,994
UGH, THAT WAS A WORKOUT.

141
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,627
AHH.

142
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,694
OW! AH!

143
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:21,960
HEY, SOMETHING BIT ME.

144
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:26,494
WHAT WAS IT, THOUGH?

145
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,694
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

146
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:34,360
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

147
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,394
- SOMETHING BIT ME.

148
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,327
I THINK IT CAME
FROM OVER THERE.

149
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,994
- WHAT?
UNH!

150
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,027
THERE IT IS.

151
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,960
IRON REAVER SOUL STEALER!

152
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,460
PAPER?

153
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,594
HUH?

154
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:09,360
- FINE WORK.

155
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:13,394
YOU HAVE THE GIRL'S BLOOD,
I PRESUME.

156
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:14,927
- ARE YOU FINISHED?

157
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,927
- YES.
NOW, TAKE ME BACK TO NARAKU.

158
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,427
- BOSSY WITCH.

159
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,894
UNH.

160
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:31,960
- UGH.

161
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,427
- THERE WAS
SOMETHING STRANGE HERE.

162
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,494
I ATTACKED IT, BUT LOOK.

163
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,827
- I CAN PERFORM THIS ON MY OWN.

164
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,560
- DO AS YOU PLEASE.

165
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:15,394
- [LAUGHING]

166
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:20,427
- IT'S TRUE!

167
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,494
- BUT THERE'S NO BITE MARK.

168
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:23,794
- HE'S RIGHT.
- I KNOW, BUT...

169
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,027
- THERE WAS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING STRANGE AROUND.

170
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,494
- LET ME LOOK, INUYASHA,
AT THAT PAPER.

171
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,527
- HERE.

172
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,027
- HMM.

173
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,460
- BY THE WAY, KAGOME,
DID YOU--

174
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:38,627
- DON'T WORRY, SHIPPO.
I DIDN'T FORGET YOUR GOODIES.

175
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,127
- OOH.

176
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,127
- MMM, HERE.
- AHH, YES!

177
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,594
THIS IS THE ONE!

178
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,960
AHH, MMM!

179
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,194
- FOR YOU, INUYASHA.

180
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,327
- THANKS.

181
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,394
- YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THE LUNCH
MY MOM MADE.

182
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:59,894
- THIS IS SHIKIKAMI.
- SHIKIKAMI?

183
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,660
[GASP]

184
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:04,160
WHAT WAS THAT?
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS!

185
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:07,627
- WHAT IS IT, KAGOME?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

186
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,027
- UH...

187
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,694
[GASP]

188
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,527
THE SHARDS
HAVE TURNED BLACK!

189
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,760
AAH!

190
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,727
- HUH?
- AAH!
- KAGOME!

191
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,927
- KAGOME!

192
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,927
- THE SHARDS ARE GOING
INSIDE ME!

193
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,327
- KAGOME!

194
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,094
- SHARDS THAT ENTER HER FLESH

195
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,527
THEN SYNCHRONIZE WITH
THIS SACRED JEWEL

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,327
WHICH HAS BEEN DEFILED
WITH YOUR EVIL

197
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,760
AND WILL SLOWLY FESTER
IN HER BODY AND MIND.

198
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,494
AND THEN, NARAKU,

199
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,427
THIS YOUNG WOMAN WILL BE MINE
TO CONTROL.

200
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,927
- TSUBAKI, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THIS YOUNG WOMAN KAGOME.

201
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,094
- DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

202
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,994
SHE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE SHE HAD
BEEN PLACED UNDER A CURSE.

203
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:03,894
I EXPECTED THE REINCARNATION
OF KIKYO

204
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,827
TO BE MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE.

205
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,960
NOW, WHAT SHALL I DO?

206
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:11,094
KILL HER IMMEDIATELY
OR PERHAPS...

207
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,160
- HEH HEH HEH.

208
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:15,627
LET'S MAKE INUYASHA SUFFER
THROUGH ANOTHER NIGHTMARE,

209
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,960
A NOSTALGIC DREAM
ABOUT THE WOMAN HE LOVES...

210
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,860
KILLING HIM.

211
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,560
- CAN YOU HEAR ME, KAGOME?
- SAY SOMETHING.

212
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:25,960
- KAGOME!

213
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,094
- WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS,
LADY KAEDE?

214
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,060
- THAT EVIL
WE SENSED EARLIER--

215
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:33,694
SOMEONE WAS PLACING A CURSE
ON KAGOME.

216
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:36,827
- SOMEONE'S CURSED HER?

217
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,027
- I BELIEVE THE DARK PRIESTESS
IS BEHIND THIS.

218
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,927
KAGOME WAS BITTEN AT THE WELL

219
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,827
BY THE DARK PRIESTESS'
SHIKIKAMI.

220
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
- DARK PRIESTESS?

221
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:50,327
- AYE. INUYASHA,
YOU MUST CERTAINLY KNOW OF THEM.

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,260
THIS IS A WICKED PRIESTESS
WHO SPECIALIZES IN CURSES.

223
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,460
IT WAS HER DARK ENCHANTMENT

224
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,660
THAT TURNED
THE JEWEL SHARDS BLACK.

225
00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:00,494
- AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE
ENTERED KAGOME'S FLESH!

226
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:04,394
- THE POISON COULD KILL HER
UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING.

227
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,494
- LET'S GO, SANGO.

228
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,260
WE'LL DESTROY
THIS DARK PRIESTESS.

229
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:11,994
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO BREAK THE CURSE.

230
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,827
- HANG ON.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

231
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,527
- INUYASHA...

232
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,527
- IT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU
TO STAY HERE WITH KAGOME.

233
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,327
- YOU'RE MOST NEEDED HERE.
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

234
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,194
- UNH!

235
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:33,094
I SENSE EVIL COMING
FROM THIS DIRECTION.

236
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,794
- UP HERE!
GET ON, MIROKU!

237
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,127
- YEAH. GOOD LUCK!

238
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,027
- KAGOME!

239
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,427
- [MOANING]

240
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
- KILL HIM.
- WHO?

241
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:53,060
- KILL HIM.
- KILL WHO?

242
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:57,760
- KILL INUYASHA.
KILL INUYASHA.

243
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,703
KILL HIM.
- WHO?

244
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,603
- KILL HIM.
- KILL WHO?

245
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:16,470
- KILL INUYASHA.
KILL INUYASHA.

246
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:20,036
- STOP.
PLEASE, STOP.

247
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:27,136
- HUH, THE DEFIANT YOUNG WENCH
IS RESISTING.

248
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,136
- AS I TOLD YOU,

249
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,003
THIS KAGOME WOMAN IS
THE REINCARNATION OF KIKYO,

250
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,036
THE PRIESTESS.

251
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,136
TAMING HER WILL REQUIRE
MORE THAN A LITTLE EFFORT.

252
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,203
- KIKYO.
HAH!

253
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,236
THAT WRETCH.

254
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,103
LONG AGO KIKYO WAS INFATUATED
WITH A HALF-DEMON,

255
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,303
AND HER POWERS WERE
THUS WEAKENED.

256
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,136
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

257
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,703
TO STEAL THE SACRED JEWEL
FROM ITS GUARDIAN.

258
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:56,570
YAH!

259
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:59,170
- [GROWLING]

260
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:05,003
-BUT IT WASN'T TO BE.
- YAH!

261
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:06,570
- OH, THAT WENCH.

262
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:10,303
SHE HURLED MY CURSE
STRAIGHT BACK AT ME!

263
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,770
AAH!

264
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:19,503
- NOW LEAVE,
AND I WILL SPARE YOUR LIFE.

265
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:21,470
- SUCH A SMUG COUNTENANCE.

266
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:26,170
SIMPLY RECALLING IT
MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL.

267
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:28,770
- [MOANING]

268
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,170
- OH, WILL SHE BE ALL RIGHT?

269
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:40,136
TELL ME SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.
OW!

270
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,703
[GROWLING]

271
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,736
OH. HMM.

272
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,703
- MMM. I SHALL CHANGE THE WATER.

273
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:04,870
- IT'S OVER THERE.
- GOOD. LET'S HURRY.

274
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,336
- DO YOU THINK
KAGOME CAN BE SAVED?

275
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,470
- PERHAPS.

276
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:18,903
KAGOME IS LIKELY FIGHTING
THE CURSE WITH ALL HER MIGHT.

277
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,736
- LUCKILY,
SHE'S STRONG-WILLED.

278
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,570
- AYE. THE MORE TIME IT TAKES
TO BREAK THE CURSE,

279
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,836
HOWEVER,
THE WEAKER SHE'LL BECOME.

280
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,470
- WILL IT TAKE MUCH LONGER?

281
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:36,170
- SHE SHOULD STOP RESISTING
SOON ENOUGH.

282
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:40,770
NOW THEN, NARAKU,

283
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:44,336
YOU SHALL HAVE
WHAT YOU WISHED FOR.

284
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,103
- DAMN IT!

285
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:54,803
HAVEN'T MIROKU AND SANGO FOUND
THE DARK PRIESTESS YET?

286
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,503
DAMN!

287
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,403
KAGOME IS LYING HERE
SUFFERING,

288
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:16,403
AND I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO SIT AND DO NOTHING?

289
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:19,403
HUH?

290
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:21,870
OH!

291
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:29,170
KAGOME?

292
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,770
- [MOANING]

293
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,103
- HUH?

294
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,403
UNH!

295
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:43,070
- DIE, INUYASHA!

296
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:46,336
- WHY, KAGOME?

297
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,003
- KILL INUYASHA.

298
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:52,470
- GET AWAY.

299
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:54,403
- KILL HIM.

300
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,303
- RUN, INUYASHA.

301
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,636
- HUH? KAGOME, YOU'RE...

302
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,136
- STUBBORN WOMAN.

303
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,703
I HAVE CONTROL OF HER BODY,

304
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,436
BUT HER MIND IS STILL
RESISTING ME.

305
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,336
- HEH HEH HEH.

306
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,370
THIS IS BECOMING
EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING.

307
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:14,436
TSUBAKI, IF INUYASHA
SHOULD FLEE FROM HER,

308
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,970
THEN TAKE THE CHANCE
TO KILL KAGOME.

309
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,836
- RUN!

310
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,936
- KAGOME'S POSSESSED
BY THE DARK PRIESTESS.

311
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,503
WHAT'S TAKING YOU,
MIROKU?

312
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,703
- THE DEMONIC AURA
IS GETTING STRONGER.

313
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:43,370
- HURRY, KIRARA.

314
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:51,903
- THERE IT IS!

315
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:53,570
- [ALL SCREAM]

316
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:56,203
- [GRUNTING]

317
00:20:56,236 --> 00:21:00,470
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MIROKU?

318
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,536
- UNH...

319
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,136
WHAT THE...

320
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,836
- I FEEL IT.

321
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,470
I HAVE FACED THIS EVIL
ONCE BEFORE.

322
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:43,636
- I CAN KILL HER WITH MY CURSE
ANY TIME YOU WISH.

323
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,970
- HA HA HA!

324
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,170
WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW,
INUYASHA--

325
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:50,370
BE SLAIN BY KAGOME,
OR WILL YOU FLEE

326
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:54,236
AND BY DOING SO,
HAVE KAGOME KILLED?

327
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:58,603
- GET...AWAY.

328
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,270
- WHAT DO I DO?

329
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,270
- HA HA HA!

330
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:07,903
SUFFER, INUYASHA.

331
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,836
- RUN AWAY.

332
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,503
GET OUT OF HERE.

333
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:34,214
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

334
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,548
- BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED,

335
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,714
KAGOME SAID SHE WAS BITTEN
BY SOMETHING.

336
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:02,181
IT WAS PROBABLY SHIKIKAMI,

337
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:05,148
A DEMON SERPENT
OF THE DARK PRIESTESS.

338
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:05,881
- HURRY, MIROKU.

339
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,681
WE MUST FIND THIS DARK PRIESTESS

340
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,681
BEFORE KAGOME KILLS INUYASHA!

341
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,681
- THIS BARRIER IS TOO STRONG.

342
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,581
I CAN'T BREAK THROUGH IT!

343
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:15,714
- LOOK!

344
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,681
- KIKYO?
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

345
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:24,148
- NEXT TIME,
"KIKYO AND THE DARK PRIESTESS."

346
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:25,181
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED
50 YEARS AGO?
