1
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,096
>> THIS ARROW BROKE THE BARRIER.

2
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:53,663
>> INUYASHA'S RED TETSUSAIGA

3
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:54,463
COULDN'T BREAK THROUGH

4
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,763
HAKUDOSHI'S BARRIER,

5
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,496
YET THIS ARROW DID.

6
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:58,729
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON

7
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:12,496
IT COULD BELONG TO.

8
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:16,729
KIKYO MUST BE ALIVE.

9
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:19,763
>> IT ISN'T KIKYO'S.

10
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:20,863
>> NOBODY SAID THE ARROW

11
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,296
BELONGED TO HER.

12
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:26,029
>> BUT YOU'RE ALL THINKING IT.

13
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,596
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I WONDERED THE

14
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,863
SAME THING MYSELF AT FIRST.

15
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:31,929
THIS ARROW DOESN'T HAVE

16
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,429
KIKYO'S SCENT.

17
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:36,463
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

18
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:41,363
WHAT IS THIS SMELL?

19
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,096
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT

20
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,363
WAS FIRED BY, BUT IT DEFINITELY

21
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,963
WASN'T ONE OF OUR ALLIES.

22
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:45,796
>> SO IT DOESN'T BELONG

23
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,296
TO ANY OF OUR FRIENDS.

24
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:48,163
>> RIGHT.

25
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:49,896
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, AROUND

26
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,329
THE TIME THAT ARROW WAS FIRED

27
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,829
AT THE BARRIER, I DIDN'T SENSE

28
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,296
KIKYO'S SPIRITUAL POWERS AT ALL.

29
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,329
>> WAIT A MINUTE.

30
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,296
IF IT WASN'T FIRED BY KIKYO,

31
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,463
THEN WHO FIRED IT?

32
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:00,763
THAT ARROW SAVED INUYASHA,

33
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,429
REMEMBER?

34
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:02,096
>> PERHAPS I KNOW.

35
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:02,696
>> HUH?

36
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:03,363
>> IT COULD HAVE BEEN A

37
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,129
FRIENDLY HAND LENT BY HIJIRI,

38
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,196
THE HOLY ONE.

39
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,363
>> YES, DEFINITELY.

40
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,329
>> YOU COULD BE RIGHT ABOUT

41
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,929
THAT.

42
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,229
>> HIJIRI, THE HOLY ONE.

43
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,396
>> WE'D BETTER HURRY TO SEE

44
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:14,729
THIS HIJIRI PERSON.

45
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,729
SOMETHING TELLS ME THE BIRDS'LL

46
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,996
BE HEADED THAT WAY, TOO.

47
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:21,229
>> MASTER, WE ARE

48
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,096
ALMOST AT THE VILLAGE.

49
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,796
I ONLY HOPE THAT THEY SOMEHOW

50
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:47,229
MANAGED TO HOLD OUT.

51
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,496
>> PEOPLE, STAY WHERE YOU ARE

52
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:55,296
AND DO NOT MOVE FROM THE CAVE.

53
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:56,329
>> ARE YOU CERTAIN WE'LL BE

54
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,663
SAFE FROM THOSE BIRDS?

55
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:58,529
>> WHAT IF THEY BREAK THROUGH

56
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,763
THE BARRIER AND COME INTO THE

57
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:00,463
CAVE?

58
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,029
>> WHEN WILL HIJIRI THE HOLY

59
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,496
ONE RETURN?

60
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:05,096
>> THEY PUT UP A BARRIER?

61
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:08,629
SUCH INSOLENCE.

62
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:09,763
FAIRLY STRONG FOR SOMETHING

63
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,396
THAT WAS CREATED BY HUMANS.

64
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:12,929
IN THAT CASE, PERHAPS I SHOULD

65
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,596
FORCE THEM TO COME

66
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:17,396
OUT OF THE CAVE.

67
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:28,796
AFTER THEM.

68
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,663
>> THE BIRDS ARE AFLAME.

69
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:31,796
>> WE'RE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED

70
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:32,896
BY FIRE.

71
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:33,896
>> WE'LL BE BURNED ALIVE UNLESS

72
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:34,996
HELP COMES FAST.

73
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,696
>> I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

74
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:37,629
>> LOOK, THIS SIDE

75
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:38,796
ISN'T BURNING.

76
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,296
RUN FOR IT.

77
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:40,963
>> QUICKLY.

78
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:42,129
>> HEED MY COMMAND.

79
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,929
DO NOT LEAVE THE BARRIER.

80
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:57,863
>> [SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY]

81
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:58,863
>> HIJIRI THE HOLY ONE

82
00:04:58,863 --> 00:04:59,729
HAS RETURNED.

83
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,329
>> HURRY, PLEASE SAVE US.

84
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,496
>> THE ONE WHO ERECTED THE

85
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,163
BARRIER.

86
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:22,829
SLAY HIM.

87
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,329
>> LOOK, LOOK, WE'RE SAVED.

88
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,329
>> MY BIRDS HAVE ALL BEEN SLAIN.

89
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,563
HOW ON EARTH COULD THIS HAVE

90
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,096
HAPPENED?

91
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,196
EVER SINCE NARAKU CAME INTO THE

92
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:33,229
PICTURE, I'VE HAD NOTHING

93
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:39,029
BUT INTERFERENCE.

94
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,363
>> SHE'S GONE.

95
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,929
>> ALL THANKS TO THE SAINT

96
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:44,029
HIJIRI.

97
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,796
>> THANK YOU.

98
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:45,863
>> THANK YOU FOR SAVING US.

99
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:59,963
>> SAINT HIJIRI.

100
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,396
>> WE'VE JUST PASSED THE SUMMIT.

101
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,529
WE SHOULD REACH THE HOLY ONE'S

102
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,463
VILLAGE ANY TIME NOW.

103
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:07,796
>> ONCE WE REACH THE VILLAGE,

104
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:08,863
WE MIGHT JUST FIND OUT

105
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:10,129
WHO THIS HIJIRI PERSON

106
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,029
REALLY IS.

107
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,329
>> THERE IT IS.

108
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,563
>> YEAH.

109
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:17,929
HMM.

110
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,296
I SMELL BLOOD AND SOMETHING

111
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,496
BURNING.

112
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:21,429
>> WHAT?

113
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:22,396
>> IT'S COMING FROM AROUND THAT

114
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,096
CRAGGY MOUNTAIN UP AHEAD.

115
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:41,329
>> LET'S HURRY, THEN.

116
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,129
INCREDIBLE.

117
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,096
>> YES, THE SAINT HIJIRI

118
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,529
SLEW THE BIRD DEMONS.

119
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,929
>> WE'RE SO VERY GRATEFUL.

120
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,529
>> THE HOLY ONE SAVED US

121
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,229
VILLAGERS BY WIPING OUT A WHOLE

122
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,329
FLOCK OF DEMON BIRDS

123
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,263
WITH A SINGLE ARROW.

124
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:58,163
>> A SINGLE ARROW?

125
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,863
REALLY? THAT'S AMAZING.

126
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,096
BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

127
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:04,463
I MEAN, IS HIJIRI STILL HERE?

128
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,096
>> NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.

129
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,063
THE HOLY ONE HAS ALREADY LEFT.

130
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,263
>> HUH?

131
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,663
>> THE HOLY ONE HAS LEFT TO

132
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,029
TRACK DOWN AND DESTROY

133
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,963
THE DEMON BIRDS.

134
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,263
WE ARE SO FORTUNATE

135
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:16,863
FOR HIS HELP.

136
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,063
>> WE CAME HERE AS QUICKLY AS

137
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,196
WE COULD, YET WE JUST

138
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,763
MISSED HIM.

139
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:24,229
>> INUYASHA, DO YOU THINK

140
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:26,263
WE SHOULD FOLLOW?

141
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:29,663
>> AFTER THIS HIJIRI, YOU MEAN?

142
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,129
>> JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

143
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,796
IT COULD TURN OUT TO BE KIKYO,

144
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:35,796
YOU KNOW.

145
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:36,896
>> HUH?

146
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:44,596
>> KAGOME.

147
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:48,963
>> INUYASHA.

148
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:51,863
>> KIKYO WAS KILLED BY NARAKU.

149
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:54,629
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE HER DIE,

150
00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:00,363
AND I DIDN'T SEE HER BODY.

151
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,529
KIKYO, IF YOU ARE STILL ALIVE,

152
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:12,205
WHY HAVEN'T YOU COME TO FIND ME?

153
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:21,805
KAGOME.

154
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,472
>> KAGOME IS SO BRAVE.

155
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:24,938
I'LL GIVE HER THAT MUCH.

156
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,338
HOW COULD SHE SPEAK UP

157
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,438
LIKE THAT?

158
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:28,405
>> YOU MEAN WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT

159
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,805
KIKYO?

160
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,938
SANGO, IF THIS GREAT HIJIRI

161
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,438
TURNS OUT TO BE KIKYO,

162
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,305
THEN WE'RE SURE TO CROSS PATHS.

163
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,405
OUR GOALS ARE THE SAME--TO FIND

164
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:39,472
THE NESTS OF THE DEMON BIRDS.

165
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:40,538
>> YES, BUT THAT'S NOT THE

166
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:41,972
PROBLEM.

167
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,872
INUYASHA GETS SO INDECISIVE

168
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,172
AROUND KIKYO.

169
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,705
KAGOME'S PUT UP WITH IT UNTIL

170
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,105
NOW, BUT WHO KNOWS HOW LONG

171
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:49,838
IT'LL LAST?

172
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,538
IF I WERE HER, I'D PUSH HIM

173
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:52,805
OVER A CLIFF AND MAKE SURE

174
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,372
HE NEVER WALKS AGAIN.

175
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,105
>> UH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

176
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:57,338
INUYASHA, AREN'T YOU?

177
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,105
>> OHH! SHE'S SERIOUS.

178
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:03,505
OHH!

179
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,105
>> KAGOME, ARE YOU OK WITH THIS?

180
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,672
>> WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

181
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,738
HOW ABOUT YOU?

182
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:11,305
WHAT IF SAINT HIJIRI TURNS OUT

183
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:17,538
TO BE KIKYO AFTER ALL?

184
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:21,105
>> I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

185
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:23,038
>> BLUNT AS USUAL.

186
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,338
>> ONE THING, THOUGH.

187
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,305
IF IT REALLY IS HER, THEN

188
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:28,038
OBVIOUSLY NARAKU DIDN'T KILL

189
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:32,205
KIKYO LIKE HE SET OUT TO DO.

190
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,505
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, HE'LL

191
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,072
DEFINITELY COME AND TRY TO KILL

192
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,872
HER AGAIN.

193
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:40,338
FOR NOW, I SAY WE CONCENTRATE

194
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,505
ON FINDING THE BIRDS' NEST

195
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,438
AND DESTROYING THEM.

196
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:53,305
>> YEAH.

197
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:54,338
>> YOU'LL REGRET DOING

198
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,138
THIS, YOU MEDDLING FOOL.

199
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,372
HOW DID YOU BREAK THROUGH MY

200
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,072
BARRIER?

201
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:11,738
>> WHAT A TOUGH LITTLE BRAT.

202
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,138
AM I HALLUCINATING?

203
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:17,005
NO, IT'S TRUE.

204
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,138
I CAN HEAR HIS HEART,

205
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:22,572
BUT HE'S HOLLOW INSIDE.

206
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,872
IS HIS HEART SOMEWHERE ELSE,

207
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:31,338
THEN?

208
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,638
>> LADY KAEDE, LADY KAEDE,

209
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,205
TERRIBLE NEWS.

210
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,638
>> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

211
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,972
>> WELL, THERE WAS A LIGHT IN

212
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,872
THE SKY THAT FELL.

213
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,072
>> THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

214
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,405
ARE YOU CERTAIN ABOUT THIS?

215
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,038
>> YES.

216
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,538
>> AND WHERE EXACTLY DID YOU

217
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,438
SEE THIS MYSTERIOUS LIGHT?

218
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,572
>> A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

219
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,338
WE SAW IT FALLING FROM THE SKY.

220
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:51,705
IT DESCENDED TOWARD LADY

221
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,772
KIKYO'S SHRINE.

222
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:57,838
>> IT WHAT?

223
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:05,272
>> OVER THERE.

224
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:07,538
>> ARE THEY DEMONS?

225
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:11,072
>> LADY KAEDE, WHAT ARE THEY?

226
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:12,305
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN,

227
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,838
BUT THEY WEREN'T DEMONS.

228
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,672
PROBABLY MORE LIKE SHIKIGAMI

229
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,472
MESSENGERS SENT BY SOMEONE.

230
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,605
I DIDN'T SENSE ANY EVIL AURA

231
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,138
FROM THEM.

232
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,338
>> LADY KAEDE.

233
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:23,105
>> HUH?

234
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,872
>> COME, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

235
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:26,172
>> WHAT IS IT?

236
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,272
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE BEINGS

237
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,305
FROM THE LIGHT WERE DIGGING

238
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:29,072
HERE.

239
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:29,805
>> WHAT?

240
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,138
>> NOT SURPRISING.

241
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,772
KIKYO'S ASHES AND SOIL FROM HER

242
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,472
GRAVE WERE TAKEN ONCE BEFORE,

243
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,638
REMEMBER?

244
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:36,938
>> NOT AGAIN.

245
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:38,305
>> HMM.

246
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,272
WHO WOULD TAKE SOIL FROM SISTER

247
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:49,205
KIKYO'S GRAVE, AND WHY?

248
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,338
>> NARAKU'S DEMONS.

249
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:52,638
>> IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY'RE

250
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:54,872
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING.

251
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:55,905
>> MY GUESS IS THEY'RE LOOKING

252
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,305
FOR HIJIRI THE HOLY ONE.

253
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,705
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

254
00:11:58,705 --> 00:11:59,805
I BET THIS HIJIRI'S

255
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,005
GETTING IN NARAKU'S WAY.

256
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,338
>> IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN

257
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,872
MAYBE NARAKU REALIZES THAT

258
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,972
SAINT HIJIRI MIGHT BE KIKYO,

259
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,505
AND IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN I

260
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:09,505
WONDER IF HE'S GONNA TRY TO

261
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:17,205
FIND HER AND KILL HER AGAIN.

262
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,238
>> HIJIRI, YOU SAY?

263
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,805
YES, I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD

264
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,238
RUMORS OF THE HOLY ONE.

265
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,172
>> WE HEARD THAT HE MIGHT HAVE

266
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,438
BEEN SEEN IN THE VICINITY

267
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:25,305
LATELY.

268
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,472
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DID SEE

269
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,905
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A SIGN

270
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:29,905
FROM HIM.

271
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,072
IT WAS JUST BEFORE DAWN, AND TWO

272
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,372
STRANGE STREAKS OF LIGHT

273
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,505
APPEARED IN THE SKY.

274
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,172
IT'S AS THOUGH THEY WERE SUCKED

275
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,005
TOWARD THE FORBIDDEN MOUNTAIN.

276
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,172
>> IT'S FORBIDDEN.

277
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,505
HOW SO?

278
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,672
>> 'CAUSE ONLY THE CHOSEN ONES

279
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:45,538
ARE ALLOWED TO GO

280
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,905
TO THE MOUNTAIN.

281
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,238
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO THERE,

282
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,305
INUYASHA?

283
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:50,538
>> YEAH.

284
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:51,438
MIGHT AS WELL.

285
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:57,638
IT'S OUR ONLY LEAD.

286
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,372
>> SANGO, I THOUGHT WE WERE

287
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:00,238
SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING

288
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,038
FOR THE DEMON BIRDS' NEST.

289
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:02,805
>> HUH?

290
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:03,805
>> IT'S NOT LIKE IT MATTERS

291
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:04,672
TO ME OR ANYTHING.

292
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,605
IT'S JUST THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG

293
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:06,738
THE WAY, OUR GOALS CHANGED FROM

294
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:08,138
DESTROYING THE BIRDS TO MEETING

295
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,938
THIS HIJIRI PERSON.

296
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:11,738
>> SHIPPO, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU

297
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:12,938
DON'T MENTION THAT IN FRONT OF

298
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,072
KAGOME.

299
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:14,972
>> I'M SURE SHE'S ALREADY

300
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:17,638
NOTICED IT HERSELF BY NOW.

301
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,172
>> THERE'S THE MOUNTAIN.

302
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,505
>> HEY, INUYASHA, LOOK AT THAT.

303
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:24,005
SOMETHING'S SPARKLING.

304
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,105
WATER, MAYBE.

305
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:47,872
>> YEAH, COULD BE A WATERFALL.

306
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,338
>> DEMONS ARE COMING.

307
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:50,405
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SAINT

308
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,972
HIJIRI.

309
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:53,672
>> HMM.

310
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:54,972
INUYASHA, HAVE YOU NOTICED

311
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,005
THEM AROUND US?

312
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:56,838
>> YEAH.

313
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,572
NARAKU'S DEMONS AGAIN.

314
00:13:58,572 --> 00:13:59,872
SOMETHING TELLS ME THEY'RE

315
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,038
FOLLOWING US.

316
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,238
OR EVEN WORSE.

317
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,038
>> THERE ARE MORE AND MORE OF

318
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,438
THEM COMING EVERY MINUTE.

319
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,172
>> YEAH, GOING OUR DIRECTION.

320
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,538
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEY

321
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,705
MUST BE HEADING TOWARD THE

322
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,438
FORBIDDEN MOUNTAIN.

323
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:20,638
DOES THAT MEAN KIKYO IS THERE?

324
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:21,338
>> HUH?

325
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:22,538
>> A SACRED ARROW.

326
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,972
>> SAINT HIJIRI IS HERE

327
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:27,072
ON THIS MOUNTAIN.

328
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,905
>> WE'D BETTER HURRY.

329
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:50,526
>> THEY'RE COMING FROM

330
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:55,493
DOWN HERE AS WELL.

331
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,526
>> [INDISTINCT]

332
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:03,826
>> MOVE.

333
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,126
WHAT A PAIN.

334
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,826
MIROKU, SANGO,

335
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:13,726
TAKE CARE OF KAGOME.

336
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,959
GO ON AHEAD.

337
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,326
>> INUYASHA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

338
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:19,159
>> ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

339
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,559
I'LL JOIN YOU AS SOON AS I

340
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,993
DESTROY THESE VERMIN.

341
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,193
YOU GUYS GO AND FIND THAT

342
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:25,326
HIJIRI PERSON.

343
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,859
GET GOING.

344
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,059
>> KIRARA.

345
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,559
>> INUYASHA.

346
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,293
>> SHOULD WE REALLY SEE HIJIRI

347
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,159
BEFORE HE DOES?

348
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,559
>> WHAT'LL I DO IF THIS HIJIRI

349
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,293
PERSON TURNS OUT TO BE KIKYO?

350
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:44,993
I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:49,259
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST.

352
00:15:49,259 --> 00:16:00,526
[INDISTINCT]

353
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,926
I HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR

354
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,893
MYSELF OR I WON'T BE ABLE TO

355
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:07,259
GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

356
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:15,893
HUH?

357
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,859
IS THAT KIKYO?

358
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:25,026
I'M NOT PICKING UP HER SCENT.

359
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,859
STILL.

360
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,326
SHOW YOURSELF.

361
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:38,759
LET ME SEE YOUR FACE.

362
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,126
>> I'M KIND OF WORRIED.

363
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,526
THINK INUYASHA'S OK?

364
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,826
>> HE'LL COME AS SOON AS HE'S

365
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,459
DONE.

366
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,526
>> SHE'S RIGHT.

367
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:46,393
HE'LL COME.

368
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,326
HE'S THE ONE WHO WANTS TO MEET

369
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:53,326
HIJIRI MORE THAN ANYONE.

370
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,459
>> SANGO, HERE COMES

371
00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:02,359
SOME MORE DEMONS.

372
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,493
>> KAGOME, SHIPPO,

373
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,459
YOU STAY HERE.

374
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,059
>> RIGHT.

375
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,993
>> KIRARA.

376
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,459

377
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,926
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

378
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:16,426
I'M HERE WITH YOU, KAGOME.

379
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,726
I'VE GOT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.

380
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:20,826
HELP!

381
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:24,726
KAGOME! DEMONS!

382
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,826
>> HANG ON A MINUTE.

383
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,759
THEY'RE SOUL COLLECTORS.

384
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,226
>> HEY, WAIT, KAGOME.

385
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:32,759
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

386
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,926
>> SO, KIKYO REALLY IS HERE.

387
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,426
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

388
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,026
>> AFTER THOSE SOUL COLLECTORS.

389
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,593
KIKYO MIGHT BE UP THERE.

390
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,793
>> DON'T BE SO HASTY.

391
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:48,659
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

392
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,293
>> SHE DISAPPEARED.

393
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,359
>> A BARRIER.

394
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,526
>> ANSWER ME.

395
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,293
ARE YOU KIKYO OR NOT?

396
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,193
>> A POTENT AURA HAS RAVAGED MY

397
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,826
MASTER'S FLESH.

398
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:02,359
HER BODY CANNOT RESTORE ITSELF.

399
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,859
>> SHE HAS ALSO LOST HER VOICE.

400
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,693
SHE FIGHTS USING HER SPIRIT

401
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:07,359
ALONE.

402
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,459
HOWEVER, SOON HER STRENGTH

403
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:12,193
WILL RUN OUT.

404
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:18,726
>> SO BACK THEN, SHE DIDN'T DIE?

405
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:19,959
KIKYO?

406
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:24,493
YOU ARE KIKYO.

407
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:32,659
KIKYO.

408
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:37,093
KIKYO!

409
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:39,793
KIKYO!

410
00:18:39,793 --> 00:19:01,793
HUH?

411
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:06,226
HUH?

412
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:08,559
ISN'T THIS A SHIKIGAMI?

413
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,293
>> DAMN, THAT KIKYO IS ELUSIVE,

414
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:12,459
ISN'T SHE?

415
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,893
>> KAGURA?

416
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,026
YOU AGAIN.

417
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,693
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE?

418
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,626
>> JUST WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

419
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,759
WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME.

420
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,126
>> WHERE IS KIKYO?

421
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,893
IS SHE STILL ALIVE OR NOT?

422
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,793
>> HMM. NARAKU

423
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:27,226
SEEMS TO THINK SO.

424
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,626
YOU KNOW THE ARROW THAT BROKE

425
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,393
THROUGH HAKUDOSHI'S BARRIER?

426
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:31,793
THERE WAS SOME DIRT LEFT ON THE

427
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,959
ARROWHEAD, AND IT CAME FROM

428
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,459
ONIGUMO'S CAVE.

429
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,393
>> ONIGUMO?

430
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,026
OF COURSE.

431
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:39,859
THAT WAS THE SCENT

432
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:43,026
FROM THE ARROW.

433
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:44,526
>> THE SOIL THERE IS IMMERSED

434
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:48,459
WITH ONIGUMO'S LUST FOR KIKYO.

435
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,259
AND THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS KIKYO

436
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,393
FROM BEING DESTROYED BY

437
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:53,059
NARAKU'S WRATH.

438
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,326
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD

439
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,493
HAVE ANY USE FOR SOIL FROM

440
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,559
ONIGUMO'S CAVE.

441
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,793
IN ANY CASE, IT LOOKS LIKE

442
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:00,959
WE'VE BOTH BEEN CHASING ALL

443
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,226
OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AFTER A

444
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:02,993
FAKE.

445
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,293
TILL NEXT TIME.

446
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,126
NARAKU'S GREATEST HINDRANCE

447
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,726
IS STILL ALIVE.

448
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,259
NOW, THIS IS GETTING

449
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:17,159
INTERESTING.

450
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,659
>> HUH?

451
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,259
THOSE TWO GIRLS--

452
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:39,626
THEY'VE GONE, TOO.

453
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:48,759
>> IS KIKYO REALLY ALIVE?

454
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,193
>> IT'S TRUE, THEN.

455
00:20:50,193 --> 00:21:12,559
KIKYO IS ALIVE SOMEWHERE.

456
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,993
>> ARE THEY CALLING ME?

457
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:27,326
IS THAT IT?

458
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:42,026
A WATERFALL.

459
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:44,824
KIKYO.

460
00:21:55,427 --> 00:23:31,318
>> [MUSIC]

461
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,318
>> ALONE AT THE BASE OF

462
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:33,051
THE MOUNTAIN,

463
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:33,985
I MEET THE HOLY PERSON

464
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,551
THEY CALL HIJIRI.

465
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:37,018
IT TURNS OUT TO BE A SHIKIGAMI

466
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:38,851
CONTROLLED BY KIKYO.

467
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,885
>> THE REAL KIKYO

468
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,485
IS SUBMERGED UNDERWATER.

469
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:42,718
IS SHE ALIVE?

470
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,251
>> YOU MUST CHOOSE

471
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,918
WHETHER TO SAVE HER.

472
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:48,618
YOU ALONE CAN SAVE HER.

473
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:52,085
HER LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS.

474
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,785
>> NEXT TIME, KAGOME'S

475
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:56,018
INSTINCTIVE CHOICE.

476
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,518
ONLY I CAN SAVE HER?

477
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,518
AND YOU WANT ME TO DECIDE?
