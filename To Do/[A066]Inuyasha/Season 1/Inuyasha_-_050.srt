- KAGOME, IS IT THIS WAY?

2
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:46,562
- YES.

3
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,228
IT'S JUST BEYOND
THIS FOREST.

4
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:50,162
WE'RE IN SEARCH
OF SACRED JEWEL SHARDS

5
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,395
WHEN WE MEET UP
UNEXPECTEDLY WITH KOHAKU,

6
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,228
WHO'S BEING ATTACKED BY
ONE OF NARAKU'S DEMONS.

7
00:01:56,262 --> 00:02:00,995
THE DEMON IS AFTER
THE SHARD EMBEDDED
IN KOHAKU'S BACK.

8
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,295
- HUH.

9
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,362
HUH?

10
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,295
- KOHAKU.

11
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,862
- SANGO IS OVERJOYED
AT BEING REUNITED WITH KOHAKU,

12
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:18,062
BUT KOHAKU'S MEMORY
HAS BEEN ERASED BY NARAKU,

13
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,695
AND HE REMEMBERS
NOTHING ABOUT HER.

14
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,762
- KOHAKU HAS COME BACK TO ME.

15
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:25,695
HE'S ESCAPED
FROM NARAKU'S GRASP.

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,262
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BELIEVE.

17
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,262
- IT'S OBVIOUSLY
ONE OF NARAKU'S TRAPS.

18
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:34,262
- YOU'RE WRONG.

19
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,062
I TRUST KOHAKU.

20
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,562
- THAT'S WHAT NARAKU WANTS.

21
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:40,395
- WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE
EXCEPT TO TRUST
MY YOUNGER BROTHER?

22
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:43,528
- THAT'S WHEN KAGURA SHOWS UP
TO TAKE BACK THE SHARD,

23
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:46,595
BRINGING AN ARMY OF DEMONS
WITH HER.

24
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:51,462
IF THE SHARD IS REMOVED,
KOHAKU WILL DIE.

25
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,928
INUYASHA AND MIROKU
BEGIN FIGHTING OFF THE DEMONS

26
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,495
IN ORDER TO DISTRACT THEM.

ESCAPE INTO THE FOREST.

AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

STILL, WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY?

30
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,828
IT'S LIKE I'M SCARED.

31
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,195
THERE'S SOMETHING
I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER.

I'LL FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY.

181
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:02,895
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
I PROMISE.

182
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:04,862
LET ME END IT.

183
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,528
- KAGOME.

184
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,028
- HUH?

185
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:14,462
- INUYASHA,
YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER SANGO.

186
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:15,895
SHE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HERSELF.

187
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:19,895
- KAGOME, KOHAKU DID THIS
TO YOUR ARM, DIDN'T HE?

188
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,395
- IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

189
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,528
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT WORSE.

190
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,595
HE COULD HAVE KILLED ME
IF HE'D WANTED TO.

191
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,195
HE COULD HAVE,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

192
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:30,262
- HUH?

193
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,362
- I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO TELL SANGO.

194
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:38,362
SHE MIGHT BE PLANNING
TO KILL KOHAKU.

195
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,062
- OK.

196
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,862
I UNDERSTAND.

197
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:49,828
KOHAKU DIDN'T KILL KAGOME,
EVEN THOUGH HE COULD HAVE.

198
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:53,862
DOES THAT MEAN
HE DISOBEYED NARAKU'S ORDERS?

199
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,462
IF SO, THEN HE STILL
HAS A WILL OF HIS OWN,

200
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:01,695
EVEN IF HIS MIND
IS BEING CONTROLLED.

201
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,462
- KOHAKU.

202
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:27,128
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

203
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:27,862
- HUH?

204
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,962
- YOU'RE EMBRACING ME.

205
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,695
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

206
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,295
- WHY ARE YOU SO SHY?

207
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,595
WE'RE SIBLINGS.

208
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:37,662
KOHAKU, STAY HERE.

209
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,962
DON'T LEAVE ME ANYMORE.

210
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:44,795
YOU'RE MY BROTHER,
THAT'S WHY.

211
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:51,762
KOHAKU, YOU'RE MY ONE
AND ONLY LITTLE BROTHER.

212
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:55,395
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU,
THEN MYSELF.

213
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,595
IT'S MY ONLY CHOICE.

214
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:01,628
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
TO FREE YOU FROM NARAKU.

215
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,562
FORGIVE ME, KOHAKU.

216
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:21,399
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU,
THEN MYSELF.

217
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,099
IT'S MY ONLY CHOICE.

218
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,966
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
TO FREE YOU FROM NARAKU.

219
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,632
FORGIVE ME, KOHAKU.

220
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,132
- STOP, SANGO.

221
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:05,032
- OH, INUYASHA,
WHY DID YOU STOP ME?

222
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:05,999
- DON'T BE STUPID.

223
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:09,066
KILLING KOHAKU
WILL ONLY ACCOMPLISH ONE THING.

224
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,732
IT WILL MAKE NARAKU HAPPY.

225
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,899
HUH?

226
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,566
KOHAKU, COME BACK HERE.

227
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,566
SNAP OUT OF IT, YOU BRAT.

228
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,732
KAGURA.

229
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:41,599
- AS COMMANDED,
KOHAKU SHALL MURDER KAGOME.

230
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:45,132
KOHAKU IS UNABLE
TO DEFY NARAKU'S ORDERS.

231
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,832
- OH, YEAH?

232
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:51,199
- INUYASHA, WHY DO YOU THINK
KOHAKU HAS LOST HIS MEMORY?

233
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,132
- THAT'S OBVIOUS.

234
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,666
BECAUSE NARAKU
IS CONTROLLING HIS MIND.

235
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,966
- THAT'S PART OF IT,

236
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:01,999
BUT IT'S ALSO
BECAUSE KOHAKU HIMSELF
DOESN'T WISH TO REMEMBER...

237
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,999
SUCH AWFUL MEMORIES.

238
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,999
- HUH?

239
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:16,766
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

240
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,166
DON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE
IN FRONT OF KOHAKU.

241
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,499
- DAMN YOU, KAGURA.

242
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:32,032
- KOHAKU DIDN'T WANT
TO REMEMBER,

243
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:36,566
SO NARAKU GRANTED HIS WISH
AND ERASED HIS MEMORIES.

244
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,832
IT'S SO EASY
TO MANIPULATE SOMEONE
WHO'S A BLANK SLATE.

245
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,199
- KOHAKU, YOU GOTTA REMEMBER.

246
00:18:47,232 --> 00:18:48,599
BRING YOUR MEMORIES BACK.

247
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:52,166
REMEMBER SANGO
AND THE DEMON SLAYERS.

248
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,832
- INUYASHA.

249
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,632
- YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER
EVERY LAST DETAIL.

250
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,432
DO IT, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.

251
00:18:58,466 --> 00:18:59,732
- STOP IT.

252
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,232
- THE ONLY WAY TO FREE HIM
FROM NARAKU'S CONTROL

253
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,166
IS TO GET HIM TO REMEMBER
EVERYTHING HE FORGOT.

254
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,432
NARAKU WILL EVENTUALLY
KILL HIM ANYWAY

255
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:10,932
TO TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD
IN HIS BACK.

256
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,766
- YOU ALWAYS SEE
THE WORST IN PEOPLE.

257
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,532
- COME BACK HERE.

258
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:34,066
- I'D THINK TWICE
ABOUT FORCING THIS BOY
TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

259
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,466
HIS PAST REALLY WOULD
DESTROY HIM.

260
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,166
LET THE POOR LAD
DIE IN BLISS,

261
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,599
FREED FROM ALL THOSE
TERRIBLE MEMORIES.

262
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,766
- KOHAKU.

263
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,032
DAMN.

264
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,932
NOT AGAIN.

265
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:10,266
- SANGO.

266
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:14,566
- NO, NOT AGAIN.

267
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,366
- DAMN.

268
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,099
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
ARE A REAL PAIN.

269
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,499
- HMM?

270
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:19,332
- INUYASHA.

271
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,966
- HEY, SANGO,
MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE YOU

272
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,499
DO THINGS A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME.

273
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,932
NARAKU ORDERED KOHAKU
TO KILL KAGOME.

274
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,066
- HUH?

275
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,199
- BUT, YOU SEE,
KOHAKU DIDN'T CARRY OUT
HIS ORDERS...

276
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,599
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
HE STILL HAS A HUMAN HEART.

277
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:39,432
THAT'S WHY
WE CAN'T KILL KOHAKU.

278
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,532
WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM ALIVE.

279
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,266
GOT THAT?

280
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,432
- MM-HMM.

281
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,899
- KOHAKU, REMEMBER
THAT I SPARED YOUR LIFE.

282
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:08,399
I ALSO ERASED
YOUR TERRIBLE MEMORIES
FOR YOU...

283
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:12,532
AND YET YOU STILL FAILED
TO KILL KAGOME.

284
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,199
WHY IS THAT, KOHAKU?

285
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:22,532
DO YOU WISH
TO BECOME HUMAN AGAIN?

286
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:27,032
THEN DO YOU WANT
YOUR MEMORIES RETURNED?

287
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,699
ALL OF YOUR MEMORIES?

288
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,366
- NO. NO.

289
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,432
- HUH.

290
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,366
FAIR ENOUGH.

291
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:50,066
I'LL LET YOU LIVE, FOR NOW.

292
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,199
FORGET IT ALL.

293
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,532
- YES.

294
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:14,466
STILL, I CAN'T ERASE
THAT WOMAN'S FACE FROM MY MIND.

295
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,593
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

296
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:59,855
- A VILLAGE
IS ATTACKED BY LOOTERS.

297
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,522
GATENMARU, THE VICIOUS LEADER,

298
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:04,422
IS ACTUALLY A MOTH DEMON
DISGUISED AS A HUMAN.

299
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:07,889
INUYASHA AND MIROKU
ARE TRAPPED IN A POISON COCOON.

300
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:10,622
MEANWHILE,
SESSHOMARU SEARCHES FOR CLUES

301
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,589
INTO WHY INUYASHA TRANSFORMS,

302
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:16,689
AND LEARNS SOME
FRIGHTENING SECRETS
FROM A TREE DEMON.

303
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:22,889
NEXT TIME...

304
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:23,922
SEE YOU SOON.
