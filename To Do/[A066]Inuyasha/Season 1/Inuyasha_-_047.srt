1
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,839
- WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.

2
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,972
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID,
INUYASHA?

3
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,039
- PUT A CORK IN IT.

4
00:01:58,072 --> 00:01:59,806
JUST GET IT OVER WITH AND GO.

5
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,839
- EVERY TIME YOU TWO RETURN,

6
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,006
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF AN ARGUMENT.

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,572
- COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF EVERYONE ELSE, KAEDE?

8
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,839
- HMM!

9
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:11,839
- ARE YOU JUST GOING
TO LET HER LEAVE, INUYASHA?

10
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:14,906
- HUH! I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

11
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,406
- HMM.

12
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,672
- I SWEAR, INUYASHA,
YOU CAN BE A REAL JERK.

13
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,939
ONLY REASON
I STOPPED ARGUING WITH YOU

14
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,839
WAS BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED

15
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,372
THE STRAIN MIGHT MAKE
YOUR INJURIES WORSE.

16
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,539
- KAGOME, WAIT!

17
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:29,906
- HUH?

18
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,839
SHIPPO, WHAT?

19
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:32,672
- JUST BE PATIENT,
OK, KAGOME?

20
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:35,506
YOU KNOW, INUYASHA'S
ALWAYS BEEN THE JEALOUS TYPE

21
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,439
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU.

22
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:40,139
- KAGOME, YOU'RE MY WOMAN.

23
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:45,239
- INUYASHA'S JUST BEING...PETTY.

24
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:46,606
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

25
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,839
WHY HE TOOK KOGA'S WORD

26
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:48,806
SO SERIOUSLY.

27
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,239
OH, AND ALSO BECAUSE
HE'S SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

28
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,972
- HMM. THANKS, SHIPPO.
I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT,

29
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,506
BUT THE REAL REASON
I'M GOING BACK

30
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,539
IS TO GET SOME MORE BANDAGES
AND MEDICINE FOR US TO USE.

31
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:02,372
I'M COMING RIGHT BACK,
BUT DON'T TELL INUYASHA THAT!

32
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,106
- HUH?

33
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,006
- SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD

34
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,239
TO MAKE HIM WORRY A LITTLE.

35
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,006
- I GET IT,

36
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,606
BUT PLEASE COME BACK
TO US QUICKLY, KAGOME.

37
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,172

YOU'RE OUT THERE.

- HMM. SHARP AS USUAL, KIKYO.

43

- HOW COULD I NOT NOTICE YOU?

44
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,806
AND NOT ONLY TODAY,

45
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:01,506
BUT YOU'VE COME TO SPY ON ME
QUITE OFTEN RECENTLY.

46
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,372
- HUH.

47
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:05,739

QUITE INTERESTED IN ME.

[LAUGHS]

49
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:08,806
- SOMETHING AMUSE YOU?

50
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,939
- COME NOW,
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE REASON

51
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:14,239
YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN ME,
NARAKU, IS BECAUSE...

52
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:19,806
YOU STILL HAVE ONIGUMO'S HEART

OR MAYBE SOMETHING TO EAT FIRST?

00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,106
I'LL GO RUN A NICE BATH FOR YOU.

66
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,006

67

BEEN ON A TRIP AND HIS WIFE.

WITH YOUR PRESENCE THIS TIME?

76
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,806
- I'M LEAVING AFTER A NAP.

OH, SOTA, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET
ME THE BANDAGES AND ANTIBIOTICS.

I COULD FINISH A WOMAN LIKE THAT
OFF ANYTIME I WANT TO,

85
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,772
BUT MAYBE THE REASON I CAN'T

86
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,039
IS BECAUSE THE HEART OF ONIGUMO
STILL BEATS WITHIN ME,

87
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:22,139
AND HE COVETED KIKYO'S LOVE
ABOVE ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD.

88
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,939
ONIGUMO'S HEART...

89
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:28,006
SUCH A SHALLOW,
EVIL, CRIMINAL MAN.

90
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,239
HE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE,

91
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,539
AND YET YEARNED FOR KIKYO
TO SUCH A DEGREE

92
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:36,239
THAT HE OFFERED HIS BODY
UP TO A HOST OF DEMONS,

93
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:39,739
TO BE REBORN AS MYSELF.

94

- IT'S THAT FOOL OF A MORTAL'S

UNDERESTIMATE ME, KIKYO,

THE FOURTH INCARNATION,

145
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,739
IS THE YOUNGER SIBLING

FOR THE THRILL OF BATTLE,

TO NARAKU'S ORDERS.

FOR EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
CREATED FROM A DEATHDOM,

HE RUTHLESSLY CHOPPED

IT'S OBVIOUS THAT EVEN

THE OLDER SIBLING WHO LAY
DORMANT INSIDE JUROMARU.

153

00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,739
SAY, INUYASHA,
AREN'T YOU GOING TO CALL KAGOME

159
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:07,906
TO MAKE SURE
SHE COMES BACK TO US?

160
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,839

WITHOUT HER
HANGING AROUND ANYWAY.

- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

163
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,739
THEN WOULD YOU MIND
DOING US ALL A FAVOR

164
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,672
AND STOP THAT NERVOUS FIDGETING?

THAT KAGOME HAS
THE PATIENCE OF A SAINT,

00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:25,806
PUTTING UP WITH YOU.

- I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

- BUT THE REAL REASON
I'M GOING BACK

172
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,306
IS TO GET SOME MORE BANDAGES
AND MEDICINE FOR US TO USE.

173
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,139
I'M COMING RIGHT BACK,
BUT DON'T TELL INUYASHA THAT.

TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT HER.

YOU'RE TALKING AS IF
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT

185
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,939
THAT SHE DECIDED
TO GET UP AND LEAVE.

186
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,339

COME BACK RIGHT AWAY,

00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:24,739
I'M THE ONE WHO GETS
ALL THE BLAME.

193
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:30,806

THAT WAS WRONG, ANYWAY?

194
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,006
OH.

00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,206

- AND YOU LED HIM HERE KNOWING
THAT I WOULD RESCUE YOU.

- DON'T BE A FOOL, INUYASHA.

I WAS RUNNING BLINDLY
FOR MY LIFE

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

252
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,765
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?!

253
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,398
- WE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STILL SLEEPING.

254

- OVER 50 YEARS.

- WHAT'S THAT?

256
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,165
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, INUYASHA?

257
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,765
- I WAS THINKING HOW WE REALLY
HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH

258
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:26,265
CONSIDERING 50 YEARS
HAVE PASSED.

SINCE THAT TIME, LONG AGO,

262
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:35,398
WHEN I SEALED YOU
TO THIS TREE WE'RE UNDER.

263
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:37,431
- IT WAS BECAUSE
OF NARAKU'S DECEPTIONS

264
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,498
THAT WE HATED EACH OTHER.

265
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,831
SO MUCH THAT YOU TRAPPED ME
HERE FOR 50 YEARS,

266
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,898
AND THEN YOU DIED.

267
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:51,065
KIKYO, BE HONEST.
HAVE I CHANGED?

268
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,498
BEFORE I KNEW
OF NARAKU'S EXISTENCE,

269
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:01,698
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT
I BURNED WITH RESENTMENT
OVER WHAT YOU'D DONE TO ME,

270
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,765
BUT THEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT MY LIFE WAS YOURS,

271
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,698
AND YOURS IS MINE.

272
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,198
- AH!

273
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:18,265
- IT SEEMS YOU'RE
NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM
NARAKU AFTER ALL.

274
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,665
- YOU'RE SAYING

275
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,631

276
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,698

- ONIGUMO'S HEART?

279
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,298
- HE DESIRED ME,

280
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,365
AND HAVING ME KILL YOU
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS

281
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:35,265
WAS SOMETHING THAT
HE DREAMED ABOUT.

282
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:40,831
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
THE JEALOUS HEART OF
ONIGUMO SCHEMED FOR.

283
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:45,831
- HE WAS JEALOUS OVER
SOMETHING SO RIDICULOUS?

284
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:52,498
- YES, RIDICULOUS,
BUT THAT'S WHAT MORTALS ARE.

285
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:57,098
- ONIGUMO'S HEART
REMAINS INSIDE NARAKU.

286
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:01,598
WAIT. KIKYO, DOES NARAKU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU, TOO, NOW?

287
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,798
- HE IS RELUCTANT TO ADMIT IT,

288
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:07,998
BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT HE HAS
A LINGERING DESIRE FOR ME,

289
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,531
AND IN AN EFFORT
TO EASE THAT FEELING,

290
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,765
HE'S TRYING TO GET RID OF ME.

291
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:14,865

00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,731
- ENOUGH TALK, INUYASHA.

293
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,931
THESE SOULS HAVE
FULLY REJUVENATED ME.

294
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,131
- KIKYO, YOU AREN'T
ACTUALLY PLANNING

295
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,731
TO CONFRONT NARAKU
BY YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

296
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,165
YOU'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH,

297
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:36,098
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
HE MIGHT BE IN LOVE WITH YOU.

298
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,198
IT'S TOO MUCH TO BEAR!

299
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:40,898
- THERE!

300
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,565

00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:43,998
I AM SO LATE.

302
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,198
OH, WELL.

303
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,831
I GUESS INUYASHA'S PROBABLY
HAD ENOUGH TIME TO HIMSELF NOW.

YOU FEEL ABOUT ME NOW.

00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,331

- I WILL SLAY NARAKU MYSELF SO
YOU WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

316
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:58,198
I WILL PROTECT YOU.

- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW MEN
ARE PATHETIC FOOLS.

322
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,065
YOU HAVE THIS BELIEF
THAT ONCE YOU EMBRACE A WOMAN,

00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,498
SHE BELONGS TO YOU.

324
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,431

- DON'T MOVE.

326
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,898
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING
FROM WATCHING YOU JUST NOW.

AS LONG AS THE HEART OF
THE WEAK AND PATHETIC ONIGUMO

BEATS WITHIN NARAKU,

329
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,965
THERE WILL BE
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME,

330
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,398
AND THAT WILL GIVE ME
THE CHANCE I NEED

331

LEAKING FROM THE HEART

NEVER.

SO SHE WAS WATCHING.

STRAIGHT AT ME.

00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:03,598
WHY?

352
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,631
WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AWAY?

353
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,731
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

354
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,463
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

355
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:58,996
- NOW THAT INUYASHA
HAS SWORN TO PROTECT KIKYO,

356
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:00,529
I CAN'T STAY WITH HIM ANYMORE.

357
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,663
BUT ONLY AFTER I'VE RUN BACK
TO THE PRESENT DO I REALIZE

358
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:05,496
THAT I STILL HAVE A SHARD
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

359
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,996
I KNOW FULL WELL THAT I SHOULD
RETURN IT TO THE FEUDAL ERA,

360
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,696
BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT IT MEANS
THE END OF MY ADVENTURES.

361
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:14,463
TORN BY INDECISION,

362
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,129
I STAND IN FRONT
OF THE SACRED TREE

363
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,429
WHERE I FIRST MET INUYASHA.

364
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:22,363
NEXT TIME,
"BACK TO WHERE WE FIRST MET."

365
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,396
SEE YOU SOON!
