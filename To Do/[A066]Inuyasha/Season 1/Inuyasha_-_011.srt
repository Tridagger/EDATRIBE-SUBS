MY SISTER, KIKYO,

00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,953
HAD DIED TRYING TO SEAL
THE JEWEL'S POWERS.

6
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:44,986
HOWEVER, SHE WAS REINCARNATED
AS A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED KAGOME,

7
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,553
AND RETURNED TO COMPLETE
HER MISSION.

UHH.
- ERK!

16
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,919

YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

17
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,586
UNTIL YOU HAND OVER THE SHARDS
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

18
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,253

THAT THIS GIRL

I MIGHT FAIL THE CLASS,

HEY! NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[GRUNTING]

CHANTING STUFF, GRANDPA?

36
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,086
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK,
DOES IT?

37
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,319
- IT DOES.

YOU REALLY DID IT, GRAMPS!

- NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
TO SHAVE YOUR HEAD

56
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,686
AND START TRAINING
FOR THE PRIESTHOOD.

57
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,019
- SHAVE MY HEAD?
- OF COURSE.
TIME TO PASS THE TORCH.

- GET REAL.
I'M GOING TO BE
A FAMOUS SOCCER PLAYER.

IS THAT?

DUSTING ANTIQUES AND CHECKING
FOR POCKET CHANGE, THAT--

- VERY INTERESTING, BUT COULD WE
FINISH THIS CONVERSATION

62
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,353
AFTER YOU'VE HELPED ME
OUT OF THE WELL?

63
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,753
- ANYWAY, MOM WANTS ME
TO BE A DOCTOR.

- A DOCTOR?
WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD BE
A DOCTOR ON THE WEEKENDS,

TO START YOU TRAINING
FOR THE PRIESTHOOD TODAY.

[AHCHOO]
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, BUYO?

OR MAYBE MY HAIR STILL SMELLS
A LITTLE GROSS.

DIDN'T YOU BRING HIM HOME
WITH YOU?

- OF COURSE I DIDN'T.
I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO

74
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:42,553
THAN SPEND MY TIME
BABY-SITTING A DEMON ALL DAY.
HA!

75
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:46,386
OH, BROTHER.
MY LIFE'S GETTING A BIT
TOO COMPLICATED.

76
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,619
I'VE LIVED HERE
AT HIGURASHI SHRINE
SINCE I WAS 4.

77
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:55,086
THERE'S GRAMPS, MOM,
MY LITTLE BROTHER SOTA,

00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,353
AND ME, YOUR AVERAGE
MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL.

79
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,553
BUT THAT'S WHERE THINGS
START GETTING WEIRD.

80
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:02,419
WE HAVE A HIDDEN WELL
ON THE GROUNDS

81
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,153
THAT LEADS TO THE FEUDAL ERA,

82
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,053
NOT TO MENTION
ALL KINDS OF MONSTERS

83
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,686
THAT ARE AFTER THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

84
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:13,453
NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY LIFE IS ANYTHING BUT AVERAGE.

85
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,353
I KEEP THINKING
I'M GOING TO WAKE UP

86
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:19,053
TO FIND OUT IT'S ALL
A BAD DREAM OR SOMETHING,

87
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,586
BUT IT'S NOT A DREAM.
IT'S VERY REAL,

88
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:24,653
AND I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO DEAL WITH IT.

[SIGH]

90
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,686

- WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR ACCIDENT
WITH THE CAT.

97
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:04,019
THAT IS ONE NASTY PLACE
TO GET BITTEN.

98
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,686
HOW'S YOUR BACK
AFTER THAT FALL OUT OF BED?

99
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,419
- BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR BACK OUT,
YOU WERE AWAY FOR SOME
LYME DISEASE TESTS.

100
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,419
- GOT THE RESULTS BACK YET?

101
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,886
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THAT CASE OF RINGWORM?
[GROANS]

102
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,286
- COME ON, GRAMPS.
COULDN'T YOU HAVE TOLD THEM
I HAVE A COLD?

00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,819
- OHH!
- KAGOME!

115
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,786
ARE YOU GOING OUT WITH HOJO?

116
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,253
- 'COURSE NOT.
I HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME.

117

DOES THAT GUY TOTALLY HAVE
THE HOTS FOR YOU, OR WHAT?

118
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:03,386
- OH, YEAH.

119
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,686
- YOU MEAN, HE'S NEVER EVEN
TALKED TO YOU BEFORE?

120
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,719
- NOT REALLY.
- AREN'T YOU EVEN EXCITED?

121
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,519
- OH, NO.
MAYBE SHE LIKES SOMEONE ELSE.

122
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,086
- COME ON.
I DON'T LIKE ANYONE.

123
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,486
- IF YOU DID,
WHAT WOULD HE BE LIKE?

124
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,586
THE ATHLETIC TYPE
OR THE INTELLECTUAL TYPE?

125
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:18,853
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HUH?

126
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:21,286
- HE DEFINITELY WOULDN'T
BE AGGRESSIVE,

127
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,586
AND NOT SELFISH.

128
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,486
HE WOULDN'T GET MAD EASILY.

129
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,753
HE'D BE KIND AND UNDERSTANDING,

130
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:30,486
AND HE'D BRING ME FLOWERS
AND WRITE ME POETRY.

131

SOMEONE THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF INUYASHA.

132

THAT'S THE PERFECT GUY FOR ME.

133
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,853
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS AN UNDECIDED.

134
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,986
- MAYBE SHE IS STILL SICK.

[HUMMING]
- UH, UH...OHH!

136
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,753

GET OFF YE DUFF AND SEEK OUT

THE STOREHOUSE IS ON FIRE!

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:27,086
THIS IS TERRIBLE!
THE NOH MASK HAS BURNED

EXORCISED THAT EVIL MASK
FOR A NOH ACTOR

151
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:46,353
WHO BROUGHT IT TO HIM.

152
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,686
IT WAS CALLED
THE FLESH-EATING MASK,

153
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,653
AND WAS RUMORED TO HAVE
INCREDIBLE MALEVOLENT POWERS.

154
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:54,819
I MUST DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
TO SEAL IT UP AGAIN!

- KAGOME!
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

HOW COULD A FIRE START
IN THE STOREHOUSE?

ANYTHING AND ANYONE IN ITS PATH.

THE NUMBER OF INJURED SO FAR
HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED,

217
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,586
SINCE EVERY PERSON
THAT CROSSES ITS PATH

218
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,319
SEEMS TO HAVE VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR.

219

THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION
WE HAVE AT PRESENT,

220

BUT UNTIL MORE IS KNOWN
ABOUT THE INCIDENT,

WE STRONGLY ADVISE EVERYONE
TO STAY OFF THE STREETS.

I CAN GAIN THE POWER TO STOP
THIS FLESH FROM DECOMPOSING.

IS HE AWAKE YET?

BUT THE DOCTOR'S
A LITTLE BAFFLED.

WOKEN UP BY NOW.

AND A TOTAL EGOMANIAC.

[SIGH]
THE GUY'S A COMPLETE PAIN.

334
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:14,219
- THIS CAN'T BE THE SAME GUY
KAGOME WAS TELLING ME ABOUT.

335
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,853
SURE, HIS OUTFIT'S
A BIT OUT OF DATE,

336
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:18,253
BUT INUYASHA'S
THE ONLY GUY AROUND HERE

337
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:20,353
I THINK I CAN TRUST.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

339
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,594
- INUYASHA'S NOT HERE YET.

340
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:38,460
WHAT'S TAKING HIM SO LONG?

341
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,827
AAH!

342
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
AAH!

343
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:48,427
OH, NO!

344
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,294
- I NEED THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL!

- SURE. I'M FINE.
- OH, SIS.

348

- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE TEARS?

349
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:07,927
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T AFRAID.

350
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,460
- IT'S OK.
INUYASHA'S GONNA DESTROY
THAT MONSTER FOR US,

351
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:14,360
AND IT'LL ALL BE OVER.
- AHEM.
- HUH?

352
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,927
- BEFORE WE GET ON
WITH MY LITTLE
RESCUE MISSION HERE,

353
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,360
THIS MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE
TIME FOR AN APOLOGY,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

354
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,694
- HUH?
APOLOGY FOR WHAT?

355
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,694
SIT!

356
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,827
- FOR WHAT?
FOR SHOUTING
ALL THOSE INCANTATIONS

357
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,160
AND PUTTING MY BACK OUT,
THAT'S WHAT.

358
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,994
YEAH, SHE HAS THE GALL
TO BEG ME FOR HELP.

359
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,927
- OH, THAT.
YEAH, NOW IT'S COMING BACK.

360
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,494
OK. I'M VERY SORRY.
THERE. YOU SATISFIED NOW?

361
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:40,927
- SHE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE
SHE'S APOLOGIZING FOR
STEPPING ON MY FOOT.

362
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,260
MAYBE I'LL GO BACK.

363
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:43,427
- YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE US HERE.

364
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,960
BESIDES, THE MASK HAS A SHARD
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

365
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,060
DON'T YOU WANT TO ADD IT
TO OUR COLLECTION?

HE'S SHRINKING
TO LIFE-SIZE PROPORTIONS

371
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,060
BEFORE MY VERY EYES.

372
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,527
- OH, NO.
THE MASK!

373
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,427
- WHO DARES TO ATTACK ME?

374
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,327
- INUYASHA, AIM FOR THE MASK.

375
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,094
THE SHARD IS IN THE FOREHEAD!

376
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,994
- I AM THE FLESH-EATING MASK.

377
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:09,894
CENTURIES AGO, I WAS CARVED
FROM A GIANT TREE

378
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,594
WHICH HAD A FRAGMENT
OF THE SACRED SHIKON JEWEL

379
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:13,694
EMBEDDED IN IT.

380
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:14,727
SINCE MY CREATION,

381
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,427
I HAVE CRAVED HUMAN FLESH
AND DEVOURED MY VICTIMS.

382
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,827
BUT NOW, I WISH TO HAVE
A LIVING BODY THAT WILL NOT ROT.

383
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,827
FOR THAT, I REQUIRE MORE POWER
FROM THE SACRED JEWEL.

384
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,594
- I SEE.
SO THAT'S WHY THE MASK

385
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,694
IS SO DESPERATE
TO HAVE THESE SHARDS.

386
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,727

YOU'VE EATEN SO FAR,

TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT!

NOW YOU SHALL NEVER ESCAPE ME.

I'LL THROW IT AWAY.
NO, THAT WON'T WORK.
