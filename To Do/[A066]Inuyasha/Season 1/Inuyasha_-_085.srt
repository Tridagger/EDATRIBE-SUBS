BE?

261
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:18,321
I HIT IT SQUARE ON WITH MY WIND

>> JUST AS I THOUGHT.

284
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:31,988
THAT DEMON WAS NO MORE THAN AN

285

ILLUSION.

286
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:35,765

>> DOES THAT MEAN THE DEMON HEAD

288
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,621
WILL APPEAR AGAIN TOMORROW

289
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,055

THE REAL DEMON.

294
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,021
>> SO THAT MEANS THE REAL DEMON

295
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,255
MUST BE HIDING SOMEWHERE IN

296
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:58,855
