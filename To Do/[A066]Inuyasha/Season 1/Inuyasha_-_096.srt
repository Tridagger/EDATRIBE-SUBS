190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,060
THOUSAND-YEAR FLOWER?

191
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,293
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

192
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,826
RIN, IF YOU TRULY WANT TO SAVE

193
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:54,526
ME, YOU MUST HURRY.

194
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,526
BEFORE THE SUN SETS, I MUST

195
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:57,993
SWALLOW THE BERRIES OF THE

196
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:59,993
THOUSAND-YEAR FLOWERS OR ELSE

197
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,593
THE TOXIC POISON WILL SPREAD

198
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,260
THROUGHOUT MY BODY, AND I WILL

199
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,193
BE DOOMED.

200
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,660
>> DON'T WORRY, JAKEN.

201
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,926
I WILL RETURN BEFORE THE SUN

202
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,226
SETS.

203
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,660
I PROMISE.

204
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,726
>> AH-UN, GO FASTER!

205
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,593
>> HMM, ARE YOU QUITE SURE THIS

206
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,226
IS THE RIGHT WAY, KAGOME?

207
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,360
>> HMM, I THINK SO, BUT I'M NOT

208
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,493
SURE.

209
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:29,760
IT WAS THIS WAY, WASN'T IT,

210
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,660
INUYASHA?

211
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,160
>> OH, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN MY

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,560
OPINION IS IMPORTANT?

213
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,926
>> COME ON, ARE YOU STILL

214
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:36,793
SULKING ABOUT WHAT I SAID?

215
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,293
OK, I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING RUDE.

216
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:40,593
THERE, YOU HAPPY?

217
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:41,326
>> SHE'S JUST SAYING THAT

218
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:42,260
AS USUAL.

219
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,493
SHE DIDN'T EVEN MEAN IT.

220
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:48,393
>> I KNOW THAT SMELL.

221
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:50,093
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, INUYASHA?

222
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,426
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY THEM--

223
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,160
NARAKU'S POISONOUS INSECTS.

224
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,860
>> UH?

225
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,393
>> HEH, I COULDN'T ASK FOR

226
00:09:58,393 --> 00:09:59,293
BETTER LUCK.

227
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:00,326
THIS PLACE COULD USE SOME PEST

228
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:02,660
CONTROL.

229
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,826
>> INUYASHA, WAIT A MINUTE.

230
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:04,560
>> HUH?

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,826
>> KAGOME, ARE YOU SENSING ANY

232
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,860
SECRET JEWEL SHARDS NEARBY?

233
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,060
>> MM-MM, NO, NOT ANYWHERE

234
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,326
NEARBY.

235
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,493
>> AND NO DEMON PUPPETS EITHER?

236
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:14,693
THEN PERHAPS THE POISONOUS

237
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,393
INSECTS ARE HEADING BACK TO

238
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:18,160
NARAKU.

239
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,526
>> IF WE FOLLOW THEM INSTEAD OF

240
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,060
KILLING THEM...

241
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,093
>> WE'LL FIND NARAKU.

242
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:24,914
LET'S GET GOING.

243
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,226
>> LOOK, THEY'RE FALLING!

244
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,593
>> WHAT?

245
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,026
>> ARE THEY DEAD?

246
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:39,860
>> I DON'T GET IT.

247
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,620
WHAT'S GOING ON?

248
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,060
>> SESSHOMARU.

249
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,826
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

250
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,093
SANYOSHO?

251
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,426
DID YOU KILL THEM?

252
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,060
>> SANYOSHO?

253
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,293
YOU MEAN THOSE POISON INSECTS?

254
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:58,093
>> YOU'RE SO SHORT-SIGHTED.

255
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,026
>> WHAT?

256
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,060
>> I WAS FOLLOWING THEM TO

257
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,693
NARAKU, BUT NOW, I HAVE NOTHING

258
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,693
TO LEAD ME.

259
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:04,260
>> LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR.

260
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
I DIDN'T KILL THOSE BUGS.

261
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,226
>> YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR

262
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,193
EVERYTHING.

263
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:09,993
IT DOES GET SO TIRESOME.

264
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,326
>> HA, I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE

265
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:12,460
EXCUSES FOR YOU.

266
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,960
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

267
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,126
>> INUYASHA ISN'T LYING.

268
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,360
HE DIDN'T KILL THEM!

269
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,526
>> STAY OUT OF THIS, KAGOME.

270
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,426
HE'S SO STUBBORN.

271
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,193
HE NEVER UNDERSTANDS.

272
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,193
>> INUYASHA, I'M NOT FEELING

273
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,826
PARTICULARLY MAGNANIMOUS TODAY.

274
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,293
I WON'T GO EASY ON YOU LIKE I

275
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,526
HAVE IN THE PAST.

276
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,626
>> OH, CUT THE CRAP, AND DON'T

277
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,207
COME CRYING TO ME AFTERWARD.

278
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,560
>> COME ON, STOP IT, BOTH OF

279
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
YOU!

280
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,626
>> YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH.

281
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:40,993
>> THOSE TWO ARE CONSTANTLY AT

282
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,293
ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.

283
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,354
>> I'LL SECOND THAT.

284
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,860
>> AH-UN, YOU WAIT THERE UNTIL I

285
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,593
GET BACK.

286
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,926
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT--AN HERBAL

287
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,560
GARDEN, AND THIS IS THE PLANT I

288
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,901
NEED!

289
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:20,607
UH, EXCUSE ME.

290
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,574
>> HUH?

291
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,474
WHO ARE YOU?

292
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,774
>> A WITCH.

293
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,141
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

294
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,074
>> I'M REALLY SORRY TO INTRUDE,

295
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,874
BUT I WANT TO SEE JINENJI.

296
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,807
>> NO CAN DO.

297
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,141
JINENJI ISN'T SEEING ANYONE

298
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,107
TODAY.

299
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:36,341
GO ON HOME.

300
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,274
>> YOU'RE HERE, AREN'T YOU

301
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:38,407
JINENJI?

302
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:39,707
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

303
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:40,741
I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME SOME

304
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:43,607
SINENSO BERRIES.

305
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,107
MY FRIEND HAS BEEN POISONED,

306
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,141
AND HE MIGHT DIE ANY MINUTE!

307
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,274
>> THAT'S A TERRIBLE SHAME.

308
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,707
NONETHELESS, I DON'T HAVE ANY

309
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,774
SINENSO BERRIES HERE.

310
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,241
GO HOME.

311
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,407
>> JINENJI, WHAT'S WRONG WITH

312
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:57,241
YOU?

313
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,207
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT FROM

314
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,907
UNDER THE COVERS AND TALK TO ME?

315
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,607
>> YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE GIRL, SO

316
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,607
YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

317
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:07,041
JINENJI IS A HALF-DEMON.

318
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,674
>> HALF-DEMON?

319
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,174
>> FROM TIME TO TIME HIS DEMON

320
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,841
APPEARANCE CHANGES AND HE TAKES

321
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,641
ON HIS HUMAN FORM.

322
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:16,307
HE'S SUCH A COWARD.

323
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,774
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE

324
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:20,241
HIS HUMAN SELF.

325
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,274
>> THEN PLEASE TELL ME WHERE I

326
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:22,941
CAN FIND THE BERRIES, JINENJI.

327
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:24,474
I'LL GO GET THEM MYSELF.

328
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,141
>> SINENSO BERRIES ARE USED AS

329
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,307
AN ANTIDOTE BY DEMONS.

330
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,141
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE A DEMON,

331
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,874
LITTLE GIRL?

332
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:32,841
>> MM-HMM.

333
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,241
>> DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE SMITTEN

334
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,541
WITH THIS DEMON?

335
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,274
>> SMITTEN?

336
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,774
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

337
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,507
>> NEVER MIND DEAR, YOU ARE SO

338
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,274
YOUNG, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY

339
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,474
KNOW ABOUT IT.

340
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,374
I WAS LIKE YOU ONCE, YOUNG AND

341
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:46,974
INNOCENT.

342
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,907
>> NEVER MIND THAT.

343
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,341
I HAVE TO TRY TO SAVE MASTER

344
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,507
JAKEN.

345
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:52,941
>> MOTHER.

346
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:53,774
>> HUH?

347
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:57,574
>> THIS GIRL RESEMBLES KAGOME.

348
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,207
>> KAGOME?

349
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,841
OH, YES, THAT YOUNG GIRL.

350
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,041
YOU'RE RIGHT.

351
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,541
>> THE SINENSO GROWS IN THE

352
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,141
RAVINE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUT BACK.

353
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,741
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF DEMONS

354
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,941
AND BEASTS IN THE AREA.

355
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,241
A HUMAN...

356
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,041
WOULD NEVER MAKE IT

357
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,241
BACK...

358
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,441
ALIVE.

359
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,874
WHEN IT'S DARK, I'LL RETURN TO

360
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,007
NORMAL.

361
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,307
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT UNTIL THEN?

362
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,307
>> IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

363
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,441
TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PLANT IT

364
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,474
IS.

365
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,974
I'LL GO GET IT MYSELF.

366
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,415
>> YOU ARE SO SIMILAR TO KAGOME.

367
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:40,541
>> RIN, LORD SESSHOMARU.

368
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:44,207
[CRYING]

369
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:47,648
NO, I DON'T WANT TO DIE ALONE.

370
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,807
>> AH-UN, THERE'S THE RAVINE!

371
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,774
THAT MUST BE THE PLACE.

372
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:06,255
>> TIME FOR MY WEAPON!

373
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:12,888
>> WHAT?

374
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,507
