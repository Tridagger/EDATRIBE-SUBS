1
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,105
- [SIGH]

2
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:31,972
- WHOO-HOO!

3
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:33,705
THERE'S EVERY WEAPON
UNDER THE SUN HERE--

4
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,872
ALL MADE FROM THE BONES
AND HIDE OF DEMONS.

5
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:38,105
- THE PEOPLE OF THIS VILLAGE

6
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,472
USE THESE ARMS
TO SLAY DEMONS.

7
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:43,072
- THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY STRONG FOR HUMANS.

8
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:47,205
- YES. THAT'S WHY THE DEMONS HAD
SUCH ANGER TOWARDS THIS PLACE.

9
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:50,738
- OH. NARAKU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR HATRED.

10
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,738
- HE USED THE DEMONS
TO DO HIS DIRTY WORK.

11
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:58,438
- ON OUR JOURNEY IN SEARCH
OF THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,

12
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,172
WE CAME UPON A VILLAGE
OF DEMON SLAYERS.

13
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:04,005
LEGEND SAYS THIS VILLAGE
WAS THE BIRTHPLACE
OF THE SACRED JEWEL,

14
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,505
BUT NARAKU'S TREACHERY
BEAT US TO THE SPOT,

15
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:09,772
AND THE ENTIRE VILLAGE
WAS ANNIHILATED BEFORE
WE GOT THERE.

16
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:13,172
EVERY SLAYER, EXCEPT FOR
A GIRL CALLED SANGO, WAS KILLED.

17
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,072
THE SACRED JEWEL THAT KIKYO HAS
TRIED TO HIDE FROM THE WORLD,

18
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,438
THE SACRED JEWEL THAT BURST
FROM MY BODY EONS LATER,

19
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:24,672
EVERYTHING WOULD BECOME CLEAR
IN THIS VILLAGE.

20
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,472
- [BIRDS SCREECHING]

21
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:58,538
- DAMN IT,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, ANYWAY?

22
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,872
HEY, MIROKU,
IS THAT SANGO GIRL

23
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,305
STILL IN BED HEALING
HER WOUNDS OR WHAT?

24
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:04,772
- YES, I BELIEVE SHE IS.

25
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,705
- WELL, SHE CAN'T SLEEP
ALL DAY.

26
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,738
GET HER OUT OF BED.

27
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,305
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS
WHERE NARAKU'S HIDING.

28
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:11,238
SHE SAYS SHE CAN'T
REMEMBER HOW TO GET

29
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,638
TO THE CASTLE
WHERE HE'S STAYING,

30
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:13,938
BUT IF WE KEEP
LOOKING AROUND,

31
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:16,538
SOMETHING'S BOUND TO JOG
HER MEMORY SOONER OR LATER.

32
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,638
- MUST HAVE BEEN A SPELL.
AND NOW THAT IT'S WORN OFF,

33
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:23,272
SHE'S FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ABOUT
NARAKU AND HIS WHEREABOUTS.

34
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,905
- WHO CARES ABOUT
HER SPELL AND WOUNDS?

35
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,605
WE'VE BEEN WAITING 10 DAYS!

36
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:28,772
I WOULD HAVE BEEN UP IN 3.

37
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,672
- NOT ME. I WOULD BE BEDRIDDEN
FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.

38
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,805
BESIDES, SANGO'S NOT JUST
SUFFERING PHYSICALLY.

39
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,605
SHE'S LOST HER
ENTIRE FAMILY AND VILLAGE.

40
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,405
HER HEART'S
BEEN DEEPLY WOUNDED.

41
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,105
- OH, A WOUNDED HEART, HUH?

42
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,705
WELL, THE BEST CURE
FOR THAT IS VENGEANCE.

43
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:46,305
AND TO GET OUR REVENGE,
WE HAVE TO FIND NARAKU'S CASTLE.

44
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:48,805
I'M GONNA SEE
IF SHE REMEMBERS ANYTHING.

45
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,372
UGH! WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

46
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:53,272
- LEAVE HER ALONE
AND LET HER REST FOR AWHILE.

47
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:56,938
I GUARANTEE THAT WILL BE
THE BEST MEDICINE.

48
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,505
- [GASP]

49
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,338
SHE'S GONE!

50
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:19,872
SANGO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

51
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,405
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE UP.

52
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:23,072
YOU STILL NEED TO REST.

53
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,205
- THE GRAVES.

54
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,405
- HUH?

55
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:30,238
- YOU BURIED ALL THE VILLAGERS,
AND YOU MARKED THEIR GRAVES.

56
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,372
- MMM...UH...

57
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,205
I CAN'T TELL HER TO CHEER UP.

58
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:40,872
I MEAN, IN ONE DAY,
SHE'S SUDDENLY ALL
ALONE IN THE WORLD.

59
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:46,072
- LISTEN,
WHEN YOUR WOUNDS HEAL,

60
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,838
WHY DON'T YOU CONSIDER
JOINING OUR GROUP?

61
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,372
INUYASHA AND MIROKU
ARE PRETTY DECENT GUYS,

62
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,172
GIVE OR TAKE A FEW QUIRKS.

63
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,338
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

64
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:56,038
- THAT'S A SACRED JEWEL SHARD
AROUND YOUR NECK, ISN'T IT?

65
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,238
- HUH?

66
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,572
THE SHARDS FROM THE SACRED JEWEL
ENERGIZE THE POWER OF EVIL.

67
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:04,305
I'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF PIECES
TO COLLECT BEFORE IT'S WHOLE.

68
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,038
- NARAKU WILL COME AFTER IT,
I'M POSITIVE.

69
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,905
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO JOIN YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS.

70
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:12,072
- TO AVENGE YOUR
FAMILY AND VILLAGE?

71
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,672
- I GUESS SO.
BESIDES, THE SHIKON JEWEL...

72
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,005
- WAS BORN HERE,
SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.

73
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:20,072
ALL OF US INITIALLY CAME
TO YOUR VILLAGE

74
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,838
HOPING TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE JEWEL'S ORIGINS.

75
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,838
EVERYONE WHO COMES IN CONTACT
WITH THE JEWEL SHARD

76
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,272
SEEMS TO END UP UNHAPPY.

77
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,372
JUST WHAT IS IT,
EXACTLY?

78
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,872
- [MEWLING]
- HMM?

79
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,172
HEY, WHAT'S UP, KIRARA?

80
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,805
- ALL RIGHT.
CALL YOUR FRIENDS.

81
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:37,772
- HUH?

82
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,472
- YOU HELPED BURY THE DEAD.

83
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:47,305
SO I WILL TELL YOU
HOW THE SACRED JEWEL CAME TO BE.

84
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,338
- AT LONG LAST, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO ENTER THE LIMESTONE CAVE,

85
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:02,172
THE BIRTHPLACE OF
THE JEWEL OF 4 SOULS.

86
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:03,238
- SO TELL US, SANGO,

87
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:07,738
HOW WE GET RID OF THIS STUPID
CAVE BARRIER, ANYWAY?

88
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:12,538
- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT AGE-OLD
INCANTATION YOU VILLAGERS CHANT

89
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,105
IN ORDER TO BREAK IT
AND PASS THROUGH SAFELY.

90
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,572
- THERE ISN'T
ANY INCANTATION.

91
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:20,038
- OH! OF COURSE THERE IS.
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU DO IT?

92
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,072
- MYOGA!

93
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,872
- OY!

94
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,805
- THIS PLACE IS A GRAVEYARD.

95
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:26,672
- GRAVEYARD?

96
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,038
- IT'S USELESS
TO JUST LOOK FOR A WAY IN.

97
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,305
AT FIRST, MY VILLAGERS
HAD THOUGHT THE DEMONS

98
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,538
HAD PLACED A CURSE TO KEEP
ANYONE FROM ENTERING,

99
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:39,038
BUT WE EVENTUALLY REALIZED
THAT SHE IS THE ONE
WHO KEEPS INTRUDERS OUT.

100
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,005
- AND WHO IS SHE?

101
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:43,238
- THE PERSON IN WHOM
THE SACRED JEWEL WAS BORN.

102
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,338
HER SPIRIT IS FULL
OF SADNESS AND REGRET,

103
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,338
AND IT PREVENTS OTHERS
FROM ENTERING.

104
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,205
THAT'S WHAT I SENSE.

105
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:54,038
IT WILL BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND
ONCE WE GO IN.

106
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,705
GO AHEAD, STEP THROUGH
THE BARRIER.

107
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:57,772
- UHH...

108
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,605
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

109
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,572
- COUNTLESS PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN KILLED

110
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,605
BECAUSE OF THE SACRED JEWEL'S
DARK POWER.

111
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,805
AND IT IS THE SYMPATHY
YOU SHOW FOR THE VICTIMS

112
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:10,505
THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
SHE WILL ALLOW YOU
TO ENTER THE CAVE.

113
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,605
- HUH?
- HUH?

114
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:19,205
- HEY, SHE'S RIGHT.
WE GOT THROUGH.

115
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,172
- WE DID IT.

116
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:25,572
NOW WE CAN MEET THE PERSON WHO
GAVE BIRTH TO THE SACRED JEWEL.

117
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,905
HA! ENTER MYOGA!

118
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:30,172
[SPUTTERING]

119
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,738
NOW, WHY DID THAT HAPPEN?

120
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,872
- UH...AAH!

121
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:44,172
- UH.

122
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,905
- HUH?

123
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,605
- WHA-WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

124
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,105
- THERE WAS A TIME WHEN OGRES,
DRAGONS, AND OTHER DEMONS

125
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:58,372
MERGED THEIR BODIES TOGETHER
TO WAGE A BATTLE.

126
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:01,372
THEY FOUGHT AGAINST
ONE POWERFUL HUMAN.

127
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:05,505
- THERE'S A PERSON
INSIDE THE STALAGMITE.

128
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:14,105
- THE DEMON HAS IT
IN HER JAWS.

129
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:17,938
- ANCIENT ARMOR.
IS THAT AN ANCIENT WARRIOR?

130
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:18,838
- IT'S A WOMAN,

131
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,272
A PRIESTESS WHO LIVED
MANY CENTURIES AGO.

132
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,772
- HUH?

133
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:33,772
- LOOK AT THE NUMBER
OF DEMONS SURROUNDING HER.

134
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:39,572
THIS PRIESTESS MUST HAVE HAD
IMMENSE SPIRITUAL POWER.

135
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:43,238
- THE COURT NOBLES CONTROLLED
THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME.

136
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,872
WARS AND FAMINES
DRAGGED ON AND ON,

137
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:48,938
AND COUNTLESS PEOPLE PERISHED.

138
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,905
DEMONS DEVOURED THE DEAD
AND THE NEAR DEAD,

139
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:57,505
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GROW
IN GREAT NUMBERS.

140
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,272
MANY PRIESTS AND WARRIORS
SET OUT TO SLAY THEM,

141
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:04,805
BUT ONLY ONE PRIESTESS,
KNOWN AS MIDORIKO,

142
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:09,872
WAS ABLE TO PURIFY DEMON SOULS
AND RENDER THEM HARMLESS.

143
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:15,272
SHE WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST
POWERFUL HUMAN OF HER TIME.

144
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,972
- SHE COULD PURIFY AND WEAKEN
THE DEMONS' SOULS?

145
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,038
- MM-HMM.

146
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,805
IN HER WORLD, HUMANS, ANIMALS,
TREES, AND EVEN STONES

147
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:25,572
WERE ALL CREATED
THROUGH THE 4 SOULS.

148
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:27,938
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SHIKON MEANS "4 SOULS."

149
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:31,938
- I'VE COME ACROSS THAT
PHILOSOPHY IN MY READINGS.

150
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,038
THE 4 SOULS ARE CALLED

151
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:39,605
ARA-MITAMA, NIGI-MITAMA,
KUSHI-MITAMA, AND SAKI-MITAMA.

152
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:40,838
WHEN THEY'RE COMBINED,

153
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,905
THEY BECOME THE SOUL
OF ONE PERSON

154
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:45,605
HOUSED INSIDE THE HEART.

155
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:48,038
ARA-MITAMA IS COURAGE.

156
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,072
NIGI-MITAMA IS FRIENDSHIP.

157
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,472
KUSHI-MITAMA IS WISDOM.

158
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,838
SAKI-MITAMA IS LOVE.

159
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:58,805
WHEN THE 4 SOULS, OR SPIRITS,
WORK TOGETHER IN HARMONY,

160
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,005
IT IS CALLED NAOHI,

161
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,605
AND THE HUMAN HEART
IS FILLED WITH GOODNESS.

162
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:05,172
ARE YOU KEEPING UP WITH ME,
INUYASHA?

163
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,672
- UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

164
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:11,038
- THIS IS WAY
TOO DEEP FOR ME.

165
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,672
- WHEN SOMEBODY
DOES A BAD DEED,

166
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:17,205
THE 4 SOULS ENERGIZE EVIL,
AND THE HUMAN LOSES HIS WAY.

167
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,172
IN OTHER WORDS--

168
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,138
- IN OTHER WORDS,
A SOUL CAN TURN GOOD OR BAD,

169
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:24,705
AND THIS TRANSFORMATION
CAN HAPPEN WITHIN A HUMAN
SOUL OR A DEMON SOUL.

170
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:28,072
NOW YOU KNOW WHY MIDORIKO
WAS A FORMIDABLE FOE
FOR THE DEMONS,

171
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:32,505
BECAUSE SHE WAS ABLE
TO PURIFY THEIR SOULS
AND MAKE THEM POWERLESS.

172
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,205
- SO WHAT? SHE FOUGHT OFF
AN ARMY OF DEMONS

173
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,838
BY TURNING THEM INTO
A BUNCH OF WEAKLINGS.

174
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:40,338
HER POWER DIDN'T LAST
VERY LONG, DID IT?

175
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:43,338
I'D SAY SHE'S A PRETTY
USELESS PRIESTESS NOW.

176
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,738
- SHE HASN'T LOST
THE BATTLE YET.

177
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,205
- WHAT DOES SHE MEAN,
NOT YET?

178
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,605
[GASP]

179
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,705
WHAT'S THAT?

180
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:57,472
- AFTER BATTLING FOR
7 DAYS AND 7 NIGHTS,

181
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,238
A DEMON GOT ITS FANGS
INTO MIDORIKO.

182
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:01,838
WITH HER LAST OUNCE
OF ENERGY,

183
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:05,605
SHE REACHED DEEP WITHIN
HER OWN BODY FOR STRENGTH,

184
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:07,772
AND SEIZED THE DEMON'S SOUL.

185
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:12,805
BUT IN DOING SO,
SHE FORCED OUT HER OWN SOUL.

186
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:18,272
- TELL ME, IS THE HOLE
IN HER CHEST

187
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,638
THE SPOT WHERE SHE FORCED OUT
HER OWN SOUL?

188
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:25,938
- WHAT FLEW OUT OF HER WAS
IN FACT THE SHIKON JEWEL.

189
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,972
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO PURIFY
THE DEMON'S SOUL.

190
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,905
ALL SHE COULD DO WAS
SEIZE AND IMPRISON IT

191
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,305
ALONG WITH HERSELF.

192
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:37,605
ALTHOUGH THE FLESH IS GONE,

193
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:40,805
INSIDE THE SACRED JEWEL,
A BATTLE STILL WAGES

194
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:43,205
BETWEEN MIDORIKO
AND THE DEMONS.

195
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,005
THAT IS WHY THE FIGHT
ISN'T OVER YET.

196
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,872
- SO, A WAR BETWEEN SOULS
IS STILL RAGING INSIDE
THE SACRED JEWEL.

197
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,838
- HA. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS STORY
COMPLICATES THINGS.

198
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:57,905
WE JUST HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT NARAKU HUNTING
AFTER THE JEWEL SHARDS.

199
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:00,472
I'M GONNA TAKE POSSESSION
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

200
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:03,505
AND USE IT TO BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON,

201
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,772
AND THEN MIDORIKO
CAN REST IN PEACE.

202
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,805
HUH? HUH? AAH!

203
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:14,438
[SCREAMING]

204
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,005
AAH!

205
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:20,572
- LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE WHO
TALK OF THE SHIKON JEWEL
AND SELFISH GAIN

206
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,705
GET THROWN FROM THE CAVE.

207
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:27,072
- THAT MUST BE MIDORIKO'S
VERSION OF "SIT."

208
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:31,738
- IT'S GOTTEN SO LATE.

209
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:37,505
- A PRIESTESS INSIDE
OF A STALAGMITE?

210
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,005
OH, MY! TELL ME ALL
THE JUICY DETAILS, SHIPPO.

211
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:44,172
- THE PRIESTESS THRUST
THE SACRED SHIKON JEWEL
OUT OF HER BODY

212
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:45,972
WHILE THE DEMON HAD HER
IN HIS JAWS,

213
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:48,105
AND THE IMAGE OF THEM
IS SET IN STONE.

214
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:51,005
- HMM. THEY WERE COVERED
IN A STALAGMITE.

215
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:54,472
THEN SEVERAL CENTURIES MUST HAVE
PASSED SINCE THE BATTLE,

216
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,072
JUST LIKE SANGO SAID.

217
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:06,589
- MY VILLAGERS HAVE WORKED
AS SLAYERS FOR GENERATION
UPON GENERATION,

218
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:10,489
AND IT LIKELY HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MIDORIKO'S INFLUENCE.

219
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,889
OVER THE CENTURIES,

220
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:15,689
THE SACRED JEWEL PASSED
THROUGH THE HANDS OF
SEVERAL HUMANS AND DEMONS,

221
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,989
AND EVENTUALLY RETURNED HERE
IN MY GRANDFATHER'S TIME.

222
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:23,189
THE SHIKON JEWEL CAME OUT
OF A DEMON THAT HE HAD SLAIN.

223
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:26,322
BUT MY GRANDFATHER'S LIFE
AND THE LIVES OF MANY OTHERS

224
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:27,556
WERE SACRIFICED IN THE BATTLE.

225
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,522
THE SACRED SHIKON JEWEL
WAS REMOVED FROM THE DEMON,

226
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:32,956
BUT IT WAS HORRIBLY DEFILED,

227
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:36,556
AND THE SLAYERS DID NOT POSSESS
THE ABILITY TO HANDLE IT.

228
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,722
- SO THEY PUT IT
IN KIKYO'S CARE.

229
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:53,022
- KIKYO? WAS SHE THE PRIESTESS
WHO HAD THE ABILITY

230
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,522
TO PURIFY THE SACRED JEWEL?

231
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:59,556
- YES, BUT NARAKU FOUND OUT
ABOUT HER AND KILLED HER.

232
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,489
- WHEN DEMONS AND EVIL HUMANS
POSSESS IT,

233
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,056
THE JEWEL BECOMES DEFILED.

234
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,222
WHEN A PURE-HEARTED SOUL
POSSESSES IT,

235
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:09,789
THE JEWEL TRANSFORMS
AND BECOMES PURE.

236
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:11,056
- IT'S ALL VERY COMPLICATED.

237
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,856
IT'S A SACRED JEWEL
THAT POSSESSES THE POWER
FOR GOOD OR EVIL,

238
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,122
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
AN INSTANCE WHERE THE JEWEL
HAS BEEN USED FOR GOOD.

239
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,822
AND AS LONG AS NARAKU
IS AFTER IT,

240
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:22,122
THERE WILL ONLY BE
MORE AND MORE BLOODSHED.

241
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:27,656
SO WE MUST PUT AN END TO
THE SACRED JEWEL'S BAD KARMA.

242
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:30,422
INUYASHA, YOU MUST
RELINQUISH ALL THOUGHTS

243
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:34,156
OF USING THE SACRED SHIKON JEWEL
TO BECOME A GREAT DEMON.

244
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,756
- HA!

245
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:36,756
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

246
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,322
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON
DESTROYING NARAKU.

THANK YOU, KIRARA.

WE MADE GOOD TIME
COMING HERE.

251
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:35,356
MIDORIKO, I, TOO, FEEL
COMPASSION FOR HUMANS.

252
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,822
HOWEVER, WHEN ONE LIVES
AS LONG AS I HAVE AND SEES
A GREAT DEAL OF DEATH,

253
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,222
ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED
TO IT, HARDENED.

254
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,989
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

255
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:49,156
THIS AFTERNOON I WAS TOO EAGER
IN MY PURSUIT FOR THE TRUTH,

256
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,756
BUT SINCE YOU'VE ALLOWED ME
TO PASS THE BARRIER,

257
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,822
I TAKE IT YOU UNDERSTAND.

266
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:20,756
UNBELIEVABLE.

NUMEROUS SMALLER DEMONS MERGED
TOGETHER TO FORM HUGE ONES.

00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,422
OOH. I BET THAT'S
THE HOLE IN HER CHEST

270
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,589
WHERE THE SACRED JEWEL
WAS FORCED OUT.

THE LIGHT FROM THE SACRED JEWEL.

334
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,119
- I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT WOULD HAPPEN, YOU IDIOT.

335
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,986
TRYING TO SMOOTH OVER THE FACT
THAT YOU WERE NEARLY KILLED.

336
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,786
HUH. I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BOTHERED SAVING YOU.

337
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,486
- EXCUSE ME,
MASTER INUYASHA,

338
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,219
BUT I DON'T RECALL YOU
EVER ACTUALLY SAVING ME.

339
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:03,119
- USE YOUR LITTLE BRAIN.
DON'T BE SO DUMB.

340
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:05,019
- I'M NOT BEING DUMB.

341
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:08,186
THE PRIESTESS MIDORIKO
SAVED ME, NOT YOU.

342
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,719
- SAVE YOUR DREAMING
FOR SLEEP.

343
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,819
- [GROANING]

344
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:27,153
- [PURRING]

345
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,619
- OLD MYOGA'S BEEN DOING
SOME INVESTIGATION

346
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,153
INTO THE STORY
OF THE SACRED JEWEL,

347
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:47,186
AND HE FEELS THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE PRIESTESS
TO BATTLE SO MANY DEMONS,

348
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,353
NO MATTER HOW STRONG
HER SPIRITUAL POWER.

349
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:54,986
MAYBE MIDORIKO HAD
A BRILLIANT HELPER BY HER SIDE.

350
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,264
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

351
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:41,440
- THE DEMON SLAYER SANGO
HAS DECIDED TO JOIN US
IN OUR JOURNEY.

352
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:43,006
IT MIGHT BE MY IMAGINATION,

353
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,440
BUT MIROKU SEEMS
REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

354
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,540
WE COME TO A VILLAGE SUFFERING
FROM FREQUENT FLOODING,

355
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:50,740
AND FIND OUT THAT THERE'S
A WATER GOD DEMANDING

356
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:53,773
CHILD SACRIFICES IN RETURN
FOR PROTECTING THEM.

357
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,440
WHAT KIND OF GOD DOES THAT?

358
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:58,940
THIS MIGHT BE A DEMON
WITH A SHARD OF THE SACRED JEWEL

359
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,873
THAT'S DOING THIS.

360
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,840
NEXT TIME...

361
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:04,873
SEE YOU SOON!
