HE WASN'T BREATHING WHEN HE WAS

205
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,170

MAYBE THE NEST IS HIDDEN BEHIND

220
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,137

>> YOU ESCAPED FROM THE VILLAGE?

236

>> YES.

237
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,737
IT WAS SO FRIGHTENING.

238
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,504
WE NEVER KNEW WHEN THE DEMON

239
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,670

>> SO YOU SHOULD BE USED TO IT.

245
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,404
>> SO, WHAT NOW?

DO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO?

247
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,404
>> I BELIEVE SO.

248
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:27,470
WE PLAN TO APPEAL TO

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,070

250
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,437
IT'S OUT BEYOND THE PASS IN THE

FIND REFUGE THERE FROM

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,837

254
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,237
>> THE HOLY ONE?

255
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:38,004
>> IT THIS HOLY PERSON A PRIEST?

256
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,137
>> WELL, NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE.

257
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,870
WE'VE ONLY HEARD RUMORS ABOUT

258
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,970
THE PERSON.

259
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,604
>> NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN

260
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:45,904

261
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:46,837
>> WHAT?

262
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:47,970
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

263
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,670
>> THE FACE IS ALWAYS HIDDEN,

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,937
AND NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD

265
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,570
THE GREAT ONE'S VOICE.

BY THE 2 ATTENDANTS.

269
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,904
SO NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER

271
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,704
OR EVEN MALE OR FEMALE.

278
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,804

00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:13,904
>> YES.

>> COME ON, MIROKU.

>> HURRY?

284
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,404
WHY IS THAT?

285
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:20,737
