1
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,170
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

2
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:31,670
- I AM SOMEONE WHO,
LIKE YOURSELF,
DESPISES INUYASHA.

3
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:35,537
- I SHOULD KNOW THE NAME
OF THE ONE I MAKE A PACT WITH.

4
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,737
- MY APOLOGIES.

5
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,103
CALL ME NARAKU.

6
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,337
- WELL, I'M NOT AFRAID.

7
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,970
NARAKU'S A TERRIBLE DEMON.

8
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,270
WE'VE GOT TO DO WHAT WE CAN
TO DESTROY HIM.

9
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:51,303
- TRYING TO BUY TIME IN ORDER TO
SAVE THE LIVES OF YOUR FRIENDS.

10
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:57,003
[GRUNTING]
- AAH!

11
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,970
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

12
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:08,770
- I WAS AFRAID.

13
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,270
- HMM?
AH--

14
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:13,103
AAH!

15
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,803
- UHH!

16
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,637
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THAT FOR, INUYASHA?
UHH.

17
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,270
- LAY OFF!
- IF YOU SEAL UP THE WELL,

18
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,403
KAGOME WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO RETURN TO THIS ERA.

19
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:30,970
DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.
YOU NEED HER AS MUCH AS
THE REST OF US DO.

20
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:32,137
- I CAN'T HAVE HER
HANGING AROUND.

21
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,770
OTHERWISE, I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FIGHT THE WAY I WANT TO.

22
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,737
[GRUNTING]

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,737
WHOA.
[GROWLS]

24
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,237
LET'S GO, MIROKU.

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,470
- GO?
TO WHERE?

26
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:46,837
- HOW CAN YOU ASK SUCH A THING?

27
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,437
WE'LL FIND NARAKU AND CRUSH HIM
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

28
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,337
- LET'S BE GOING, SHIPPO.

29
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,070
- NOT ME.

30
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:55,970
I DESPISE INUYASHA.
[SNIFFLING]

31
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:57,237
- FINE WITH ME.
STAY HERE.

32
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,170
- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU FORCED
KAGOME TO LEAVE FOR HER SAFETY,

33
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:03,137
BUT DO YOU NOT THINK YOU
COULD HAVE ACHIEVED THE SAME END

34
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,703
THROUGH LESS AGGRESSIVE METHODS?

35
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,337
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
I DID WHAT I HAD TO!

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,370
- SO HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND WE
GO ABOUT SEARCHING FOR NARAKU?

37
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:12,037
YOU'VE COME ACROSS SOME
NEW LEADS, I SUPPOSE?

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,103
- NO, NOT EXACTLY.

39
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,870
- YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GO ON.
- QUIET!

40
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,370
- YOU SENT KAGOME BACK
OF YOUR OWN VOLITION.

41
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,737
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DIDN'T
TAKE OUT YOUR FRUSTRATION ON ME.

42
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,870
- WILL YOU GET OFF MY BACK?!

43
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:25,137
- OUR BEST HOPE NOW
LIES IN COMPOSING OURSELVES

44
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,703
AND THINKING THINGS THROUGH.

45
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,103
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!

46
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:29,203
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

47
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:33,170
I WANT TO CRUSH NARAKU
AS DESPERATELY AS YOU, INUYASHA.

48
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,637
50 YEARS AGO,
HE FORMED A WIND TUNNEL

49
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,803
ON THE HAND OF MY GRANDFATHER,

50
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:41,137
AND NOW THE CURSE HAS CARRIED
OVER THE GENERATIONS TO ME.

51
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,737
- MIROKU...

52
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:48,570
TAKING ACTION IS MORE MY STYLE,
NOT STRATEGIZING.

53
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,637
YOU THINK OF SOMETHING.

54
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,837
- WORK WITH ME, INUYASHA.

55
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,270
LET'S GO BACK TO WHEN
THIS ALL STARTED.

56
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:55,503
YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU FELL INTO
NARAKU'S TRAP 50 YEARS AGO

57
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:57,770
IN THIS VERY SAME VILLAGE,
CORRECT?

58
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:58,770
- YEAH.

59
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:01,903
- SO THEN YOU'VE MET NARAKU
IN PERSON, HAVE YOU?

60
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,703
- NOT EXACTLY.

61
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,370
- INUYASHA, YOU CAN BECOME
FULLY HUMAN

62
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,737
IF YOU USE THE SACRED JEWEL.

63
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,337
I SHALL BRING IT TO YOU TOMORROW
AT THE BREAK OF DAWN

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,237
TO THIS VERY PLACE.

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,503
- HUH?
UH?

66
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:21,337
- DIE, INUYASHA!

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,703
[GRUMBLES]

68
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:27,303
- I MAY HAVE MET HIM,
BUT IF I DID,
HE WAS DISGUISED AS KIKYO,

69
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,503
SO I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

70
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,803
- IT MAKES NO SENSE.

71
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,737
YOU DON'T KNOW NARAKU,

72
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,237
AND YET HE DESPISED YOU ENOUGH

73
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,870
TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS KIKYO

74
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,003
AND LEFT YOU FOR DEAD.

75
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:37,537
COULD YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING
IN THE PAST

76
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,670
TO CAUSE HIM TO BE EMBITTERED?

77
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,203
- HOW DO I KNOW?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

78
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,237
- HMM.

79
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,303
ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT
KIKYO WAS A PRIESTESS.

80
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:47,503
[SOBBING]

81
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,270
PERHAPS IT WAS SHE AND NOT YOU

82
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,770
THAT NARAKU HAD
A DEEP GRUDGE AGAINST,

83
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,970
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW HIM.

84
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:56,303
- YOU MEAN, IT'S KIKYO HE HATES?

85
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,937
- KAGOME!
- HUH?

86
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,003
- HI.
LONG TIME, NO SEE.

87
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,203
SO HOW'S YOUR RHEUMATISM?

88
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,037
- YEAH, AND YOUR
PLANTAR'S WARTS?

89
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,003
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

90
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,137
- YOU'RE WEARING CIVVIES.
UNIFORM IN THE WASH?

91
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,970
- MM-HMM.

92
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,903
I'M STILL TRYING
TO GET THE STAINS OUT.

93
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,570
THE FRONT WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.
[GASPS]

94
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:20,270
- NOW YOU'RE A HEMOPHILIAC?

95
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,103
- OH, YEAH.

96
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,637
I'LL BE 6 FEET UNDER
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

97
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:32,103
INUYASHA'S BLEEDING
HADN'T STOPPED.

98
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:35,003
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

99
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,037
BUT MAYBE HE HAD
OTHER THINGS ON HIS MIND

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,603
WHEN HE HELD ME IN HIS ARMS.

101
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,003
- I'LL HANG ON TO THE JEWEL.

102
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:46,637
- MAYBE HE HUGGED ME
TO GET THE SACRED SHIKON JEWEL.

103
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,737
THAT CREEP'S GONNA PAY!
- KAGOME.

104
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,803
TAKE IT INTO THE HALL
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

105
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:56,570
- IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
A GUY HUGGED ME LIKE THAT.

106
00:05:56,603 --> 00:06:00,137
I COULDN'T HELP IT
IF I GOT A BIT FLUSTERED.

107
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:01,803
HE'S A GUY, AFTER ALL, RIGHT?

108
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:06,203
I MEAN, HE'S HALF-DEMON,
BUT HE'S ALSO HALF-HUMAN.

109
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,503
[SIPS]

110
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:17,503
- THESE INJURIES ARE SERIOUS.

111
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,637
YE WON'T BE SEEING ANY BATTLES
FOR SOME TIME YET.

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,103
- THEY WON'T HOLD ME BACK
ANY LONGER THAN 2 OR 3 DAYS.

113
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:25,137
- NOT SURPRISING THAT YE WOULD
PUT ON A BRAVE FACE.

114
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,903
THERE.
- AAH!

115
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,170
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?!

116
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,570
- IF YE CAN MUSTER
THAT MUCH VIGOR,

117
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,070
THEN PERHAPS IT WON'T
TAKE TOO LONG TO RECOVER.

118
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,003
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YE.

119
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,870
I HAVE GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT
TO THIS,

120
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:37,237
EVER SINCE MY SISTER KIKYO

121
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,803
WAS REVIVED BY
THE EVIL WITCH URASUE.

122
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:41,670
- HMM.

123
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,203
- KIKYO HAD TOLD ME
IT WAS YE, INUYASHA,

124
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,870
WHO HAD STOLEN HER
SACRED SHIKON JEWEL.

125
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,670
DO YE NOT THINK IT STRANGE?

126
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,903
THE ONE WHO
DISGUISED HIMSELF AS YE

127
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,237
COULD HAVE MADE OFF
WITH THE JEWEL,

128
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,537
YET HE DID NOT.

129
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,470
HE TRICKED YE INTO
TERRORIZING THE VILLAGE

130
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,537
AND PURSUING THE SACRED JEWEL.

131
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,737
THEN KIKYO BOUND YE TO A TREE

132
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,137
WITH HER SACRED ARROW.

133
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,337
WAS THE TRICKSTER ATTEMPTING
TO PIT YE AGAINST EACH OTHER?

134
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,037
OR WAS IT KIKYO WHO WAS
THE TRUE OBJECT OF HIS MALICE?

135
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,103
WAS HE TRYING TO FILL HER HEART
WITH HATRED AND BITTERNESS?

136
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,170
- WHAT?

137
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,170
- IN KIKYO'S POSSESSION,

138
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:22,470
THE SACRED JEWEL OF THE 4 SOULS
REMAINED PURE,

139
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:25,370
BUT WHEN HER HEART
BECAME TAINTED AND HATEFUL,

140
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,037
THE JEWEL ALSO BECAME SULLIED,

141
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,303
AND IT FILLED
WITH A MALEVOLENT POWER.

142
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,103
AT THE TIME, THERE WAS
BUT A SINGLE PERSON

143
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:36,437
WHO WISHED FOR
SUCH A TERRIBLE OUTCOME.

144
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,270
SHALL I TAKE YE TO SEE THE PLACE

145
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:42,103
WHERE THIS MAN ONCE RESIDED?

146
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,803
KIKYO HAD COME
TO HER OWN DECISION.

147
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,503
- SHE WAS HARBORING A THIEF.

148
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:50,637
- BECAUSE SHE PITIED HIM.

149
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,303
HE WAS UNABLE
TO MOVE ON HIS OWN.

150
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,237
THIS IS THE CAVE.

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,070
THE MAN WENT BY
THE NAME OF ONIGUMO.

152
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,037
HE SUFFERED FROM TERRIBLE BURNS,

153
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,137
AND HIS FACE WAS
ESPECIALLY SCARRED.

154
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,203
I KNOW NOT IF
HE FELL FROM A CLIFF

155
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,203
OR HOW HE SUSTAINED
HIS INJURIES,

156
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:15,603
BUT BOTH LEGS WERE BROKEN.

157
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:20,303
YET DESPITE HIS SEVERE WOUNDS,
ONIGUMO CONTINUED TO ENDURE.

158
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:21,603
HE DID NOT MOVE AGAIN,

159
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:24,637
BUT HE RECOVERED HIS STRENGTH
ENOUGH TO CONVERSE,

160
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,970
AND, GRADUALLY,
HIS TRUE NATURE EMERGED.

161
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,337
- YOU...

162
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,470
YOUNG LASS.

163
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,203
- IT'S KAEDE.

164
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:38,603
- YES.

165
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:42,837
YOUR SISTER POSSESSES WHAT IS
KNOWN AS THE SHIKON JEWEL,
DOES SHE NOT?

166
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,037
- WHAT WOULD YE KNOW
ABOUT THE JEWEL?

167
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,470
- ALL WHO ARE WICKED
KNOW OF IT AND PURSUE IT.

168
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:50,537
- YE INCLUDED?

169
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,703
- I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE MORE EVIL THE JEWEL ABSORBS,

170
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:57,170
THE MORE EVIL IT BECOMES.
OUTSTANDING.

171
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,437
- MY SISTER HAS IT
UNDER HER CONTROL.

172
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,070
IT WON'T BE CORRUPTED.

173
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,503
- KIKYO'S MANNER
IS SELF-RIGHTEOUS.

174
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,570
FOR ONCE, I SHOULD
LIKE TO SEE HER

175
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:07,437
APPREHENSIVE AND FRIGHTENED.

176
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,203
THAT WOULD BRING ME
TRUE PLEASURE.

[CHUCKLING]

178
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,437
- I SEE.
ONIGUMO SAID THAT, DID HE?

179
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,237
- BIG SISTER, I DON'T CARE FOR
THAT MAN.

180
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,403
- BEAR HIM NO GRUDGE.

181
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,337
GIVE HIM PITY.

182
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,003
HIS INJURIES ARE GREAT.

183
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,603
HE SHALL NEVER MOVE
FROM THERE AGAIN.

- IT WAS NOT LONG AFTERWARD

185
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,737
THAT KIKYO BOUND YE TO A TREE
WITH HER ARROW.

186
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,403
SEVERAL DAYS LATER, WHEN I WENT
TO VISIT ONIGUMO AT THE CAVE,

187
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,337
I FOUND IT HAD BEEN BURNED OUT.

188
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,370
JUDGING BY WHAT I SAW,

189
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,437
THE FLAMES MUST HAVE
BEEN INTENSE,

190
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,370
FOR ONIGUMO WAS UNABLE TO MOVE

191
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,403
AND WOULD HAVE PERISHED
IN THE CAVE,

192
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,870
YET HIS BONES WERE
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

193
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,537
THEY, TOO, MUST HAVE
GONE UP IN FLAMES.

- WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,937
I'M LOOKING FOR NARAKU,
AND NARAKU IS A DEMON,

NOT A HUMAN,
SUCH AS THIS ONIGUMO PERSON.

ONIGUMO MAY HAVE BEEN EVIL,
BUT HE WAS HUMAN--

199

TO MISS HER ALREADY.

TO FIGHT THE WAY I WANT TO.

LEFT THIS FOUL SPIRIT BEHIND,

HERE WHERE EVEN
GRASS REFUSES TO GROW?
