- THEY DON'T DESERVE
YOUR SYMPATHY,

16
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:03,561
NOT AFTER THEY TREATED YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER SO POORLY.

17
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,394
DON'T WORRY.

- HUH?

21
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:16,227
- DO AS I SAY.
ANNIHILATE THE VILLAGE!

22
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,127
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

23
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,594

WHAT WAS THE HOLDUP, ANYWAY?

36
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,994
HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS
ARE THERE, DO YOU THINK?

37
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,861
- MORE THAN
WE COULD EVER COUNT.

38
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:03,827

A SHOT AT THEM.

- IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

46
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:25,327
AND WITH SHIORI AROUND,

47
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,161
I CAN'T EVEN USE MY WIND TUNNEL
ON THEM, EITHER.

48
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:32,161
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
CAN'T YOU MAKE A MOVE?

49
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,161
HA HA HA HA!

50
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:34,261
- DAMN IT ALL.

51
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,461
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY

52
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:38,394
THAT WE CAN GET SHIORI
OUT OF THE OLD DEMON'S GRIP.

53

- PLEASE THINK OF SOMETHING!
- HUH?

- ALL OUR LIVES DEPEND ON YOU.

55
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,461
- THE BAT DEMONS WILL SLAY
ALL OF US.

56
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,727
- IT'S THE VILLAGERS.

57
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,727
- HUH. YOU DON'T NEED
TO ASK ME FOR FAVORS.

58
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:51,361
I WAS GONNA
FINISH HIM OFF ANYWAY.

59
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:55,261
BUT FIRST I'VE GOT TO GET SHIORI
AWAY FROM HIM.

60
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,661
- YOU CAN'T.
THAT'S INSANE!

61
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:59,461
- AND BESIDES, THE GIRL
IS ON THE DEMON'S SIDE.

62
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:02,761
- HMM. YOU WANT ME
TO KILL HER, TOO, THEN?

63
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,527
- WELL,
THERE'S NOT MUCH CHOICE.

64
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,694
- AFTER ALL, SHE IS
THE CHILD OF A DEMON.

65
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:09,861
- HOW CRUEL.

66
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:13,027
SHIORI'S MOTHER SACRIFICED HER
FOR ALL THESE VILLAGERS HERE

67

FROM THE DEMON BATS.

I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE
INUYASHA DESPISES MORE THAN
PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

71
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:29,394
- YES, SEEING AS
HE'S BEEN TREATED BADLY
BY PEOPLE JUST LIKE THEM.

72
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,361
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, SHIORI?

73
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:36,061
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

74
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:36,994
- [SIGHS]

75
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,694
- YOU HEARD WHAT
THESE PEOPLE SAID ABOUT YOU.

76
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:43,627
GOING BACK TO THE VILLAGE
MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA.

77
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,394
DO YOU STILL
WANT TO GO BACK?

78
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:49,827
- THAT'S THE MAN
WHO WAS WITH MOMMY TODAY.

79
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,127

YOU WANT TO GO BACK HOME,

80
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,761
THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET THERE.

88
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:16,027
I SEE YOU'RE ALSO
A HALF DEMON.

89
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:19,327

IS OVERWHELMING.

ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE
WITH THIS?

92

- YOU'RE RECALLING
YOUR OWN SITUATION.

93
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:28,127
THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL
SUCH GREAT SYMPATHY FOR SHIORI.

94
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,294
- SHE'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

95
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:34,394
I JUST CAN'T STAND ROTTEN
OLD BATS LIKE YOU, IS ALL.

96
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,827
- HE'S A HALF DEMON?

97
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,594
THEN HE'S JUST LIKE ME.

98
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:41,461
- HMM.

99
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,427
SHIORI, MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

100
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:46,527
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE VILLAGE OR NOT?

DON'T YOU?

112
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:12,061
- HMM?

113
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:15,161
WHAT DO I DO?

114
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,727
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

115
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,127
- HOW DARE YOU CONFUSE
THE GIRL?

116
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:22,961
- SHIORI,
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF!

117

FINE WORK, MY GIRL.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

OF TAIGOKUMARU'S BODY
OUTSIDE THE BARRIER,

I HAVE NO USE
FOR THIS VILLAGE.

137
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:42,194
DESTROY EVERY ONE OF THEM.

- THIS VILLAGE
WAS SAFE FROM YOUR ATTACKS

143
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:53,894
WHILE YOUR SON TSUKYUMARU
WAS ALIVE.

144
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:57,127
THAT WAS BECAUSE
HE PROTECTED US.

145
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,694
YOUR SON WANTED SHIORI
AND I TO LIVE HAPPILY.

146
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,627

HA HA HA HA!

151
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:27,994
HOW LUDICROUS.

152
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:33,561
TSUKYUMARU WAS INDEED MY SON,
BUT HE WAS A FOOL,

153
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:36,761
AND FALLING IN LOVE
WITH A MORTAL

154
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,427
ONLY HASTENED HIS DEMISE.

155
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,627
- HUH? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

156
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,661
- JUST AS YOU STATED,

157
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:46,894
HE SAID HE WOULD PROTECT
THIS VILLAGE.

158
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:51,761
HE SAID THAT UNLESS
WE ABIDED BY HIS WISHES,

159
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:56,094
HE WOULD ABANDON HIS DUTY
AS GUARDIAN OF THE BARRIER

160
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,727
AND WOULD LEAVE THE TRIBE.

161
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:03,394
EVEN HIS HEART
HAD BEEN STOLEN BY THE MORTAL.

00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,427
TRY IF YOU DARE.

179
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,227
AS YOU CAN SEE,

180
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:52,061
SHIORI CAN'T ADJUST
THE SIZE OF THE BARRIER.

181
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,861
WHEN YOU SLAY ME,

182
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:58,827
YOU WILL ALSO TAKE
THE GIRL'S LIFE.

183
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:01,361
- [GROWLS]

184
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,027
DAMN YOU!

185
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,027
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN DO IT, INUYASHA?

186
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,727
- IS THERE SOME WAY
HE CAN GET THE OLD MAN

187
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,294
WITHOUT HURTING SHIORI?

188
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,627
SHE CAN'T CONTROL THE BARRIER.

189
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:14,494
EVEN IF INUYASHA
DOES BREAK THROUGH IT SOMEHOW,

190
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:18,527
HE'LL ACCIDENTALLY KILL HER
IN THE PROCESS.

191
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,227
- HA HA HA HA!

192
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,861
WHAT'S THE MATTER, FOOL?

193
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:25,594
ARE YOU GOING TO
KILL ME OR NOT?

194
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:29,961
- OH, SHUT UP, YOU OLD BAT.
I'M TIRED OF PLAYING GAMES.

195
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:30,927
- NO!

196
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,427
YOU MEAN UP TILL NOW,
YOU'VE GONE EASY ON ME?

197
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:39,027
IN THAT CASE, I DARE YOU
TO USE YOUR FULL POWER!

198
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:41,894
- GLADLY. BACKLASH WAVE!

199
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,527
UHH!

200
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:52,594
THERE'S A HOLE IN THE BARRIER
FROM THE OLD BAT'S ATTACK.

201
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:57,494
MY BACKLASH WAVE SHOULD GO
THROUGH IT AND REACH THE BAT.

202
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,194
- THE DEMONIC AURA
FROM HIS SWORD

203
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,627
IS TWISTING THROUGH MY OWN

204
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,661
AND HEADING
STRAIGHT TOWARD ME!

205
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:07,927
- GO THROUGH THAT HOLE
AND BLAST HIS HEAD OFF!

206
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,327
- [GASPING]

207
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,561
- THE BARRIER'S BENDING!

208
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,127
- DID IT WORK?

209
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,694
- [GASP] IT WENT
BACK TO NORMAL!

210
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,227
- AND TAIGOKUMARU
DIDN'T GET HURT!

211
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:39,027
- GRR! I WAS A SECOND
TOO LATE.

212
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,361
- HA HA HA HA!

213
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:44,727
FINE WORK, MY SWEET GIRL.
KEEP IT UP.

214
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:45,894
- GET OUT.

215
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,827
- HUH?

216
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:52,794
- I WILL AVENGE
MY FATHER'S DEATH.

217
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:57,727
- [SCREAMING]

218
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,561
HOW DARE YOU?

219
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,794
AND YOU A MERE HALF DEMON!

220
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:16,161
I NEVER EXPECTED
SHE POSSESSED SUCH GREAT POWER.

221
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:21,394
EVEN I WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL
THE BARRIER AS SHE DOES.

222
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,194
- SHE'S FALLING!
- SHIORI!

223
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:30,561
SHIORI!

224
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:31,594
- YAAH!

225
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:34,561
EVEN THOUGH MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS
A MERE HALF DEMON,

226
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:38,327
I WOULD NEVER ALLOW THE HUMANS
TO HAVE HER!

227
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,094
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

228
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,727
- HA HA HA HA!

229
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,761
- MOMMY, NO!

230
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:47,927
- TIME TO SAY
YOUR PRAYERS, OLD BAT!

231
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,561
- NOT AGAIN!

233
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:02,294
- GOT HIM!
- WITH THE BACKLASH WAVE!

- [INUYASHA PANTING]

235
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:11,994
- IT'S OVER.

236
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:13,694
- YES.

237
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:16,661
- OVER HERE, PEOPLE!

238
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:17,994
THERE.

239
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,994
- UHH!

240
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,361
- SHIORI!

241
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,861
- MOMMY!

[CRYING]

243
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:29,194
- SHIORI, I'M SO SORRY.

244
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:33,327
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

245
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:36,227
- I MISSED YOU.

246
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:37,127
- MM-HMM.

247
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:42,094
- WELL, GUYS,
WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN HERE.

248
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,227
LET'S GET GOING.

249

- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

250
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:46,361
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

251
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,694
- MYOGA, WHAT ARE
YOU STILL DOING HERE?

252
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,994
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN OUR REASON
FOR COMING HERE?

253
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:55,061
YOU NEED TO SLAY THE DEMON
WHO PROTECTED THE BARRIER

254
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,894
AND ALLOW TETSUSAIGA
TO SUCK ITS BLOOD!

255
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:58,994
SO MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

256
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,961
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
THE SWORD STRONGER
OR DON'T YOU?!

257

- [GASP]

258
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,794
YOU CAME HERE
TO KILL MY GIRL?

259
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:07,094
- YEAH, AT FIRST.

260
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:08,494
OH, DON'T WORRY.

261
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,527
I MAY BE A HALF DEMON,

262
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,527
BUT I'M NOT EVIL ENOUGH
TO KILL A LITTLE GIRL.

263
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:14,561
- ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE'S
SO SWEET AND INNOCENT.

264
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,161
- AND A HALF DEMON LIKE HIM.

265
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:17,661
- I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE

266
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:19,661
WHO CAN PUT UP
AN EVEN STRONGER BARRIER

267
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:20,727
AND KILL HIM INSTEAD.

268
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,794
- YOU'VE CHANGED,
MASTER INUYASHA.

269
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:24,661
YOU WEREN'T
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

270
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:26,694
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

271
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,761
- UH, I--WELL, UH...

272
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,594
- HE MEANS
THAT YOU'VE GROWN UP.

273
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,161
- HMM.

274
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,061
- HMM.

275
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:36,661
- WELL, WE BETTER BE
HEADING OFF NOW.

276
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:38,061
- FAREWELL.

277
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:39,261
- WAIT!

278
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,527
- HUH?

279
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,061
- SHIORI?

280
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:44,761
- HMM?

281
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,327
- TAKE THIS.

282
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,961
- HUH?
- HMM?

283
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,628
- YOU WANT ME
TO BREAK THE ORB?

284
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,795
- MM-HMM.
SMASH IT TO PIECES.

285
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,495
THIS BLOOD CROW CRYSTAL
IS A PRECIOUS HEIRLOOM

286
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:11,595
PASSED DOWN TO EACH GUARDIAN
OF THE DEMON BAT BARRIER.

287
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:16,728
THIS IS WHAT GIVES US
THE ABILITY TO PUT UP
A POWERFUL BARRIER,

288
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:21,095
AND IT STORES ALL THE POWER OF
EACH GENERATION OF GUARDIANS,

289
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:25,362
LIKE MY GRANDFATHER'S
AND MY FATHER'S.

290
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,262
SO IF YOU BREAK THE CRYSTAL,

291
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,528
I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
STRENGTHEN YOUR SWORD.

292
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:33,528
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T IT?

293
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:36,195
- WE COULDN'T HAVE ASKED
FOR ANYTHING BETTER.

294
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,662
SMASH THE THING,
MASTER INUYASHA!

295
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,362
- YEAH. GOOD IDEA.

296
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:44,928
THE SOONER WE GET RID OF
THAT EVIL THING, THE BETTER.

00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:47,695
- [GASP]
- HUH?

298
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:50,695

A DEMONIC AURA!

299
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,728
- LET GO OF IT!

300
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,028
AAH!

00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,128
HUH?

00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:59,095
- MOMMY, YOUR HANDS!

303
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,262
- [GASP]
- HUH?

304
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,162
- THE CRYSTAL
PUT UP A BARRIER.

305
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,328
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WOULDN'T BE SO EASY TO BREAK.

306
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:08,395
HUH.

307
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,662
THIS IS GETTING AMUSING.

308
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,462
BUT NOT FOR ME!

309
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:17,495

00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,828
- YOU OK?

313
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,728
- YEAH, SURE.

314
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:35,562
- I WOULD NEVER LET YOU GO
THAT EASILY, SHIORI.

315
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:38,462
- THAT'S GRANDFATHER'S VOICE.

316
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,795
- SIMPLY BREAKING
THE CRYSTAL

317
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:44,928
COULD NOT SEVER YOUR BOND
WITH THE DEMON BAT TRIBE,

318
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:48,762
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MOTHER
IS MORTAL.

AND ALL THE OTHERS IN HELL.

00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,462
WHAT!

327
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,728
AAH!

- CURSE YOU. AAH!

335
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,562
- THE BAT'S POWER
IS GETTING WEAKER.

336

MY SWORD!

WHOA. THE BLADE
IS TURNING RED!

347
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:10,062
- LOOK. THE TETSUSAIGA HAS
ABSORBED THE CRYSTAL'S POWER.

348
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:14,295
- MAKING INUYASHA'S SWORD
A GREAT DEAL STRONGER.

349
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,162
- SHIORI?

350
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:30,095
- THANKS FOR HELPING.

351
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,495
- HUH. I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE THANKING YOU
FOR SAVING ME.

352
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,528
YOU WEAKENED
THE OLD BAT'S POWER.

00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:39,162
- UH-UH. I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO DID THAT.

354
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:42,095
SOMEONE PUT HIS ARMS
AROUND US--

355
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:44,195
AROUND ME AND MOMMY.

356
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:47,162
HE WANTED TO PROTECT US.

357
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:50,195
- THAT WAS TSUKYUMARU.

358
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:53,162
THAT WAS YOUR FATHER,
SHIORI.

359
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,328
- HMM.

360
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,162
- HMM.

361
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,495
- I'M SURE YOUR FATHER
WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU

362
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:03,395
TO LIVE IN FREEDOM, TOO,
SHIORI.

363

- GOOD-BYE!

371
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:16,928
- INUYASHA WANTED
TO HELP THE GIRL.

372
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:20,862
I'M PRETTY SURE HE FORGOT
ALL ABOUT MAKING HIS SWORD
STRONGER,

373
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:24,462
AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE SPIRIT
OF SHIORI'S FATHER

374
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:27,328
HELPED HIM DEFEAT THE DEMON.

375
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,262
- I WONDER WHAT INUYASHA'S
THINKING ABOUT.

376
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:41,028
- INDEED.

377
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:42,695

FOR SOMEONE

378

SO MUCH TIME THINKING.

SHIORI AND HER MOTHER,
I MEAN.

383

- HA!

384
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:56,462
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THOSE TWO.

385
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,495
A GOOD HALF DEMON

386

EVERY LITTLE HARDSHIP.

387

HMM?

388
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:02,362
- YES, INDEED,

389
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,895
AND HERE WE HAVE
A FINE EXAMPLE

390
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,362
OF HOW A GOOD HALF DEMON
SHOULD BEHAVE.

391

DOESN'T BECOME AS WARPED.

WHAT ARE YOU JABBERING ABOUT?

396
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,528
- IT'S STRANGE
SEEING YOU LOST IN THOUGHT.

397
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:21,295
GROWLING SUITS YOU
A LOT BETTER THAN THINKING.

398
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,495
- HE'S RIGHT.

399
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,495
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THINGS YOU
DON'T HAVE SO MUCH PRACTICE IN.

400
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,795
- SHUT UP, MYOGA.
I'LL KILL YOU BOTH!

401
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,262

THAT'S ALL.

- STOP MAKING FUN OF ME!

404
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:38,162
- HEY, DON'T BLAME ME
IF YOU FALL OFF.

405
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:42,762
- INUYASHA DIDN'T SAY A WORD
WHEN HE LEFT SHIORI.

406
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,328
NOT EVEN A "DO YOUR BEST"
OR "GOOD LUCK,"

407
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:50,195
EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE A LOT
OF THINGS HE COULD HAVE SAID.

INUYASHA CHOSE SILENCE
TO ENCOURAGE HER,

409
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,562

- GOOD BOY!

416

- THEY'RE AFTER TWO THINGS:

00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:08,183
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS
AND MASTER INUYASHA'S HEAD.

- HUH! I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT THEM.
