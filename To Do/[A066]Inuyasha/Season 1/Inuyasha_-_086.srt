00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,748
>> THE DEMON!

381
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:08,248
>> IS IT UNCONSCIOUS?

382
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:14,148
>> HUH?

383
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,814
>> OH!

384
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,614
>> LOOK. MY LORD!

385
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:22,048
>> WHAT IS IT?

386
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,285
>> [ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

387
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,948
>> HUH.

388
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,081
>> DIE!

389
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,648
HUH?

390
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,248
STAY STILL, WOULD YOU?

391
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,114
>> HA HA HA HA!

392
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:44,814
>> WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

393
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,514
>> THE OCCUPANTS OF THIS CASTLE

394
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,748
BURIED MY HEAD UNDERGROUND.

395
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:49,648
THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD

396
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,214
WARD OFF EVIL.

397
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,881
THOSE FOOLISH HUMANS!

398
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:56,448
THAT'S WHY I CURSED THE PRINCESS

399
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,081
TO DEATH, THEN ASSUMED

400
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,314
HER APPEARANCE.

401
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,548
AND INTO HER CORPSE, I HID THE

402
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,781
SPIRITUAL POWERS THAT I STOLE

403
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:07,148
FROM THOSE I DEVOURED.

404
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,481
>> SO THE LORD WAS MERELY

405
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,814
GUARDING THE PRINCESS' BODY

406
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,211
AND ACTING AS A DECOY IN CASE

407
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,929
THE TRUTH WERE EVER LEARNED.

408
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:23,744
HUH.

409
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,544
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD FOR YOU,

410
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,544
DEMON HEAD.

411
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,777
YOU'RE MESSING WITH THE WRONG

412
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:28,911
PEOPLE THIS TIME.

413
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,811
>> HA HA HA HA!

414
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:31,844
DO YOU THINK SO?

415
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,044
>> I KNOW SO!

416
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:34,044
>> WAIT. STOP!

417
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:34,811
>> HMM?

418
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,911
>> MIROKU!

419
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,877
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT, MIROKU?

420
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,377
QUIT INTERFERING!

421
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,677
>> I HAVE TO ASK THE DEMON

422
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,611
SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S DESTROYED.

423
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,944
>> LIKE WHAT?

424
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,311
>> MONK?

425
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,111
>> TELL ME, WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE

426
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:48,744
YOUR ESCAPE SOONER?

427
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,277
YOU HAD EASILY OVERPOWERED ME.

428
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,111
WITH SUCH AN OBVIOUSLY POWERFUL

429
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,244
DEMONIC AURA, YOU COULD HAVE

430
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,177
ESCAPED ANYTIME YOU WANTED.

431
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,677
>> HA HA HA HA!

432
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,244
UNTIL NOW, I HAD TO BE CAREFUL

433
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,711
ABOUT APPEARING.

434
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,311
I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A STRONGER

435
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,377
PRESENCE--ONE THAT COULD TAKE

436
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,577
COMPLETE CONTROL OF ME.

437
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,044
>> [TOGETHER] HUH?

438
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,477
>> HUH?

439
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,611
A STRONGER PRESENCE?

440
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:14,844
>> CORRECT.

441
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,111
NARAKU AND THE DEMONIC AURA

442
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,544
HE CONTROLLED.

443
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,944
HOWEVER, NARAKU IS NO LONGER

444
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,277
AROUND, AND I DON'T HAVE TO

445
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:24,644
HIDE MYSELF IN THIS CASTLE

446
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:28,444
ANY LONGER!

447
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,111
>> IT'S ESCAPING!

448
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,577
>> HA HA HA HA!

449
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,311
NOW I CAN HAVE MY FILL OF MONKS

450
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,511
AND PRIESTESSES!

451
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,611

00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:04,111
>> [GRUNTS]

457
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,377
>> IT'S STILL ALIVE.

458
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,511
>> THE WIND SCAR DIDN'T WORK.

459
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,344
>> HA HA HA HA!

460
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,044
IT'S JUST A START.

461
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:13,044
I'LL RESTORE MY BODY

462
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:17,477
AND WREAK HAVOC ON THIS LAND!

463
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:18,677
WHAT?!

464
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,277
>> WIND TUNNEL!

IT'S ALL OVER, FINALLY.

468
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,977
>> ABOUT TIME.

469
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:38,134
WHAT A PAIN THAT WAS.

470
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,644
>> LOOK!

471
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:50,877

>> THE DEMON'S DESTROYED,

474
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,544
AND THE DEMONIC AURA OVER

475
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,642
THE CASTLE HAS DISAPPEARED.

476
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,811
>> SO IT'S ALL BECAUSE THIS

477
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:34,511
DEMON NAMED NARAKU HAS VANISHED?

478
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:35,977
AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMONS

479
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:37,511
IN THIS REGION ARE ACTING UP

480
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,144

481
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,944
>> IT SEEMS SO.

482
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:41,944
>> AH.

483
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,011
THEN I CAN SEE THAT I'LL BE

484
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,411
GETTING VERY BUSY.

485
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,744
BUSINESS WILL SOON BE BOOMING.

>> AND I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU.

499
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,377
>> HUH. WOULD YOU LISTEN TO HER?

500
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,744
>> I THINK THIS EXPERIENCE

501
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,377
HAS MADE HER OVERCONFIDENT.

506
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,611
EASY TO GET RID OF.

507
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,311
>> HUH? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

508
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,611
>> [TOGETHER] UH, NOPE.

509
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:21,811

510
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:22,944

534
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:08,048
