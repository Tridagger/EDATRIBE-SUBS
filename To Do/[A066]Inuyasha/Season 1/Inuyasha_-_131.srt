1
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:13,779
>> HUH?

2
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:14,440
AHH!

3
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,040
HELP!

4
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,706
UHH.

5
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:23,040
HUH?

6
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,873
AAH!

7
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:30,340
>> COME BACK.

8
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:46,006
THE OLD MAN RAN AWAY.

9
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,873
>> A VILLAGE OF DEMON WOMEN?

10
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,106
>> IT'S TRUE, I SAW THEM

11
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,840
WITH MY OWN EYES LAST NIGHT.

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
I WENT INTO THE FOREST TO GATHER

13
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,940
HERBS AND LOST MY WAY.

14
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,440
I WANDERED AROUND FOR A TIME

15
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,373
AND FINALLY ENDED UP NEAR

16
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:58,473
A MARSH.

17
00:02:58,473 --> 00:02:59,640
SOME WOMEN WERE ON A CLIFF

18
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,740
ABOVE, HOLDING SOMETHING.

19
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,606
THEY THREW IT INTO THE MARSH.

20
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,473
>> WHAT WAS IT?

21
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:05,473
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

22
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:06,540
>> I'M CERTAIN IT WAS

23
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,873
A HUMAN BODY,

24
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:11,706
A BODY THAT HAD BEEN SKINNED.

25
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:12,773
HUMANS WOULD NEVER DO SUCH

26
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:14,073
A TERRIBLE THING.

27
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:14,940
IT HAD TO BE THE WORK

28
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,006
OF DEMON WOMEN.

29
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,806
>> DEMON WOMEN?

30
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:20,306
THAT'S CREEPY.

31
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,340
>> IT'S RATHER STRANGE THAT

32
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,773
I DON'T FEEL ANY DEMONIC AURA

33
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,373
COMING FROM AROUND HERE.

34
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,440
>> KAGOME, DO YOU SENSE ANY

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,806
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS?

36
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,940
>> NOT AT ALL.

37
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,773
>> IF THERE AREN'T ANY

38
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:29,906
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,

39
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:30,806
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BOTHER

40
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,973
GOING TO SUCH A DANGEROUS PLACE.

41
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:34,073
>> THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

42
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:34,973
>> HUH?

43
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,340
>> WE HAVE TO CHECK EVERY AREA

44
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,306
THAT'S EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT

45
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,473
SUSPICIOUS.

46
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,473
>> SANGO IS RIGHT.

47
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:40,406
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE

48
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:41,606
SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE SACRED

49
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,740
JEWEL SHARDS BEFORE NARAKU DOES.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,273
>> RIGHT.

51
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:51,840
NARAKU IS NOTHING BUT EVIL.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,140
WE CAN'T LET HIM FINISH CREATING

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,540
AN IMPURE SHIKON JEWEL.

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,873
>> UHH.

55
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:08,940
>> HUH?

56
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,540
>> WOMAN, YOU MUST TELL ME,

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,640
IS THERE A VILLAGE NEARBY?

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,206
UHH, OHH...

59
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,906
>> OH, YOU POOR MAN,

60
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:21,073
YOU'RE INJURED.

61
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:21,873
>> I SEE.

62
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:22,773
YOU SUFFERED A DEFEAT

63
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,773
IN THE WAR.

64
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:25,373
>> YES.

65
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:28,340
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICE,

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,706
THIS IS A STRANGE VILLAGE,

67
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,473
INDEED.

68
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:32,273
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY STRANGE?

69
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,206
>> I HAD A FAIRLY GOOD

70
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,740
LOOK AROUND.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,373
THERE ARE ONLY WOMEN HERE.

72
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,106
>> THAT'S CORRECT, THERE ARE

73
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:41,540
NO MEN LIVING IN THIS VILLAGE.

74
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,373
THEY ALL DIED IN BATTLE.

75
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,840
>> OH, I SEE.

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,073
THAT'S A SHAME.

77
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:46,940
>> PLEASE HAVE SOME FOOD

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,740
AND DRINK.

79
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,206
I'M SURE YOU MUST BE FAMISHED.

80
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,173
>> HMM.

81
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:52,340
THEN WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN

82
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,240
AND THE ELDERLY?

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,773
AH?

84
00:04:58,773 --> 00:04:59,640
UHH.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,840
OHH.

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,206
>> WAKANA, TAKE THIS MAN

87
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,473
INTO THE SHRINE AND AWAIT

88
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:09,806
MY INSTRUCTIONS.

89
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:15,206
>> YES, RIGHT.

90
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:25,140
>> UHH?

91
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,073
WAKANA.

92
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,340
AH, WAKANA!

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,506
UHH!

94
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:45,240
>> AAH!

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,973
>> MMM.

96
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,840
UHH?

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,773
I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.

98
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,611
WHERE AM I?

99
00:05:53,611 --> 00:06:01,645
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SHRINE.

100
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,211
A PAINTING.

101
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:07,678
WHY IS IT GLOWING LIKE THIS?

102
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:09,311
>> [LAUGHTER]

103
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,345
>> [GASP]

104
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:13,011
>> [LAUGHTER]

105
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:17,611
>> UHH.

106
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:26,087
OHH, AAH!

107
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,720
>> IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,587
MIROKU?

109
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:29,254
>> I THINK I SENSE

110
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:32,087
A DEMONIC AURA JUST NOW.

111
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,420
>> YOU POSITIVE?

112
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,654
>> YES, IT WAS ONLY FOR

113
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:35,487
AN INSTANT,

114
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,920
BUT I DEFINITELY FELT IT.

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:48,187
>> UHH.

116
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,654
>> REMEMBER THAT OLD MAN

117
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:50,720
MENTIONED A MARSH WITH

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,887
DEMON WOMEN?

119
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,020
>> YES, THIS IS PROBABLY

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,487
THE PLACE.

121
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:58,354
>> LOOK OVER THERE, SOMETHING

122
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:02,587
IS FLOATING DOWNSTREAM!

123
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:07,720
>> YES, IT'S A MAN.

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,820
>> UHH...

125
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,254
>> IS HE DEAD?

126
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,554
>> UH-UH, HE'S ALIVE.

127
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,354
>> CAN'T YOU BE A BIT MORE

128
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,720
GENTLE WITH THE POOR MAN?

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,520
>> I GO BY THE NAME SHINOSUKE.

130
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,787
>> HERE, DRINK THIS UP.

131
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:27,287
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

132
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:28,287
>> HE'S GOTTA BE THE GLOOMIEST

133
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,754
GUY I'VE EVER MET.

134
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:30,654
>> COULD YOU NOT BE RUDE

135
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:31,854
FOR A CHANGE?

136
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,320
>> SHINOSUKE, YOU MENTIONED

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,387
EARLIER THAT YOU WERE LOOKING

138
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,987
FOR YOUR MISSING FIANCEE.

139
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:36,787
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU MEAN

140
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:37,820
BY THAT?

141
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,720
>> WELL, JUST 3 DAYS

142
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,354
BEFORE OUR WEDDING CEREMONY,

143
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,520
I WAS CALLED INTO BATTLE.

144
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,087
I WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.

145
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,854
A FULL 2 YEARS PASSED BEFORE

146
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,587
I WAS ABLE TO RETURN HOME.

147
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,187
NOT LONG AGO, I FINALLY RETURNED

148
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:51,454
TO MY HOMETOWN.

149
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,354
BUT THE VILLAGE HAD BEEN

150
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:54,787
BURNED TO THE GROUND.

151
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:56,420
AND MY FIANCE, WAKANA,

152
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,187
WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

153
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,620
I SEARCHED FOR HER, NOT KNOWING

154
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,387
IF SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE.

155
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:04,554
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD OF A VILLAGE

156
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,520
INHABITED SOLELY BY WOMEN.

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,820
>> OH, A VILLAGE OF ONLY WOMEN?

158
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,987
>> I HEARD THAT THE VILLAGE WAS

159
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,387
MADE UP OF WOMEN WHO'D LOST

160
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,354
THEIR HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN

161
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,154
TO WAR.

162
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,187
AND THAT THEY LIVED TOGETHER

163
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,420
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER

164
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,787
DURING THEIR TIME OF NEED.

165
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:19,254
>> HMM?

166
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,354
>> WHEN I HEARD, I THOUGHT THAT

167
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:23,220
PERHAPS WAKANA HAD GIVEN UP ON

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,954
MY RETURN AND HAD JOINED THEM.

169
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:26,954
>> DO YOU THINK THIS HAS

170
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:27,920
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT VILLAGE

171
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,220
OF DEMON WOMEN THE OLD MAN

172
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,420
TOLD US ABOUT?

173
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,954
>> YES, IT HAS TO BE MORE

174
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:33,520
THAN A COINCIDENCE.

175
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,887
>> I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

176
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,054
WE WILL ACCOMPANY YOU

177
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,320
TO THIS VILLAGE.

178
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,654
>> THANKS FOR OFFERING,

179
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,120
BUT HOW WOULD WE FIND IT?

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,954
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO.

181
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,520
THEY'VE COME LOOKING FOR US,

182
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,554
SO THAT SOLVES PART OF

183
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:50,054
THE PROBLEM.

184
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:51,154
>> YES, THIS IS INDEED A VILLAGE

185
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,354
FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST

186
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,520
THEIR LOVED ONES.

187
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,920
TOGETHER, WE MANAGE TO EEK OUT

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,520
A LIVING HERE.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,054
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAKANA

190
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:00,120
YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR

191
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,220
IS NOT WITH US.

192
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,854

381
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,454
SANGO.

382
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:05,520
>> WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

383
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
>> I JUST GET THAT FEELING,

384
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,087
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HIS

385
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,354
SPECIAL GIRL.

386
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:10,254
HE REALLY SEEMS TO CARE

387
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:11,954
ABOUT YOU A LOT.

388
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,487
>> YOU THINK SO?

389
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:14,520
>> YOU THINK SO, TOO,

390
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,754
DON'T YOU, KIRARA?

391
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,487
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, KIRARA?

392
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,454
>> OH, I SEE.

393
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:25,554
YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND IN BATTLE,

394
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,820
HOW SAD.

395
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,154
>> YES.

396
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,254
>> IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT

397
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,687
I COULD LEND YOU SOME COMFORT,

398
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,254
PLEASE, LET ME KNOW.

399
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,854
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,

400
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,887
THANK YOU.

401
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:40,820
>> HUH?

402
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,754
SANGO--

403
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:44,554
>> I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

404
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:45,720
>> COME ON, INUYASHA,

405
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,454
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO LET

406
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,920
MIROKU DO THAT?

407
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
>> WHATEVER.

408
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,020
IT'S WAY BETTER THAN HAVING

409
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,187
HIM HERE SIGHING ALL NIGHT

410
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:52,454
ABOUT THE WOMEN.

411
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,854
>> OH, SANGO'S GONNA BE FURIOUS!

412
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,687
>> WHY'S THAT?

413
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,187
>> UH, COME ON, ARE YOU REALLY

414
00:15:58,187 --> 00:15:59,720
THAT STUPID?

415
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,554
>> AAH!

416
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:01,220
>> LET ME GO!

417
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,087
>> EXCUSE ME.

418
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,420
>> HMM?

419
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,520
>> I'M GOING TO SLEEP, I'LL

420
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,254
BE LEAVING HERE AT FIRST LIGHT.

421
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:07,454
I MUST CONTINUE MY SEARCH

422
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:08,954
FOR WAKANA, AND I NEED TO MAKE

423
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:11,520
USE OF EVERY HOUR OF DAYLIGHT.

424
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,354
>> SURE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

425
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,554
>> I FEEL SO SORRY FOR SANGO.

426
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,920
SHE SHOULD SWALLOW HER PRIDE

427
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,887
AND STOP MIROKU.

428
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:29,287
I GUESS THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK.

429
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,054
HUH?

430
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:31,620
WHAT'S THE MATTER, KIRARA?

431
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,387
SANGO!

432
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:39,654
>> QUIET!

433
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:42,020
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

434
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,287
>> I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THEM.

435
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,220
>> HEY, WAIT!

436
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,387
I'LL GET INUYASHA AND MIROKU

437
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,520
TO COME ALONG, TOO.

438
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,420
THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSE BY,

439
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,787
SO IT'LL JUST TAKE A SEC--

440
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:51,854
>> NEVER MIND, THERE'S NO TIME

441
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,287
TO LOOK FOR THEM.

442
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,189
>> WAIT, SANGO.

443
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,773
>> HUH?

444
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,906
HMM...

445
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:20,940
WHAT'S THIS SCENT?

446
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,840
WATER?

447
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,940
NO...IT'S THE SMELL OF

448
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,406
SOMETHING ALIVE.

449
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:28,540
A WHOLE BUNCH OF SOMETHINGS.

450
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,440
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, INUYASHA?

451
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,940
>> HUH?

452
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,673
>> YOU TWO GO BACK TO SLEEP.

453
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:34,940
>> INUYASHA!

454
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,973
SANGO WENT OFF TO FOLLOW

455
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,273
THE WOMEN ON HER OWN.

456
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:40,273
>> SHE WHAT?

457
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:40,973
>> THE SMELL OF LIVING

458
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,240
WATER CREATURES?

459
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,206
>> YEAH.

460
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:44,373
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

461
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,406
BUT I JUST PICKED UP THE SCENT

462
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,840
ALL OF A SUDDEN, TOO.

463
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,673
JUST AS THE WOMEN STARTED

464
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:53,073
TO MOVE.

465
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:59,840
>> HUH...

466
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,740
>> SHINOSUKE.

467
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,773
>> WAKANA, WAKANA.

468
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:08,873
HOW I'VE SEARCHED FOR YOU,

469
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:12,040
MY DEAREST.

470
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,540
>> PLEASE, THIS WAY, MONK,

471
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
KEEP COMING.

472
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:22,506
>> INTERESTING.

473
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:23,906
INSIDE A SHRINE?

474
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,040
WE'LL BRING ON THE WRATH

475
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,873
OF THE DEITY KANNON FOR THIS.

476
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,873
HUH?

477
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:50,940
HMM...

478
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,006
>> THEY'RE GONE.

479
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,873
BUT WHERE DID ALL THOSE

480
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:58,973
WOMEN GO?

481
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,373
AAH!

482
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,773
>> [MOANING]

483
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,240
>> AAH!

484
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,940
UHH!

485
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,106
KIRARA!

486
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:17,873
KIRARA!

487
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,140
AAH!

488
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,773
>> SANGO!

489
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:30,440
SANGO!

490
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,040
WHERE COULD SHE BE?

491
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,206
>> I LOSE SANGO'S SCENT

492
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,940
RIGHT HERE.

493
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,006
SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE INTO

494
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,806
THE WATER FOR ALL WE KNOW.

495
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:39,173
HUH?

496
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,006
>> WHAT'S THAT?

497
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:40,673
>> OH, NO--

498
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:47,973
KAGOME, GET BACK!

499
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:50,240
>> THE VILLAGE WOMEN.

500
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,206
>> HEY, YOU, WHAT'D YOU DO

501
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,073
WITH SANGO?

502
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,073
IF YOU HID HER SOMEWHERE,

503
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,106
YOU BETTER TELL ME.

504
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,673
>> INUYASHA, WAIT!

505
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,440
THERE'S SOME KIND OF

506
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,606
DEMONIC VAPOR SEEPING OUT

507
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:01,740
OF THEIR MOUTHS.

508
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,640
>> OH!

509
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,606
>> THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED

510
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,306
BY SOMETHING OR SOMEONE.

511
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:06,206
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T HURT

512
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,740
THEM.

513
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,773
>> UHH!

514
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,440
>> HMM, SO THIS IS THE VILLAGE

515
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,473
OF DEMON WOMEN WE WERE

516
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:14,073
LOOKING FOR ALL ALONG.

517
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:18,740
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

518
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,106
>> PLEASE COMFORT ME, MONK,

519
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:25,306
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

520
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,806
>> DEMONIC AURA...

521
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:27,706
IS THERE SOMETHING INSIDE

522
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,473
HER BELLY?

523
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:30,673
AWW, GEEZ.

524
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:32,540
JUST MY LUCK, TOO.

525
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,040
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

526
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,406
>> I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

527
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,140
YOU'RE POSSESSED.

528
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,940
AND I THINK I KNOW

529
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,373
WHO'S BEHIND THIS.

530
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:43,373
TELL ME, WHAT KIND OF DEMON

531
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,306
ARE YOU?

532
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,006
>> HA HA HA...I WANT YOUR FLESH,

533
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:49,140
GIVE ME YOUR FLESH!

534
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,306
>> MY FLESH?

535
00:20:56,306 --> 00:21:00,673
>> SO, YOU'RE CONSCIOUS?

536
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,073
>> AAH!

537
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,840
WHERE AM I?

538
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,906
>> AND NOW WE SHALL MAKE YOU

539
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:17,906
ONE OF US.

540
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:19,873
>> WHAT IS THAT THING?

541
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:21,373
IT LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF EGG.

542
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:29,473
>> HERE, SWALLOW IT.

543
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:30,473
>> YOU MUST SWALLOW IT

544
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,273
WITHOUT BITING, AND VERY SOON

545
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,606
THE EGG WILL HATCH INSIDE

546
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,706
YOUR STOMACH AND YOU, TOO,

547
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:39,306
SHALL BECOME ONE OF US.

548
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,340
>> NO WAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA

549
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,773
MAKE ME SWALLOW THAT THING.

550
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,814
>> OHH...OHH.

551
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:32,420
>> TRAPPED IN A VILLAGE

552
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,287
OF DEMON WOMEN,

553
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,387
SANGO IS PUT UNDER A SPELL

554
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:36,287
AND ATTACKS MIROKU.

555
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,087
NO!

556
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,353
WHY DO YOU TWO HAVE TO FIGHT?

557
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,187
>> THEY MUST HAVE MADE HER

558
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:41,553
SWALLOW A DEMON.

559
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,720
I GUESS THIS WON'T BE AS EASY

560
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,753
AS DEALING WITH THE WOMEN

561
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:45,053
FROM THE VILLAGE.

562
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,453
SANGO, YOU'RE ONE PERSON I

563
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,153
WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE AN ENEMY.

564
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:49,320
BUT I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE

565
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
AND LET YOU KILL ME.

566
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,453
>> NEXT TIME,

567
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:53,520
MIROKU'S MOST DANGEROUS

568
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,553
