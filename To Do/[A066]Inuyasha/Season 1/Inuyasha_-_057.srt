THIS IS, KAGOME?

FOR AN IMPORTANT EXAM

BUT HE REEKS OF DEAD MEN.

176

SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TALK.

THE SOULS OF SAGES WITHOUT FAIL.

- HMM.

376
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,868
IT'S FAINT, BUT I DEFINITELY
SENSE THE PRESENCE

WICKED SAGE SHE IS.

A MAN RENOUNCES THE WORLD

AND BECOMES A HERMIT,

381
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:21,101
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REACH
THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF A SAGE.

382
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:26,001
- AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY
THESE MEN CANNOT BECOME SAGES.

- HMM.

384
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,068

TURNED DEAF EARS TO ME.

TALKING TO THEM.

- NO.

THAT WE CAN DO.

ALL RIGHT.

409
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:26,068
I MIGHT GET OUT OF HERE YET.

410
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,568
