00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:51,668
TRUTH RIGHT FROM THE VERY

566
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,102
BEGINNING?

567
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,702
YOU COULD HAVE.

568
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:55,735
>> WELL, I SUPPOSE I WAS TOO

569
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:58,035
NAIVE, SANGO.

570
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,702
I THOUGHT YOU'D KNOW WITHOUT MY

571
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,302
EXPLAINING IT.

572
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,802
>> OH, MIROKU...

573
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,735
>> NO, IT'S MY FAULT FOR BEING

574
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:08,202
SUCH A WOMANIZER ALL THE TIME.

575
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:09,768
I'M SORRY I HURT YOU SO BADLY,

576
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,868
SANGO.

577
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,902
HONESTLY.

578
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,402
>> NEVER MIND.

579
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:18,235
BESIDES, WHEN YOU CAME TO MY

580
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,235
RESCUE...

581
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,002
I DON'T KNOW, I WAS JUST SO

582
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:24,002
GLAD.

583
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,002
>> WILL YOU FORGIVE ME THEN,

584
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:26,835
SANGO?

585
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,335
>> I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU THAT.

586
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,302
>> AND THAT'S IT?

587
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,268
>> YOU KNOW, SANGO REALLY DOES

588
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:33,835
HAVE A BIG HEART.

589
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,568
>> IN SOME WAYS, IT'S BIGGER

590
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:38,935
THAN YOURS, KAGOME.

591
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,335
>> HUH?

592
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,602
HMM.

593
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:48,635
YOU 2 MAKE A FINE MATCH.

594
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:52,035
>> HMM.

595
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:53,268
>> I WAS JUST THINKING, IF HE

596
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:54,268
HAD ONLY TOLD HER THE TRUTH

597
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,402
SOONER, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE

598
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:58,235
HAPPENED.

599
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,535
>> JUST A SECOND.

600
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,668
HEY, MIROKU.

601
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:01,768
MAYBE IT JUST TOOK YOU A LONG

602
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,802
TIME TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS WHAT.

603
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,935
>> THAT'S A BULL'S EYE.

604
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,302
>> IS THAT TRUE?

605
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,135
WELL?

606
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,902
IS THAT IT?

607
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:11,835
>> I DON'T KNOW.

608
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,473
IT JUST HAPPENED SO LONG AGO.

609
00:22:20,153 --> 00:23:57,067
[MUSIC]

610
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,767
>> WHAT'S WRONG, JACQUES?

611
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,200
>> RENNE'S...BY A DEMON!

612
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,133
>> A GROUP OF MONKS WHO

613
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,333
SPECIALIZE IN SLAYING DEMONS

614
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,833
WENT TO SAVE HER, BUT...

615
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,167
>> THOSE MONKS...

616
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,300
THINGS COULD GET UGLY IF THEY

617
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,800
COME ACROSS SESSHOMARU.

618
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,733
>> IF THE HUMANS TRY THEIR

619
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,300
HALF-BAKED SPELLS, SESSHOMARU

620
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,800
WILL TEAR THEM APART.

621
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,367
>> I'M NOT SCARED.

622
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,700
>> NEXT TIME, "FOREVER WITH LORD

623
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,967
SESSHOMARU."

624
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:20,033
>> LORD SESSHOMARU, PLEASE

625
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:22,033
DON'T FORGET ME, EVEN IF I DIE.
