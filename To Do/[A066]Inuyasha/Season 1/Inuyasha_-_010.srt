00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,054
- HMMM, TRYING TO
HASTEN YOUR FATE?

176
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,554
- I WON'T LET GO,
NOT IF IT KILLS ME.

177
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,521
- RELEASE ME AT ONCE,
YOU LITTLE PEST.

178
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:17,787
- GRRRR...

179
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,654
- RELEASE ME IMMEDIATELY,
FOX TYKE.

180
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:21,754
REMOVE THOSE BABY TEETH
FROM ME NOW,

181
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,654
OR I'LL HAVE TO RETHINK
THE ORDER OF MY VICTIMS.

182
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,354
- UH!

183
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:27,121
- MANTAN, CAREFUL YOU DON'T SOIL

184
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:28,887
THAT PRECIOUS
FOX STOLE OF YOURS.

185
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,321
WOULDN'T WANT TO
SEE IT SOAKED WITH BLOOD.

186
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,254
- THANKS FOR THE TIP, HITEN.

187
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,887
- GRRRRRR...

188
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,954
- HEY, I'LL BE THE FIRST TO
ADMIT I'VE RACKED UP MY SHARE
OF BAD KARMA IN THE PAST,

189
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:42,921
BUT I'M INNOCENT
COMPARED TO YOU TWO SWINE.

190
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:46,054
BLADES OF BLOOD!

191
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,421
- FINALLY, THIS IS
STARTING TO GET INTERESTING.

192
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:54,887
- YAAHH!

193
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,521
- NICE THROW IF
YOU'RE AIMING AT THE ROCKS.

194
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,821
- DID I GET HIM?

195
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:01,087
- HUH?

196
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:03,187
- OOOOHHHHH!

197
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:04,287
OOMPFF.

198
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,554
- MANTAN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

199
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:08,921
- OH, SHIPPO.

200
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,321
THE TETSUSAIGA.

201
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:13,021
I'VE GOT TO
BRING IT TO INUYASHA.

202
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,221
- DON'T LEAVE MY FATHER.

203
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,621
- HUH? YES, OF COURSE.

204
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:18,487
BUT I CAN'T CARRY
THE SWORD AND YOUR FATHER BACK.

205
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,454
- MANTAN!

206
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,787
- KAGOME, GET OUT OF THERE
BEFORE HE KILLS YOU!

207
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:24,887
- AAAH!

208
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:26,987
UGH. OHHH...

209
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,954
- UNH! MANTAN.

210
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:32,121
- OHHH, HITEN, THEY'RE GONE.

211
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:35,021
EVERY LAST STRAND
OF MY HAIR HAS FALLEN,

212
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,887
AND WITH THEM MY HOPES
OF BECOMING HAPPY.

213
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,421
- DON'T BE SO FOOLISH, MANTAN.

214
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:41,121
WE CAN MAKE IT GROW BACK.

215
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:43,354
- IT'S NO USE KIDDING MYSELF.

216
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,087
I'LL NEVER HAVE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

217
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,721
YOU WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO INHERIT FATHER'S LOOKS,

218
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,221
BUT FATE SMOTE ME.

219
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:54,387
IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE
LOT IN LIFE TO RESEMBLE
OUR HOMELY MOTHER,

220
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,287
WITH HER RECEDING HAIRLINE AND
DECIDEDLY REPTILIAN COUNTENANCE.

221
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,521
HOW I LONGED FOR
THE LOOKS OF YOU AND FATHER.

222
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,221
- BEAUTY ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE.

223
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,087
I WOULDN'T CHANGE
A THING ABOUT YOU, BROTHER.

224
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,921
I LOVE EVERY LAST
BALD INCH OF YOU.

225
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:10,521
- THANK YOU,
EVEN IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

226
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,387
SAY A PRAYER
FOR ME WHEN I'M GONE.

227
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,221
PRAY THAT I'LL BE REBORN
AS A FUZZY CATERPILLAR,

228
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,887
COVERED IN HAIR
FROM HEAD TO FURRY TOE.

229
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:21,587
NO, BROTHER,
WHO AM I TRYING TO KID?

230
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,287
I'D RATHER BE REBORN BALD AGAIN.

231
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:27,354
I'D MAKE THAT SACRIFICE IF I
COULD BE REBORN AS YOUR BROTHER.

232
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,921
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE, HITEN?

233
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,587
- MANTAN!

234
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,421
PLEASE DON'T DIE!

235
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:36,121
- KAGOME!

236
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:36,954
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

237
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,554
- I'M OK,
BUT I DROPPED THE TETSUSAIGA

238
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,187
WHEN WE WERE HIT
BY THE LIGHTNING ATTACK.

239
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,587
- NO PROBLEM.
LOTS MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

240
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,821
- I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
I'M SORRY I MESSED UP.

241
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:48,587
- DAMN RIGHT YOU MESSED UP.
YOU MESSED UP BIG TIME!

242
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,654
BUT SWORD OR NO SWORD,
YOU'RE WRONG IF YOU THINK

243
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:54,054
I'M GONNA LET HITEN
GET THE BETTER OF ME!

244
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,954
- MANTAN...

245
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,554
YOU WRETCHES!

246
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,487
YOU SLAUGHTERED MY BROTHER!

247
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,554
MY DEAR MANTAN.

248
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:04,621
[SOBBING]

249
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:08,787
REST ASSURED THAT WE SHALL
ALWAYS BE AS ONE, BROTHER.

250
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,787
AAAUUGH!

251
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,521
- HITEN'S A CANNIBAL?

252
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,721
- WAIT. THINGS ARE NOT
ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR.

253
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,387
HITEN BIT INTO
HIS BROTHER'S HEAD

254
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,221
TO FUSE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS
WITH HIS OWN BODY.

255
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:27,621
MASTER, YOU MUST BE EVEN
MORE CAREFUL THAN BEFORE,

256
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:31,121
FOR HITEN NOW HOLDS
THE POWER OF 5 JEWEL SHARDS.

257
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:32,487
- GEE, YOU THINK?

258
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:35,321
HEY, YOU WANT TO TRY
EXPLAINING YOUR NOTICEABLE
ABSENCE UP UNTIL NOW?

259
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,554
- [COUGHING]

260
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,054
- CONVENIENT HOW YOU DISAPPEARED
JUST WHEN THE GOING GOT ROUGH.

261
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:40,921
- YOU CATCH THAT?
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL SARCASM.

262
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:45,254
AS IN, IT WASN'T CONVENIENT
THAT YOU BAILED ON US WHEN
WE NEEDED YOU MOST.

263
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:46,354
- I DIDN'T BAIL ON YOU.

264
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,621
I HAD TO MAKE AN ITCH
THAT NEEDED SCRATCHING.

265
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:51,821
- LOOK OUT!

266
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:59,154
- HOW DARE YOU
STRIKE DOWN MY BELOVED BROTHER?

267
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:04,521
I SHALL NOT STOP
TILL I'VE RETURNED THE DEED.

268
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:07,721
- HIS THUNDER PIKE
IS EVEN STRONGER THAN BEFORE.

269
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,754
HE HAS THE POWER OF
5 JEWEL SHARDS NOW,

270
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,121
AND I HAVE A REAL
FIGHT ON MY HANDS.

271
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:15,754
KAGOME, TAKE SHIPPO
AND GET AS FAR AWAY FROM
HERE AS YOU'RE ABLE TO.

272
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,221
- WE CAN'T LEAVE YOU.

273
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,887
- DO IT NOW.

274
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,821
HMM.

275
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:32,221
- I SHALL AVENGE MY BROTHER!

276
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,787
PREPARE TO DIE!

277
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,221
- I CAN'T AVOID IT!

278
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,554
- MY LORD,
USE THE SHEATH OF TETSUSAIGA.

279
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:44,754
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

280
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,987
- USE THE SHEATH, AND IT WILL
STAVE OFF THE LIGHTNING BOLT.

281
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:48,787
QUICKLY!

282
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,054
- YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT.

283
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,787
[GRUNTING]

284
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,754
- WHAT?

285
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:15,844
- HUH?

286
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,511
WOW, IT REALLY WORKED.

287
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:18,677
- JUST AS I PRESUMED.

288
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:21,844
THE SHEATH KEEPS THE ALMIGHTY
TETSUSAIGA'S POWER IN CHECK,

289
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:25,244
SO NATURALLY IT CAN REPEL
A MERE LIGHTNING BOLT.

290
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:28,477
WHEW! GLAD MY HUNCH
WAS CORRECT ON THAT ONE.

291
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,877
- YOU SENT ME INTO BATTLE
ARMED WITH A MERE HUNCH?

292
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,544
- I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT
A MERE HUNCH, MY LORD--

293
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,777
MORE LIKE
A HIGHLY EDUCATED GUESS.

294
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,077
BUT LET'S GET BACK TO
THE MORE PERTINENT MATTER

295
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,511
OF ESCAPING WITH OUR LIVES.

296
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,477
- NO CHANCE.

297
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,544
I'M GONNA USE THIS BABY
TO DEFEAT THAT DEMON.

298
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,511
- HAAAH-YAHHH!

299
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:50,344
- IF I CAN BLAST THROUGH
THE CORE, I CAN DEFEAT HIM.

300
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:52,944
HUH?

301
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:53,777
AAAAAHHHH!

302
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,911
- SPLENDID PLAN--
IN THEORY, THAT IS.

303
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:59,277
- UGH!

304
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:02,244
- INUYASHA!

305
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,377
- HUH?

306
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,477
FATHER'S FUR.

307
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,777
- SHIPPO, YOU ALL RIGHT?

308
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:08,577
- KAGOME?

309
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,177
WHAT HAPPENED TO MANTAN?

310
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,377
- INUYASHA BROUGHT HIM DOWN.

311
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,411
BUT NOW HITEN'S
THIRSTY FOR REVENGE.

312
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:16,144
- HAAAA-AHH!

313
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,277
- INUYASHA'S GETTING TIRED.

314
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:27,411
- HITEN'S HARD TO MATCH
WITH THOSE FLYING WHEELS.

315
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,644
- HITEN USES WHEELS TO FLY.

316
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,844
THAT'S IT!

317
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:37,011
- THOSE EXTRA JEWEL SHARDS
HAVE INCREASED HIS SPEED.

318
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:38,744
- WHAT ARE YOU
SEARCHING FOR, KAGOME?

319
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,744
- OH, RIGHT, WHAT GOOD'S
AN ARROW WITHOUT A BOW?

320
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:42,777
- COMING RIGHT UP.

321
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:46,844
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
JUST LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.

322
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:51,377
- HE'S GONNA
TRANSFORM INTO A BOW.

323
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,811
I WANTED A BOW, NOT A SNAIL.

324
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:56,111
- I AM A BOW.

325
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,544
- HAAAA-YAAH!

326
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,311
- OOHHH!

327
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,277
- WHAT'S TAKING YOU, KAGOME?

328
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,411
HURRY UP AND FIRE.

329
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:06,744
- I ONLY HAVE ONE ARROW LEFT,

330
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,011
AND I'M NOT EXACTLY
A MARKSMAN, YOU KNOW.

331
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:10,711
- YOU WILL BE
WITH ME AS YOUR GUIDE.

332
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:14,811
- HUH? THANKS, SHIPPO.
LET'S GET THAT SUCKER.

333
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,577
YEAH!
THE GIRL CAN SHOOT.

334
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,444
- HE'S MINE.

335
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:27,444
- YOUR CONFIDENCE IS ANNOYING.

336
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:28,544
- WHAT'S HE THINKING?

337
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:29,977
MASTER INUYASHA MAY BE STRONG,

338
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:33,977
BUT TAKING HOLD OF THE THUNDER
PIKE IS FOOLHARDY INDEED.

339
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,311
OH, MY!

340
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,344
- WAIT A MINUTE, MYOGA.

341
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,144
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
FIGHTING WITH INUYASHA.

342
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,911
- LET GO OF THE PIKE, MY LORD.

343
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:44,177
- I DON'T NEED
THIS THING ANYMORE.

344
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:47,144
- DON'T LET GO OF
THE SHEATH, FOOL.

345
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:49,444
IT'S YOUR ONLY CHANCE
TO TRIUMPH.

346
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,944
- I'LL DO THINGS MY WAY.

347
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,611
NOT BAD FOR A HALF-BREED,
HEY, HITEN?

348
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,744
- WELL, THAT'S
ONE WAY OF DEFEATING HIM.

349
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,844
- WHATEVER
WORKS FOR YOU, I SAY.

350
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:06,577
- HEY-HO FOR MASTER INUYASHA.

351
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,844
HE SLUGGED HIM
RIGHT IN THE KISSER!

352
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:10,311
DOWNED HIM IN THE FINAL ROUND
WITH THE OLD RIGHT HOOK!

353
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:11,444
YEAH!

354
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,744

A FOOL A FEW MINUTES AGO?

I'VE NEVER BEEN
STRUCK IN THE FACE BEFORE,

357
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,477
AND I REFUSE TO
ALLOW IT AGAIN.

358
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:29,044
- UH-OH. THIS IS BAD.

359
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:31,177
- HE'S GONNA EXPLODE.

360
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:37,711
- I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL,
YOU SWINE!

361
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,611
- THE SHEATH'S
STARTING TO CRACK!

MORE THAN ANY OTHER, HALF-BREED.

364
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:56,611

00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:59,911
BUT IF THE TETSUSAIGA SHEATH
SHOULD SHATTER...

366

I'VE GOTTA GET THE TETSUSAIGA
TO INUYASHA SOMEHOW.

368

IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
GET BACK HERE.

- OH, NO. HITEN MUST HAVE
GAINED MANTAN'S ABILITIES

374
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,877
AS WELL AS HIS JEWEL SHARDS.

375

MY BREATH ON HER.

- WHAT A SHAME.
IT SEEMS THAT SHE AND
THAT FOX CHILD ARE DEAD.

381

382
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:42,311
YOU'VE SLAUGHTERED MY FRIENDS!

ANY REAL DEMON I'VE
EVER ENCOUNTERED.

YOU EVER CROSSED ME.

GONE TO YOUR HEAD

YOUR BELOVED WOMAN.

RISKING A BATTLE OVER?

FIGHTING TO THE DEATH FOR.

I WAS DEFEATED.

- LORD INUYASHA,

403

- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.

IF ONLY I'D TAKEN CARE OF
HITEN SOONER,

405
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:59,777
I COULD HAVE SAVED
KAGOME AND SHIPPO.

THE BATTLE HARD AND WELL.

ABLE TO AVENGE MY FATHER.

THE "DON'T LEAVE ME" STUFF?

00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:47,677
- FATHER? YOU MUST HAVE
USED FOXFIRE TO PROTECT
US DURING THE BATTLE.

423

- I SHOULD CLARIFY.

424
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:51,444
WHEN I SAID SOULS,
I REALLY MEANT TO SAY FOXFIRE

IS ASHAMED THAT HE BELIEVED
YOU WERE DEAD,

439
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:27,844
AND IN A MOMENT OF GRIEF
MAY HAVE REVEALED MORE THAN

ALONG WITH US FOR, SHIPPO?

YOU NEED ME, AND YOU KNOW IT.

HURTING ANYONE.
