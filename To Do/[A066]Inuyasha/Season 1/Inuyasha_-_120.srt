377
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,225
I WANTED TO DIE AN ADMIRABLE

378
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,992
DEATH AS A SAINT, BUT IT WAS NOT

379
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,025
TO BE.

380
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,025
I DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT MY OWN

381
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:12,425
WEAKNESS.

382
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,325
SO I CRIED IN DESPAIR, ALL FOR

383
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:20,392
THE WEAKNESS OF MY OWN HEART.

384
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,258
>> HOW PAINFUL IT MUST HAVE

385
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,592
BEEN.

386
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:27,325
>> YES. IT WAS PAINFUL.

387
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,592
>> YOU HAVE DONE MORE THAN

388
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:31,158
ENOUGH GOOD IN THIS WORLD, SO

389
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:34,792

392
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,858
>> YES. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

393
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:44,899
>> OHH...

394
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,592
