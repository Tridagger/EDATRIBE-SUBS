SHE TRIED TO SLAY ME.

346
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,764
I MANAGED TO DODGE THE ARROWS

347
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:10,530
AND WENT TO THE VILLAGE
TO STEAL THE JEWEL.

348
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:15,030
AND THAT'S WHEN
SHE BOUND ME TO THE TREE.

349
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,930
[GROANING]

350
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,997
- WHY DID YOU
BETRAY ME, INUYASHA?

351
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:33,130
- HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?

352
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,897
AAH!

353
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,497
HOW DID IT GO SO WRONG?

354
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,030
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE THIS!

355
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,497
KIKYO!

356
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,480
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

357
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,994
- APPARENTLY, KIKYO DIES AGAIN,
BURYING HER HATRED OF INUYASHA,

358
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,660
AND OUR JOURNEY IN SEARCH
OF THE JEWEL SHARDS CONTINUES,

359
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:49,260
BUT NOT WITHOUT MORE
DEMONS TRYING TO STEAL
THE ONES WE ALREADY HAVE.

360
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,794
WAIT.
THIS GUY ISN'T A DEMON.

361
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,060
WELL, WHATEVER HE IS,

362
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:54,427
HE SURE HAS A LOT OF POWER
IN HIS RIGHT HAND.

363
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,227
IS HE AN ALLY, A FOE,
OR JUST A DIRTY LECHER?

364
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,058
NEXT TIME, "MYSTICAL HAND
OF THE AMOROUS MONK, MIROKU."

365
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,094
SEE YOU SOON!
