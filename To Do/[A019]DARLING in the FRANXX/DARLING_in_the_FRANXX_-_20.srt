175
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,333
What's that?

176
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,791
[HACHI]
I'll call for reinforcements.

177
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,041
[FRANXX]
They won't get here in time.

178
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,583
Prioritize the mission,
Strelizia!

179
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,791
Get going!

180
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,750
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

181
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,208
[ZERO TWO]
Uh, right!

182
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,541
Doctor, we should leave too.

183
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,208
[FRANXX grunts]

184
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:03,708
[001] Humans... You will not
do as you please with our child.

185
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,416
[FRANXX laughs]

186
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,166
[FRANXX] I see! So it is you,
Code Zero-Zero-One!

187
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,500
Princess of the Klaxosaurs!

188
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,583
[FRANXX]
It's been far too long.

189
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,791
Are you here to take
back Star Entity?

190
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:26,000
But, you can't operate it.

191
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,166
You don't have a partner.

192
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,333
You are the last
surviving klaxo-sapiens.

193
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:39,375
So, I'll operate it. Ever since
the day I first met you,

194
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,333
that's all I've dreamed of!

195
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,833
That's what all my
research has been for!

196
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,708
Princess! Sit there and watch--!

197
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,416
[FRANXX grunts]

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,583
[001]
You sinful man.

199
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,583
Doctor!

200
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,125
[001]
I...

201
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,666
[FRANXX groans]

202
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,541
[001]
...need no partner.

203
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,875
But, since I have the chance,

204
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,458
I shall use the one
you have provided.

205
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,791
[FRANXX]
What?

206
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,333
[HIRO]
No good. It's not gonna budge.

207
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,500
[ZERO TWO]
Darling.

208
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,333
This is Strelizia.

209
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,750
We've reached the entry point,
but the door won't open.

210
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,916
--[roaring]
--[ZERO TWO gasps]

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They caught up?
We'll have to fight here!

212
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,375
Zero Two?

213
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,666
The controls.

214
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,958
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

215
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,791
[grunts]

216
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,375
[ZERO TWO gasps]

217
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,625
[HIRO]
What's going on?

218
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,000
[gasps]

219
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,708
[ZERO TWO groans]

220
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,250
Zero Two!

221
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,500
[001]
Ah, the fake the humans created.

222
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,333
A duplicate that does not
realize it is being used

223
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:10,750
by the invaders. You are
not fit to pilot our child.

224
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,666
[ZERP TWO]
What do you mean fake?

225
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,166
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,875
Zero Two! Zero Two!

227
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,916
[001]
Hm...

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,500
[ZERO TWO grunts]

229
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,208
[001]
I shall take him.

230
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,458
[HIRO gasps]

231
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,416
[gasps] Darling!

232
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,666
[grunts]

233
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,250
[HIRO grunts]

234
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,333
[001]
A curious taste.

235
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,750
You really must be
no ordinary human.

236
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,208
--Whaddayu--
--[001] Surrender yourself

237
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
to me.

238
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:58,541
Your body. Your soul.
I shall devour all that you are.

239
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,958
[HIRO gasps]
No...

240
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,500
[FEMALE OPERATOR A] Strelizia
has entered Star Entity.

241
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,541
[MALE SAGE C]
The worst has come to pass!

242
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,666
All the work put into Code Zero-
Zero-Two will have been in vain!

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,083
[MALE SAGE E]
Should the klaxosaur princess

244
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,958
connect to Star Entity,
our defeat is all but assured!

245
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,500
[APE VICE CHIEF] Worry not.
We've already taken measures.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,916
[HACHI]
What is this?

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,083
She's connected...
with Strelizia?

248
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,000
[FRANXX gasps]

249
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,708
Doctor!

250
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:49,041
[FRANXX] I wasn't expecting
her to link with a human.

251
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:53,250
At this rate, she will
devour once again!

252
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:59,291
Tell me why. And how can you
be able to pilot Strelizia?

253
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,333
[001]
Of course I can.

254
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,666
This was originally
one of our brethren.

255
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,416
[HIRO]
Your brethren?

256
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
[HIRO grunts]

257
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,041
[HIRO]
What is this?

258
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:16,083
[ringing]

259
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,875
[ICHIGO]
What the...?

260
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,958
[MIKU]
It's a voice.

261
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,375
That's speaking...

262
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,375
[IKUNO]
...directly...

263
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,875
...to our brains.

264
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,416
[001]
Heed me, humans.

265
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,333
You ignorant fools who steal
the symbol of our bonds

266
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,208
that courses the
planet's depths.

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,250
"Courses the planet's depths"?

268
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,833
The magma energy.

269
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,666
[FRANXX] I found something while
studying klaxosaur corpses.

270
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,458
At some point in time,
their kind split,

271
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,166
becoming two different forms.

272
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:09,041
[FRANXX] One of which returned
to the earth and became energy.

273
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,125
[MALE SAGE A]
Steal? That's an affront!

274
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,750
[MALE SAGE C] Magma energy
is a planetary resource!

275
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:18,125
Its discovery saved human
civilization from certain ruin!

276
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,125
[001] Do you realize
how self-centered

277
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:26,708
a viewpoint that is? And now
you wish to steal my child?

278
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,208
I could never allow
that to pass.

279
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:37,291
For this child... is a
crystallization... of our bonds.

280
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:44,041
[9'a] Don't talk down to Papa,
you damn klaxosaur!

281
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,458
[HACHI] And... what
about the other form?

282
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:52,125
[FRANXX] It consumed that
energy and evolved physically.

283
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,666
[FRANXX]
It took an absurdly long time.

284
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,291
During which they stopped
mingling with one another,

285
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,041
and eventually lost
their intelligence.

286
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,416
Just what are the klaxosuars?

287
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,750
[FRANXX] Biological weapons
built by the klaxo-sapiens.

288
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:13,791
They are comprised of one male
and one female klaxo-sapiens.

289
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,666
The female's soul
connected to the weapon,

290
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,958
and the male's soul took root
in the core, the cockpit.

291
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,875
That sounds almost
like... a FRANXX.

292
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,291
[FRANXX]
Exactly.

293
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,625
They're merely an application
of the klaxosaur system.

294
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,083
Klaxosaurs that can
be piloted by humans

295
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,666
genetically modified
to be similar.

296
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,708
That... is what the FRANXX are.

297
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,833
So then... all this time
we've been piloting

298
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,583
klaxosaurs to fight klaxosaurs?

299
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,166
This isn't real.

300
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,041
I can't believe the klaxosaurs
have had pilots just like us!

301
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,000
[ZOROME gasps]
Could it be?

302
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,500
[MIKU]
The thing we saw. Back then!

303
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,833
[IKUNO] Yeah. Also...
remember the S-Planning?

304
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,541
[FUTOSHI] They were
excavating klaxosaurs...

305
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,083
...for the FRANXX.

306
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,250
They dug them up to serve
as the base of the units.

307
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,750
Damn it, no!
You've gotta be kidding!

308
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,291
What the hell is with that?

309
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,333
We've been kept in the
dark this entire time!

310
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,541
Where are we?

311
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:30,166
[001] Come. Awaken, my child.
They are nearly here.

312
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,333
Who are "they"?

313
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,916
[grunts]

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,166
[FEMALE OPERATOR A] Strelizia's
begun the implanting process.

315
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,583
[MALE SAGE C]
No.

316
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,208
[PAPA] I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this,

317
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,291
but we have no choice.

318
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
[MALE SAGE A]
What?

319
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,541
[APE VICE CHIEF]
We had wanted to take it

320
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,333
and Hringhorni into
space as soldiers.

321
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
[MALE SAGE C]
Into... space?

322
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,166
[PAPA]
If we can't have it,

323
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,500
then it can go down
along with this planet.

324
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,833
[MALE SAGE A]
What are you saying?

325
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,791
[PAPA] And we will return
to our "original roles."

326
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,083
[FUTOSHI]
An earthquake?!

327
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,833
[IKUNO gasps]
Look! Over there!

328
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,583
[GORO]
Are these...

329
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,000
[ICHIGO]
...some kind of klaxosaur?

330
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,250
[ICHIGO gasps]

331
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,500
[MIKU]
They can fly?!

332
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,458
[MIKU yelps]

333
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
[9'a]
Again?

334
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,291
[FEMALE FRANXX PILOT A]
An even bigger one!

335
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,583
[MALE FRANXX PILOT B]
What is this?

336
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,708
[IKUNO]
Klaxosaurs?

337
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,250
There's no way. This is
far too outrageous.

338
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,166
[ZOROME]
What the hell is this?

339
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,666
[FUTOSHI gasps] It's nothing
like our previous battles!

340
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,000
[ICHIGO] Just what in
the world is happening?

341
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,458
[ICHIGO gasps]

342
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,166
[HACHI] So, that's Star
Entity's awakened form?

343
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,916
[FRANXX]
This is it! My Strelizia Apus!

344
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,708
[FRANXX laughs]
Beautiful!

345
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,708
I wish I could have piloted it!

346
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,166
No, that doesn't matter anymore.

347
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,541
[HACHI gasps]

348
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:42,666
[001] Look at you. How ugly
the humans have made you.

349
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,958
But... you are still our child.

350
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,083
[001] A long time ago, when we
were attacked by invaders

351
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:05,333
from the expanse of space,
we fought and drove them off.

352
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:10,500
Then, we holed up in the earth,
and prepared for their return.

353
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,583
[HIRO]
"Invaders"?

354
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,291
[001]
Indeed.

355
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:25,000
[001] They are invaders.
Our true enemy. VIRM.

356
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,958
[HIRO]
True enemy? Invaders?

357
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,541
[001]
Filthy invaders.

358
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,375
This time. I shall not even
let you touch our planet.

359
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,708
[PAPA, SAGES gasp]

360
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:06,041
[001] Die. You will not...
take our planet!

361
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,708
[PAPA]
It's futile.

362
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,041
[001 gasps]

363
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,833
[ICHIGO gasps]

364
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,458
What happened?

365
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,958
[001 grunts]
Curse you, VIRM!

366
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,625
What did you do to our child?

367
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
[FRANXX gasps]

368
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,250
[FRANXX]
What? What's going on?

369
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,125
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
This is VIRM's will.

370
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,583
[MALE SAGE C]
What?

371
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,750
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Star Entity is a mass of life

372
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,750
that could disturb
the universe's peace.

373
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,875
[PAPA] As such, if the klaxosaur
princess were to take over

374
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:50,083
the implanting process,
we programmed it to explode.

375
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,291
[APE VICE CHIEF]
The die has been cast.

376
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,333
[PAPA]
This planet...

377
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,208
[APE VICE CHIEF]
...will explode.

378
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,333
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
Leaving nothing behind.

379
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,916
Hiro. Zero Two!

380
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,208
[FRANXX]
Stop. Please stop!

381
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,708
Doctor!

382
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:16,708
[FRANXX] It's all ruined!
Apus, my ultimate work of works!

383
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,708
Don't defile it!

384
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:24,333
[APE VICE CHIEF] We will absorb
all lifeforms on this planet.

385
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,250
[PAPA] And will take you
to eternal paradise.

386
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,333
[001 grunts]
You impertinent fiends!

387
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,083
[HIRO yells]

388
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,458
Damn!

389
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,791
[HIRO gasps]
Zero Two!

390
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,083
[ZERO TWO]
I... I promised.

391
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,541
[ZERO TWO]
Darling. I'm gonna come get you.

392
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,041
[ZERO TWO]
No matter what!
