00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,541
It looks like they're
moving in a pack,

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,083
which means that huge thing
could be a klaxosaur as well.

00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,583
If so, it's unlike any
I've ever seen before.

Did you hear the numbers?

They're higher than
they estimated.

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,708
Do you think we'll be able to
stop them and still make it

Don't worry about it, we can
let Squad 26 handle them alone.

18

You know, since we're just
"deadweight," apparently.

[IKUNO] It's not like
you to pass up a fight.

I don't see much reason
for us to be optimistic.

Hey, don't go whimping out.
They may have the numbers,

but you've got Zorome

And while he's busy
getting in trouble,

25

Strelizia will be there
to clean up the mess.

I tried, but I was wide awake.

I see.

really sleep much, either.

But I also know you're

Aside from the

we've also detected
a very dense unit.

[HACHI] It doesn't match
anything we have on record,

87

team up with Strelizia.

Maybe because I'm a monster.

[ZERO TWO gasps, shouts]

342
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,708
[ZERO TWO gasps]

343
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,666
Dar... ling?

344
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm your partner, Zero Two.
I won't leave you all alone.

345
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,083
[ALL gasp]

346
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,958
Wait. Hiro's... still alive?

347
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,083
[ICHIGO]
Hiro.

348
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,875
[NANA] Hiro's vital signs
are all reading normal.

349
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,333
What's going on?

350
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,250
[FRANXX]
Oh?

351
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,375
[NANA gasps]
Doctor?

352
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
[KOKORO]
It's changing forms again!

353
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,208
[MITSURU]
We can't let it!

354
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,833
[MIKU]
Don't just stand there, Ichigo!

355
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,125
Come on!

356
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,416
[IKUNO]
Now's our chance!

357
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,625
[FUTOSHI]
It's our turn!

358
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,250
[ZOROME]
Let's give 'em a hand!

359
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,458
[GORO] Create another
opening for Strelizia!

360
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,625
[ICHIGO]
Right!

361
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,875
[ICHIGO]
Hiro! Zero Two!

362
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,208
[ZERO TWO]
Let's fly...

363
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,500
Yeah!

364
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,791
[ZERO TWO] ...with the
wings I share with you!

365
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,958
With the wings
I share with you!

366
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:13,125
[ZERO TWO, HIRO shout]

367
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,208
Those were wings.

368
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,541
[FRANXX]
That boy.

369
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,625
He might just make
Zero Two's wish come true.

370
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,750
[HIRO]
Zero Two?

371
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,291
[ZERO TWO]
Mm?

372
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,166
[HIRO] I found another
reason for why I fight.

373
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,000
Why I pilot a Franxx.

374
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,750
[ZERO TWO]
Really? What is it?

375
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,166
Because I want to be your wings.

376
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,458
Though, I don't know what'll
happen to me next time.

377
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:06,583
You'll be fine. Next and every
other time, my darling.

378
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,000
[HIRO] The Jian, also known as
"the bird that shares wings",

379
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,833
only possesses one wing.

380
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,291
When a male and female lean
on each other and act as one,

381
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,416
they can fly as high and
as far as they want.

382
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:28,875
[HIRO] If I can be your wings,
then even if my life burns out,

383
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,791
I'll keep leaning
on you, right here.

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,458
[HIRO] Because, that may
be my purpose in life.

385
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,291
[ZERO TWO] There are still so
many klaxosaurs I have to kill.

386
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,083
[9'a]
Well, well.

387
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,750
You're certainly hitting it off,
aren't you, Nine Iota?
