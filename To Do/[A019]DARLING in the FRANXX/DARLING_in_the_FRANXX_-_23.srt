[HIRO grunts, gasps]

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
[9'a]
Meeting you guys

175
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,958
helped me learn a little
about being human.

176
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:24,041
But my home is the battlefield,
and nowhere else.

177
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,541
Tell Iota "hi" for me.

178
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,041
[HIRO]
Alpha!

179
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,333
[9'a]
It's been kinda fun, I guess.

180
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,833
[HIRO] Zero Two, why did you
leave me and run off alone?

181
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,500
[HIRO]
Together, we are one.

182
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,291
"We'll always be together."

183
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,916
Didn't we promise
each other that?

184
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,333
[HIRO]
Answer me. Zero Two!

185
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,500
[thunder rumbles]

186
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,875
[KOKORO]
No! You can't!

187
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,625
What's the matter?

188
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,583
[KOKORO]
Zero Two!

189
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,625
What is... happening to you?

190
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,333
No, don't!

191
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,458
[thunder rumbles]

192
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,416
[gasps]

193
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,833
Zero Two. This thing, is it you?

194
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
[HIRO]
If it is...

195
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:02,000
If it's you,
then please, consume me.

196
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:15,500
[HIRO] Is this the picture
book in Zero Two's mind?

197
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,916
[ZERO TWO]
Stay away.

198
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,875
[ZERO TWO]
Why'd you come?

199
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,708
[HIRO]
To see you.

200
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,958
[HIRO]
Why did you leave?

201
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:34,125
[ZERO TWO] Because, darling,
I want you to remain human.

202
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,625
[HIRO]
I want to be with you!

203
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,291
[ZERO TWO]
I can't be with you.

204
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,583
[HIRO]
Why?

205
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,791
[ZERO TWO]
I just can't.

206
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:53,541
[HIRO breathes raggedly]

207
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,333
[FUTOSHI]
The ship!

208
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,583
[ZOROME gasps]

209
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,000
[ZOROME]
Hey, look!

210
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,750
[GORO]
Oh, crap!

211
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,208
[ICHIGO] C'mon, guys,
we're gonna provide back up!

212
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,583
[IKUNO] Not letting us go
without a fight, huh?

213
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,833
[9'y]
We'll distract them for you!

214
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,125
[9'b]
Go!

215
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,708
[ZOROME]
Thanks!

216
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,833
So then, should we
go in a blaze of glory?

217
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
[9'b]
Not a bad idea.

218
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,958
[NANA]
Let's move to another ship!

219
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,083
[HACHI, NANA grunt]

220
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,583
[NANA gasps]

221
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,125
[HACHI]
So, this is it, huh?

222
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,875
Leave me and go.

223
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,791
You don't get to say that
after keeping me alive.

224
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,541
To hell with that!

225
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,833
You listen to me.

226
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,291
It's your duty to watch
over their futures, too!

227
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:05,333
[footsteps]

228
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,583
[HACHI]
What's that?

229
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,000
[NANA] The ship was
equipped with a bomb?

230
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,208
--[PAPA] Cease your resistance.
--[NANA gasps]

231
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,000
We know that voice.

232
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,166
[APE VICE CHIEF] Is there any
point at all to this warfare?

233
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,500
[PAPA] Eventually, all
lifeforms will merge with us.

234
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,333
[APE VICE CHIEF] Surrender
yourself to the gentle,

235
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,791
perpetual pleasure we offer.

236
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,458
[PAPA]
Our utopia is free of all hatred

237
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,916
and discrimination
between species.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,750
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Klaxosaurs? Humanity?

239
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,666
Such distinctions
won't matter anymore.

240
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,375
Equality for all!

241
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,833
[PAPA]
But beyond that,

242
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,250
we will attain an endless
and peaceful slumber.

243
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:57,833
And at the same time, endless
and relentless evolution.

244
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,791
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Rejecting that to march toward

245
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,083
your destruction
is far too foolish.

246
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,500
[PAPA]
Now, become one with us.

247
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,916
[HACHI]
To the adults,

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,833
that very well may have
sounded like utopia.

249
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,833
But that is not where
the children belong.

250
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,208
In perpetual tranquility,
the flames of their lives

251
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,666
will never burn as bright.

252
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,666
[HACHI] It isn't a matter
of right or wrong.

253
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,166
This is simply the path
that the children,

254
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,041
and humanity, have chosen.

255
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,208
[MIKU]
Things are getting pretty rough!

256
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,833
How much longer does Hiro need?

257
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
Don't worry.

258
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
He's always pulled
through in the past.

259
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,708
[ICHIGO] And we're not
the only ones struggling.

260
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,125
Yeah. Those two must be fighting
back on Earth just as hard!

261
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,500
[IKUNO]
That's right!

262
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,875
[MITSURU] Kokoro!
It's not safe! Get inside!

263
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,375
Just leave us be!

264
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,250
Zero Two wants to
stay right here!

265
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,625
Yeah, but... it's bad
for your body!

266
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,625
I don't care.
I will protect her!

267
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,166
[gasps]

268
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,416
Now that I'm not a parasite
anymore, I have nothing left.

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
Nothing I can do!

270
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,500
So I want to at least
be by her side!

271
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,041
Please, just let me stay.

272
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,000
All right, then I will as well.

273
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,583
I'll stay with you both!

274
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,125
Go away!

275
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,375
I've told you so many times
you don't need to feel respons--

276
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,625
[MITSURU]
It's not about responsibility!

277
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,458
Please don't say that
you have nothing.

278
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,458
If you don't, then neither do I!

279
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,750
[gasps]

280
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,833
[MITSURU]
But that's not true.

281
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,208
I've found my reason to live.

282
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,458
In you.

283
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,541
I want to protect you
and that baby's future.

284
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,375
I'm a weakling

285
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,708
and I don't really
understand what love is.

286
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,583
I don't.

287
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,125
But still, if I'm with you,
then I can keep walking.

288
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,541
That's what I've
come to believe.

289
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,583
[KOKORO gasps]

290
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,583
What the...
You still have that?

291
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,916
But why?

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,875
Why do you say my name
even though it hurts you?

293
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,250
Even without our memories,
we can start over again.

294
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,375
I'll call your name as
many times as you want.

295
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,625
This right here?
This is our battle to fight.

296
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,875
[KOKORO sobs]

297
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:27,458
Mitsuru. Mitsuru.

298
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,875
Mitsuru!

299
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,041
[MITSURU]
Kokoro. Kokoro.

300
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,791
--Kokoro!
--Mitsuru!

301
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,875
[ZERO TWO] I was always
a monster, so whatever.

302
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,041
But you?

303
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,375
I want you to live as a human.

304
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,500
That's why...
I can't be with you.

305
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,833
[HIRO] We promised
we'd always be together.

306
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,291
[ZERO TWO]
Stay away.

307
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,208
I'm fine... by myself.

308
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,750
[HIRO]
Liar.

309
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:02,208
If you really are, then why
is your last page left blank?

310
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,416
Don't fly off alone.

311
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,708
Please, Zero Two,
let me stay here with you.

312
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:12,416
Together, let's rewrite
that story's ending.

313
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,208
Darling.

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,583
Uh, Zero Two?

315
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,916
[KOKORO gasps]

316
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,750
What's going on?

317
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,708
[HIRO] I hereby vow
to never let you go.

318
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,916
[ZERO TWO]
Okay.

319
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,125
[GROUP]
Zero Two!

320
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,500
[ICHIGO]
He got to see her!

321
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,791
[GORO]
Wait, what?

322
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,708
Isn't that...?

323
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,708
[MIKU]
What the heck is that?

324
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,875
[ZERO TWO]
A warp gate.

325
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,750
[MIKU, ICHIGO gasp]

326
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,250
[IKUNO]
"Warp gate"?

327
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,083
Yeah.

328
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,291
The klaxo-sapiens built it.

329
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,250
[HIRO]
Hey, guys? Listen.

330
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,416
Zero Two and I are going
to go through that gate

331
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,416
and leave the solar system.

332
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,041
[IKUNO]
"Leave the solar system"?

333
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,166
Wait, what? Right now?

334
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,125
[ICHIGO gasps]

335
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,250
No way.

336
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,708
Whoa, whoa, wait a second!

337
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,541
You met up with Zero Two
like you wanted.

338
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,416
Why not head back to Earth?

339
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,333
[HIRO] Apus and the gate's
system are linked.

340
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:51,625
That means... neither of us
can stop the process.

341
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,208
Besides, the gate
will close soon.

342
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,875
[MIKU]
You're kidding.

343
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,791
[ZOROME]
This can't be happening.

344
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,625
[ICHIGO]
I don't get why.

345
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,916
Why do you two have to
go through that thing?

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,208
So we can finally put
an end to this war.

347
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,750
Now, I see. This is
what that bomb is for.

348
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,625
--[ICHIGO] Then let's all go!
--[HIRO] You can't.

349
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,083
[HIRO] Only Apus can withstand
going through the gate.

350
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,958
[FUTOSHI] But what are you
gonna do all by yourselves?

351
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
[IKUNO] And won't the
enemy's main force

352
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,083
be much larger
than this one was?

353
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,166
Yeah.

354
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,833
We'll need to take
them by surprise.

355
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,958
[GORO]
You will come back, right?

356
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,125
[MIKU]
Oh, no.

357
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,291
[ICHIGO]
I won't let you!

358
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,625
If that's your answer,
you can't go!

359
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,541
Leader's orders!

360
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,416
Come back alive, both of you!

361
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,041
Ichigo.

362
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,416
Exactly! I won't stand for it.

363
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,041
Come back to us, Hiro!

364
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,625
Yeah, I'm not gonna
accept goodbye like this!

365
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,041
[MIKU]
Me neither!

366
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,791
Squad 13 isn't complete
without the two of you around!

367
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,208
[FUTOSHI]
So, come back with Zero Two!

368
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,666
[IKUNO]
Yeah!

369
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
You guys.

370
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,416
[ICHIGO]
Zero Two!

371
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
It doesn't matter
how long it takes.

372
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,750
Make sure you come
back with Hiro!

373
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,916
We'll build a home
and wait for you!

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,958
[chuckles] You are
always so bossy!

375
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,583
I promise.

376
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,666
I'll come back to you
with my darling.

377
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,458
[KOKORO] Everyone has their
own feelings and desires.

378
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,916
We're all looking for
somewhere to belong.

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,083
Strelitzia looked so
beautiful at that moment.

380
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,375
Or so everyone who saw
it would tell us later.

381
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,708
[KOKORO] Right now,
all we can do is pray.

382
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,375
Pray that what is
waiting for those two...

383
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,708
...is a happy ending.
