This is bad.

The depths of

00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,416
[ZERO TWO] That room was the

world that would never touch
what lay outside those windows.

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,041
[HIRO] That place was
the entirety of my world.

00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:39,250
The Garden, a closed world
where only children lived.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,541
[ZERO TWO] But that day, I went
outside for the first time.

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,166
To this day,
I haven't forgotten.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,333
[HIRO] To this day,
I'd forgotten all about...

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,833
[ZERO TWO]
How vast the sky above was.

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,125
[HIRO]
How warm the hand I held was.

15
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,958
[HIRO, ZERO TWO] And the promise

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,208
[ZERO TWO]
"Who exactly am I?"

17
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:09,750
Back then, that question
never even crossed my mind.

18
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:14,583
I was trapped in that room for
as far back as I can remember.

19
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,333
I felt like I had
older memories,

20
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,416
but I soon forgot them.

I didn't know what this was.

00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,541

00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,666
[ZERO TWO] One day,
for the first and only time,

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,583
she brought me something

[ZERO TWO]
It was a picture book.

28
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,541
As I turned the pages, its
bright colors jumped out at me,

29
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,083
as did various shapes.

30
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:11,291
It had words, too, but I
couldn't understand them.

31
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:17,500
And after that day,
she never showed up again.

32
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:22,958
Anyway, this book was
my first "pretty thing."

33
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,916
The outside world surely
contained many more.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,833
At least, that's what
I innocently believed

35
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,583
in that moment.

36
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:37,208
It turns out that I was
half-right... and half-wrong.

37
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,500
[HIRO]
Who exactly am I? Back then,

38
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,333
that question was the only
thing I ever had on my mind.

00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,208
I was in the Garden for as

All of us children were referred

The lower the number,

44
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,875
the higher the child's
potential as a parasite.

The double-digits,
up through Zero-Nine-Nine,

46
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,666
were given special treatment.
Particularly the teens.

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,833
I was one of them, and I
was told that I was special,

cry anymore, either.

Should I get more injections?

61
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,750
Well, y'know, both our
codes are in the teens,

62
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,708
so we were already different
from them to begin with.

better that way, right?

Mm-hm! What do you think?

it's okay to be different.

Samii, Junna, Nakku, Toshi,
Sakuto, Shinya, and Mitsuru.

to refer to a person.

feel our anxieties fade away.

'cause I wanna be
with you forever, too.

345
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,625
And that way I can always be...

346
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,458
...darling.

347
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,125
[gasps]

348
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,916
Da...

349
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,916
[ZERO TWO] I don't know why,
but tears flowed from my eyes.

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,625
It wasn't because my wound hurt.

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,500
It's a mistletoe.

352
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:02,541
[ZERO TWO] Yeah, those were
probably tears of joy.

353
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,958
The picture book's
world was pretty,

354
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:10,083
and I believed that if I was
with him, I could be the same.

355
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,791
[ZERO TWO]
But, this world didn't allow it.

356
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,833
[HIRO]
Why? Why is it?

357
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,375
Am I not able to find
the answers I seek...

358
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
...because I'm just a child,

359
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,666
who doesn't have the power
to protect anyone?

360
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,708
[ZERO TWO] Why didn't I
realize that he and I

361
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:34,791
were different creatures,
with blood of different colors,

362
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,458
and that I... was a monster?

363
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,791
[MALE GUARD 13A]
That's what you get...

364
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,791
[FRANXX] Erase those memories.
They're noise.

365
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,125
[ZERO TWO]
Darling!

366
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,958
[ICHIGO] Aren't you gonna
give them names anymore?

367
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:48,916
[MITSURU]
You liar!

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,791
[NANA]
This is bad.

369
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,583
[MALE VOICE 13A]
Monster.

370
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,500
[ZERO TWO] So, that's why
I swore to become human,

371
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,458
no matter what it took,
or what I had to do.

372
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:04,375
If I were the same as him,
I could be with him forever.

373
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,125
[ALL]
Delphinium!

374
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,833
[ICHIGO screams]

375
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,083
[ICHIGO] Hiro, get away
from Zero Two, right now!

376
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,916
She only got closer to you so
that she could suck you dry!

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,083
If you stay with her, even you
will lose your humanity!

378
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,083
[ZERO TWO]
That's right. After all, I...

379
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,208
[HIRO]
The picture book.

380
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,500
[ZERO TWO gasps]

381
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,791
That was you. You were the girl.

382
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,833
The one with the
picture book back then.

383
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]
