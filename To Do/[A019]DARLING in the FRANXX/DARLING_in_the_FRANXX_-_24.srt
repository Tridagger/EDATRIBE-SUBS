1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,000
[ZERO TWO]
We've left on our honeymoon,

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,875
heading to the ends
of the universe.

3
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,583
The road there is all too long.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,166
Even so...

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,583
[HIRO]
It's strange.

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,625
[HIRO]
So many days have passed,

7
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:33,958
but I haven't been feeling
hungry or sleepy at all.

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,458
Will I turn... completely
into a klaxosaur?

9
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,291
[ZERO TWO]
Are you scared?

10
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,958
No way.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,125
It's almost like I've
become a part of you.

12
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,541
And I'm going deeper
and deeper in.

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,583
I can tell what you're feeling.

14
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,375
Same for me, darling.

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,166
[ZERO TWO]
More enemies.

16
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,458
[HIRO]
Zero Two, let's do this.

17
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,208
Come to me, darling.

18
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,958
[HIRO]
When we share our wings,

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,750
we can fly as high
and as far as we want.

20
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:18,291
Right now,
we are unbreakable.

21
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,458
[007]
It's getting a bit big.

22
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,916
I'll arrange pregnancy
clothes for you.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,291
If you could.

24
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,750
No. Please.

25
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,333
I don't want to be given any
kind of special treatment.

26
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,625
I must.

27
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,250
As the first pregnancy,
you'll be a pioneer

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,375
and an example for others.

29
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,208
We should do things right
to set forth a precedent.

30
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,125
[KOKORO]
Hm. 'Kay.

31
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,250
[ZOROME]
And here we go!

32
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,250
Ah! We found the place!

33
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,083
[ICHIGO]
I'm amazed it's still here.

34
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't try to explore
any unsafe areas!

35
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,583
[GROUP]
Okay.

36
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,833
[FUTOSHI]
Unreal.

37
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,333
The plants were dying
back then, but now...

38
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,458
It's like a miracle.

39
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,000
[ZOROME] We went through
so much here, didn't we?

40
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,166
Maybe Mistilteinn kept
all of this safe for us

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,375
so we'd return.

42
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,250
Maybe. This is our chance.

43
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,833
We can make a fresh start now.

44
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,916
All right!

45
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,458
[ICHIGO] What do you need
all these files for?

46
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,458
Well, because there's
something I wanna get done.

47
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,208
You're so good at that!

48
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,250
Take the thread,
and then you...

49
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,583
[MITSURU]
Um...

50
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,916
Is there anything that
you need me to do for you?

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,333
You shouldn't worry so much.
Everybody's here for me.

52
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,708
I'll be fine.

53
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,916
[MITSURU]
But I feel like I should help.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,250
[ZOROME, FUTOSHI]
Kokoro!

55
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,250
[ZOROME]
Outta my way, fatty!

56
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,791
[FUTOSHI]
Don't call me that!

57
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,500
Kokoro, eat this stuff!

58
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,416
Huh?

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,250
[ZOROME]
No fair! Eat this, too!

60
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,666
Thank you, you guys.

61
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,791
We asked Nana and she said
we could bring it to you.

62
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,708
You need to eat a bunch and
get all those nutrients!

63
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,833
Yeah. Thanks so much.

64
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,333
[ZOROME] All right.
Back to the field we go.

65
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,750
[MITSURU]
Wait. Hold on a second.

66
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,500
[FUTOSHI] Relax! There's still
time before it's born!

67
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,333
--[MITSURU] Um.
--[KOKORO] Huh?

68
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,083
I... guess I'm off.

69
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,875
'Kay. I'll see ya later.

70
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,708
[ICHIGO] Do you think Hiro and
Zero Two are still fighting?

71
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,833
Honestly, every now and then,

72
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,041
it really hurts to think
about how we're living here

73
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,208
without the two of them.

74
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,583
And I just keep wishing
there was something useful

75
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,250
we could do to help them out.

76
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,958
We feel the exact
same way as you.

77
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,625
But still...

78
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,541
All that's left to focus on
is what we can do here and now.

79
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,791
Just like they're doing.

80
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,000
[ZERO TWO] Can you tell
which stars these are?

81
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,500
[HIRO] Not at all.
We're really far from Earth.

82
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,791
And from this perspective,
they look so different.

83
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,416
[ZERO TWO] Want to make a
constellation ourselves, then?

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,833
[HIRO]
Make one?

85
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,083
[ZERO TWO] For example,
we can link those two stars--

86
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,333
[alarm sounds]

87
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,916
[ZERO TWO]
Too bad. The enemy's here.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,541
Let's go, darling.

89
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,583
[HIRO]
Right.

90
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,625
[ZERO TWO]
Don't worry.

91
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,291
We have all the time
in the world.

92
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:36,666
[MITSURU panting]

93
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,833
--[GORO] Mitsuru! Hurry up!
--[ZOROME] Ah, there he is!

94
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,541
Kokoro!

95
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,916
[gasps]

96
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,250
Lookit, there's your papa.

97
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,541
[ICHIGO] The first step
in the future we chose

98
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,375
finally came to pass.

99
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,208
[FUTOSHI]
Well done, Mitsuru!

100
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,875
You're the first papa!

101
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,041
[ICHIGO] It was something
we'd never forget.

102
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,083
[ZOROME]
You're gonna suffocate him!

103
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,625
[ICHIGO] Some time later, we
were told about the facility.

104
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,458
The one that housed all
the children who disappeared.

105
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,708
Naomi!

106
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,625
You guys...

107
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,791
[ICHIGO] We threw
ourselves into this life,

108
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,875
taking each step
slowly but surely.

109
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,625
[ICHIGO] Making sure we could
each find our own path to walk.

110
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,750
[ICHIGO] And then one of us came
to another major crossroads.

111
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,208
[GORO] Okay, I'm going
to explore the world.

112
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,625
I'll find things we need.

113
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,375
Like useable materials
that'll help in the future.

114
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
Also...

115
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,208
I wanna look for any children
that were left behind.

116
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,708
They desperately
need a helping hand.

117
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,708
It'll be a long journey
for you. Good luck.

118
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,541
And take care of yourself.

119
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,041
You okay with this, Ichigo?
We'll all miss him, but...

120
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,416
I am.

121
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,291
'Cause what he's doing
is a very Goro way to live.

122
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,541
Good to go.

123
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,583
All right,
then do your thing.

124
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,791
[GORO] I can't let Hiro
outshine me forever.

125
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,833
[ICHIGO]
Right.

126
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,083
Try to contact us now and then.

127
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:35,916
[ICHIGO gasps]

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,916
[ZOROME, MIKU yelp]

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,625
Hey! What was that?

130
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,291
[GORO]
Okay, take care, guys.

131
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,958
And I'll find that thing
you asked about, Ikuno.

132
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,583
Yeah, yeah. Thanks a bunch.

133
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,541
Later!

134
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,208
[IKUNO sighs] Goro's changed
a lot, hasn't he?

135
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,791
[ICHIGO] Through this cycle
of meetings and partings,

136
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,208
we're gradually growing
up and becoming adults.

137
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,833
Hiro. Zero Two.
How are you two doing?

138
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,791
It's just a little bit
lonely without you both.

139
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,708
[ICHIGO] But we're giving
our all to our lives here

140
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,125
so we can face you
with our heads held high.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,083
[ICHIGO] And then, we passed two
years since that fateful day.

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,541
[ZERO TWO]
Darling.

143
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,083
Darling.

144
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,166
[ZERO TWO]
Are you okay?

145
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,583
Sorry, guess I fell asleep.

146
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,541
[ZERO TWO]
That's unusual.

147
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,541
You seem to be really weak.
Don't push yourself.

148
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,250
[HIRO]
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,666
[HIRO]
Zero Two. I had a dream.

150
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,166
[ZERO TWO]
A dream?

151
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,125
One about the gang.

152
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,791
They were living good lives.

153
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,250
Yeah...

154
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,208
[ZERO TWO]
Darling.

155
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,458
We're nearing the
enemy's home planet.

156
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,333
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
You feeble lifeform,

157
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,583
bound to your flesh.

158
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,666
[ZERO TWO]
VIRM!

159
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,708
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
Heed my voice!

160
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,916
Don't even bother!

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,041
My darling won't listen to you--

162
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,750
What?

163
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,416
Is that Hringhorni?

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
[APE VICE CHIEF]
This is our territory.

165
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,208
[PAPA]
Feeble one.

166
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,916
Let me deliver you
from your suffering.

167
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,875
Darling, let's go!

168
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,125
[ZERO TWO]
Darling?

169
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,458
Darling!

170
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,291
[ZERO TWO] Darling!
Hang in there, darling!

171
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,500
[ZERO TWO shouts]

172
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,166
Why? What's wrong?

173
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,291
Why can't I hear his voice
when he's right here?

174
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,458
[HIRO]
Zero Two?

175
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,416
Zero Two!

176
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,708
You're right here, but your
voice is growing so distant.

177
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,583
[ZERO TWO] What did
you do to my darling?

178
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,541
[PAPA] Gently caressed his
surface consciousness.

179
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,916
That's all.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
[APE VICE CHIEF] Every physical
body has its limits,

181
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,083
and he is but a frail human.

182
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,458
You two may have a shallow
connection, but as a pure

183
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,875
klaxosaur crystallization, you
are not a good match for him.

184
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
[ZERO TWO gasps]
No!

185
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,208
Stop it!

186
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,791
[HIRO]
It's so quiet.

187
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,250
Where am I going?

188
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,083
I vowed to be with you forever,

189
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,458
so why can't I stand
with you until the end?

190
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,041
Is it because I'm human?

191
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,458
My darling. My darling's
mind is fading away.

192
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,625
[ZERO TWO gasps]

193
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,791
[screams]

194
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,958
[ZERO TWO]
Please. I'm begging you.

195
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,083
Guys...

196
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,958
Please save my darling.

197
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,791
[AI]
Huh?

198
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,791
[AI]
Darling! Darling!

199
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,625
[MITSURU]
What's the matter, Ai?

200
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,541
You know you shouldn't do that.

201
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,208
Papa. Darling!

202
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,041
Is something wrong, Papa?

203
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,916
Well, uh, Kokoro--

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,125
[KOKORO sighs] I keep telling
you to call me "Mama."

205
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,916
[MITSURU]
Uh, she's...

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,291
Darling!

207
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,208
Huh? What the...?

208
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,666
That's weird, she shouldn't
know that word yet.

209
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,000
Wait a sec, could it be?

210
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,833
We should let everyone know!

211
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,750
[IKUNO] I heard it was
originally yours.

212
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,958
So I wasn't sure whether
to show you or not.

213
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,708
I'm certain I can only
stand here right now

214
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,041
because of whatever role
this mirror played in things.

215
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,916
So I should be grateful.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,416
--[door opens]
--[NAOMI] Uh?

217
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
You two, come with me!

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,416
[ZOROME] This Zero Two is linked
to the one in outer space?

219
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,666
[MITSURU]
I can't say for sure exactly.

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,250
Even so, how are we
supposed to use this one

221
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,541
to talk to the other?

222
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,041
We should all link up, too.
C'mon, guys.

223
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,458
[ICHIGO] And so, we started
praying to the skies.

224
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,833
All day, all night.

225
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,250
More and more people
joined us by the day,

226
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,083
and we all screamed
our throats hoarse

227
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,458
at something that
may not be there.

228
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,750
[ZERO TWO]
I can hear them.

229
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,333
All their voices!

230
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,958
Darling! Can you hear them too?

231
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,916
Listen! We're trying!

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,708
We're doing our
best here on Earth!

233
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,333
We haven't forgotten about you!

234
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,666
You hear me?

235
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,666
Not a day goes by we
don't think about you!

236
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,625
Squad 13 doesn't feel complete.
Not without the both of you.

237
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,333
But we've gained
loads of new friends

238
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,833
in the time you've been away!

239
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,666
I'll never let you guys
outshine me! You got that?

240
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
I'm gonna take my own path!

241
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,708
That's right!

242
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,916
And we promise we'll all
find our own happiness,

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,625
no matter what, okay?

244
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,541
I've decided, whatever
time I have left,

245
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,791
I'm going to make
the most of it!

246
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,083
Hiro!

247
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,916
We had our child
and gave her a name!

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Just like you once
gave us all of ours!

249
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,750
[KOKORO] It's Ai, for "love"!
The word we were never taught!

250
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,125
I read an old book

251
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,750
and learned about bonds
like the one you two have.

252
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,125
It means that you
love each other.

253
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:01,791
We want our child, our Ai,
to inherit that bond!

254
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,125
That's what we decided!

255
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,500
[HIRO]
I hear... their voices.

256
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Ai.

257
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,458
[ZERO TWO]
That's right. Humans are strong.

258
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,750
[HIRO]
Zero Two?

259
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,916
[ZERO TWO]
This is something you started.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,041
You've always yelled out
that you want to be there

261
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,375
and live together with everyone.

262
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,833
[HIRO] It's not something
to be proud of.

263
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,833
Mine was a petty, selfish wish.

264
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,166
I thoughtlessly rushed
toward everything,

265
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,083
and I caused trouble
for everyone.

266
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,083
[ZERO TWO] But that's how badly
you wanted to live, right?

267
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,166
That's why you yelled to me that
you wanted to be here, right?

268
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,000
You dazzled me.

269
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,708
Your pained expression
and your tears,

270
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,708
they were exactly the
humanity I always wanted.

271
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,250
And so, we were bound by a kiss.

272
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,791
A symbol saying
"You're mine and mine alone.

273
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,750
You're special to me."

274
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,000
We met by chance

275
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,500
and were attracted to
each other by nature.

276
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:08,250
Now, say my name, darling!

277
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,416
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

278
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,791
It's time to become one!

279
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,166
We are the Jian!

280
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
I feel your blood.

281
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,500
I feel it coursing
through my veins!

282
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,750
You're dyeing every
part of me in your colors!

283
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,791
I was so blessed
to have met you all!

284
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,958
I'm glad I was born
into this world!

285
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,750
Darling! I love you!

286
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,708
Same here.

287
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,666
Zero Two! I love you!

288
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,708
[ZERO TWO, HIRO yell]

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,750
[HIRO]
Commence implanting!

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,875
What?

291
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,333
[ZERO TWO yelps]

292
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,625
Not yet.

293
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:23,666
We've gotta rewrite that story
and continue it together!

294
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,875
Zero Two. I am
becoming one with you.

295
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,750
Now you are me.

296
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,500
And you are me.

297
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,875
So, we're probably going
to disappear soon.

298
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,583
But still, the path we've
walked on won't ever fade.

299
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,125
The others will take it further.

300
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,125
It doesn't matter how long.

301
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,291
If we have souls, then I
swear I'll meet you again.

302
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,875
Back where we started.
Back on Earth.

303
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,750
[HIRO]
I love you, Zero Two.

304
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,750
[ZERO TWO]
I feel the same.

305
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,416
I love you, darling.

306
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,875
[PAPA]
All of you so-called souls,

307
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,333
are you going back to be
caged in your bodies?

308
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,666
[APE VICE CHIEF]
You willingly choose

309
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,125
to be shackled by
pain and sorrow?

310
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,250
[PAPA]
VIRM will not die.

311
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
[APE VICE CHIEF] I'm sure
we will face off once again

312
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,458
at the apex of evolution.

313
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,291
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
So long as this universe

314
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,250
contains a flicker of life.

315
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,416
[GORO]
It's over, huh?

316
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,250
All the prayers
that we were saying.

317
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,166
Do you think they
managed to reach them?

318
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,208
I'm sure they did. They heard.

319
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,500
[KOKORO]
Thanks to Hiro and Zero Two,

320
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,708
this planet can go back and
start over from square one.

321
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,916
[AI]
Mama?

322
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,500
[ICHIGO]
Take as long as you want,

323
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,541
but make sure you
both come back here.

324
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,666
We'll keep our home
up and running,

325
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,541
so you can return anytime.

326
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,708
What the...?

327
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:51,083
[ICHIGO] That bright light shone
upon us for three days straight.

328
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,791
And a few days later, many
klaxosaurs returned to Earth

329
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,250
from the battle,

330
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,250
dove straight into the ground,
and became a part of it.

331
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,083
[ICHIGO]
Hachi said that...

332
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:10,750
...maybe they decided to
let mankind have Earth.

333
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,958
And then, eight years passed.

334
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,708
[KOKORO] As we decided to
rebuild our lives on Earth,

335
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,375
we made a vow.

336
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,625
[ZOROME]
A vow to stop using

337
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,291
what little magma
energy we had left.

338
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,958
[FUTOSHI] Because it's a symbol
of the klaxosaurs' bonds,

339
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,666
and something very precious
to the planet itself.

340
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
[MITSURU] But that decision
brought our lives

341
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,833
adversity after adversity.

342
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,833
[GORO] Because we had to conjure
up a self-sufficient lifestyle

343
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,958
out of thin air.

344
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,916
[IKUNO] Using our meager food
reserves as a foundation...

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,250
[MIKU] ...we gradually
made everything.

346
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,541
All that we needed to live.

347
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,666
[ICHIGO] And then, we finished
the rest of that picture book.

348
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,875
So that those two would
forever be as one.

349
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,208
And future generations
would know about them.

350
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,875
[ICHIGO laughs]

351
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,000
[ICHIGO]
Man, you suck.

352
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,625
[NANA]
What do you think?

353
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,250
Is there anything
we can do for them?

354
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,958
We never grow any older,

355
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,916
and we're stuck in the middle,
neither adults nor children.

356
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,250
We have only
a single obligation.

357
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,333
To reach out to
humanity's future

358
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,000
and continue to watch over it.

359
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,958
Wow. You're always
so unyielding.

360
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,333
Well, I don't have
any emotions,

361
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,833
but that's why you're here.

362
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,625
If you were to stay
by my side forever,

363
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,708
I wonder if I would
also be able to change.

364
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,333
[NANA gasps]

365
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,083
[GIRL A]
Hey, hey, Hachi!

366
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,000
Come play with us!

367
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,416
[HACHI]
Oh. Sure. I'll be right back.

368
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,833
[NANA chuckles]
You don't have to worry.

369
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,416
You have changed
and so have I.

370
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,708
And we will all
continue to change.

371
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,666
[ZOROME] Phew! Looking at
this really drives home

372
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,125
how many pipsqueaks
we have now.

373
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,625
[GIRL B]
Mr. Zorome!

374
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,875
Huh?

375
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,291
[GIRL B] Ms. Nana was
mad that you skipped the

376
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,625
teachers' meeting.

377
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,875
[GIRL C]
Totally mad!

378
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,166
It's fine.

379
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,750
I don't have to attend
those stupid meetings.

380
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,833
But bad girls need
to be punished!

381
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,750
Take that!

382
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:38,416
[GIRL B, GIRL C, ZOROME laugh]

383
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,208
[MIKU]
Hey!

384
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
[ZOROME grumbles]

385
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,833
[ZOROME]
Oh, Miku.

386
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,708
Why don't you quit
slacking for a change

387
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,208
and help us out over here?

388
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,708
Shaddup! I was just
about to get started!

389
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,041
Oh?

390
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,000
Because it sure didn't
look like you were to me!

391
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:53,958
--[BOTH laughing]
--[ZOROME] Come off it.

392
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,333
[ZOROME]
I'm busy with stuff.

393
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,791
[MIKU]
What stuff exactly?

394
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,708
[ZOROME]
You know, stuff.

395
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,666
[ICHIGO] Sounds like
they're arguing again.

396
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,250
Even on a day when everyone's
supposed to meet up.

397
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,541
Those two are
incapable of changing.

398
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,166
Everything looks good.

399
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,916
It's growing fine.

400
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,583
Thank you, Ikuno.

401
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,625
[IKUNO]
You're going to be a mom.

402
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,541
I wonder what your
baby will be like.

403
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,458
--[door opens]
--[FUTOSHI] I'm here, Ikuno.

404
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,625
[IKUNO]
Futoshi.

405
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,000
New recipe! You wanna
try this bread?

406
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,666
[NAOMI] You haven't
lost any weight at all.

407
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,333
Oh, back off.

408
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,125
Anyway, it was Ikuno's fault
I regained my appetite.

409
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,291
It's all thanks to
the research you did.

410
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,791
We ex-parasites owe you so much.

411
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,416
You've kept our accelerated
aging in check.

412
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,666
Don't think your bread
isn't special, as well.

413
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,916
All the kids here
grow up eating it.

414
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
[FUTOSHI laughs]

415
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,750
Kokoro and Mitsuru,
they're on their fourth.

416
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,625
[IKUNO]
I heard.

417
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,833
Like you're one to talk.

418
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,166
[FUTOSHI]
Huh? Oh.

419
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,166
Go on. We're good here.
Get back to your family.

420
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,250
[FUTOSHI laughs]
All right.

421
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,625
[IKUNO]
Where's Goro?

422
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,666
He should be arriving soon.

423
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,791
[IKUNO] He's still traveling
all over the place.

424
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,166
--But you know what he said?
--[ICHIGO] Hm?

425
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,875
[IKUNO ] He wants to stay put
by your side for a while,

426
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,625
for the baby's sake.

427
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,250
[ICHIGO chuckles]
Yeah.

428
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,333
[ZOROME]
We're all grown up now, huh?

429
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,625
[MIKU]
Your mental age disagrees.

430
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,041
[GORO] Although,
we're nothing like the adults

431
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,208
we grew up watching.

432
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,583
[KOKORO]
Anything goes.

433
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:35,125
As long as we're good
role models for our kids.

434
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,750
[ICHIGO]
Hiro. Zero Two.

435
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,625
We're all living strong,
with our own lives now.

436
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,708
You two were the ones
who showed us how to...

437
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,875
[FUTOSHI]
...enjoy every experience.

438
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,250
[IKUNO]
Fight when you have to.

439
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,291
[ZOROME]
Keep working towards your goal.

440
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,625
[MIKU] Never half-ass things
and go all-out.

441
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,208
[KOKORO] Try and get to
know another person better.

442
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,041
[MITSURU] Choose your
destiny with your own hands.

443
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,791
[GORO]
Be honest with your feelings.

444
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,500
[ICHIGO]
And be someone's wings.

445
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,916
In that sense,

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,750
I know that you two were more
human than anybody else.

447
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,000
[HIRO]
One day, for sure.

448
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,916
[ZERO TWO]
Yeah. One day, for sure.

449
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,333
[WOMAN]
Stop running! You'll fall!

450
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,500
[GIRL]
I'll be fine!

451
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,041
[BOY gasps]

452
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,958
[GIRL]
Ow, ow, ow.

453
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,416
Are you okay?

454
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,583
[GIRL]
Who are you?

455
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,041
[BOY]
Me?

456
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,291
My name is...
