I wish my numbers
were as high as yours.

171
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,708
I guess you and Goro must
be really compatible.

172
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,583
[MIKU] "The elite double digits
are made for each other."

173
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,166
I'm so happy for you.

174
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,750
Oh, gee, thanks.

175
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,625
[MIKU] But speaking
of elite, how about Hiro?

176
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,125
Out of nowhere, he shows up with
a girl and after one ride, boop!

177
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,375
She calls him "darling." He, he!

178
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,458
I don't really get it,
but they may end up a good--

179
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,416
--[thump]
--[yelps]

180
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,375
[KOKORO gasps]

181
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,375
[MIKU]
Huh. What's her problem?

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
[HACHI] I'll give you your
strategic objectives.

183
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,791
But all decisions on the field

184
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,833
will be made by the
lead FRANXX, Delphinium.

185
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,666
[ICHIGO]
Roger.

186
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,541
What'd Ichigo ever do
to become leader?

187
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,166
Now. We'll begin the drill.

188
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,583
This'll be your first
one in a real FRANXX,

189
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,208
so relax and stay calm. So long
as you trust your partner

190
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,875
and follow their movements,
you'll do fine.

191
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,583
Commence connecting.

192
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,166
[KOKORO, MIKU gasp]

193
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,583
Don't make weird noises!

194
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,333
[MIKU]
It's a natural reaction!

195
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,416
Partners can't afford
to be out of synch.

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,958
Their para-capacity
will fluctuate.

197
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,375
You must trust your partner and
accept them wholeheartedly.

198
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,875
You okay?

199
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,666
[ICHIGO]
I'm fine. Keep going.

200
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,166
How was that?
It didn't suck, right?

201
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,875
[KOKORO]
Mm-mm. You did just fine!

202
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,375
[FUTOSHI giggles]
We're a good match, aren't we?

203
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,041
[ZOROME] Enough, you two,
spare us the touchy-feely crap!

204
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,000
If anyone should
be bragging, it's me.

205
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,250
I was the first to finish!
Ya hear that, "double-digits"!

206
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,750
And don't you forget it!

207
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,083
So wound up.

208
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,208
We shouldn't compete
with each other.

209
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,375
[ZOROME]
Ha! Spoken like a loser!

210
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,750
[MIKU] Zorome, slow down!
You're being too rough!

211
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:24,625
[ZOROME gasps]
Whoa. Whoa!

212
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
[ICHIGO]
That was close.

213
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,875
[MIKU]
Thank you.

214
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,291
[ICHIGO]
The stamen controls handling,

215
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,958
but the pistil connects
to the FRANXX.

216
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,916
So, you have to make sure she
can keep up with your movements.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,708
Thanks. Know-it-all.

218
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,750
[HACHI] Line up in formation.
Delphinium in the center.

219
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,166
Then, advance!

220
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,416
[ALL]
Roger!

221
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,250
[HIRO]
It happened. I know it did.

222
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,291
If they would just let
me ride with Zero Two

223
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,416
in Strelizia again, then I...

224
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:14,375
[NANA] A startup trial
in an actual FRANXX?

225
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,083
I've almost figured out
the secret to connecting.

226
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,666
I'm so close.

227
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,666
Hey! Wait a sec!

228
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,875
Why'd you pick Hiro?

229
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,791
"Hiro"? You mean my darling?

230
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,625
What does that even mean?

231
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,083
Look, everyone's grateful that
you stopped the klaxosaur

232
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,458
the other day.

233
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,500
But, from now on, I want
you to stay away from Hiro!

234
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,583
Why's that?

235
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,625
Because you're not
part of our squad.

236
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,208
That means you'll leave one day.

237
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,791
So you shouldn't be
getting Hiro's hopes up.

238
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,875
[ZERO TWO] Oh? And what
are you to my darling?

239
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,791
I'm the leader of this squad.

240
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,875
[ZERO TWO]
Hm.

241
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,625
Uh, hey.

242
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,416
[ICHIGO gasps]

243
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,500
You taste sweet. I like that.

244
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,750
[ICHIGO grunts]

245
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,375
[FUTOSHI] Do you think we'll be
able to fight like that one day?

246
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,875
[FUTOSHI grunts]
Against the klaxosaurs.

247
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,666
Like what Hiro did in
that girl's FRANXX.

248
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,208
Huh?

249
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,750
What he did out there is not
what I would call "piloting."

250
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,166
You know that jerk
can't handle a FRANXX.

251
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,625
[FUTOSHI] But it did move
around with him inside.

252
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,333
And Papa seems to have taken
an interest in Hiro, too.

253
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,875
[ZOROME]
So what?

254
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,541
[MITSURU] I heard another rumor
about that Zero Two pistil.

255
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,125
They say she has the special
ability to pilot a FRANXX

256
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,791
all by herself. You saw
that four-legged form?

257
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,916
She controlled that alone.
Hiro was no pilot,

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,208
he was along for the ride
as cargo and nothing more.

259
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,666
What did I tell you?!

260
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,666
There's no way that loser
piloted a FRANXX before us!

261
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,875
Huh?

262
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,666
[ZOROME] Don't go thinkin'
you're hot stuff, you hear me?

263
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,791
Bullseye! I'm number one!

264
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,250
Sorry, pal.

265
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,125
I really thought you were
gonna be able to dodge that.

266
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
Where've you been?

267
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,416
Playing with yourself
in a training unit?

268
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,625
That is the best you can do.

269
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,375
The closest thing you
can get to action

270
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,291
is hitching a ride with a girl!

271
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,500
[laughs]

272
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,083
Huh? What's with you?
You wanna fight me?

273
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,375
Zero Two said I
piloted that thing.

274
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,708
You wouldn't forget your
first time if you did!

275
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,458
Once I get another chance,
I'll prove it to you!

276
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,583
[ZOROME growls]
You know where to find me!

277
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,166
[ICHIGO gasps]
Hey! What are you doing?

278
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,166
[GORO]
Break it up!

279
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,375
[FUTOSHI gasps]

280
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,458
Knock it off.

281
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,333
Let me go, he's
had this coming!

282
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,750
Damn you, Hiro! You're nothing
but a waste of space!

283
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,708
[ZOROME grunts]

284
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,208
I can do it.
I just need a chance.

285
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:46,958
[ZOROME grunts]

286
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
--Yeah.
--[phone rings]

287
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,958
[ICHIGO]
It's Nana.

288
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,208
A mock battle,
with me in a FRANXX?

289
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
That is correct.

290
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,333
And depending on
how well you do,

291
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,208
we may promote you to parasite.

292
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,333
[HIRO gasps]

293
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,833
Way to go!

294
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,666
[HACHI]
Pick your partner.

295
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
[ZERO TWO]
I'll do it.

296
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,000
[HIRO]
You will?

297
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,250
Of course. You are
my darling, after all.

298
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,791
[ICHIGO]
Wait just a moment.

299
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,833
Please, allow me
to be his partner.

300
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,375
[GORO]
Ichigo.

301
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,875
[ICHIGO] With all due respect,
she's not part of our squad.

302
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,625
Besides, if the purpose
is to test Hiro's aptitude,

303
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,541
it should work just
as well with me.

304
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,083
But then why does it have
to be you of all people?

305
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,375
Don't forget. You already
have a partner,

306
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,666
and yet you want to ride
with someone else?

307
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,083
[NANA] That's enough. I don't
like where this is going.

308
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,541
Zero Two.

309
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,291
HQ hasn't authorized the use
of Strelizia at this time.

310
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,500
The only way for Hiro
to do the mock battle

311
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,333
is to partner with someone
from his squad.

312
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,375
[ZERO TWO]
Boo. That sucks... Oh, well.

313
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,666
My injuries haven't
healed yet, anyway.

314
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,750
[HIRO]
Wait, what?

315
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,250
So. I'll let you have
him just this once.

316
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:58,416
Better make the most of it.
Take care of my darling.

317
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,125
Then it's settled. We agreed?

318
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,833
[ICHIGO]
Yes.

319
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,125
[HIRO gasps]
Wait!

320
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,666
[MITSURU]
Hmph.

321
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,666
[HACHI] Does anyone want to
volunteer as their opponents?

322
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,166
[ZOROME]
We will!

323
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
[MIKU grunts] Excuse me?!
Shouldn't we talk about this?

324
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,041
Back me up. This is our chance
to prove what we can do, okay?

325
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,666
[MIKU grunts]
We'll do it.

326
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,541
[NANA]
All right.

327
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,041
The battle will be tomorrow.

328
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,500
[ZOROME]
Wait, wait, wait!

329
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,541
Why can't we duke
it our right now?

330
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,208
[GORO] I guess Zorome can't let
go of the fight you had earlier.

331
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,166
Yeah. Sorry I have to use
your partner for this.

332
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,708
[phone rings]

333
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,458
Is everything ready?

334
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,208
Yup. Gotta go.

335
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,166
'Kay. Later.
And, Hiro, it's fine.

336
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,125
I couldn't have told Ichigo
not to do it if I wanted.

337
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,500
Thanks. I'm gonna make
this one count, I swear.

Hey!

341

You and I got some unfinished
business to handle, pal!

342
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,125
[MIKU] Given your
partner's track record,

343
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,000
I may just beat you
this time, "Great Leader."

344
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,583
[ICHIGO] Fine by me. This test
isn't about winning or losing.

345
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,250
[FUTOSHI] Miku's as pumped
for this as Zorome.

346

[ICHIGO] I don't care if
we lose. All that matters

347
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,583
is that we prove that Hiro
really can pilot a FRANXX.

focus on connecting.

This'll work.

I can draw out Hiro's
ability too. I know it!

[HIRO] This feeling... It's like
I'm entering Ichigo's mind.

Keep going. I've got you!

No way. This can't be!

Now fight!

They stopped.

No. Why now? What wrong?

Not like this!

three minutes, okay?

There're no time outs!

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,833
[HIRO] Why isn't it working?
We have to keep moving.

Come on! Damn it!
Why'd this happen?

I dunno. It stopped.

Is it my fault?

383

I don't think so.

384
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,208
Is there something
Zero Two did that I'm not?

385
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,333
[HIRO]
I don't know. I don't remember!

386
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,125
[ICHIGO]
It's okay, there's no rush.

387
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,583
Just relax and
maybe it'll come back.

388
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,916
The kiss.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,708
[ICHIGO]
Huh?

390

She "kissed" me first.

'Kay. What's a "kiss"?

392
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,791
[HIRO] It's, uh. We put
our lips together.

393
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,416
There was some flash
of light. And boom.

Hold on.

during the klaxosaur attack?

[HIRO] It's not like we
were fooling around.

She just did it as
soon as I got in.

Truth be told, I didn't know
what was happening.

But she made it sound
like a special thing.

Wait, hold on a second.

unless we do this, right?

If that's all it takes,
I don't mind.

than three minutes by now?

their chance, let's do this.
