C'mon! Don't you
remember the ceremony?

"Until death do us part,"
and all of that stuff.

353
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,875
You guys even exchanged
wedding rings.

00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,708
Oh, this? I don't know
when it got there.

Anyway, who is she?

356
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,208
Did they give us
a new squadmate?

[KOKORO gasps] You're the one
who's new to our squad, not me.

Hey, what's gotten into you two?

The home we built for ourselves,

365
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,875
was too brittle to live in.

Everything we ever hold dear,

367

rule us anymore.
