1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,916
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
This is VIRM's will.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,958
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Star Entity is a mass of life

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,291
that could disturb
the universe's peace.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,458
[PAPA] As such, if the klaxosaur
princess were to take over

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:24,500
the implanting process,
we programmed it to explode.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,916
[9'a]
Papa?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,125
[APE VICE CHIEF]
The die has been cast.

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,208
[PAPA]
This planet...

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,541
[APE VICE CHIEF]
...will explode...

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,541
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
...leaving nothing behind.

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,833
[MALE SAGE A]
What's going on?

12
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,291
[MALE SAGE C]
Who are you?

13
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,583
[PAPA] We have assimilated
several lifeforms

14
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,208
from all over the universe,

15
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,625
and helped them break free of
the shells of their bodies.

16
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,666
[APE VICE CHIEF] And the time
has come for you humans

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,875
to embrace your evolution!

18
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,250
[MALE SAGE C gasps]
What?

19
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,458
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
There exists a form of pleasure

20
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:58,750
that is gentle and perpetual,
and you will now experience it!

21
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,708
Damn!

22
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,208
[HERO]
Zero Two...

23
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:18,791
[screaming]

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,541
[ZERO TWO grunts]

25
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,833
[001 screams]

26
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,666
[HIRO]
It's all or nothing.

27
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:37,458
[HIRO] What is this? Just how
long have you been alive?

28
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,208
You've been living
all by yourself

29
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,833
since before humans existed?

30
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:42,958
[gasps]

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,416
Darling.

32
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,541
[MALE FRANXX PILOT A] Command!
Please come in, command!

33
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,208
Papa!

34
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,041
[FUTOSHI] Uh, hey! Who exactly
are we supposed to fight here?

35
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,833
[ZOROME]
The klaxosaurs, obviously!

36
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,583
That's how it's always been!

37
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,916
[IKUNO] But she said the
ones that came from the sky

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,791
were invaders.

39
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,333
[KOKORO] It doesn't
matter who the enemy is.

40
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,500
All I can do is fight.

41
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,458
[FRANXX] Since the
detonation stalled once

42
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,250
Code Zero-One-Six connected...

43
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,041
[FRANXX]
It's a backdoor code.

44
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,875
Backdoor code?

45
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,083
[FRANXX] It's targeting
the Stampede mode.

46
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,916
They set it up so
the mode's overload

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,041
would cause an
internal explosion.

48
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:54,041
[FRANXX laughs]
They got me. They got me good!

49
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,166
If this thing blows,
the planet will go with it.

50
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,416
And Code Zero-One-Six
prevented that from happening?

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,125
[FRANXX]
All he's done is slow it down.

52
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,833
As things stand, it will
reach critical in...

53
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,541
[HACHI gasps]

54
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,833
[ZERO TWO] So, that's how much
time my darling bought us, huh?

55
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,791
[HACHI]
Code Zero-Zero-Two?

56
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,000
[MIKU] Don't you think it's
too dangerous to stay here?

57
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
What else are we
supposed to do?

58
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,291
[ICHIGO]
Hey, calm down.

59
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,625
We should assume we won't get
any more orders from above.

60
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,750
Which means we'll have to
deal with this ourselves.

61
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,333
[IKUNO] They were saying
some pretty strange stuff

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,750
in that last message.

63
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,625
Uh-huh. About using Star Entity
as a bomb or something.

64
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,500
They also said that the
whole planet would explode.

65
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,125
[grunts] Yeah, nothing
they said sounded normal.

66
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,541
[ZOROME]
What does that mean?

67
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,291
Wasn't that thing supposed
to put an end to the war?

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,666
[ICHIGO gasps]

69
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,208
[ICHIGO] We should go
and see for ourselves.

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,125
If the bomb thing is real, we
don't have time to stand around.

71
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,333
You're right. And I'm worried
about Hiro and Zero Two.

72
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,916
[MIKU]
Yeah, good point. Okay then.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
[ICHIGO] We're heading back...
to the Gran Crevasse!

74
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,583
[HIRO screams]

75
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:23,208
[001] It's no use. VIRM got me.
It's over. We've lost.

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,833
These VIRM,
what exactly are they?

77
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,625
Who are these guys that
came from the sky?

78
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,833
The ones your people fought?

79
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,500
When I connected
with you, I felt it.

80
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,625
The passing of an
unbelievable amount of time.

81
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,416
When did it begin?

82
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:52,500
She said that I was a fake.
What was that all about?

83
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,208
What did she mean?

84
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:00,000
[FRANXX] She is the sole
survivor of the klaxo-sapiens,

85
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,666
and you... are her clone.

86
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,291
[001] It has been more than
60 million years now.

87
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,125
[001] We inhabited this planet,
as a civilization

88
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,666
far more advanced than yours.

89
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,458
[001]
But one day, VIRM arrived.

90
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,750
They were a group mind
with no physical bodies,

91
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,791
and they wanted us to join them.

92
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,208
[HIRO]
Join them?

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,166
[001] They were telling us
to cast aside our bodies.

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,166
We refused, and war broke out.

95
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,250
[001]
During that centuries-long war,

96
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,833
we reforged ourselves
into immortal weapons.

97
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:51,083
And evolved into what you
people call "klaxosaurs."

98
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,791
By the time we finally
fought off VIRM,

99
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,125
fighting and warfare
was all that remained

100
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,583
of our civilization.

101
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,875
We had even lost our
ability to procreate.

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,666
[001]
But things did not end there.

103
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,416
The enemy we had fought off
was but VIRM's vanguard.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,708
With no innate form,
they kept expanding,

105
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,833
adding weapons of the planets
they devour to their arsenal.

106
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,291
[HIRO]
No.

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,541
[001] To prepare for
VIRM's inevitable return,

108
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
we went underground.

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:31,708
The weak turned themselves into
energy, and the strong combined,

110
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,791
evolving into even
stronger weapons.

111
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,166
[FRANXX] That is how the
klaxo-sapiens built Star Entity,

112
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,333
a collective mass
of klaxosaurs.

113
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,291
Only a klaxo-sapiens
can operate it.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,500
The klaxosaur princess has
probably lived millions of years

115
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,625
for that very purpose.

116
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,125
[FRANXX] Zero Two, you were
created to operate Star Entity

117
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,333
on behalf of the human race.

118
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,625
I created you from her DNA.

119
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,625
[001]
Even if victory was impossible,

120
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,208
I wanted to take down as
many of them as I could,

121
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,166
but this is the end.

122
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,083
It's all over.

123
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,833
[HIRO grunts]
Is it really the end?

124
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,250
[001]
Huh?

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,375
Is there really nothing
more you can do?

126
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,875
[001]
That's right.

127
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,625
[FRANXX] Many specimens were
born, but failed to survive.

128
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,833
You were the only success.

129
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,125
Eventually, with the idea of
using them as either backups

130
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,625
or stamens, I created
clones using your cells, too.

131
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,833
But they didn't inherit
the klaxosaur blood.

132
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,125
[MIKU grunts]

133
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,458
[ALL gasp]

134
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,416
[gasps] Clones from... my cells?

135
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,500
[FRANXX]
The Nines.

136
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,916
[ICHIGO]
It's you guys.

137
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,250
[9'a]
Why are you here?

138
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,375
You know as well as I do
this isn't your squad's post.

139
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,625
Leaving without permission can
be considered disobeying orders.

140
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,208
Return to your assignment.

141
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,166
When Papa gives you an order,
you follow it no matter what.

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
[IKUNO] That's meaningless at
this point! The bomb is going--

143
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,041
[9'e] That doesn't matter,
it's not your call to make.

144
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,291
It's Papa's.

145
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,625
[ICHIGO] And we can't
get in touch with him,

146
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
which means we're on our own!

147
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,166
We have to analyze and
make our own decisions!

148
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,750
Our own decisions?

149
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,250
Do you guys seriously think that
you're special or something?

150
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,041
Papa's words are absolute,
you understand?

151
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,875
[9'a]
Tsk. Damn monsters.

152
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,750
Kill every last one of them!

153
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,208
[9'a shouts]

154
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,625
Those guys are completely nuts!

00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,625

Oh, yeah! Hurry!

159
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,416
[MITSURU grunting]
Kokoro! Let's go.

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,708
[KOKORO]
Uh, right.

161
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,208
What is with those guys anyway?

162
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,125
[9'e]
Delta! To your left!

163
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,833
[9'd grunts]
What?

164
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,458
[gasps]

165
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,625
[9'e screams]

00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,791
[9'a]
Delta! Epsilon!

00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,625
[9'd grunts]

168
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
[9'a]
Hang on, you two!

169
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,833
[9'y] We'll get rid
of them right away!

170
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,625
[9'd screams]
No! I don't wanna die!

171
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,458
[9'e screaming]
Help me!

172
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,125
[9'd whimpers, screams]

173
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,125
Screw every one of you.

174
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,750
Screw every one of you!

175
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,458
[9'a yells]

176
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,291
[ZERO TWO]
Okay, I'm going.

177
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,625
[HACHI]
Where?

178
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,166
[ZERO TWO]
To bring back my darling.

179
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
[HACHI]
Don't push yourself.

180
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,708
[ZERO TWO]
My darling is waiting for me.

181
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
[FRANXX]
What can you do there?

182
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,500
Star Entity is probably
rigged with VIRM traps.

183
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:23,083
Even if you took it back, you'd
only end up falling into them.

184
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,541
[ZERO TWO]
So what?

185
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,541
[FRANXX]
Hm?

186
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,458
[ZERO TWO]
The klaxosaur princess?

187
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,708
VIRM? I don't care.

188
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,041
I don't care if I'm a fake,
or a monster, or whatever.

189
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,416
My darling and I made a promise.

190
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,333
To be together forever.

191
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,541
And that we'd go get the
other if we were torn apart.

192
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
[HACHI] But we learned
the door to the entry point

193
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,083
only opens for
Code Zero-Zero-One.

194
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,583
[FRANXX]
Very well. I'll go with her.

195
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,833
[HACHI]
Doctor?

196
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,875
[gasps]

197
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,708
[MIKU screams]

198
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,416
[ICHIGO yells]

199
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,458
Everyone...

200
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
[ALL] 
Zero Two!

201
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,666
[ZERO TWO]
Mm!

202
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,833
[FRANXX]
Zero-One-Six's connection has

203
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,833
delayed their plans,
if only briefly.

204
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,708
He is most definitely an
unknown factor to VIRM.

205
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,541
The klaxosaur princess,
Zero-One-Six, and you,

206
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,708
together, the three of you
could create a miracle.

207
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,250
You think so?

208
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,000
[FRANXX]
It's a highly optimistic view

209
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,375
with no basis whatsoever.
Some might call it blind hope.

210
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,416
Even so,

211
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,333
it's still a lot better than
standing no chance at all.

212
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,375
[MIKU]
Man, these guys don't give up!

213
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,708
[ZOROME]
Now there's another!

214
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,708
[ICHIGO gasps]

215
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,125
[GORO]
It's caved in!

216
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,791
[MITSURU]
No! We'll have to take a detour!

217
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,250
[ICHIGO] There's not
enough time for that!

218
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]

219
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,041
[IKUNO]
Get back, everyone.

220
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,750
[MIKU]
What are you doing, Ikuno?

221
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,458
[IKUNO] Futoshi! We're going
to open up a path!

222
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,583
Right!

223
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,666
[ICHIGO]
Wait, Ikuno! If you do that--

224
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,291
[ALL grunt]

225
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,541
[ICHIGO]
Are you okay?

226
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:32,875
--[IKUNO pants]
--[FUTOSHI] Ikuno! Your hair!

227
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,291
[ZOROME]
Damn it!

228
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,541
[IKUNO]
Ichigo! Move!

229
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,208
[ICHIGO]
How can I?

230
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,791
[KOKORO] I'll stay behind.
The rest of you, go on ahead.

231
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,958
[MIKU]
The hell we will!

232
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:44,875
[KOKORO]
Huh?

233
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,958
[MIKU]
We're staying with you!

234
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,875
You're not gonna
throw your life away!

235
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,458
[KOKORO]
But Miku...

236
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,291
[MITSURU]
Kokoro.

237
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,791
[KOKORO gasps]

238
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
I think our teammates are
making the right call on this.

239
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,916
We should fight together.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,291
[KOKORO]
Mm.

241
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,583
[ZOROME]
Either way,

242
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,791
we'll need manpower to
hold these things off.

243
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,041
[MIKU] Okay, there you have it.
So get going already!

244
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,291
Ichigo.

245
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,958
[ICHIGO]
I understand.

246
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,833
[IKUNO]
Zero Two. Get Hiro for us.

247
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,500
[FUTOSHI]
After we save the world,

248
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,875
let's have a big feast together!
We'll even make a bunch

249
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,125
of your favorite sweets
things for it, too!

250
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,791
[ZERO TWO]
Mm.

251
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,750
[ICHIGO]
You take care of Chlorophytum!

252
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,083
And don't you guys dare die!

253
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,250
[GORO]
Let's go!

254
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,625
[ZOROME]
Welp, leader's orders.

255
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,458
Miku? We're gonna survive,
no matter what!

256
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,000
[MIKU]
Of course we are!

257
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,541
[KOKORO gasps]

258
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,833
[MITSURU]
Here they come!

259
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:46,083
[HIRO breathes heavily]

260
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,375
[001]
Why? Why do you still struggle?

261
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,333
This battle was never
yours to fight.

262
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,041
I used to be the same.

263
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,083
[001]
Huh?

264
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,416
I was the same way
as you people.

265
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,916
I never doubted for a second
that my purpose in life

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,333
was to fight, and I
wasn't afraid to die.

267
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,500
But you know what
I came to learn?

268
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,750
You don't call that living.

269
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,666
Meeting Zero Two
helped me understand.

270
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,208
Crying, Laughing,
Falling in love.

271
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,583
The time we spend doing those
things is truly valuable.

272
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,333
And I realized I wanted
to protect it all.

273
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,958
[001 gasps]

274
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,458
[HIRO] But if we march into
death, we'll lose everything.

275
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,333
It'll all be gone.

276
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,875
And I'm not having that!

277
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,500
I will never give up,
you hear me!

278
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,708
I promised her... that I'd
be with her forever.

279
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,250
[001 gasps]

280
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,083
I don't just live
to fight anymore.

281
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
I'm going to fight to live.

282
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,791
What the...? Is that Hringhorni?

283
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,375
Who's operating it?

284
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:17,041
[9'a]
Hey, Papa. Say something.

285
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,958
What are we to do?

286
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,791
[GORO]
Crap! It's catchin' up!

287
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,833
[ICHIGO]
Zero Two! How much farther?

288
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,250
[ZERO TWO]
I see it!

289
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,958
[ICHIGO grunts]

290
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,416
[gasps] It's over there!

291
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,791
[GORO] They keep coming.
Go! Get Hiro for us!

292
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,291
[ICHIGO] Both of you had
better come back together.

293
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,625
If either of you is missing,
there's going to be hell to pay!

294
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,208
Thanks, you two.

295
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,083
[GORO]
You're not getting past!

296
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,208
[ICHIGO grunts]

297
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,708
[ICHIGO screams]

298
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,791
Damn it!

299
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,000
[ZERO TWO]
Ichigo! Goro!

300
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,500
[FRANXX]
Dig in. It's your master's arm.

301
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,958
[FRANXX groans]

302
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,083
[ZERO TWO]
Doctor! Why?

303
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,666
[FRANXX] That contains
the princess's cells.

304
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,458
They didn't turn me into a
klaxosaur like I wanted,

305
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,125
but this will do,

306
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,208
[FRANXX]
Get going.

307
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,541
Doctor.

308
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,541
[FRANXX] It's the least
I could do to atone.

309
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,916
I won't ask for forgiveness.
Feel free to hate me.

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,916
I deserve it for what
I've done to you.

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,958
[growling]

312
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,041
[ZERO TWO]
Are you telling me to ride you?

313
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,458
All right, then.

314
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,375
[ZERO TWO]
Hey.

315
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,583
[FRANXX]
Hm?

316
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,708
[ZERO TWO] Did you take
me to Plantation 13,

317
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,250
to reunite me with my darling?

318
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,541
[FRANXX]
Who knows?

319
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,625
It's not like I was
expecting you two

320
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:48,125
to rekindle what you had.
It was just a scientist's whim.

321
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,958
A fancy.

322
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,625
[ZERO TWO]
That's so you.

323
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,291
[ZERO TWO]
I should say this before I go.

324
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,791
[FRANXX]
Hm?

325
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,708
'Cause you created me and
helped me meet my darling.

326
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,166
So, thank you.

327
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,208
[FRANXX]
When did she become so... human?

328
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
[ZERO TWO grunts]

329
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,541
[ZERO TWO grunts]

330
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you.

331
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,083
[ZERO TWO]
Strelizia.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,333
[ZERO TWO]
Wait for me... darling.

333
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,375
Darling!

334
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,250
[ZERO TWO] Darling! I'm here!
I kept my promise!

335
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,458
Hey! Darling!

336
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,541
Wake up! Open your eyes!
Why aren't you saying anything?

337
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,291
Please, talk to me!

338
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,833
Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey, hey!

339
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm talking to you!

[ZERO TWO gasps]

341
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,458
Oh, no...

342
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,458
[alarm buzzes]

343
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,333
So then, it didn't work.

344
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,958
[ZERO TWO]
I will... never accept this.

345
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,083
And I will never give up!

346
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,833
Please wait for me, darling.

347
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
[001]
Is this what living is for you?

348
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,625
I'm beginning to understand.

349
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,833
We believed by
abandoning our ties

350
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
and embracing solitude,

351
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,375
we could perfect ourselves
and become stronger.

352
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,041
However... perhaps some lives

353
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,125
only shine in unison
with another.

354
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,458
[001]
Very well.

355
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,541
I shall give you every ounce of
strength that remains within me.

356
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,166
Whether you can take over the
controls will be up to you.

357
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,833
[001]
This planet and its future...

358
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,666
...I stake... on the two of you.

359
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,250
[ZERO TWO]
Darling. Darling?

360
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
[HIRO]
Zero Two.

361
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,000
I did it. I kept my promise.

362
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,458
I believed you would.

363
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,166
Everybody helped me
get back to you.

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,166
[HIRO]
Zero Two, I missed you.

365
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,375
[ZERO TWO]
Same here, darling.

366
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,250
[BOTH chuckle]

367
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,500
What is this?

368
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:07,541
[001] Humans, we shall
take flight once more.

369
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:13,125
Decide whether you want to
fight or accept your ruin.

370
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,541
[APE VICE CHIEF] Strelizia is
rejecting all attempts

371
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,708
at interference.

372
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,666
[PAPA]
It broke free of our program?

373
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,083
[ZERO TWO] Right now, I feel you
closer to me than ever before.

374
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:33,166
I know what you're thinking,
like the back of my own hand.

375
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,166
No matter what happens,
from here on out,

376
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,750
our hearts will always
be as one, darling!

377
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:44,875
[HIRO shouts]

378
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,458
[FRANXX]
I see it! I see it!

379
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:12,875
Ah. How beautiful you are,
my Apus, Strelizia.

380
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,375
Apus!

381
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,166
[APE VICE CHIEF]
We have no choice.

382
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,083
We'll settle for the lance of
life built from klaxosaurs.

383
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,875
We wanted more, but we'll
withdraw for now.

384
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,416
[PAPA]
But know that we will return.

385
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,541
And when do, we'll bring
our full army,

386
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:49,250
and erase this planet
from existence.

387
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,833
[9'a]
Papa...

388
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,208
[pants]

389
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,458
It looks like we
did it, Zero Two.

390
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,208
Zero Two?
