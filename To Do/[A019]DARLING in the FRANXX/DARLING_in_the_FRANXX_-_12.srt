00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,583
Where'd that question
come from?

172
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,333
Obviously, Papa and the
other adults made us.

173
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,625
Is that really
the truth, though?

174
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,791
[ALL sigh]

175
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,875
[ZOROME] Kokoro,
you're acting kinda weird.

176
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,250
[NANA]
There you are!

177
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,833
I've never seen
children disobey orders

178
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
and get yelled at
like that before.

179
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,375
You and your squad
truly are interesting.

180
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,000
Can't you go bother
someone else?

181
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,625
[9'a] How cold. The Nines and
I are going to be leaving soon,

182
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,958
so what's a little
chat going to hurt?

183
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,000
[9'a] I hear you guys are
actually a test team.

184
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
One formed by Dr. Franxx.

185
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
Is that why they give you
so much more freedom

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,208
than the squads from
the other plantations?

187
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,208
Just what kind of tests
do they have you doing?

188
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,250
I'd love to hear the details.

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,875
Only one of Iota's partners
has ridden with her more than

190
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,375
three times, and that's
Code Zero-One-Six.

191
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,416
Could that, perhaps,
be related to your tests?

192
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
What are you trying to say?

193
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,000
Ah, you finally looked
my way. If you want,

194
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,750
I can let you in
on a big secret.

195
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,791
I'll tell you what
Code-Zero-Zero Two

196
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,166
is really like.

197
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,750
[ICHIGO gasps]

198
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,125
She can never co-exist with you
and your other squad members.

199
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,500
Right now, she's merely
wearing a human disguise

200
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,708
and pretending that she can.

201
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,041
[ICHIGO gasps]

202
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,833
[HACHI]
Five Moho-class.

203
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,000
They aren't much
of a threat, but...

204
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,708
[NANA]
Why have they shown up here?

205
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,041
That's the real question.
Seeing as no klaxosaur

206
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,791
has ever been sighted
in this area before.

207
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,541
Is it possible they've become
aware of what we're up to?

208
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,208
[HACHI]
All FRANXX, prepare to sortie.

209
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,208
[HIRO]
Sorry. I'm here!

210
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,750
[HIRO gasps]
Zero Two, your horns.

211
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,333
Quit staring already.

212
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,208
Oh... Sorry.

213
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,375
[ZERO TWO]
Darling?

214
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,916
Let's kill a whole lot of
klaxosaurs again today.

215
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,583
[ZERO TWO grunts]

216
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,708
[ZERO TWO]
Huh?

217
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,708
[ZERO TWO grunts]

218
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,416
Hold on!

219
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,291
[ICHIGO] Strelizia! Make sure
you follow the plan!

220
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,416
[HIRO]
Yeah, you're being too direct!

221
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,250
[ZERO TWO]
Oh, shut up!

222
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,458
As long as we kill them all,
what difference does it make?

223
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,083
Hiro, check your four o'clock!

224
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,291
[HIRO]
Damn it.

225
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,666
[HIRO]
Zero Two! Pay attention!

226
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,541
[ZERO TWO grunts]
Why, you...!

227
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,333
You're chasing them too far!
We have to work with the others!

228
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,875
[KOKORO]
They're fast!

229
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,458
[IKUNO] Strelizia!
There's more coming your way!

230
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,333
[ZERO TWO]
I'll crush them all at once!

231
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:14,041
Why aren't you listening
to me? Zero Two!

232
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,083
Damn!

233
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,416
[ZERO TWO grunts]
Darling!

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,208
Why are you getting
in my way now, too?!

235
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,541
[HIRO]
Fire!

236
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,375
[HIRO panting]

237
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,333
Not sure how, but we got 'em.

238
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,500
[ZERO TWO]
You damn monsters.

239
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,000
Take this. And this!

240
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,666
Zero Two! That's enough!

241
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,250
You don't need to
hit them, anymore!

242
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:53,625
[ZERO TWO] Damn you! I'm going
to kill every single one of you!

243
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,791
And become human.

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,666
We're out of power.

245
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,000
[IKUNO] I think you
went a bit overboard.

246
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,750
[MIKU]
That was kinda scary.

247
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,208
[ICHIGO]
Uh...

248
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,458
[HIRO gasps]

249
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,416
[HIRO]
Zero Two.

250
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,000
[HIRO gasps]

251
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,708
[HIRO]
Your nails are peeling off!

252
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,666
And you're covered in bruises.

253
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,291
[ZERO TWO]
Let go.

254
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,375
[ZERO TWO]
Kill them.

255
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,250
[HIRO]
What?

256
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,250
I don't have much time.
I need to kill more.

257
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,500
So many more klaxosaurs.

258
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,750
I wanna hurry up
and become human.

259
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:09,375
You mentioned that earlier.
What did you mean?

260
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:15,208
[ZERO TWO] I'm going
to be human... Human.

261
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,708
[HIRO]
Snap out of it, Zero Two!

262
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,458
I have no idea why you're
so fixated on being human,

263
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
but you are who you are!

264
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,458
How you were born
doesn't matter!

265
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,583
And neither do your
horns and fangs!

266
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,208
[ZERO TWO]
Shut your damn mouth!

267
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,791
[HIRO] I was attracted
to the person you are!

268
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,166
It doesn't matter
whether you're human!

269
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
This entire time, I've been
trying to figure out why

270
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,583
I felt this way about you.

271
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,625
And after watching Goro
and Futoshi, I understand.

272
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,833
I know what this feeling is!

273
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,708
Zero Two, I love you! I love you
exactly the way that you are!

274
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,666
"Love me"? What's that mean?

275
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,958
[HIRO grunts]

276
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,708
[HIRO]
What are you--?

277
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:06,250
[ZERO TWO] Is this it? It's what
you're talking about, right?

278
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,750
Then I'll teach you what
comes after kissing.

279
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,541
[HIRO]
No, that's not it--

280
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[HIRO gasps] Stop that!
This isn't what I meant!

281
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,291
You're wrong. I was...

282
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:27,166
This is so tedious.
Just hurry up and let it out.

283
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,500
But this isn't enough.
You still have to kill more

284
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,875
of those monsters
and make me human!

285
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,333
After all, you're nothing
more than my fodder!

286
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,000
[HIRO gasps]

287
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,500
[HIRO]
Fodder?

288
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,750
[HACHI] The detailed testing
shows that Code Zero-Zero-Two's

289
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,041
rate of saurification
has accelerated

290
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,375
since they became partners.

291
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,541
And Code Zero-One-Six's
numbers are nearing

292
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,625
the upper limit as well.
If this keeps up,

293
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,250
he could very well undergo
a genetic transformation.

294
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,916
[NANA] Are you saying
that he would no longer

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,541
be considered human?

296
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:11,583

297
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:19,625
[ZERO TWO breathes heavily]

298
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,458
Hey, could I talk
to you for a se--

00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,208
[glass shatters]

300
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:46,125
[ZERO TWO] Don't show me...
Don't reflect me!

301
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,708
[ZERO TWO grunts]

302
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,291
Zero Two, what're you doing?

303
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,541
[ICHIGO gasps]

304
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,750
[gasps]

305
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,708
[9'a] Why do you think it is
that Iota came to be known

306
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,875
as "the Partner Killer"?

307
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,041
Because she curses her partners.

308
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,625
It's how she drains
their lives away.

309
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,000
That power is what she
uses to pilot the FRANXX.

310
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,208
And she can do that

311
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,916
because Iota's the key
to saving the world.

312
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,791
What are you saying?
This makes no sense.

313
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,708
She's used and discarded
more than a hundred stamens.

314
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,666
And I'm only counting
the ones I'm aware of.

315
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,958
Code Zero-One-Six is
an exceptional case.

316
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,291
Maybe he has a special ability
that keeps him going.

317
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,125
However, if he continues
to ride with her,

318
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,625
then the curse might turn
him into the same kind of

319
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,000
monster that she is.

320
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,333
She must believe that the
more klaxosaurs she kills,

321
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,083
the closer she gets
to being human.

322
