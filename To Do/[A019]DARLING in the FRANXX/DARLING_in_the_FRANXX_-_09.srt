00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,458
Right. I'll try to come up
with something on my end.

176
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,625
[HIRO]
Goro...

177
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,875
I'm sorry that we had
to leave you behind.

178
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,250
[GORO]
Don't worry about it.

179
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,750
Anyway, I'm wasting power here,

180
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,875
so I'm gonna switch to
safe mode for a bit.

181
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,041
[HIRO]
All right. We'll be in touch.

182
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,291
Without a pistil
aboard the FRANXX,

183
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,291
he can't use its
magma energy.

184
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,583
You mean...

185
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,208
No need to worry.

186
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,250
After all, the FRANXX's life
support systems run off

187
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,791
of backup power.

188
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,541
[ZERO TWO] Which... means if
it runs out, he'll die.

189
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,708
[ALL gasp]

190
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,375
Well, as things stand now,
this plantation,

191
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,041
along with all of us,
will soon be going kaboom.

192
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,291
[MIKU]
Hang on!

193
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,916
[IKUNO gasps]
Ichigo?

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,458
You should still be in bed!

195
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,041
I need answers. What's this
about Goro getting swallowed up?

196
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,666
Like I already told you,
he was trying to save us and...

197
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,125
"And"? Why aren't we
rescuing him yet?

198
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,625
How could you turn tail?

199
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,291
This very second, he's trapped
inside that klaxosaur!

200
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,000
That fool. Why did he
cut me loose like that?

201
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,666
Without me, he knows
that he's helpless!

202
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,666
Ugh. So annoying. C'mon, girl.

203
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,875
How have you not realized
that Goro is always

204
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,375
--looking out for you?
--[ICHIGO] What?

205
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,833
Like that time when
Hiro almost died.

206
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,208
You immediately broke down,

207
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,250
and who was it that got
you back on your feet?

208
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,708
What makes you think
you have the right

209
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,000
to run your mouth at me?

210
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,875
You're always like,
"I'm the leader."

211
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,708
But when things go wrong, you
lose it and take it out on us.

212
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,208
Do you get what I'm saying?

213
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,708
Goro must be miserable
with you as a partner!

214
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,791
[ICHIGO grunts]

215
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,166
[door hisses]

216
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,958
All right, girls, that's enough.

217
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,333
I'm glad to see you
children are okay.

218
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,958
Good, you're all here.

219
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,625
We've analyzed the samples
stuck on your units.

220
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,000
The results show this klaxosaur
can vaporize its bodily fluids

221
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,041
to expand and explode.

222
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,125
Wait. You mean what
Goro's stuck in

223
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,041
is essentially its fuel source?

224
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,458
[HIRO gasps]

225
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,875
Just relax. Fortunately,
we've confirmed several details

226
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,333
about this creature.

227
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,458
Such as the part Delphinium
jumped into being harmless

228
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,041
to FRANXX.

229
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,541
All right! Then the first order
of business is rescuing Goro!

230
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,666
I do owe him one, after all.

231
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,916
The top priority, is keeping
the target from the plantation.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,541
[KIDS gasp]

233
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,833
[HACHI] Estimated time of
contact is approximately

234
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,375
one hour from now.

235
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,125
We'll set up a last
line of defense,

236
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,791
and eliminate the klaxosaur
before it crosses that line.

237
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,291
But, sir, what if we can't
eliminate it by then?

238
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,916
In that case, the planation
will open fire, as well.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,041
The target will defend
itself by detonating its

240
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,458
internal fuel several times.

241
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,625
However, if we launch
enough strikes,

242
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,208
there's a chance one
will eventually finish it.

243
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,500
[ALL gasp]

244
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,708
Are you telling us you
would leave Goro to die?

245
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,458
In the worst-case
scenario, absolutely.

246
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,541
No way.

247
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,916
[HACHI]
You have your orders.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,416
The operation begins
in 15 minutes.

249
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,041
All hands, prepare to sortie.

250
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,083
[ALL gasp]

251
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,875
[ICHIGO] Sir. Please allow me to
speak to Goro before we start.

252
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,083
[GORO]
Is that water?

253
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,583
How long ago did Hiro radio?
Thirty minutes?

254
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,875
[GORO] There's only
one thing I can do now.

255
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,208
[ICHIGO]
Goro.

256
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,500
Ichigo? You're up.
Thank goodness.

257
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,000
[ICHIGO]
You idiot!

258
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,833
What were you thinking, getting
yourself swallowed whole?

259
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,583
Why do you always put
yourself second like this?

260
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,166
How are you going to get
out of there without me?

261
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,958
You've always been
like this, too!

262
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,625
Making selfish decisions.

263
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,375
And every time, it ends up
with you coming back hurt!

264
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,208
Why don't you ever just
lean on me a little?

265
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,291
I'll save you. No matter what,
I'll save you.

266
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,333
So wait for me!

267
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,541
Ichigo.

268
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,750
[gasps] Whoa, hold on.
Are you crying?

269
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,083
[ICHIGO]
Shut up.

270
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:38,000
It's all right, Ichigo. I came
up with a really good plan.

271
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,583
I'm gonna kill this thing.

272
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:45,041
Then I'm coming back home
to you, so don't worry about me.

273
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,416
How are you gonna kill
it when you can't move?

274
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,125
[GORO] I gotta go.
I can't waste more power.

275
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,958
No, Goro!

276
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,875
Hey. I've got this,
even by myself.

277
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,333

278
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,500

279
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,250
[ICHIGO]
Please, let me rescue Goro!

280
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,500
If I know him, he's thinking
of doing something stupid!

281
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,500
He's just trying to
act tough! I can tell!

282
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,250
[HIRO]
She's right! Please, let us go!

283
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,875
[NANA] And how exactly do
you intend to rescue him?

284
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,916
Well, I suppose.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,458
[ZERO TWO]
There was one spot.

286
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,375
On top of the klaxosaur is an
exhaust hole of some sort.

287
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,125
A person could probably slip
in there if they really tried.

288
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,083
[gasps]

289
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,416
[HACHI] Genista and
Chlorophytum are standing by

290
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,875
as the last line of defense.

291
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,708
If it looks like the target is
going to cross that point...

292
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,041
Right. I understand.

293
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,291
[HIRO] You'll have to cross an
area of highly pressurized

294
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,625
vapor fuel to get
to Delphinium.

295
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,250
There's no guarantee you'll
be safe, even in your suit.

296
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,708
[ICHIGO] Yeah, I know.
But there's a chance.

297
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,250
Isn't that right?

298
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,875
[ZERO TWO] We can't be sure.
If it were me, I wouldn't do it.

[HIRO]
Hey! Zero Two!

300
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,500
[ICHIGO] Well, I will.
And Zero Two? I believe in you!

Sick of the communal lifestyle,

00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,041
I thought I'd get to be alone...

00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,333
...if I could make
everybody else hate me.

312

[ICHIGO] Hey, you shouldn't
pick so many fights

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500

I never asked for your help.

[ICHIGO]
Yeah, but we won.

Maybe we can't win alone,

[GORO gasps]

328
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:45,833
[GORO] Yeah. Ever since then,
I've loved Ichigo.

329
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,666
And always right
beside her... was Hiro.

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,625
[GORO]
But I was okay with that.

331
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:14,625
Because Hiro was special
to me, too. In his own way.

mind if my feelings never got

one thing I regret...

enough to self-destruct.

Why'd you come?

I said I'd save you
no matter what, right?

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,041
[GORO grunts] And I said
not to worry about me.

Yeah, well, you're an idiot,

352

so I knew you would try to
fix everything by yourself.

You're so headstrong,
even though you're weak.

Even though you can't
do anything without me.

355

That doesn't mean
you had to come here.

You were willing to cry over me.

I thought I could be
satisfied just knowing that...

...until a moment ago.

Oh. You had it the whole time.

to give you a long time ago,

I love you, Ichigo.
