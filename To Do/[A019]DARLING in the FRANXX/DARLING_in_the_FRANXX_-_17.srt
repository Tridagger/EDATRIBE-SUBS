and wanna know her better.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,291
[MITSURU] Oh. So that's what
this is. I love Kokoro.

175
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,416
Sorry if I'm mistaken.

176
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,583
Your situation
could be different.

177
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,083
I only know how it is for me.

178
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,458
It's okay. I think that's
very much like you.

179
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
I'm glad that we talked.

180
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,666
We haven't done this
in a long time.

181
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Oh! There he is!

182
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,333
[BOTH]
Hm?

183
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,333
We heard about you...
and her. Blame Zorome.

184
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,625
I have to say, I'm not
the least bit surprised.

185
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,291
Hey all I did was casually
ask if a boy and girl

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,500
getting touchy-feely was
some sorta cool thing to do!

187
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,541
That's enough!
Stop being such a baby!

188
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,708
Mitsuru! Tell me,
did you... kiss her?!

189
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
[MITSURU]
Uh, well...

190
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:12,333
Not my Kokoro! Someone wake
me from this nightmare!

191
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,750
[IKUNO]
Settle down.

192
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,791
[FUTOSHI] But, if you two
are happy, who am I to...

193
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,375
[FUTOSHI sobs]

194
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:23,375
Oh. Hey, everybody. Do any
of you recognize this?

195
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,458
[gasps]

196
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
It looks like you do.

197
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,416
Then surely you won't mind
giving us an explanation.

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,625
Right, Code Five-Five-Six?

199
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,875
[9'a] You are the one who
dropped this book, aren't you?

200
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,500
But this is strange.

201
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,166
It wouldn't be provided
in the study here,

202
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,000
and it certainly
doesn't belong to you.

203
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,791
What's the meaning of this?

204
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,375
[MIKU]
Uh, what is that?

205
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,708
[ZOROME]
What's that book about?

206
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,916
Well, um...

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,958
[KOKORO] I'm sorry for
not telling you all.

208
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,541
Everyone? I want to make a baby.

209
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,000
[MIKU]
A baby?

210
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
[ICHIGO]
Like animal babies?

211
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,416
[FUTOSHI] And how exactly
would you make one?

212
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Wow. Okay. You are aware
Papa has banned that, right?

213
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,125
[ZOROME gasps] Wait, really?
Sounds like trouble.

214
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,833
She tell you about this?

215
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
[MITSURU]
Mm-mm.

216
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,625
[KOKORO]
O-Okay, sure.

217
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,583
But still, is it really
that terrible a thing?

218
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,416
I mean, this practice is how the
adults, as well as ourselves,

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,791
and every other human,
comes to be born.

220
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,208
Hold on.

221
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,541
Are you saying that Papa
isn't the one who created us?

222
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,875
[KOKORO]
I am.

223
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,583
The truth is, we're the
same as any other animal.

224
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,125
It's what we've done
since ancient times.

225
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,041
That's how. The way every
living thing has been keeping

226
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,958
their species going for
thousands of years!

227
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,750
So... the reason we
have boys and girls

228
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,291
must be because of that.

229
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,250
And... this may
be selfish of me,

230
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,541
but I want to leave
a mark on the world.

231
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,666
Leave something
behind before I'm gone.

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
[9'a]
Leave a mark?

233
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,416
Yes. We've lived
our entire lives

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,125
believing we had no purpose
other than riding the FRANXX

235
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,416
into battle against
the klaxosaurs.

236
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,125
But you know what? That might
not actually be true!

237
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,958
We could carry new lives

238
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,833
and leave them here
as part of the future.

239
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,875
When I learned
that was possible,

240
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,125
it made me feel so happy!

241
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,625
--That's why--
--[9'a] Absolutely disgusting.

242
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,208
[KOKORO]
Huh?

243
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,166
I mean you. You're disgusting.

244
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,500
[KOKORO gasps]

245
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,625
[9'a]
This is ridiculous.

246
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,250
Humans have evolved and cast
their reproductive functions

247
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,583
aside in the process.
If you reject that,

248
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,666
then we will all have to
go back to conforming

249
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,500
to one gender or another.

250
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,500
But, what about...?

251
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,916
Has this thought crossed
your mind? I'm sure it has.

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,333
Gender is a pain.
An annoyance only tolerated

253
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,916
for the sake of
operating the FRANXX.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
And that's all it is.

255
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,458
That's not...!

256
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,083
[9'y whistles]

257
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
Ikuno?

258
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,541
[IKUNO] A pain, huh?
Even if it is, then so what?

259
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,708
[sighs] Humans also cast
away their tendency

260
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,125
to be ruled by emotions.
Especially ones like that.

261
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,375
Such things serve absolutely
no purpose in life.

262
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,375
And yet, look at you people.

263
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,541
Why, you!

264
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
Cut it out, Ikuno!
You need to calm down!

265
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,458
--[IKUNO] Let me go!
--[NANA] That's enough!

266
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,791
[GORO]
Nana! Hachi!

267
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,708
[NANA] This is why I didn't
want to let the Nines in!

268
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,375
I knew it would be
nothing but trouble!

269
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,000
[NANA grunts]

270
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,708
Perhaps, but they were sent
here on Papa's command.

271
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,875
We couldn't just turn them away.

272
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,125
Since it's come to this,

273
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,375
we ought to put an
end to the test.

274
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,875
What test? What do you mean?

275
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,208
We were acting on
the doctor's explicit orders

276
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,083
not to contact you in any
form this past month.

277
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,416
He informed us this would
be Squad 13's final test.

278
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,375
Of course we still monitored
you the entire time.

279
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,916
Which means, we saw you
interact with Mitsuru.

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,833
We know what you
were attempting.

281
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,958
[KOKORO gasps]

282
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,250
So you want to
make a baby, huh?

283
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,208
You know that's something
nobody's allowed to even

284
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,041
speak of, let alone do.

285
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,500
[KOKORO]
But... why not?

286
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,375
Why do our bodies still have
reproductive organs, then?

287
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,500
Solely because they're necessary
for piloting the FRANXX.

288
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,083
[KOKORO gasps]

289
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,458
That's why only children
possess them,

290
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,208
and that's all there is to it.

291
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,291
Don't go thinking you and your
squad are somehow special.

292
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,208
Then what about these feelings?

293
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,625
Why do we still have emotions
if they don't serve a purpose?

294
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,500
[NANA grunts]
Quiet!

295
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,666
Nana, what...?

296
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
[NANA]
I said shut up!

297
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,833
Return to your dorm.

298
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,125
We'll give you your
orders in due time.

299
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,541
[NANA grunts]

300
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,375
[HACHI]
How long?

301
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,416
[NANA]
For a week or so now.

302
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,791
Watching them go about their
lives made me feel so irritated.

303
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,250
[HACHI sighs]

304
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,208
[9'a] Well, well. Did someone
relapse into puberty?

305
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,083
Me? Never. I can't be
going through puberty!

306
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,541
Haven't you two
undergone the procedure?

307
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,666
Emotional Indoctrination.

308
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,291
You should have when
you were both parasites.

309
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,916
Relapsing is really bad news.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,333
You should have her replaced
with a new Nana, Hachi.

311
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,583
[NANA]
Huh?

312
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,875
I hope you go back to
doing your actual job

313
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,625
from now on, instead of getting
into mischief with the doctor.

314
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,416
Well. I'll be reporting
this to Papa and the rest.

315
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,291
[HACHI grunts]

316
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,833
[FRANXX]
So. Nana is useless now.

317
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,375
Doctor. I believe continuing
will be difficult.

318
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,166
[FRANXX] Oh, I'm sure. But I
gained some intriguing data.

319
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,083
The development of humanity's
original reproductive instincts.

320
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,916
That's far beyond
my expectations.

321
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,208
[MALE SAGE B]
This development differs greatly

322
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,916
from human civilization
and culture.

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,625
I never expected
the klaxosaurs

324
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,916
to still possess
such technology.

325
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,166

Humans and klaxosaurs
have waged a war

spanning close to a century,

329
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:34,125
and you have shown truly
admirable spirit and fortitude.

330
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,500
But it is now time for
this protracted war

331
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,916
to be consigned
to the history books.

332
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You no longer stand
any chance of victory.

No! This isn't what we wanted!

We only came here to
ask you to surrender!

Damned human wannabes.

[FUTOSHI] Kokoro sure is
taking a while to return.

[ICHIGO]
Yeah.

348
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,208
[MIKU groans] I had no
idea she was thinking about

349
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,458
stuff like that. I wish she
had talked to me about it.

350
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,250
It's not her fault. Everyone has
things they can't talk about.

351

[ICHIGO gasps]

352
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,166
[MIKU] Do you guys think we
can make babies? Like, really?

353
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,000
How're we supposed to know?

354
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,291
It's not like we were
taught about it.

355
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,916
Another question is,

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,916
if Papa didn't create us,
how exactly were we born?

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,166
Again, how are we
supposed to know?

[GORO]
What do you think, Hiro?

359
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,208
I'm not sure. I mean,
it might be possible.

360
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,041
We may have the potential
to do something

361

Papa never told us about.

362
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416
Like what Kokoro said.

363
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
To leave something
for the future.

364

The future.

365
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,208
To leave a mark.

Hm?

[MIKU]
Envious? Of what?

369
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,791
Of leaving something behind.

370
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,583
My body's incapable
of doing that.

It's wonderful.
You're all wonderful.

You have the ability to
decide your futures,

[MITSURU]
Don't apologize.

382
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,708
You weren't forcing
me to do anything.

So please, Kokoro, I want
to make you happy!

I don't understand. Is it so
wrong to wanna make new life?

Why can't we? Aren't we allowed
to think about the future?

[IKUNO] Everything comes
to an end eventually.

The only difference is whether
it happens sooner or later.

after that, we have no idea.

How foolish.
