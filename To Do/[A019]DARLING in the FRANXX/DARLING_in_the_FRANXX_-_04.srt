Shit. I can do this. I can!

[MITSURU grunts]

175
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,625
I can handle it.
This is nothing.

00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,708
[IKUNO]
Hold on to me.

177
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,666
I don't need your help.

178
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,791
[IKUNO grunts]
You're so stubborn.

179
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,958
[HACHI] We haven't
identified its class yet.

180
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,750
And while we've only
confirmed this one so far,

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,625
there may be more
in hiding, so be careful!

182
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,666
[ALL]
Roger that!

183
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,875
Commence connecting!

184
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,583
I hope for both of our sakes
that you can do this.

185
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,791
Don't worry.
I'll be fine this time.

[HIRO]
That the only one?

189
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,250
As of now, yes. Don't think
putting on your suits

190
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,083
means we'll deploy Strelizia.

191
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,833
[ZERO TWO scoffs]
We didn't say that,

192
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,666

[ICHIGO]
Is it dead?

199
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,250
[GORO] No, I doubt it. I don't
think anyone got its core.

200
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,791
[MIKU]
Well, if we missed its core,

201
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,875
then we better get back to work.

Just saying. This wouldn't
be happening if we were

213
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,500
out there right now.

214
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,125
Out of the question.

215
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,750
Tsh. Killjoy.

216
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:30,166

[door hisses]

00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,750
[SOLDIER B]
Code Zero-Zero-Two.

219
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
You're coming with us.

220
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,166
[NANA] Your escorts. And I'd
obey them, if I were you.

221
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,291
Zero Two, as I said before,

222
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,250
you're going back
to the front lines.

223
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,791
By yourself, of course.

224
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,166
[HIRO]
Wait. I don't understand, why--

225
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,666
[SOLDIER B]
Let's go!

226
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,333
It's easier to leave while that
klaxosaur is preoccupied.

227
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,625
Don't touch me!

228
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,250

[SOLDIER D]
Freeze!

231
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,875
What's this about, Zero Two?

232
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,333
[ZERO TWO] Darling.
Looks like our time is up.

233
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,500
[gasps]

234
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,416
Although I wish it wasn't.

235
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,958
I honestly believed things could
work out between the two of us.

236
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:29,416
I truly wanted to be with you.
But now, this is goodbye.

237
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,833
[HIRO grunts]

238
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,583
But... why?

239
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,791
Bye, Darling.

240
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,500
[SOLDIER D]
Move.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,583
[NANA] Hiro... It was a
direct order from Papa.

242
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,416
[HIRO]
Are the rumors about her true?

243
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,375
That she's a "partner killer"?

244
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,750
It's complex.

245
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,250
Zero Two is a unique
individual that must be kept

246
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,541
on the front lines of this
battle. She's a special pistil.

247
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,708
But with that comes a
great toll for any stamen

248
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,500
who is assigned to
be her partner.

249
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,791
Remember. She's not like you,
or the others in your squad.

250
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,416
[HIRO]
Are you saying she isn't human?

251
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,875
[NANA] That's exactly
what I'm saying, Hiro.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,041
[HIRO]
Is that really how it is?

253
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,000
Also. It's nice that you weren't
frightened by my horns at all.

254
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,791
Are you just like everyone else?
Do you think I'm a monster?

255
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,708
I truly wanted
to be with you.

256
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,208
Bye, Darling.

257
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,916
[HIRO]
No. She is just like us.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,875
[NANA gasps]
What're you doing? Hiro!

259
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,541
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

260
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,500
[ZERO TWO]
Huh?

261
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,291
[SOLDIER D]
What wrong?

262
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,875
It's nothing.

263
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,500
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

264
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,833
[gasps]

265
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,125
[HIRO]
Don't go! Damn it. Stop!

266
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,125
[grunts] Listen to me!
Please, wait!

267
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,125
I was afraid to ride
with you, I admit it!

268
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,291
Honestly, I'm still
kind of afraid.

269
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
But that fear has nothing
to do with the fact

270
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,375
that you aren't human.
It's because I lack resolve!

271
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,083
When we met by that lake,

272
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,333
I couldn't take my
eyes off of you.

273
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,250
You looked so strong.
So confident.

274
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,041
And when you were hurt, you
jumped right back in the fight,

275
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,791
and I found that beautiful.

276
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,500
I'd been moping around.

277
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,458
But during that time I
got to spend with you,

278
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,291
I felt like I could fly!

279
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,375
And you made me realize
that I never really cared about

280
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,333
riding in a FRANXX at all.

281
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,000
What mattered was
riding in one with you!

282
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:09,291
So please, don't
leave me! Zero Two!

283
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,958

284
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,875
[SOLDIER D]
Hey, keep moving.

285
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,791
[ZERO TWO]
How can I leave after that?

286
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,875
[SOLDIERS gasp, grunt]

289
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,916
You're the first person tell
me something so embarrassing.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,125
It's my first, too.

291
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,500
Do you wanna ride now?

292
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,916
I do.

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,625
Lemme hear you say it.

294

295
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:56,541
Okay. I wanna ride in
Strelizia with you again!

297
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,291
Now that's what I
expect from my darling!

[ZERO TWO]
Fast as you can!

299

got through the gates!

Hold it!

305
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,083
You vacate that
FRANXX right now!

306
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,375
I can't. I'm going
out with my darling!

307
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,666
You don't have permission--

308
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,875
[ZERO TWO gasps]
Something wrong, Darling?

309
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,500
What if I can't pilot?
What'll happen?

310
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,458
You can. We can do this!

311
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,791
Well, are you ready?

312
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,291
[HIRO inhales]
Yeah.

313
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,750
[HIRO]
It'll be all right.

314
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,416
If I'm with Zero Two,
I can do this!

315
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,125
[ZERO TWO]
Now, darling, let's fly!

316
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:24,458
I did it. Ha, ha!
I'm doing it! I'm piloting!

317
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,166
[ZERO TWO] That's right!
This is what you're capable of!

318
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,250
This feeling, though, it's like
I'm deep inside of you.

319
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:36,625
I can't tell where I end and
you begin. And yet, I love it!

320
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,291
[ZERO TWO]
I'm feeling it, too.

Let me handle this!

to rely on Strelizia this time!

You take that one.

on this one here.
