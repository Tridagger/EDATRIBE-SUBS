00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,583
There's no need to be nervous.

172
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,166
You won't be battling klaxosaurs

173
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,333
like the one the
other day just yet.

174
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, thank goodness.

175
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,041
[NANA] We would've liked to
ease you in more gradually,

176
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,958
but unfortunately,
we can't afford to.

177
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,083
[HACHI] You'll be facing
a Conrad-class klaxosaur.

178
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,500
It's just a little bit
smaller than a FRANXX.

179
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,958
Klaxosaurs are attracted
to magma-energy reactions.

180
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,875
Lately, they've been showing
up deep in a Level Eight mine

181
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,416
on the outskirts, wreaking all
kinds of havoc there.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,541
Even the automatic bulwark
systems can't keep up with them.

183
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,000
[NANA]
We should mention that Strelizia

184
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,833
won't be a part of this mission.

185
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,208
[gasps]

186
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,375
After all, you parasites are
going to have to defend

187
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,208
Plantation 13 by
yourselves eventually.

188
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,958
[NANA] If you can't
eliminate this klaxosaur,

189
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,500
there's no way you can
handle any in the future.

190
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,083
So just focus on
the task at hand.

191
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,791
Ichigo and Goro will have
command in the field.

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,083
[BOTH]
Right.

193
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,583
[HACHI] That's it.
All hands, prepare to board.

194
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,000
[GORO] Are you still upset
about the mock battle?

195
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,416
'Cause we're going
into actual combat now.

196
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
Gotta switch gears.

197
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,500
[ICHIGO]
Yeah. I know.

198
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,791
[ICHIGO]
Hey.

199
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,333
[GORO]
Huh?

200
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,458
[ICHIGO]
I'll do my best as leader.

201
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,166
You take care of the handling.

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,500
[GORO]
Sure thing. Let's do this.

203
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,166
[ZOROME]
Finally, my first battle!

204
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,875
Just try not to get
so full of yourself

205
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,666
you blow it like last time.

206
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,250
Relax! I've got this!

207
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
[laughs]

208
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,958
Well, I'm not so sure
you've got anything.

209
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,083
[GORO]
Ready, Ichigo?

210
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,083
[ICHIGO]
Yeah. Come to me.

211
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,125

[IKUNO grunts]

213
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,708
[HACHI]
What's wrong, Chlorophytum?

214
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,666
Seems Ikuno's not up to it.

215
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm almost there,
just give me a second!

216
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,291
Don't bother. It's over.

217
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,083
[FEMALE OPERATOR A] It appears,
their para-capacity's too low,

218
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,250
and still falling.

219
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,875
No go, huh?

220
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,125
[HACHI]
Chlorophytum will stay behind.

221
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,125
The other three will
go on without it.

222
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,583
[ICHIGO]
Roger that.

223
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,250
[NANA]
This might be tough.

224
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,166
[KOKORO]
That's a big hole.

225
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,958
How far down do
you think it goes?

226
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,416
[ZOROME] Do you see
that pipe? It's a monster!

227
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,250
[GORO] They used these to
extract the magma reserves?

228
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,083
[HACHI]
Head down to Level Eight.

229
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,666
As you're well aware by now,

230
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,708
in order to completely
neutralize a klaxosaur,

231
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,500
you must first
extract its core,

232
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333
which is essentially its heart,

233
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,083
and then shatter it using your
customized magma-energy weapons.

234
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,875
If the core's destroyed,
so is the klaxosaur.

235
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,041
Got that?

236
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,541
[ALL]
Roger!

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,750
[ICHIGO]
Proceeding to objective.

238
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,791
Both of you, fall in
behind Delphinium.

239
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:03,916
[KOKORO]
Got it.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,916

Miku?

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,333
[MIKU]
Yeah, got it.

242
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,500
[NANA] What happened?
Are you not feeling well?

243
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,666
[IKUNO]
No, nothing like that.

244
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,041
Alright. I guess I shouldn't
be too surprised,

245
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,416
you have always
been a bit unstable.

246
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,166
We'll run some tests
on you tomorrow.

247
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,541
Pardon, but if I may, is it
possible that the two of us

248
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,708
simply have a
compatibility issue?

249
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,041
A lot of teams go
through this at first.

250
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,250
But don't worry,

251
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,333
it isn't grounds for
splitting you two up.

252
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,416
Is that so?

00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,708
[MIKU]
Gimme a break! I didn't die!

341
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,833
[ICHIGO]
Miku. Are you okay?

342
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,291
[MIKU]
I'm fine!

343
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,250
We won't last much longer.

344
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,625
[HACHI]
Strelizia's on its way.

345
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,750
Can you hold out
until it arrives?

346
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,958
[ICHIGO gasps]

347
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,250
All right! If we can
hang on until then...

348
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,458
[KOKORO]
...we're good!

349
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,166
[ICHIGO] Who is it?
Who's piloting it?

350
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,583
Hey, Ichigo! Stay focused.

351
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,958
[grunts] Why'd she
just get so heavy?

352
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,416
Ichigo!

353
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,458
[ICHIGO gasps]

354
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,125
[MIKU]
Hey! Come on!

355
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,291
[MIKU grunts, shouts]

356
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,541
[MIKU]
What's gotten into you?

357
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,083
We can't stay in here!

358
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,875
Let's make a
break for the center!

359
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,333
[GORO]
We can wait for Strelizia here.

360

[ALL gasp]

Oh, no.

362
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,000

We can't handle this many!

363
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,750
[MIKU] Uh, hey, Leader.
What do we do?

364
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,750
[ICHIGO]
If I hadn't let my mind wander

365
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,458
to stupid thoughts
back there,

366
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,125
we wouldn't be in
this mess right now.

367
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,833
And Strelizia could've
made it in time.

368
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,958
[ICHIGO] I'm their leader...
and I've failed.

369
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,000

Strelitzia!

370
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,416

Hiro? Is that you?

371
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,583
[MITSURU]
Get back. All of you.

372
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,875
[ZOROME gasps]
Is that Mitsuru?

373
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,416
[HACHI] All units, evacuate and
let Strelizia handle this.

374
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,458
Roger. Let's move, Ichigo.

375
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,000
[ICHIGO]
Oh, yeah.

376
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:12,375
[pants]
Awesome! I feel the power!

377
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,791
It's like I can do anything!

378
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,125
Amazing how changing partners
can make such a difference.

379
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,500
I knew the problem wasn't me!

380
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm every bit as
good as Hiro is!

381
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,541
Hiro! Are you watching?
We're in perfect sync!

382
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,833
I can pilot Strelizia with ease.

383
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,500
And do it without
losing consciousness!

384
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,250
If you want, Zero Two,

385
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,833
I wouldn't mind becoming
your official partner.

386
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't you think we'd be
the greatest duo ever?

387
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,458
[ZERO TWO]
Really? You mean that?

388
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:52,125
Then... I guess I can try
going all-out for a bit.

390
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,416
[HACHI]
Strelizia, that's enough.

391
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,708
The other units have
all evacuated. Now get out--

392
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,083
[ZERO TWO] Nah, I'm gonna
have some fun before I leave.

393
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,916
Stop it! Get back
here right now!

That girl...

Prepare to recover Strelizia
and its stamen at once.

397
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,458
On the double.

398
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,125
[IKUNO gasps]
"Recover"?

399
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,583
[KOKORO] Looks like
Strelizia saved us all again.

400
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,125
Never expected
Mitsuru to pilot it.

401
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,750
I'm sorry. That was my bad.

402
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,375
Eh. Doesn't matter
whose fault it was.

403
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,625
We're partners, so we're
in this together.

404
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,250
Miku. Thanks!

405
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,958
What's the matter?
You're not yourself.

406
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,208
[ICHIGO]
Sorry.

407
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,541
I guess I let my guard
down once I heard that

408
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,000
help was on the way.

409
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,625
[ICHIGO]
Get it together!

Hey. They're back.

[HIRO]
The hand she held out

413
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,208
and the smile she offered
to me alone came at a price.

[HIRO]
The rumors were true.

418
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,208
Mitsuru's wretched state
was all the proof I needed.

[ZERO TWO]
Yeah, turns out this kid

420
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,291
really isn't cut out
to be my darling.

421
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:29,583
Only you are my darling.
You alone.

422
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,958
[HIRO] And I thought back
to what she said before.

00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,000
"I can get you out of here."
