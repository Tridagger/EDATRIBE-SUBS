[MIKU] Look, you made
your point, alright?

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
That's why I'm trying so hard
to find us things to eat.

I've never been
down here before.

Why's it sealed off?

you for your calm analysis!

I'm being honest,

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,625
Really hard. Y'know,
now that I think about it,

296
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,500
we should try to consider
our parter's feelings more.

297
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,666
Why should we bother to do that?

298

They're nothing but
weirdo wackjobs!

00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,000
[HIRO]
True. I don't get them either.

300
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,958
But that's exactly why I started
wanting to know more about her.

301
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,916
That way, I might be able
to give her better support

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,208
when she needs it.

303
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,875
If you're talking
about Zero Two,

304
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,791
then you're barking
up the wrong tree.

305
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,750
She's extraordinary,
the ultimate pistil

306
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,000
that's never needed help
from anybody, even you.

307
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,541
[HIRO]
No, Zero Two's a normal girl.

308
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,000
And it's not just her.
Their job as pistils

309
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,541
means they rely on us
to handle the controls.

310
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,125
But then, when we
go into battle,

311
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,916
it's their frail bodies
taking the brunt of it.

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,041
Oh, wow. Yeah, that must
be rough on them.

313
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,625
[HIRO] Despite that, they keep
connecting to the FRANXX

314
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,291
and doing their best.
They place their trust in us.

315
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,666
Watching Zero Two like that,
it made me think.

316
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,166
I want to become stronger.
To take care of her.

317
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,083
Better than I can now.

318
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,416
You're right. The girls give
it their all in every battle.

319
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,458
It's wrong of us to
be back there ogling

320
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,958
while they struggle.

321
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,708
Of course they'd want
nothing to do with us.

322
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,083
I can be a man
about this, too, okay?

323
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,333
I'll admit it, even I
feel the need to look

324
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,708
after my partner and
take care of her.

325
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,416
And, believe me, I don't like
seeing the girls in pain

326
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,333
any more than you guys.

327
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,208
Well, then there's only
one thing for us to do.

[ICHIGO]
"Sooner or later we'll all die."

329
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,500
[KOKORO grunts]
Um. Okay! Y'know what?

330
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,541
I don't think we should
let this go on any longer!

331
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,875
There are some things
we can't do by ourselves.

332
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,750
But we can do them if we
work together with the boys!

333
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,041
And it's not just a few things
either, there are lots of them!

334
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,000
The most obvious being
piloting the FRANXX.

335
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,875
And yes, I know.
The boys are perverts.

336
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't even imagine what's
going on in their heads

337
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,416
most of the time.

338
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,125
It's clear that boys and
girls are nothing alike,

339
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,500
but that's why it's good
for us to be together!

340
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,583
After all, that's how--

341
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,375
Well, that's how it gets
to be born, I think.

Like, the future.
And hope. And stuff.

343
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,625
So that's why we should, uh...

344
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,166
Wow, Kokoro. It's not like
you to be so assertive.

345
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,666
Yeah. Surprised me.

346
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,375
[ICHIGO] But still,
as unexpected as that was,

347
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,416
you make a good point.

Huh?

Yeah, we can't just be the
ones who complain all the time.

It's not right.

Whoa! Hold on a second!

352
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,333
You're not thinking
of forgiving the boys!

353

II know it's hard, but we
can't go on like this.

Fine, suit yourselves!

gonna beg for forgiveness.

What's wrong?

00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,625
What is this place?

378
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:24,041
A room belonging to some former
Squad 13 parasites, I'd say.

379
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,541
Former.

380
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,791
Squad 13?

381
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,083
Of course. The plantation had
a defensive squad in the past.

382
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,583
Makes sense.

383
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,541
And then, in time, we were
assigned to defend here as well.

384
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,458
[ZOROME] So, how come
they aren't here now?

385

Well? How come?

386
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,833

Inside that old room,

sat a vase by the window,
with lilacs in it.

I couldn't help but wonder.

What were the former Squad 13
parasites thinking

407
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,875
when they placed them there?

408
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:00,625
There's no way for us to know
that now. But the next day,

409
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:05,000
we went back there and replaced
them with brand new lilacs.

[MIKU]
In the language of flowers,

411
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,166
the lilac means friendship,
fond memories, and also, youth.
