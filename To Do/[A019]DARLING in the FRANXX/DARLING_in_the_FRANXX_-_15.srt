171
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,583
The poor girl.

172
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,541
Come on! How many
more do we have to kill?

173
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,666
[ZOROME] Quit whining, fatty!
We gotta protect our plantation!

174
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,291
[FUTOSHI]
Don't call me that!

175
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,291
[MIKU] Hey, why don't you
fire more of those beams

176
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,375
from earlier?

177
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,541
[IKUNO]
Because I don't have the energy!

178
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,583
And I've blown through
my reserves, too!

179
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,166
[MIKU]
What? No way!

180
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,833
[KOKORO] Don't start fighting.
We all have to work together!

181
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,083
[ICHIGO gasps]

182
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,833
[9'b] My, how scary.
She's in a foul mood today.

183
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,541
Imagine being on the bad
side of that unseemly beast.

184
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
It's enough to give me chills.

185
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,916
[ICHIGO]
Zero Two.

186
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,791
[HIRO] Zero Two. What were you
trying to tell me back then?

187
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,000
[HIRO gasps]

188
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,333
[HIRO] What am I...
What am I hesitating for?

189
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,208
[KOKORO]
We're being pushed back!

190
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,458
[MITSURU] We can't let
them get any farther!

191
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
[IKUNO shouts]

192
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,500
[IKUNO]
I'm out!

193
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,333
[FUTOSHI]
We may not have ammo...

194
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,458
...but we can still fight!

195
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,500
[MIKU grunts]
Hey!

196
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,666
[ZOROME]
Damn you!

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,333
We can't give in!
We have to defend the city!

198
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,500
[GORO]
Hey, Ichigo. Ichigo! Behind us!

199
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,125
[ICHIGO gasps]

200
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,333
We can't afford to lose focus.

201
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,875
[ICHIGO]
Sorry.

202
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,958
[GORO] Hold on. What's a
training unit doing here?

203
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,833
[ZOROME]
Whoa! What's the deal?

204
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:06,291
[MIKU] Wait. You guys!
Is that... Hiro?

205
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,375
[GORO]
That guy.

206
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,041
[HIRO]
When did it happen?

207
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,291
When was it that I
stopped asking questions?

208
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,666
[HIRO]
Back then, all I wanted

209
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,958
was to learn about
the outside world.

210
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,166
To set foot outside the Garden.

211
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,166
I was always fighting alone.

212
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,416
Nobody took a stand with me,
and that was frightening.

213
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,708
But, when I saw you...?

214
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,625
I realized there were others
fighting this world with me.

215
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,916
And that made me so, so happy!

216
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,750
[HIRO]
It has to be you.

217
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,458
Without you...

218
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,666
Without you, I can't fight!

219
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,375
I need you!

220
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,041
[ICHIGO]
Hiro! Why did you come out here?

221
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,666
What do you think you can
do in a training unit?

222
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,375
I'm not going to let you go!

223
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,916
[ICHIGO gasps]

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
[ICHIGO] Hey! Why are you
shutting us down, Goro?

225
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,250
Because I've seen enough.

226
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,583
[ICHIGO]
You what?

227
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,125
I can't stand it anymore.
Seeing them like this.

228
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Hiro, get in.

229
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,375
[HIRO gasps]

230
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,791
You have something to
tell her, don't you?

231
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,166
[HIRO gasps]

232
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,666
All right. Make sure he
gets to Zero Two, Ichigo.

233
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,166
You're also worried
about her, aren't you?

234
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,541
[ICHIGO grunts]

235
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,708
[HIRO]
I'm sorry, Ichigo.

236
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,958
[ICHIGO] All of this boy-girl
stuff is really such a pain.

237
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,166
Let's go!

238
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,125
[ICHIGO]
Hiro's mind is entering mine.

239
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,375
[ZERO TWO]
...being my darling?

240
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:56,041
[ICHIGO]
What are these? Hiro's memories?

241
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,583
No... Don't show me these.

242
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,375
I'm finally connected
to Hiro, but this is...

243
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,125
[HIRO] Wait for me, Zero Two!
I'm coming to you!

244
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,833
Well, damn it.
It's all about her.

245
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,208
[ICHIGO whimpers]

246
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,208
[ICHIGO]
Here we go, Hiro!

247
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,375
[HIRO]
Yeah!

248
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,166
Good luck, bro.

249
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,416
[ZOROME, MIKU] Hey, what're you
acting all cool for?

250
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,458
[ZERO TWO growls]

251
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,250
[ZERO TWO]
How I longed to be human.

252
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,166
[ICHIGO]
Zero Two!

253
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,333
What are you doing?
Why're you--?

254
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,208
[ICHIGO grunts]
I've had enough.

255
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,708
I'm sick and tired of the
way you toy with me.

256
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,625
[ICHIGO shouts]

257
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,500
[HIRO]
Ichigo! Stop it!

258
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:04,458
[ICHIGO grunts] I wish...
that we'd never known you!

259
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,833
[ICHIGO grunts]

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,041
[ICHIGO] I'll let you
have Hiro, all right?

261
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,833
So, c'mon!
Get your act together!

262
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,166
[HIRO]
Zero Two, it's me.

263
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,291
I'm here. I came to see you.

264
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,583
[ICHIGO]
Keep them safe!

265
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,083
I hate to admit it,

266
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,750
but Strelizia's the only one
who can kill that giant lug!

267
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,125
[KOKORO grunts]
Their numbers are dwindling.

268
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,916
[MITSURU]
Even so, stay alert.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,625
[MIKU] I've never killed
so many of them before.

270
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,958
[MIKU gasps]

271
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,125
[ZOROME] Hey, Miku.
There's something in there.

272
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,958
[MIKU]
What... is that?

273
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,625
[IKUNO]
It looks kinda human.

274
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,875
[MIKU] What? That's impossible.
Don't be stupid!

275
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,708
[FUTOSHI] Yeah, there's
no way it could b--

276
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,208
[MIKU gasps]

277
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,625
An explosion?

278
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,333
What the hell is this?

279
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,583
[FEMALE OPERATOR A]
Plantation 37's backup process

280
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,083
is currently 98% complete.

281
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,833
[PAPA]
They can go.

282
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:21,166
Let's release them from
the cages... of their bodies.

283
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,583
What's going on?

284
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,458
Yeah. Weren't adults
still inside there?

285
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,583
It's strange. Are they
making them self-destruct?

286
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,791
And there it goes.

287
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,291
[9'a]
It seems Papa and the rest

288
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,958
are planning to end
this without Strelizia.

289
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,958
[9'b] How many more
will be sacrificed?

290
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,083
[HACHI]
Who goes that far?

291
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,125
[FRANXX]
Of all the foolish...

292
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,708
Still not getting a response.
No choice left.

293
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,375
[HIRO]
Sorry, but I'm gonna touch you.

294
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:06,541
Please, just one more time.
Take me to where you are.

295
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,833
[MALE STAFF A]
Code Zero-One-Six's memory

296
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,500
alteration is complete.

297
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,583
As for Zero-Zero-Two, however,

298
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
there were some memories
we couldn't effect.

299
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,916
It felt like there was something
strong protecting them.

300
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,166
[MALE STAFF B] Erase those
memories, they're noise.

301
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,500
[MALE STAFF C]
Repeated use of the device

302
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,375
will put her under
too much strain.

303
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
[FRANXX]
It matters not.

304
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,875
[MALE STAFF B]
What do we do with Zero-One-Six?

305
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,708
[FRANXX]
Return him to the Garden.

306
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,958
He's probably useless now
that he's ingested her blood.

307
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,250
But he's an
interesting specimen.

308
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,666
[inaudible]

309
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,250
[ZERO TWO groans]

310
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,166
[ZERO TWO gasps]

311
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,416
[ZERO TWO gasps]

312
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:03,458
[ZERO TWO screams]

313
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,583
[ZERO TWO]
I didn't want to forget.

314
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:11,166
Because... I thought if I did,
then I would never be human.

315
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,041
[ZERO TWO]
The first word I learned was

316
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,791
how he referred to himself: "I."

317
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,916
After that came "Zero Two."

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,458
And then, the third was...

319
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,166
And that way I can
always be... your darling.

320
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,958
[ZERO TWO]
"Darling."

321
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:47,041
Darling! Darling! Darling!

322
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,333
[HIRO]
You never forgot, did you?

323
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,125
Y'know, I think I've
taken a liking to you.

324
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
How would you feel
about being my darling?

325
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,750
After all, you are
now my darling!

326
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,333
[HIRO]
Even as you were hurt so badly,

327
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,541
you kept fighting this
world all by yourself.

328
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,166
[ZERO TWO gasps]
Darling?

329
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,750
[HIRO]
I finally got to see you!

330
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,375
No! Don't look!

331
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,166
Aren't you scared of me?

332
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,250
After all, you know I
used you this entire time.

333
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,541
That doesn't
matter anymore, okay?

334
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,083
But I... I called you fodder!

335
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,875
How can you ever forgive
me for saying that?

336
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,666
And I called you
a monster, remember?

337
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,083
So now we're even.

338
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,666
That's right. I am a monster!
That's why you--!

339
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,208
No it's not!
We've gotta talk it out!

340
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,583
You and I have to
think it through!

341
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,958
There must be places
we have to go!

342
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,958
Our journey begins now!

343
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,500
Surely this world
is much, much larger!

344
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,083
Larger than we can imagine!

345
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,166
We couldn't do it back then,
but this time, I know we can!

346
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,416
Let's see the outside
world together!

347
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,583
Zero Two. Together, we are one.

348
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,750
[ICHIGO]
How much longer, Hiro?

349
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,750
[FUTOSHI]
Oh, crap!

350
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,166
[IKUNO]
Strelizia!

351
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,041
[KOKORO]
Look!

352
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,916
[ICHIGO]
What's that light?

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,041
Doctor...

354
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,583
[FRANXX]
He did it!

355
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,416
[ALL]
Strelizia!

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,291
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

357
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,958
[ZERO TWO]
Darling!

358
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,416
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

359
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,541
[ZERO TWO] Darling! Darling!
Darling! Darling!

360
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,291
[ZERO TWO]
Darling! I'm so happy I met you!

361
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,583
[ZERO TWO]
I love you!

362
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,958
[HIRO whimpers, chuckles]

363
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,500
[HIRO]
Zero Two! I feel the same!

364
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,541
I love you, too!

365
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,791
Cut the comms
next time, dumbass.

366
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,833
Seriously.

367
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,250
[MIKU]
Yeah. Right? Stupid idiots!

368
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,500
[ICHIGO]
I'm happy for you. You both.

369
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,791
[HIRO] Zero Two, we need
to destroy that dome.

370
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,958
Think we can?

371
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,625
[ZERO TWO]
If we're together, of course!

372
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,666
[9'a] Well, then.
Shall we get going, too?

373
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,375
[HIRO yells]

374
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:54,416
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
Go!

375
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,041
[9'a]
It's time. Let's do this!

376
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,375
[SPECIAL FORCES]
Yeah!

377
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,208
[KOKORO]
Oh, wow.

378
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,500
[APE VICE CHIEF]
The door to the Gran Crevasse

379
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,500
has been opened.

380
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,666
[PAPA] The day of humanity's
liberation is upon us.

381
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,916
[HIRO] The Jian, also known as
"the bird that shares wings"...

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,083
[ZERO TWO]
...only possesses one wing.

383
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,833
[HIRO]
Unless a male and female pair

384
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,625
lean on each other
and act as one...

385
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,583
[ZERO TWO]
...they're incapable of flight.

386
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,791
They're imperfect,
incomplete creatures.

387
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,833
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
But...

388
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,583
[ZERO TWO]
...to me...

389
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,875
[HIRO]
...to me...

390
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,041
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
...their way of life...

391
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,916
...struck me as
profoundly beautiful.

392
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,875
[9'g]
Hey, look at that.

393
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,000
[9'e grunts] They won't let
it end so easily, huh?

394
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,500
[9'y] Is that a collective
mass of cores?

395
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,958
[9'b]
Damn, that's huge.

396
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,250
[9'a] We're out of time.
We better get out of here.

397
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,000
Before this entire area blows.

398
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,625
Zero Two. Let's go!

399
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,541
[ZERO TWO]
Hm!

400
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,875
[ZERO TWO gasps]

401
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,208
[9'a chuckles]
Wow, an instant reaction.

402
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,041
[GORO gasps]
We're still alive.

403
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,958
[IKUNO]
But what was that thing?

404
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,791
[ICHIGO]
A... massive hand?
