00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,041
Well, if you're that in
love with somebody,

175
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,875
you should ask him out to
dinner to try to clue him in.

176
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,250
[KARINA]
I did.

177
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,708
Oh, yeah? Then it sounds
like you did all you could.

178
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,666
Don't you think you're being
a little too dense right now?

179
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,041
Uh...

180
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,708
Then it's me?

181
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,333
[KARINA chuckles]

182
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,083
[FRANXX]
You have terrible taste.

183
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,791
But I guess I
don't mind. Much.

184
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,666
[FRANXX] By that time,
desertification had

185
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,833
become a global issue.

186
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,125
APE presented humanity's
ark to the nations of Earth.

187
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,083
The plantation project.

188
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,083
And essentially became
the leader of the world.

189
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:48,291
[FRANXX] That year, in front of
mankind, it made its appearance.

190
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,166
[FRANXX] Crying out as if
it were a newborn baby,

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,208
it destroyed the mining facility
and proceeded to make landfall.

192
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,833
It only stopped after being hit

193
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,416
by several nuclear
missile strikes.

194
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,750
As a result, the eastern half
of the Australian continent

195
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,916
became an exclusion zone.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,291
Soon, these beings were
designated klaxosaurs,

197
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,291
or "screaming reptiles,"

198
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,625
and they began showing up
everywhere periodically.

199
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,875
It also became clear that
what they were attracted to

200
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,250
were the magma energy mines.

201
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,541
[FRANXX] The plantations
turned into mobile

202
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,666
anti-klaxosaur fortresses--
cities were abandoned,

203
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,125
and mankind disappeared
from the surface.

204
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,875
[KARINA]
Where are you going?

205
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,833
[FRANXX] Seems they've
secured a decently preserved

206
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,541
klaxosaur corpse in Alaska.

207
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,208
Okay. But we're supposed
to submit our marriage

208
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,416
registration next week.

209
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,750
Well, if I'm not back,
go submit it.

210
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,875
[FRANXX]
I was completely enthralled.

211
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,916
The body's composition
could be called both

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,791
mechanical and organic.

213
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,750
And it struck me as
profoundly beautiful.

214
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,833
Eventually, I noticed
it contained the same

215
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:15,250
X-X chromosomes seen
in female humans.

216
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,333
I didn't know
what that indicated,

217
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,458
but I had a bad
feeling about it.

218
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,791
My research was recognized, and
I was appointed lead developer

219
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,541
of an anti-klaxosaur weapon.

220
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,500
A robot called the FRANXX.

221
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,250
[FRANXX] Once FRANXX
development finally reached

222
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,416
the prototype stage,
it hit a prolonged roadblock

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,041
where it wouldn't start up.

224
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,875
After rigorous testing
under various conditions,

225
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,541
it was discovered
that the pilot needed

226
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,625
to still possess
reproductive functions.

227
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,458
You didn't have to volunteer
yourself to pilot.

228
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,333
You have a valuable test
subject right under your nose.

229
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't you think it'd be
a waste not to use her?

230
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,583
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,666
Don't look at me like that. All
right, I'll see you in a bit.

232
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,833
--[alarm blaring]
--[FRANXX gasps]

233
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,166
[inaudible]

234
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,833
[FRANXX]
Is this a curse?

235
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,375
[FRANXX] The tests continued,
and many lives were sacrificed.

236
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,791
The pilots were put
under extreme stress.

237
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,041
But by injecting them
with yellow blood cells

238
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,291
that acted as a
conduit to the FRANXX,

239
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,958
and having them ride
in male-fepairs,

240
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,916
that stress was found
to be alleviated.

241
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,541
[FRANXX] After losing its
reproductive functions,

242
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:58,000
ironically, mankind found
a need for new children.

243
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,750
The FRANXX pilots, or parasites,

244
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,041
were therefore
called "children,"

245
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,666
and they were made to refer
to the rest of us as "adults."

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,291
[GORO] Those two didn't just
have their memories erased.

247
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,958
They also had elaborate
fake ones implanted.

248
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,125
Do you think their real
memories are lost forever?

249
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
[FUTOSHI]
This is messed up.

250
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,000
Was what they did really so bad
that they deserved to have

251
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,833
their memories erased like that?

252
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,125
Papa ordered it. I'm sure
that he had his reasons.

253
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,708
You serious, Zorome?

254
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,333
They destroyed everything
about the wedding

255
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,083
we worked so hard for!

256
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,833
Yeah, sure, maybe.
But we've only ever had

257
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,833
Papa our whole lives, so...

258
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,916
This isn't like you! I thought
you were better than that!

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,291
[ICHIGO]
Oh, Hiro. How's Zero Two?

260
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,208
She's all right,
but she still needs

261
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,250
to get some final tune-ups.

262
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,125
You guys. I'm thinking
of speaking to Papa.

263
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,166
I want to ask him to
return those two to normal.

264
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,166
Let's all tell him how we feel.

265
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,583
[ZOROME grunts]

266
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,833
[FRANXX] In the initial
usage phase of the FRANXX,

267
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,958
entire squads would die off,

268
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,583
taking the klaxosaurs
down with them.

269
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,000
But we pushed on and
succeeded in developing

270
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,083
more capable weapons.
After massive sacrifices,

271
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:17,000
we formulated an effective
means of killing them.

272
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,125
The Garden was
founded as a facility

273
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,333
to nurture the children.
And the plantations were fitted

274
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,416
with a quarantine zone
to house the parasites,

275
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,625
known as "Mistilteinn."

276
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,375
This is because the
parasites need emotions,

277
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,458
and we'd found
antiquated environments

278
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,708
were best suited
to raising them.

279
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,458
Their health is monitored
in extreme detail.

280
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,416
And everything is controlled

281
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,000
to keep them in the
best possible shape.

282
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,833
Eventually, the humans holed
up inside the plantations,

283
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,833
the "adults," forgot about
the existence of klaxosaurs,

284
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,000
and under the influence
of magma energy

285
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,916
and their immortality
treatments,

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,125
they obtained a life
of eternal tedium.

287
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,375
I was looking for
somewhere I belonged.

288
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,416
A resting place for my heart.

289
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
By this time, my interest in the
future of mankind had faded,

290
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,125
and I engrossed
myself in research,

291
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,291
seeking a more
perfected lifeform.

292
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,250
That's when a strange rumor
started making the rounds.

293
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,375
A rumor that said the
klaxosaurs had a leader,

294
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,791
a queen bee of sorts.

295
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,041
I don't know how,

296
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,875
but APE discovered where
that leader was hiding.

297
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,833
[PAPA] You may go along,
but on one condition.

298
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,208
Which is?

299
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,708
[PAPA] Should you encounter
the klaxosaur "queen,"

300
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,000
bring back something,

301
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,500
anything that could
serve as a DNA sample.

302

What you're currently doing

is a severe breach of protocol.

Ordinarily, you would
be punished,
