she really had to take off.

172
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,125
[HASS]
Ah. Akane is such a princess.

173
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,041
[YAMATO] Guess we'll just have
to check out the next place

174
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,750
without her.

175
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,708

177
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,291
We've gotta see where
they're headed!

178
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,166
Nah, we're done here.

179
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,250
What?

180
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,416
Akane Shinjo's already
left to go home.

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,750
[YUTA]
Huh?

182
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708
[BORR]
Okay, we'd better scatter.

183
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,291
Stalking is a serious
crime after all.

184
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,666
[VIT]
See you later.

185
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,375
But, come on, you guys. Argh...

186
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,666
Clear off!

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,083
[AKANE huffs]
Whatever.

188
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,375
[AKANE]
You want to help? Fine.

189
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,208
There are four people I
want you to kill for me.

190
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,708
I refuse. I was created
solely to defeat Gridman.

191
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,583
Unless he's my target, I won't--

192
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,833
[YUTA] I completely
lost track of them.

193
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,500
What if I am too late,
and Rikka's already...?

194
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,125
[YUTA grunts]

195
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,541
[MAX]
What are you doing?

196
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,708
[YUTA]
Huh?

197
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,208
Have you perhaps lost your way?

198
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,791
[ALEXIS] Welcome back, Akane.
Have you made progress on..?

199
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,083
[ALEXIS]
Hm?

200
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,125
[AKANE sighs]

201
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,000
[AKANE] Doing it like I have
been won't cut it anymore.

202
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,375
[YUTA]
It's gone.

203
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,541
I lost my memory and I don't
know how to get it back.

204
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,458
[RIKKA] If you are just
pretending to have amnesia,

205
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,791
then you really suck.

206
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,375
I think I said something
important to Rikka.

207
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,250
The only problem is I
have no idea what it was.

208
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,416
So right now--

209
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,791
Do you have feelings
for this young lady?

210
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,041
[YUTA gasps]
What? That's not what I was--

211
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,416
Don't you like her?

212
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,291
[YUTA]
Uh...

213
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,791
Don't you like her?

214
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,833
Yeah. Probably.

215
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,708
[MAX] Probably, huh? It's truly
vexing watching you two.

216
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,333
But... it's not bad.

217
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,541
[phone rings]

218
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,000
Yo, what's going on?

219
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,083
[IMAI] It's awful!
Arii was... He was...!

220
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
Hey, slow down. What happened?

221
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,750
[IMAI yells]

222
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,958
[TAKATO sighs]
Well that was odd.

223
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,000
[TAKATO]
Uh?

224
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:19,000

Not me! No, no, no, no, no!

225
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,166
[RIKKA'S MOM]
Happy Sunday!

226
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,458
You and your friends seem to
be getting along nicely today.

227
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,208
Did any of them ask
you to hang out

228
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,083
or did you just sit
down uninvited?

229
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,583
Wow. Full-swing puberty.

230
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,500
No one minds, right?

231
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,875
Look some customers.

232
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,750
Oh, it's just Yuta.

233
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,708
Yep, just me.

234
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,166
Going somewhere?

235
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,541
[RIKKA]
Mm-hm. What's up?

236
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,791
Oh, um, it's nothing.

237
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,166
[RIKKA grunts]

238
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
[UTSUMI] Yuta! Come on over
here and grab a seat.

239
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,750
Coming!

240
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,958
I'm heading out!

241
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,625
[RIKKA'S MOM]
Where're you off to?

242
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,750
I promised my friends
I'd tag along.

243
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,291
[RIKKA'S MOM]
Moody.

244
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,458
Unbelievable. She doesn't care
about the Gridman Alliance.

245
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,250
Lame.

246
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,250
She promised them.

247
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,291
[HASS sighs] Sucks we had to
split up so early last night.

248
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,375
If only Akane didn't have to
bail on us out of nowhere.

249
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,375
Yeah. I wanted a chance
to talk with her too.

250
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,083
Personally, I was
hoping for a chance

251
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,791
to talk more with Yamato.

252
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,583
[HASS]
Me too.

253
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,708
[YAMATO]
This is Heisei's last utopia.

254
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,666
Arcadia here and I want to dive
right into the video today.

255
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,041
It's been a while...

256
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,291
That's weird. Where are
the other three?

257
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,041
[NAMIKO]
Huh? What do you mean?

258
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,416
Arcadia's supposed to
have four people in it.

259
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,291
[HASS]
It's always been just the one.

260
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,625
[RIKKA]
It's a kaiju.

261
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,083
The three disappeared and
now the world's reset.

262
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,250
But why would it target
them specifically?

263
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,083
[RIKKA] At least I know
Namiko and Hass are safe.

264
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,125
[AKANE]
Thanks for coming yesterday.

265
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,416
Oh, hey. Are you doing okay?

266
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,041
Thank goodness.
That just leaves...

267
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,208
[chair clatters]

268
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,625
[NAMIKO]
Hm?

269
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,500
Sorry, I just remembered there's
an errand I need to run.

270
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,583
I'll see you later!

271
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,333
[HASS] Sorry, I just
remembered there's an errand

272
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,500
I need to run.

273
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,375

in some old drama.

274
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,916
[UTSUMI]
Planning on going out today?

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,583
[RIKKA'S MOM] Well, I've gotta
do some shopping eventually.

276
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,583
[UTSUMI]
In that case...

277
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,708
[GRIDMAN]
Yuta. Are you troubled?

278
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah. I have been ever
since yesterday.

279
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,625
[GRIDMAN] Is it something
I can help you with?

280
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,833
I am your ally, after all.

281
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,291
Thanks a lot, but I need
to handle this on my own.

282
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,416
How long do I have to wait
until I get my memory back?

283
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
[GRIDMAN]
I feel the same.

284
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,833
For some reason, I cannot
remember the past either.

285
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,791
However, what I do
know is my mission.

286
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,916
To save this city from
approaching danger.

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,375
[YAMATO]
Hm? Hey! There you are.

288
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,666
I wasn't expecting
to hear from ya.

289
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,208
You're safe!

290
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,666
[YAMATO]
What?

291
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,125
[RIKKA] Uh. I don't exactly
know how to put this, but.

292
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,833
I think your friends were
targeted and made to disappear,

293
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,083
and since they
vanished that means

294
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,958
you're probably
going to be next.

295
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,958

Sorry, you totally lost me.

296

I figured I would.

00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,125

I'm down for that.

298
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,000

getting the wrong idea.

come after you.

Yeah! That's number four!
