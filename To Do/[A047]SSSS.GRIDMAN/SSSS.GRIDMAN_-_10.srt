Get out of here, guys!
A kaiju's coming this way!

No. I defeated it.

the other kaiju.

Well, that's...

222
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,500
It's because he's not like the
others we've fought before.

I'm not following.

224
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,583
[CALIBUR] He studied humans.
And got too close to them.

225
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,791
He's a living being
with a heart now.

226
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,750
[MAX] Gridman won't steal
the lives of the living.

227
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,583
But aren't the kaiju
technically living too?

228
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,250
[GRIDMAN] Kaiju are like
the malice of Akane Shinjo,

229
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,000
and thus don't have lives.

230

Yeah, but... this one was born
with a hatred for Gridman

from the very beginning.

232
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,125
[GRIDMAN] He must have become
a living being from a kaiju.

233
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
[AKANE]
Looks like we lost again.

234
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,041
Do Kaiju only exist for the
sake of being defeated?

You remember this place?

I treated you to a meal here

238
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,333
back when you first
defeated Gridman.

239
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,416
[ANTI] Why? Why give
life to a kaiju like me?

240
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625

You're not a kaiju anymore.

241
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
[ANTI]
Why not?

242
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,250
[AKANE] Because kaiju can't
read people's feelings.

243
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,833
You came looking
for me, didn't you?

244
00:14:55,916 --> 00:15:00,000
The thing is, kaiju don't go
out of their way for people.

245
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,458
They ruin people's
lives just by existing.

246
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,250
That's a kaiju.

247
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,541
And I don't like kaiju
that resemble people.

eyes like a person.
