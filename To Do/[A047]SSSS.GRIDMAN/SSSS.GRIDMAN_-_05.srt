182
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,708
[AKANE] I knew I was right about
him!

183
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,583
[AKANE] Ah.

184
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,333
[AKANE] Please!

185
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:38,958
[ALEXIS] Very well!

186
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,208
[YUTA] It's ringing?

187
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:49,000
[UTSUMI] What's going on?

188
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,666
[STUDENTS]

189
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,750
[GUIDE B] Everyone, get away
from the river!

190
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,875
[HASS] The entire landscape is
moving!

191
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:08,875
[NAMIKO] No, it's a kaiju!

192
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
[RIKKA] There any chance that's
not a kaiju?

193
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,125
[YUTA] It's as big as a
mountain.

194
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:21,750
[UTSUMI] No.

195
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,208
[STUDENTS]

196
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:31,625
[UTSUMI] Hold up.

197
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,958
[AKANE] Right!

198
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,041
[ALEXIS] To think of
overwhelming him with

199
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:42,000
[AKANE] I know it's sorta cheap
to scale up,

200
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,625
[AKANE] Your move, Gridman.

201
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:55,666
[KAIJU A]

202
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:05,666
[KAIJU A]

203
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:15,708
[KAIJU A]

204
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:25,708
[KAIJU A]

205
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:35,708
[KAIJU A]

206
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:45,708
[KAIJU A]

207
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:55,750
[KAIJU A]

208
00:10:55,833 --> 00:11:05,750
[KAIJU A]

209
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:20,208
[KAIJU A]

210
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,500
[BORR]

211
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,000
[CALIBUR] I think we have too
much time on

212
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,208
[BORR]

213
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:33,500
[RIKKA'S MOM] Do any of you
actually have

214
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,541
[RIKKA'S MOM] Hey, I asked if
you're

215
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,291
[VIT] Well, you see we work, and
then we

216
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:44,750
[RIKKA'S MOM] What?

217
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,291
[MAX] Gone with who to where?

218
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,125
[RIKKA'S MOM] Rikka and the boys
went on a

219
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,250
[MAX] A field trip, you say?

220
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,208
[UTSUMI] Shoot, what now?

221
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,750
[YUTA] But without Junk here,
there's no way

222
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,458
[RIKKA] And going back to the
shop is out of

223
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,458
[UTSUMI] Then our only option is
to call

224
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,208
[YUTA] Yeah, you're right!

225
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,708
[RIKKA] Well, what're we waiting
f-?

226
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,208
[YUTA] We don't have our cell
phones.

227
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,458
[UTSUMI] They're inside our
lockers!

228
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,208
[YUTA] Then we've got to go back
and get

229
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,625
[RIKKA] But it's that way,
right?

230
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,625
[UTSUMI] Unless someone has a
better idea.

231
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,416
[TEACHER] Kids, quick!

232
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
[STUDENTS] Ex.

233
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,625
[YUTA] I have to go!

234
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,750
[UTSUMI] I'm coming too!

235
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,166
[YUTA] Rikka, leave with the
others!

236
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,875
[UTSUMI]

237
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
[NAMIKO] Come on, Rikka!

238
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,333
[HASS] What the hell is she
doing just

239
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,833
[UTSUMI] Go this way!

240
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,500
[YUTA] Right!

241
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,041
[HASS] Rikka!

242
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:51,208
[NAMIKO] Rikka!

00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:51,750
[KAIJU A]

244
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
[YUTA] Shinjo?

245
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:57,250
[UTSUMI] Yeah, I didn't see her
back there!

246
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:01,166
[UTSUMI] It's not what you
think!

247
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
[YUTA]

248
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,166
[AKANE] But you're transforming,
aren't

249
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,916
[AKANE] He's so slow.

[YUTA]

251
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:10,916
[KAIJU A]

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,541
[UTSUMI] Shit!

253
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,541
[YUTA] They said it was supposed
to be a five

254
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,958
[UTSUMI] Five kilometers?

255
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,041
[YUTA] There!

256
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,416
[UTSUMI] A telephone!

257
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,541
[YUTA] Wait.

258
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,166
[UTSUMI] Leave it to me!

259
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,000
[YUTA] Yeah!

260
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,541
[UTSUMI] Now, make the call!

261
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,416
[YUTA] Uh.

262
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,041
[UTSUMI] No.

263
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,916
[RIKKA] Hey!

[YUTA] Rikka!

00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,208
[UTSUMI] Rikka!

269
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:49,791
[RIKKA] If it's our shop's phone
number.

270
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,458
[RIKKA] Um, hello, mama?

271
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,625
[MAX] I understand.

272
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,750
[MAX] I'd like to make a
purchase.

273
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,250
[MAX] How much for this unit?

274
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:03,250
[RIKKA'S MOM] Like to buy?

275
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
[RIKKA'S MOM] It's thirty-seven
thousand

276
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,375
[VIT] So pricey!

277
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,166
[BORR] So pricey!

278
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,416
[MAX] Empty your pockets!

279
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,375
[RIKKA'S MOM] Whoa!

280
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,208
[MAX] We won't be needing a
receipt.

281
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,625
[RIKKA] Great news!

00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,875

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,333
[AKANE] It should've been long
enough since

286
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:36,500
[AKANE] So why is Gridman taking
his sweet

287
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,250
[AKANE] What the heck?

288
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,125
[AKANE] Well, this totally
sucks.

00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,750
[AKANE]

290
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:53,875
[AKANE] What are you doing here?

00:14:53,958 --> 00:15:00,000

00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,916
[UTSUMI] You can't be serious.

296
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,625
[UTSUMI] Of course this happens
when we're

297
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,500
[YUTA] Ugh.

298
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,750
[UTSUMI] Yeah, but.

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,583
[RIKKA] Seems like I'm the one
holding you

00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,458
[YUTA]

305
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,416
[RIKKA] Go ahead.

306
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,791

[KAIJU A]

312
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,250
[YUTA] I've gotta keep moving.

[YUTA]

314
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,125

317
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,125
[BORR] What are you sleeping
for?

318
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,833
[VIT] You were the one sleeping,
not me.

319
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:11,541
[BORR] Yes, you were!

320
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,708
[CALIBUR] I slept well.

[ANNOUNCER] The train is about
to depart.

00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,958
[MAX] Unload Junk, quickly!

323
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,583

[RIKKA]

326
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,708
[UTSUMI] I wonder if Yuta
reached the station

00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,750
[UTSUMI]

328
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,875
[RIKKA] Isn't that his life

329
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,000
[UTSUMI] No.

330
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,750
[VIT] Wow, now that's an
inferno.

331
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,000
[BORR] We came all this way and
they've got

00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,416
[CALIBUR] There's not much time.

333

[YUTA] Hey!

334
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,000

00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,958
[CALIBUR] Let's connect Junk.

338
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,875
[VIT] Is this the only solution?

339
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,166
[BORR] You've gotta do what
you've gotta

340
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,375
[GRIDMAN] Where is this?

341
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,375
[YUTA] I'll explain later!

342
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,291
[GRIDMAN] Of course!

343
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,833
[YUTA] Good to hear.

[KAIJU A]

345
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,041
[YUTA] Can you grow to match its
size

346
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,416
[GRIDMAN] Even at my largest
output, my

[GRIDMAN] Plus, the larger I am,
the more

348
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,083

[BORR] I'll lend you a hand, so
get your ass

352
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:40,500
[YUTA] Right!

353
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,458
[BORR] And access code.
