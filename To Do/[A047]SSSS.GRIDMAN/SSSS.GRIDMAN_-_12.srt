Hurry it up, Akane.

00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,125
[AKANE] I told you I can't
make kaiju anymore.

[ALEXIS] I'm fine with you
becoming a kaiju yourself.

You are our Hibiki,

Yes, but the thing is,

00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,375
I am also the Hyper

00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,166

Yuta will most
likely awaken. But...

We can't allow Alexis

Now, wouldn't that be nice?

You're a counterfeit born

A fabricated meat-thing.
A replica.

You're a creation that Akane
made for her own benefit.

A creation that thinks
of itself as human.

A creation that believes
its god is a friend.

How sad that is.

not is up to us to decide.

Of the downfall of this

It's you who made
Akane this way.

[ALEXIS] She's been like that
since the very beginning.

That's why it's so great.

[ALEXIS]
My life is endless and infinite.

But that leaves me with
a deep emptiness inside.

Which is why the only thing
that satisfies my heart

155
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,333
are the emotions of
people like Akane.

[ALEXIS] There was nothing
in this world to begin with.

However, providing kaiju allowed
Akane to build her ideal city.

165
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,791
And destroy it again.

166
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,208

Destroy her ideal city?

167
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,166

control every irregularity,

that were born here.

[GRIDMAN shouts]

175
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
[ALEXIS]
But now,

176
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,833
Akane has reached the
end of her usefulness.

177
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,250
There's nothing left
for me in this world.

178
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,458
[UTSUMI]
He's getting away!

179
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,708
[RIKKA]
Akane!

180
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,625
[ALEXIS]
You, whose life is limited,

181
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,875
cannot hope to defeat me,
a being with lives unlimited!

182
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,041
[GRIDMAN]
That cannot be called a life!

183
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,541
[ALEXIS]
In that case,

184
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,875
I'll just have to deliver your
inevitable end right now,

185
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,666
Gridman!

186
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,458
[GRIDMAN]
Grid... Beam!

187
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,000
[GRIDMAN shouts]

188
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,291
[GRIDMAN]
I see.

189
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:23,041
My power, is not just the
power to fight and destroy.

190
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,500
[GRIDMAN]
My true power is...

191
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,333
[ALEXIS]
Hmm?

192
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:33,625
[GRIDMAN]
Grid... Fixer Beam!

193
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,500
[ALEXIS yells]

194
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:43,166
[ALEXIS] Fixer Beam?
What is this power?

195
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,583
[GRIDMAN] Fixer Beam is the
power to mend this world!

196
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,416
For this world's creator.

197
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,833
To rescue the heart
of Akane Shinjo!

198
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:54,958
[UTSUMI]
Shinjo.

199
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,916
[YUTA]
Shinjo?

200
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,708
[UTSUMI]
Shinjo!

201
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,958
[YUTA]
Shinjo!

202
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,375
[RIKKA]
Akane.

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,041
[AKANE]
I can't...

204
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,041
I'm terrible.

205
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,666
It's okay.
You're not alone, Akane.

206
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
There isn't anyone
who's perfect.

207
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,083
That's why we rely on others.

208
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,375
If you learn to depend
on someone else,

209
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,166
this city will grow and grow.

210
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,125
And not just this city, the
whole world you made will also.

211
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,625
I can't! A big world's too
much for me to handle!

212
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,166
[RIKKA] That's why we
want you to rely on us.

213
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,333
To believe us. That's what
our relationship is.

214
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,791
[AKANE]
Our relationship?

215
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:49,083
You're all... my...
You're my friends.

216
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:55,500
This is a world that I created.
Which is why I can't be here.

217
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,208
I have to leave by
my own free will!

218
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,708
To where... I belong.

219
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,750
[ALEXIS yells]

220
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,500
[ALEXIS]
It can't be!

221
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,125
To think you really
mended Akane's heart?

222
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,916
[GRIDMAN]
And that's not all!

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,375
Humans have the
power of potential!

224
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,583
Which I-- Which we believe in!

225
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,458
[ALEXIS]
What kind of power is that?!

226
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,500
[GRIDMAN]
This is the power of mortality!

227
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,416
[ALEXIS yells]

228
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:41,250
[ALEXIS groans]

229
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:47,500
[ALEXIS] This is the power
of a life which is finite?

230
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,625
You're leaving then?

231
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:48,791
I did a lot here. Lots of
things that can never be undone.

232
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,041
I know.

233
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,666
I was afraid. I'm such a coward.

234
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,166
I know.

235
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,750
Not only that, I'm a wimp.
I was unfair. So weak.

236
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,458
I said I know.

237
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,041
I know all of the things
that you are, Akane.

238
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:59,041
[AKANE]
I'm so sorry.

239
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:04,541
I really am... so sorry.

240
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,083
[RIKKA]
Open it.

241
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,000
[AKANE] A pass holder.
You're telling me to "get lost"?

242
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,250
Not even close.

243
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,041
With this, wherever you go,
you'll be like me.

244
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:45,708
Promise me. Wherever you go,
you'll make an impression.

245
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,916
Because, don't forget,
you're our god.

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,791
[AKANE]
Mm. I will.

247
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,000
One last thing, God.

248
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,916
Would it be okay if I
asked for a request?

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,375
[AKANE]
Mm-hm.

250
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,958
I want the two of
us to be together.

251
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,875
Let's hope that my wish...
never comes true.

252
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:45,958
Wasn't there something important
you wanted to tell Shinjo?

253
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,166
So much I could die!

254
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:54,666
Thing is, I can't
get there after all.

255
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,041
[YUTA chuckles]

256
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,916
[RIKKA] It's not that
big of a deal, y'know.

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,625
Though, we won't be in the
same class as a god anymore.

258
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:09,416
Somewhere out there's a world
the gods call their own.

259
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,958
Gridman has one too, right?
A world like that?

260
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
[YUTA]
Mm-hm.

261
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,833
Once you make it
back to your home,

262
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,625
tell everyone
about my exploits.

263
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,041
[YUTA]
Mm.

264
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,916
And if you come back here,
Dwell in me and not Yuta.

265
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,500
That way, I can avoid
another sad goodbye.

266
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:34,250
Alright, sure. The real Yuta
will awaken after this,

267
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,458
so take care of him for me.

268
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:42,000
But when he does, do you think
Hibiki will even remember us?

269
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,375
Hey, don't worry.

270
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,666
You can just become friends
with him all over again.

271
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,541
[GRIDMAN]
Even if he doesn't remember,

272
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,791
it's all engraved in the heart.

273
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,541
Just like his feelings for
you came through,

274
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,041
even as I dwelled inside.

275
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,875
Feelings for me?

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,625
[GRIDMAN] As a Hyper Agent,
I am grateful for all your help.

277
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,583
Alexis Kerib is sealed.

278
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,208
Now we must return
to the Hyper World.

279
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,916
Our mission is complete.

280
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,166
Thank you. You all
fought so bravely.

281
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,791
It was Rikka's bold actions that
saved us time and time again.

282
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,250
And even though Utsumi
was constantly leading us

283
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,166
down the wrong path with
his worthless predictions...

284
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,916
[BORR chuckles]
...it was still a lot of fun.

285
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,666
You aren't alone.
Nor Akane Shinjo.

286
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,791
[GRIDMAN]
If not for all of you,

287
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,875
our mission may not
have succeeded.

288
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,125
Thank you.

289
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,000
I learned again the importance
of having friends I can trust.

290
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,458
And I learned it from you.

291
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,541
But we should be the
ones thanking you.

292
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,083
So thank you, Gridman.

293
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,791
Thank you, Gridman.

294
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,625
[GRIDMAN]
Well then, take care.

295
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,125
[RIKKA]
Goodbye.

296
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,416
[UTSUMI]
Goodbye.

297
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,791
[gasps]
Wait, what about Anti?

298
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,791
He's not coming with us.
Can't pay back the debt.

299
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,083

Tsurumoto, you've got this!

302
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,541
[FEMALE TRACK STUDENT B]
Keep it up!

303
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,041
[NAMIKO]
Huh? Seriously?

304
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,875
[UTSUMI] I wonder why Gridman
picked Yuta to dwell in?

305
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, Hibiki was in the
seat next to Akane, so...

306
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,750
Do you think that's
the only reason?

307
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,166
[RIKKA]
I'm sure that's not all of it.

308
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:25,791
[sneezes] No wonder it's
coming down. It's freezing.

309
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,041
[RIKKA]
Snow.

Oh, me? I happen to be the
one who saved your life.

313
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,166
Are you a kaiju?

[ANOSILLUS]
You too, right?

315
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,916
[ANTI]
Yeah, but... I pay my debts.

316
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,250
[laughs]

317
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,000

Just like my family does.
