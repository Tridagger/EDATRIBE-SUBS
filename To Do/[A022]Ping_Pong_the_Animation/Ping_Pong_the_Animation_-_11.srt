344
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,416
Not sure I would'a pegged you
for that kinda career, man.

345
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,416
I start student
teaching next week.

346
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,916
It's a cryin' shame.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,208
You could'a been a brilliant
pro athlete, Tsukimoto.

348
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,416
One'a the best.

349
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Well thanks.
You're the only one

350
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,208
who still tells me that kinda
stuff these days, Kazama.

351
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,166
And I have to admit it's
nice hearing it again.

352
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,708
[KAZAMA] Ah!

353
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,583
Aw.

354
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,250
[TSUKIMOTO laughs]

355
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,833
[KAZAMA] Damn it!

356
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,416
[KAZAMA] So I don't
know if you keep up,

357
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,041
but I got cut from
the National Team.

358
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,833
[TSUKIMOTO]
Yeah, I heard.

359
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,458
Kong's doing well these days.

360
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,291
[KAZAMA] I used to hate
my father so much

361
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
for the life he chose.

362
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,125
But lately I'm feeling
more and more like him.

363
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,541
I worry sometimes.

364
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,708
That I'll become an
unremarkable player

365
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,791
who only dreams
about the glory days.

366
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,250
Who cares if you do?

367
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,583
Not me.

368
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,125
I like unremarkable, actually.

369
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,333
[KAZAMA] Yeah well,
I'm not okay with it!

370
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,625
Dumbass.

371
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,708
[SPECTATORS chatter]

372
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,916
[GERMAN ANNOUNCER, in German]
We'll now begin the fifth match!

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
[in English] Hey Peco!
That's you, move yer butt!

374
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,625
[HOSHINO]
Whoops! Coming!

375
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,125
[GERMAN ANNOUNCER, in German]
The Japanese ace aiming for

376
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:58,583
the top in a sport where China
dominates the world rankings!

377
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,750
Yutaka Hoshino!
[SPECTATORS cheer]

378
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,500
[HOSHINO, in English]
Yo! Danke, danke!

379
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,833
I love 'ya, guys!

380
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,750
[TSUKIMOTO] Y'hear Akuma's
wife's pregnant again?

381
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,833
[KAZAMA]
Their third now, right?

382
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah.

383
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,458
He's gonna buy his own
truck and go independent.

384
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,750
Says he won't be able to
come by the dojo for a while.

385
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,625
[KAZAMA] Really?

386
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Ah! Damn!

387
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,333
[TSUKIMOTO] Needs money
to feed all those babies.

388
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, and the woman
from the Poseidon ads

389
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,750
was in the news, wasn't she?

390
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,125
[KAZAMA]
You do keep up.

391
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,541
[TSUKIMOTO] Everything's
on the web these days.

392
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,541
You actually
look us up online?

393
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Yeah, I do.

394
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,416
[KAZAMA] Damn it!

395
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,583
What about you?
Have a girlfriend?

396
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,166
[TSUKIMOTO]
Wouldn't you like to know?

397
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,708
[KAZAMA]
That's a yes!

398
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,083
I wonder.

399
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,833
Did I go wrong somewhere?

400
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,250
You know what.

401
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,708
Maybe staking your life on
table tennis isn't so bad.

402
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,458
Won't be doin' that again.

403
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,041
No way.

404
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,875
[TSUKIMOTO]
Summer is coming soon.

405
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,791
[KAZAMA] Yup.

406
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,041
[TSUKIMOTO] We're getting
back into busy season.

407
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,458
[KAZAMA]
No doubt.

408
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,500
[yawns]

409
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,000
M'sleepy.

410
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,291
[KAZAMA] Heh.

411
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,875
[clack]
