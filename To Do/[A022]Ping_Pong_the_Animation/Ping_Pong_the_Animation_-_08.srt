00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,125
The singles qualifiers
for the championship

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,458
are coming up!

3
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,791
I want us to go in
there ready to dominate!

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,833
Take all four slots
again this year!

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,875
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,291
Our bracket's full of
heavyweights like Kong

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,458
from Tsujido.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,083
Tsukimoto from Katase.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,791
Guys even better than our
championship opponents!

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,375
Do not let your guard down!

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,333
Understood?

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,875
[KAIO PLAYERS]
Yes sir!

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,125
Aw, yeah!
Cold noodles!

14
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,916
Spring has definitely sprung!

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,708
I never get tired of
eating at this place.

16
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,375
So many seasonal options!

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,750
Yeah, yeah, that's
great, Peco, really,

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,958
but how you plan
to graduate high school

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,583
when you're always here?

20
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,208
Ah, not a problem.

21
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,791
I calculated the number of
days I can skip and still pass.

22
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,083
You go to Katase, don'tcha?

23
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,458
[HOSHINO]
Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,583
[KOKUBU] You know a
chopper there named Tsukimoto?

25
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,125
I sure do.

26
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,625
Is he good?

27
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,375
Word is he's won
fifty games in a row.

28
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,791
Is that true?

29
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,416
Yeah sounds about right.

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,083
[KOKUBU] I got a little brother
who's on a high school team.

31
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,166
He had to play this
Tsukimoto kid one time.

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,666
Said his skills are sick.

33
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,291
Like superhuman good!

34
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,625
In fact, he was so tough,

35
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,916
he made my brother
consider quitting.

36
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,583
[KOKUBU] He said it was
like playing against a robot.

37
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,250
Whoa!

38
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,166
That's the Old Lady?

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,833
Damn, she used to be super-hot!

40
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, don't give
Peco any more beer!

41
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,250
I know we got some
juice around here!

42
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,250
So you knew that statue
you took a picture of

43
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,125
when you first got
here was Mom, right?

44
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,291
[HOSHINO]
Ooh, a ping-pong girl!

45
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,250
That's Mister Koizumi.

46
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,208
And there's
Kazama's grandfather.

47
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,041
Kaio's president.

48
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:47,875
[baby crying]

49
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,083
Whoa, you're right!

50
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,791
[MICHIO]
Aw, it's okay!

51
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,166
Upsy-daisy!

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,583
It's kind of a
small world, ain't it?

53
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,958
They were all
childhood friends.

54
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,166
Now eat something
and get to bed!

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,958
Oh, by the way,
Mom's pretty worried

56
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,208
about that knee
you got wrapped up.

57
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,208
Can't blame her.

58
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,458
You know, a knee injury

59
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,875
is what made her have
to give up competing.

60
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,333
You swear you're okay, though?

61
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,583
[HOSHINO]
Yup!

62
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,333
[MICHIO]
Well, don't sleep out here.

63
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,916
[YURIE] Jeez, you're
always in the bath.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,416
I heard about Poseidon.

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,375
How they're providing mats
for the Tournament Qualifiers

66
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,583
to promote their new
mat-based products.

67
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,250
And your teammates are in on it.

68
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,083
They've got 'em all
wearing these special mat shoes

69
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,166
called "Dragons"
for some reason.

70
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,875
You should play
table tennis for yourself

71
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
and no one else.

72
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,458
I'm getting outta here.

73
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,083
And don't give me that face.

74
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,125
Huh, really?

75
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,541
I didn't realize Hoshino was
still playing table tennis.

76
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,791
Well, he is, and since you
didn't do your job with him,

77
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
I had to work twice as hard.

78
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,500
Sorry, no smoking in here.

79
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,916
All right.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,291
I'll go ahead and register him
along with the other kids, then.

81
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,583
He's always been oddly popular
with the rest of the team.

82
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,000
Sure they won't mind.

83
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,166
Hell, they might even
throw him a parade.

84
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,291
[KOIZUMI]
Question for you, "madame".

85
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,583
Whaddya think're the odds that
your little chili-bowl brat

86
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,375
could defeat Tsukimoto
if they face off

87
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,833
in the next championship?

88
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,375
Is it even possible?

89
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,625
You're the one who
already wrote him off.

90
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,916
[KOIZUMI] Maybe.
But you didn't answer me.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,291
What am I, a bookie?

92
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,875
I dunno the odds.

93
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,125
You just can't compare
this kid to other players.

94
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,333
It's hard for me to say.

95
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,708
One thing I can
say is, talent-wise.

96
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,916
Hoshino's head and shoulders
above the Kazama kid.

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,208
That much I know for sure.

98
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,916
Please.

99
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,000
[KAZAMA]
I will get stronger.

100
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,625
Better than my father.

101
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,791
Better than my grandfather!

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,333
Hey, isn't that
Makoto Tsukimoto over there?

103
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,583
Whoa, I think he's right.

104
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,333
That's totally him.

105
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,208
What the hell's he doing?

106
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,708
Is he waiting for someone?

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,166
[MALE STUDENT 8D]
Hey, did you see?

108
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,916
That was Tsukimoto from Katase.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,041
[MALE STUDENT 8E] Aw, so
that's what he looks like.

Yo, Tsukimoto!

111
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,500
Dude, you gotta get in here!

112
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,583
It's a totally different
vibe this time!

113
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,541
Kaio's here.

114
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,916
They are so hard-core!

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,250
Yeah, but what's up
with the bald heads?

116
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,166
[MALE STUDENT 8F] Man,
I wonder if those dudes'll

117
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
take the whole Top
Four again this year.

118
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,916
That'd be incredible.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,916
[MALE STUDENT 8G] I dunno, bro,
I say anything could happen.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,166
For one thing,

121
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,125
there's that Tsukimoto
guy from Katase, right?

122
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,458
Rumor goin' around's
that he's the one whose data

123
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,833
Dragon put into
his practice robots.

completely covered in 'em!

Huh, I it does feel
kinda on the slippery side.

129
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,875
Guess the ads are right?

Ow! It's slippery!

Oh, come on, dude.

Hey, you remember
how Kazama said

136
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,833
those special new mat shoes
felt like nothing else

137
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,166
in the world?

138
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,708
That was a TV commercial,
you brainwashed idiot.

139
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,625

sale outside, right?

All around the globe,

ping-pong arenas
are using mats.

Mm-hmmm?

155
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,333
I doubt the mats
will make any difference.

[KONG chuckles]

178
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,916
[KONG, in Chinese]
Ah, you could say that.

179
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,666
Aw, man.

180
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,416
China's already through
to the second round?

181
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
But after him,
it's all gravy.

182
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
At least until the semifinal

183
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,125
where you'd be up
against Kazama!

184
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,500
How 'bout Smile?

185
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,083
If you play Smile, it won't
be 'til the final round.

186
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
He's got no one
standing in his way,

187
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,125
except maybe Sanada
in Round Three.

188
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,791
Nobody else even has a shot!

00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,375
[HOSHINO]
Is Sanada good?

190
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,375
He's Kaio's number two guy.

191
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,750
Oh.

192
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,208
[HOSHINO] Well,
thanks for the info.

193
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,625
I'm gonna head down there now.

194
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,750
But why?

195
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,333
There's plenty time
before your match.

196
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,500
Yeah, I know.

197
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,625
Alright!

198

You go and show 'em
who's boss, then!

Make a name for yourself
out there, Peco!

200
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,791
Figured that might freak
him out at least a little,

201
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,166
but he seems to be taking
it all in stride, huh, Mom?

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,333
[TAMURA] Nobody gets to the top
without slaying a few monsters.

203
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,000
Guess he must've
prepared himself for it.

00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,083
Dammit, this totally blows.

205
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,500
Seriously?

206

You might not believe this,

209
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,875
but my team is
getting pretty good.

210
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,666
It was like teaching
babies to read and write

211
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,875
from scratch.

212
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Today's singles
matches may be rough,

213
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,166
but they'll go far
in the team events.

I'll look forward to it.

[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
I trust you, Wenge.

217
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,250
Is the strongest one
still that Ryuichi Kazama?

218
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,166
[KONG, in Chinese]
Yeah.

219
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,583
But there's a threat
to him this year.

220
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,583
You remember
Makoto Tsukimoto, Coach?

221

Ah, the one with the glasses!

222
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,250
[KONG, in Chinese]
It's sure to be a good fight.

223
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm not up against them
until the semifinals.

224
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,000
It's the Best Four, then the
national championships for me.

225
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,833
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
I look forward to that.

226
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,250
[in Chinese] I want to
beat Kazama just once,

227
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,833
and earn my ticket home.

228
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,708
[in Chinese]
Nice.

229
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,958
I'm sure you can do it.

230
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
[SANADA] Wait, you're not
wearing the mat shoes?

231
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,291
No.

232
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,375
The shoes don't make
any difference to me.

233
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,500
It's gonna look pretty
dumb if we all go out there

who they're named after doesn't.

I've been wearing
Butterfly shoes

236
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,458
since my days in China
and they work just fine.

237
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,291
We wear the same ones whether
on mats or bare floors.

No, really?

239

We bought these!

240
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,250
Well, good shoes are good
shoes, and that's important.

241
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,333
So it's not a total loss.

[PLAYER 8BB]
Whoa, look!

243
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,041
Kong's not wearing
the mat shoes!

00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,125
And neither's Dragon!

00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,541
[PLAYER 8CC]
Kazama isn't?

246
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125
So you're not stressing
out about the mats?

247
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:45,833
No.

248
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,125
Why would I be?

249
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,208
But more importantly, Coach,

250
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,166
you don't have any
strategic advice?

251
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,333
No tips?

No sir-ee, none at all.

in your ability

Guess this is what
world-class play is like.

make first string at Kaio

only to have this
be my debut match-up.

Nah.

276
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,500
The only reason I probably even
made the cut in the first place

277
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,750
was because Kaio's
not what it used to be.

278
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,250
I don't think anyone
expects too much from me.

and work myself to death,

352
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,791
Why no RPB shots, then?

353
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,500
Isn't that what
the rubber is for?

354
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,458
Doesn't he have any?

355
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,791
Doesn't he?

356
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,708
[in Chinese]
He doesn't really have

357
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,916
a backhand, Wenge!

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Don't let the racket fool you!

359
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,208
He hasn't mastered
the RPB style yet!

360
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,458
[KONG, in Chinese]
I see!

361
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,375
Ni hao!

362
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,750
[KONG, in Chinese]
I see now!

363
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,666
[TAMURA]
There it is.

364
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,458
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Eleven-eight.

365
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,375
Game goes to Hoshino!

366
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,083
[MALE SPECTATOR 8E] He actually
took a game from Kong?

367
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,541
[MALE SPECTATOR 8F] That
penholder's using both sides!

368
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,541
[NEKOTA] Go over all the
data we have on this Hoshino.

369
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,208
[MOURI] His backhand was
almost like a forehand.

370
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,791
What is he doing?

371
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,583
I specifically told him to try
that on someone weaker first!

372
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,458
Son.

373
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,666
Bluffs are their most effective

374
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
when used against
the best players.

375
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,291
You know this.

376
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,666
Love ya, Peco!

377
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,458
Yeah!

378
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,083
Hey, you there!

379
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,791
Uh, you're in the middle of a
match here, Tsukimoto!

380
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
[TSUKIMOTO]
Right.

381
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,333
Sorry about that.

382
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,625
Welcome back, hero.

383
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,083
Nice one.

384
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,625
Well, well.

385
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,750
[MICHIO] He just learned both
the Chiquita and the Miuta!

386
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,416
[TAMURA] That kid is
something else, huh? 

387
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,916
He's growing.
Right before our eyes.

388
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,333
This is all just
one big game to him.

389
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,041
See?

390
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,541
He bowls people over.

391
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,708
Whatever it takes
to get to the top.

392
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,750
Honestly, it's
almost frightening.

393
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,000
The most likely
explanation is Kong panicked

394
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
and it threw him off his game.

395
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,125
Yeah. But...

396
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,583
Yeah!

397
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,750
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Nine-six.

398
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,166
Hoshino leads.

399
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,041
[crowd cheering]

400
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,333
[KONG] Hey, do you remember
how when you first played me,

401
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,958
you couldn't score
even a single point?

402
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,750
You've come a long way.

403
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,083
[HOSHINO] I owe you
a big xie xie, Kong.

404
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,375
Thanks to you crushing me,
I pushed myself to get stronger.

405
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,541
I guess in a way,

406
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,916
it was you who finally
taught me how to fly.

407
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:09,958
[KAZAMA]
Huh.

408
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,250
Real talent.

409
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,125
What're you doin'
here, Mister Tsukimoto?

410
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,625
Done already?

411
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,458
Yeah.

412
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,333
Well, that sure was fast.

413
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,208
[TSUKIMOTO] You mean
you weren't watching me?

414
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,291
[KOIZUMI]
Course not.

415
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,375
I knew you'd win this round.

416
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,208
[TSUKIMOTO]
But I lost.

417
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,333
Huh?!

418
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,291
[TSUKIMOTO]
Just kidding.

419
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,750
Hoshino?

420
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,958
Yeah.

421
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,583
Your pal's playing a
pretty interesting game.

422
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,291
Driver RPB.

423
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,458
[KOIZUMI] What, you're not
gonna watch the rest of this?

424
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,458
[TSUKIMOTO] Course not,
I know he'll win this round.

425
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,416
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Out!

426
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,375
Ten-seven.

427
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,750
Hoshino.

428
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,416
[TAKU]
He's tightening the noose.

429
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,750
[KAZAMA]
Yeah, he is.

430
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,166
[TAMURA]
Atta boy.

431
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
[KONG, in Chinese] I wish I'd
at least gotten myself

432
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,291
stuck in Europe.

433
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,708
Sweden or Germany
or someplace.

434
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,541
It's the Best Four,

435
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,333
then the national
championships for me.

436
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,833
Japan, huh.

437
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,500
Go on!

438
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Kick his butt, Kong!

439
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,833
[KONG, in Chinese]
Say hi to Kazama for me.

440
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,250
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Got your ticket, Wenge?

441
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,916
[KONG'S MOTHER, in Chinese] I'm
waiting for your return, Wenge.

442
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,416
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Match goes to Hoshino!

443
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,750
[HOSHINO (CHILD)] Just call me
whenever you're in a pinch!

444
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,750
Chant these words
three times in your mind!

445
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,083
"The hero appears!

446
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,458
The hero appears!

447
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,708
The hero appears!"

448
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,375
If you do that,
I'll come runnin'.

449
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,125
Whoosh!

450
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,166
Zoom!

451
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,875
All the way from
Planet Ping-Pong!
