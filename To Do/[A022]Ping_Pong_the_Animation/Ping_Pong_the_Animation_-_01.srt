1
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:37,791
So, even though I had zipped up,
my fly was still wide open!

2
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,250
[laughter]

3
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,416
[KATASE PLAYER 1A] He tried
telling me, but I was all,

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,750
"Shut up, bro,
I'm talking to this girl."

5
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,541
So I totally ignored him!
I was flying free for hours.

6
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,625
Till like fifth period!

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,166
[laughter]

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,916
[KATASE PLAYER 1B] C'mon, Smile,
don'tcha think that's funny?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,583
Yeah. A riot.

10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,583
[KATASE PLAYER 1A]
Seriously, dude,

11
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,000
don't you ever smile? Jeez.

12
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,666
[KATASE PLAYER 1B]
Hey, where's Peco?

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,000
You got me.

14
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,791
[KATASE PLAYER 1A]
Ota's gonna act all pissy again

15
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,333
if Peco doesn't show.

16
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,333
Yeah, he's harder on us
'cause of you two. It sucks!

17
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,458
[TSUKIMOTO]
That does suck.

18
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,416
Aw, come on, man,
don't be like that.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,625
You're the only one Peco
will listen to--help us out!

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,541
All right, First Years!
The rest of the team is waiting!

21
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,000
So quit your
lady-talk and come on!

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,916
[KATASE PLAYERS]
Yes, sir!

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,708
[TSUKIMOTO]
Yes, sir...

24
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,791
[OTA] Step it up, First-Years!
I want to see what you got!

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,416
So, Captain Yamada...

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,666
What's up, Coach?

27
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,583
That chopper with glasses.

28
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,541
I don't remember him
being on our team.

29
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,083
You've gotta
be kidding me.

30
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,791
That kid's one of the
two strongest players

31
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,208
we've got this year. The other
one's skipping out today.

32
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,583
I was gonna ask you
to get on his case.

33
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,416
Who? Pen-hold grip
with the chili bowl cut?

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,833
[YAMADA]
That's him.

35
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,458
If he won't practice, then
why don't we kick him off?

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,125
Because we need him
if we wanna win.

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,208
Slacker or not,
he's still our ace.

38
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,958
Four-Eyes here's not enough?

39
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, like I was saying,
sir, he's way better

40
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,083
than anybody else in here,
but he's no match for Hoshino.

41
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:20,083
You don't say. Hmm...

42
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,333
Peco's probably over
at the table tennis dojo

43
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,000
next to Odakyu station.

44
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,875
Yeah, so what are
you waiting for?

45
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,291
If you want him then go
yourself. I can draw you a map.

46
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,708
Excuse me?

47
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,291
I'm not Peco's keeper.
It's not my job to get him.

48
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,625
[OTA] Go on talking to us
like that kid, and we'll see

49
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,541
if your underwear
can reach your ears!

50
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,458
I think Mr. Ota's
about to crack.

51
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,041
[YAMADA]
Yeah, well...

52
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,791
He lost his regular spot when
Hoshino and Tsukimoto joined up.

53
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,916
Those two can outplay
all us upperclassmen,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,916
and unfortunately
they know it.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,666
Can't blame Ota.

56
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,041
So you're new to
this club, aren'tcha?

57
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,333
That's right, but I been
playin' for ten years.

58
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,500
Sure I can beat a little
snot-nosed punk like you.

59
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,583
[HOSHINO] If you want,
we can find out.

60
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,500
But only if we
make it interesting.

61
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,291
[APE GUY] She doesn't
let us play for money.

62
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,166
Old Lady, we're gonna
borrow Table Four.

63
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,333
[TAMURA] I don't give
my tables to gamblers.

64
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,416
See?

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
[HOSHINO] Yeah,
she always says that.

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,916
Let's start at a thousand
yen a game, okay?

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,166
Around here they call me Peco.
You can call me that too,

68
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,208
but after I beat someone,
they gotta add a "Mister."

69
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,666
In other words, it's about
to be "Mr. Peco," got it?

70
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:14,250
[TSUKIMOTO hums]

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,416
[HOSHINO]
Yeah!

72
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,958
[APE GUY groans]

73
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,583
[HOSHINO]
Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!

74
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,916
[APE GUY groans]

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,208
You don't get extra points
for bein' a show off!

76
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,875
That's fine. I'm still
gonna spank ya!

77
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,291
[APE GUY grunts;
PECO laughs]

78
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,375
[TAMURA] Hello, Smile.
I haven't seen you much lately.

79
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,541
Who's he?

80
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,541
Some new guy. He's been
bragging all week

81
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,416
about how highly ranked
he was back in Junior High.

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,208
But his game reeks of college
rich-kid if you ask me.

83
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,041
[APE GUY]
You think I'm a joke?

84
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,750
How's the school team?
Havin' fun with it?

85
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,750
I guess so. Game's the
same wherever you play.

86
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,666
The saddest part is you
actually believe that.

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,333
Wish you hadn't gone with
that low-level school, Smile.

88
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,041
With your talent, you could have
done a hell of a lot better.

89
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,625
Don't give me
so much credit.

90
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,833
[HOSHINO]
Yeah!

91
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,708
The special treatment.
I hate it.

92
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,750
Anyhow, did you think about my
offer, about teaching the kids?

93
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:54,583
Can't do it. Those brats are way
too unpredictable. Stupid kids.

94
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,125
[APE GUY]
Gotcha!

95
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,833
[HOSHINO]
Ka-Boom!

96
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,541
[APE GUY]
It didn't bounce.

97
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,583
[HOSHINO] Give it three
hundred years more practice.

98
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,833
You might stand a chance.

99
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,875
A decade of hard work,
just to lose like this?

100
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,875
Hate to break it to ya, but
hard work's for people

101
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,583
without talent. In fact,
after I dominate high school,

102
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,583
I'm gonna play in Europe.

103
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,833
This club's gonna get
a nice boost to its rep

104
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,875
when I'm number one, Old Lady.
You must be pumped!

105
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,041
[TAMURA] That there
is rookie talk, kid.

106
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,791
A seasoned player knows
when to keep his mouth shut.

107
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
[TSUKIMOTO] Come to
practice tomorrow, Peco.

108
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,208
[HOSHINO] What are you,
my truant officer now?

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,666
Wait, let's play!

110
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,958
I don't care if you
show up or not.

111
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,958
The others asked me
to tell you, so I did.

112
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,166
[TAMURA] Criminy. Must be
exhausting to live like that.

113
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,875
Yeah, I used to think
it was hilarious

114
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,333
when we were kids.
But for high school?

115
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,541
Smile better grow out
of it soon, or people are

116
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,791
gonna think there's actually
something wrong with him.

117
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,041
[APE GUY] Oh, I get it, Smile's
an ironic name. Is he good?

118
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,583
[HOSHINO] Good enough to hang
with me since, like, forever.

119
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,916
So that'd be Mr. Smile
to you, moron.

120
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,750
What's with the permanent
frown anyway, Tsukimoto?

121
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,041
Are you mockin' us? You don't
smile 'cause you think we suck?

122
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,791
Lay off him, Ota.

123
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:23,666
I try to avoid emotional
extremes. It's too exhausting.

124
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,291
[OTA] Well!
Aren't you Captain Cool?

125
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,625
[TAKAMURA]
Don't act all superior!

126
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,541
[YAMADA]
Guys, I said lay off!

127
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,416
Do what we tell ya,
first-year!

128
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,708
Cheer up!

129
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,916
[HOSHINO]
Wow.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,791
I didn't realize an extra year
breathing outside of the womb

131
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,250
makes you such a big shot!

132
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,500
Shut up, dummy!

133
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,291
That little first-year
is beggin' for a fight.

134
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,291
Did you hear him?

135
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,500
You wanna go? I'll go!

136
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,583
[YAMADA] Come on, Ota!
What are you doing?

137
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,833
It's okay. Settle down.

138
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,875
Just focus on
practice, all right?

139
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,625
[HOSHINO] Yeah, you
definitely need it.

140
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,583
[OTA]
Huh?!

141
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, you lay off too, Hoshino!

142
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,291
Neener, neener, neener.

143
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,541
You know they're
just jealous, right?

144
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,791
Because they'll never
beat you at ping pong.

145
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,041
Keep chugging that stuff and
you'll give yourself diabetes.

146
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,458
Let's ditch this lame-ass
excuse for practice

147
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,791
and go over to Tsujido High.
We can check out China.

148
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,500
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,041
You mean that Chinese exchange
student they recruited?

150
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,791
What's he got to do with us?

151
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,291
For cryin' out loud, Smile.

152
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,541
Do I gotta spell out
every last thing to you?

153
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,916
[TSUKIMOTO]
What?

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,708
You should be chompin'
at the bit to see this guy.

155
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,666
He made a Chinese Province team,
that's like going National here.

156
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,208
[KOIZUMI] Hello, everybody!
Are we ready to train?

157
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,750
[PLAYERS]
Yes, sir!

158
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,916
[HOSHINO] Great, Coach is here;
now we have to stick around.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,916
Your fault for
dragging your feet.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,916
Then let's get to it.

161
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,333
Dang, Tsukimoto's
on the defensive.

162
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,958
Hoshino's got
some serious game.

163
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,708
No slacking off,
get back to work, huh?

164
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,250
[PLAYERS]
Yes, sir!

165
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,125
Question for you,
Captain Yamada.

166
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,583
Is Mr. Tsukimoto
under the weather today?

167
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,708
No, he didn't say
anything to me. Why?

168
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,750
[KOIZUMI] He looks tentative.
No aggression at all.

169
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,333
[YAMADA] Yeah.
That's probably 'cause

170
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,500
he's playing against Hoshino.

171
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,500
The kid's a pain,
but he's gifted.

172
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
Everyone looks silly facing him.

173
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,000
Footwork, backhand, blocks...
He's got the whole package.

174
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,958
Have those two been
friends a long time?

175
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,750
[YAMADA] You know
Tamura Table Tennis?

176
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,958
That dojo by the rail station?

177
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,375
[KOIZUMI]
Yeah, of course.

178
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,916
[YAMADA] Apparently, they both
learned there as kids.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,833
I see.

180
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,333
[YAMADA] I'm looking forward
to this year's high school

181
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:49,458
championships. Who knows
how far those two can go?

182
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,291
We'll find out soon.
Even the strongest panther

183
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,500
in the wild has to
watch out for lions.

184
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,416
[YAMADA]
What's that mean?

185
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,541
Means there's always
someone better, Captain.

186
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,000
[OTA]
First-years, line up!

187
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,000
[PLAYERS]
Yes, sir!

188
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,166
[OTA]
Now look around!

189
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,791
Either your teammates can turn
invisible or they skipped out

190
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,041
on practice. What happened
to Tsukimoto and Hoshino?

191
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,333
I'm sorry, Captain Ota.

192
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,000
They said they wanted
to spy on China. Right?

193
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,375
Yeah. I think they went
over to Tsujido High.

194
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,791
[OTA growls]

195
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,833
[OTA] Meet me
behind the gym, punks.

196
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,708
I'm gonna make you
run so hard you puke.

197
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,041
[HOSHINO] Which gum do you think
makes the biggest bubbles?

198
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,625
Beats me.

199
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,250
[HOSHINO] Bubblicious
is good, obviously,

200
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,333
but Marukawa's not bad either,
especially for the price.

201
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,333
I got more if
you want a piece.

202
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,958
No thanks.

203
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
So you think Ota's making
all the other first-years

204
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,583
run laps until they
almost pass out?

205
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,416
Probably.

206
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,583
You're a blast to hang out
with, you know that, Smile?

207
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,750
A real conversationalist.

208
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,458
Is our stop next?

209
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,791
[TSUKIMOTO] Not yet.
The one after.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
[KONG, in Chinese]
Is it cold outside?

211
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,791
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
How should I know?

212
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,916
Think about it for yourself.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,583
[KONG, in Chinese]
Ugh.

214
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,500
I wish I at least got to
study abroad in Europe.

215
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,416
Sweden or Germany or someplace.

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,000
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese] It's
a little late to say that now.

217
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,541
Hurry up, Wenge.

218
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,333
For years, Tsujido High
was a powerhouse

219
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,041
that dominated
Eastern Japan.

220
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,625
But lately we've taken a
big dive in the rankings.

221
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,458
So I wracked my brain,
and now here you are.

222
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm no genius, but I'm pretty
happy with this idea.

223
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,458
Recruiting a player like
Kong Wenge will give us

224
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,416
a real shot in the arm.
And with any luck,

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,208
he'll show the rest of the boys
how to step up their games, too.

226
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,250
[KONG, in Chinese]
What is this? A folk dance?

227
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,541
He says watching the
Japanese style of play

228
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,500
is most enlightening.

229
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,833
[KONG]
Heh.

230
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,791
[TSUJIDO PLAYER 1A] Coach!
We're gonna go run now.

231
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,208
[in Chinese]
Wenge! It's time to run!

232
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
[KONG, in Chinese]
That's a stupid training menu.

233
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,916
My game will be rusty after
a semester in this place.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,458
Mm... Could you
translate that?

235
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,625
He's feeling very jetlagged,
and wants to know

236
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,833
if he could please start his
training tomorrow instead?

237
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,583
Oh! Yes, of course,
what was I thinking?

238
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,666
That's not a problem at all.

239
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,708
Hey. Hold on.

240
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,708
You're just gonna waltz right
into another school's gym?

241
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,958
[TSUKIMOTO]
Well, yeah, sure. Why not?

242
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,458
[HOSHINO] "Why not?"
'Cause maybe they don't want...

243
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,750
Ah, never mind.

244
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,791
[TSUKIMOTO] Those doors,
there, you think?

245
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,708
[in Chinese]
Don't get a big head, Wenge.

246
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,250
Remember, they're paying
for you to be here!

247
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,041
[in Chinese] There's no
problem as long as I win.

248
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,125
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
You're certainly confident.

249
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
[in Chinese]
You saw them, didn't you?

250
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,166
I could play all-forehand
and still not lose.

251
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,583
I should've given up on
my talent a little sooner.

252
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,958
[HOSHINO]
A Chinese penholder?

253
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,583
Kong Wenge?

254
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,916
[HOSHINO]
Hmm...

255
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,791
Oh, wow, real sticky
top-sheet Chinese rubber.

256
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,916
Maybe China killed the
whole team with his kung fu.

257
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,625
I'm sure they're
just out running.

258
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,791
Ugh. Why is everybody so
obsessed with running?

259
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,541
These are some nice tables.

260
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,750
Hey, check this out. The rest
of their paddles are nice, too.

261
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,250
High-grade rubber with
carbon blade layers.

262
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,291
And their team still sucks!

263
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,791
Well, Wenge's not here.
Let's go home.

264
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,791
[TSUKIMOTO gasps]

265
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,833
[HOSHINO]
Hm?

266
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,041
[TSUKIMOTO]
You're kidding, right?

267
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,291
Gotta kill time till
China gets back.

268
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,791
Besides, I wanna return one
of your chops with this baby.

269
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:14,750
[sound of ping pong volley]

270
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:28,000
[sound of ping pong volley]

271
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,333
[in Chinese]
You hear that?

272
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,958
[in Chinese]
Yeah, that's a good chopper.

273
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,166
[KONG, in Chinese] But the
hitter is controlling the game.

274
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,250
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
He has speed.

275
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,375
[KONG]
Mm.

276
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,500
[in Chinese]
His play is slipshod

277
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,375
compared to the chopper's.

278
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,875
[in Chinese]
The chopper seems

279
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,958
to have his hands full just
returning the ball, though.

280
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,166
Is the hitter
getting a high arc?

281
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,583
[in Chinese] No, he's got speed,
but he leaves himself wide open.

282
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,000
The chopper is
losing on purpose.

283
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,375
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Why?

284
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,500
[in Chinese] Who knows?
Maybe it's a Japanese thing.

285
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,625
Now let's go inside.

286
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,583
The wind makes it
too hard to hear.

287
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,875
[KOIZUMI]
Hmm...

288
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,083
[KATASE PLAYER 1A] Katase High!
Fight! Fight!...

289
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,708
[OTA] You're slowing down,
punks! Move your butts!

290
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,291
[KOIZUMI] Captain Yamada,
I notice Mr. Tsukimoto's AWOL.

291
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,541
[YAMADA] Apparently
he said something

292
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,500
about spying on
Tsujido High and left.

293
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,791
[KOIZUMI]
What?

294
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,750
[YAMADA] I'm sure it's
just an excuse to skip.

295
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,166
Probably Hoshino's idea.

296
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,125
[OTA] I can't hear ya,
first years!

297
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,833
[KATASE PLAYER 1A]
Katase High! Fight!

298
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,416
[PLAYERS]
Fight! Fight! Fight!

299
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,291
[KOIZUMI] All right, Captain,
why don't you bring them inside?

300
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,541
This isn't the track team.

301
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,875
[YAMADA]
But sir...

302
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,208
[OTA] They need discipline,
or they'll skip out

303
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,541
like Tsukimoto and his pal!
You spoil those two!

304
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,000
[KOIZUMI]
You might be right,

305
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,916
but let them off
the hook for today.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,375
[YAMADA]
But Coach...

307
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,333
[KOIZUMI] It'll be good for
them to learn China's got

308
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,500
more to offer than
noodles and dumplings.

309
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,958
[OTA]
First years! Fall in!

310
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,083
[in Chinese]
That's enough!

311
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,291
Keep playing like that and it'll
become a habit, Four-Eyes!

312
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,500
Hey, China!

313
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,500
[in Chinese] Holding back is
disrespectful to your opponent.

314
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,625
Uh, essentially he's
saying that you--

315
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,500
[in Chinese] No need
to interpret, Coach.

316
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,875
Four-Eyes knows what
I'm talking about. Right?

317
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,958
Oh. Ni hao!

318
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
[KONG, in Chinese]
Switch.

319
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,416
[CHINESE COACH] Kong would like
to play, if that's all right.

320
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,375
[KONG, in Chinese] See if
you can return my serves.

321
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,250
[HOSHINO]
Xie xie!

322
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,333
[in Chinese]
Not you.

323
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,791
[in Chinese]
Wenge, just play him.

324
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,333
[KONG]
Tch.

325
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,541
[HOSHINO]
Nice change of speed.

326
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,333
[HOSHINO] Good arc,
and fast, too. I'll call that

327
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,666
his "Super Drive," product of
four thousand years

328
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,833
of Chinese Empire.
Fine, I like a challenge!

329
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,250
[HOSHINO] Well, well,
here comes again.

330
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,333
His four-thousand-year special.

331
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,750
Gotcha!

332
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,291
Huh?

333
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,416
[HOSHINO] Damn. He's got
a sinking drive, too?

334
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,625
Alright, I'll just go
lower this time.

335
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,041
[KONG, in Chinese]
Am I being punished?

336
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,666
[HOSHINO]
His spin's amazing.

337
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,916
I'll have to angle
my paddle down.

338
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,625
[KONG, in Chinese] I get kicked
off the top team, and then they

339
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,083
toss me in with crap players who
wouldn't make the second team?

340
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,291
[HOSHINO gasps]

341
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,333
[KONG, in Chinese]
Is this Hell?!

342
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:19,875
I was born in the land of ping
pong, and I think I practiced

343
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,666
more than enough. I got results,
too. I've supported my family.

344
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,583
But I make one little mistake,
And I'm stuck with these people.

345
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,708
Your backhand is weak!
And your forehand!

346
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,875
And your legs!
And your reactions!

347
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,541
Nothing about you
is good enough!

348
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't you dare think you can
stand at the same table as me!

349
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,041
Why did I have to come to this
country--to the eastern end

350
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,666
of the Earth?

351
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,333
Now learn how powerless...

352
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,750
and unpolished you are!

353
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,166
[HOSHINO screams]

354
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,416
[TSUKIMOTO] Eleven-love.
The match goes to Kong Wenge.

355
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,625
Can't believe I got skunked.

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,625
Actually skunked...

357
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,291
[HOSHINO cries]

358
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,333
[TSUKIMOTO] Crying when you
lose is a bad habit, Peco.

359
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,916
Let's go home.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,291
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
You went too far.

361
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,541
[in Chinese]
I showed him reality.

362
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,291
[TSUKIMOTO]
C'mon, stand up.

363
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,833
[in Chinese]
Wait, Four-Eyes.

364
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,791
You, in the glasses.

365
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,041
[in Chinese] Show me
your chop sometime.

366
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,666
Kong says he's very
interested in playing you.

367
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,041
Will you please have
a match with him soon?

368
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,291
It'd just end in defeat.

369
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,458
[in Chinese] He says no,
because it would end in defeat.

370
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
[in Chinese]
Whose defeat?

371
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,750
[KONG, in Chinese] Four-Eyes
has zero combativeness.

372
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,583
It's a pity he didn't have
a leader to teach it to him.

373
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,041
Although... maybe it's more
of a pity to believe in

374
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
a talent you don't have.

375
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,083
[in Chinese]
Wenge...

376
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,583
[KONG, in Chinese]
Come on. Let's practice.

377
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:04,166
If there are guys like him here,
maybe I can still be saved.

378
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:17,291
[TSUKIMOTO hums]

379
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,666
What is that?

380
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,791
Monster Robo.

381
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,583
No, I mean the song.

382
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,958
[TSUKIMOTO]
Is it weird?

383
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,666
Yeah, a little.

384
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,208
Is our stop next?

385
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,583
Not yet.
Still the one after.
