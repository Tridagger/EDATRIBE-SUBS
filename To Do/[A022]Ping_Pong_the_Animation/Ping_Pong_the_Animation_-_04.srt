why they call him Smile.

making today won't work on him.

got nothing to prove.

force this on him.

But how can he make
a real decision

168
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,166
until he understands
what the options are?

169
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,500
I just want to give him a chance

170

to see the view at the
top of the mountain first.

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500

is gonna change.

00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,916
[SAKUMA]
Thank you, sir.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,666
Wait a sec, where's Kazama?

179
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,041
[TAKU]
He's off in the can.

180
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
Again.

181
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,791
[SAKUMA] Why, is he
constipated or something?

182
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,416
[TAKU]
No.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
Nothin' like that.

184
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
He does this before every match.

185
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,750
Holes up somewhere private.

186
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,416
[toilet flushes]

187
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,583
It's about time
we got to a boss fight.

188
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,208
I hear he's won
sixty-eight in a row.

189
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,333
The guy really
is a monster, isn't he?

190
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,708
I heard at Kaio

191
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,250
if you lose before
the fourth round,

192
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,750
they kick you off the team.

193
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,083
[MALE PLAYER 4B]
No way, seriously?

194
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
That's freaking harsh.

195
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,416
[MALE PLAYER 4A] Table tennis
is their whole life.

196
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,833
They're obsessed.

197
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,250
[MALE PLAYER 4B]
It's kind of scary, actually.

198
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
[MALE PLAYER 4A]
Check out Kazama.

199
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,291
He's got a look in his
eyes like he killed a man.

200
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,000
And who knows, maybe he has.

201
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,000
If that news came out,
I wouldn't be shocked.

202
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,000
Shh!

203
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,500
He's gonna hear you,
you dumbass!

204
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,583
Just look at him,

205
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,125
tell me how he's
still in high school.

206
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,750
Dude's gotta be
thirty years old, minimum.

207
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,125
Now on Court Eight,
the quarterfinal match

208
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,833
between Kong Wenge
of Tsujido High School

209
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,708
and Ryuichi Kazama,
Kaio Academy.

210
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,000
[CROWD GUY 4A]
Go Kazama!

211
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,250
[CROWD GUY 4B]
Win it all!

212
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,208
[CROWD GUY 4C]
Wipe the floor with this guy!

213
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,875
[CROWD GUY 4D]
Have my babies!

214
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,250
[in Chinese]
Ah, so he's the hero

215
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,875
of this little
island country.

216
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,750
[in Chinese]
Look at those muscles.

217
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,083
He's got power, but I doubt
he's light on his feet.

218
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,541
Make a good serve,

219
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,458
then do a
third ball attack.

220
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,458
Keep in the lead
from start to finish.

221
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,458
[KONG, in Chinese]
Easy for you to say.

222
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,958
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Have confidence.

223
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,666
You're the stronger player.

224
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,708
[CROWD cheering]

225
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,833
[KONG, in Chinese]
Heh, lively crowd.

226
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,625
[MALE UMPIRE 3A]
First game.

227
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,000
Service to Kong.

228
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,041
Love all.

00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,833
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Yes!

00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,625
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
So fast!

231
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:10,958
[KONG, in Chinese]
He's good.

232
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,958
[SAKUMA chuckling]

233
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,916
[in Chinese]
I can't believe how fast

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,416
his reaction time is.

235
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,041
A real monster, huh?

236
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,500
[KONG, in Chinese] He must
have a hole in his defenses

237
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,541
somewhere!

238
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,958
[KONG, in Chinese]
Somewhere!

239
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,666
[KONG, in Chinese]
He's reading me.

240
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
He's predicting my moves!

Show me your weak point!

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,458

I can't afford to end here!

243
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,750
Not here!

00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,625

Your girlfriend?

251

[KONG, in Chinese]
No, my mother.

252
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,541
She made me carry it.

253
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,625
[in Chinese] She's the
stereotypical country parent.

254
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,291
[in Chinese] How long have
you lived away from her?

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,000
[in Chinese]
Since I was eight.

256
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,166
That's when I joined
the provincial team.

257
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,541
[KONG, in Chinese] After that,
she brought me food once a week.

258
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,708
She worked in a candy factory,

259
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,333
and she'd bring
mountains of their candy.

260
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,625
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
You didn't like

261
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,291
anything she brought?

262
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,333
[KONG, in Chinese]
Hm...

263
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,708
Her homemade wontons were great.

264
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,625
I used to dream
I'd lost my keys.

265
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,041
It'd be a relief not
to have anymore dreams

266
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,083
where I'm the only
one without a ticket.

267

Wenge.

268

You've only just
reached the starting line.

[in Chinese]
I'm done for.

271
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,541
[in Chinese]
I don't mean table tennis.

272
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,083
I'm talking about life.

273
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,875
And this isn't
your coach talking.

274
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,875
This is the opinion of a
friend who knows you well.

276
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,541

S'cuse me, Tsukimoto?

Can we talk for a minute?

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,208
Are you heading
back to your school?

280
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:55,833
[KAZAMA]
Yes.

281
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,625
We're still having practice.

282
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,416
[TSUKIMOTO]
That's hardcore.

283
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,166
[KAZAMA] As players, my
teammates are mostly useless.

284
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,958
They don't even realize
it, which makes it worse.

285
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,375
You know how it is.

286
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,416
[TSUKIMOTO]
Huh?

287
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,833
Come to Kaio, Smile.

288
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,166
I can make it real
comfortable for you there.

289
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
[KAZAMA]
As I'm sure you know,

290
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,833
Kaio Academy was founded by
a former table tennis star,

291
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,166
so you won't find a school more
passionate about the sport.

292
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,375
We have dedicated
practice facilities open

293
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,958
around the clock,
with international coaches

294
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,000
training us every
morning and evening.

295
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:35,291
All of our practices are filmed
in HD and analyzed by computer.

296
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,750
We have state-of-the-art
machines that can replicate

297
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,208
almost any shot, and
others to collect the balls.

298
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,208
Equipment is provided free.

299
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:48,250
It's all professional grade, and
you can use as much as you like.

300
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,125
You'll never worry
about rubber care again.

301
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,458
We restock every
three or four days.

302
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,291
You have your choice
of the best new rubbers

303
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,583
from a mountain of options,
so they're pristine

304
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,041
for every match.

305
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,833
Our specialists will also
help custom-tailor equipment

306
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,708
to your own style of play.

307
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,791
You'll have a
personalized weight training

308
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,750
and cardio program, too.

309
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,958
The trainers in our gym employ
the latest sports science

310
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,958
to understand and keep
your body in top shape.

311
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,958
All meals are
supervised by nutritionists.

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,958
And I'm still only
scratching the surface.

313
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,791
Have you ever
wanted to play overseas?

314
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,833
The staff is looking out
for our long-term futures.

315
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,041
There's a full library
where you can find coverage

316
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,708
of every major
international competition.

317
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,000
And if you ask, someone'll
go record any match you want,

318
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,041
anywhere in the world.

319
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,166
You can't reach Nationals alone,

320
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
much less the world stage.

321
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,583
But you have talent, Tsukimoto.

322
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,708
Katase isn't worthy of you.

323
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
You belong with us at Kaio.

324
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,250
I'll come pick ya up one day.

325
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,416
When you're ready.

326
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,375
Yeah, good luck
at the championships.

327
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,875
Where the hell is Kazama?

328
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,416
Guy definitely takes his
sweet time in the can.

329
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,083
All your play was sloppy!

330
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,583
That's unacceptable!

331
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,708
You clowns think you're so
good you can pull your punches

332
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,500
against inferior players?

333
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,208
Well at Nationals, you
boys're gonna be screwed!

00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,583
I want everyone to
show me you're serious.

337
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,791

[KAIO PLAYER 4B]
She's hot.

346
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
[KAIO PLAYER 4C] Yeah, have you
seen her in those commercials?

347

Kazama's one lucky dog.

00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,458
[KAIO PLAYER 4D] Yeah,
I hear he lives with her

349
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,625
at the President's house.

350
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,250
He actually has a life.

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,916
[SANADA]
It isn't right.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,375
[TAKU]
Those two are cousins!

353
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,208
Their relationship is platonic.

354
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,458
[KAIO PLAYER 4B]
No way I'm buying that.

355
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,083
[KAIO PLAYER 4A]
Dads are totally blind.

356
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,750
[TAKU]
You'll pay for that in laps!

357
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,750
Get on the bus!

358
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,791
[KAIO PLAYERS]
Yes sir!

359
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,791
[announcement bell]

360
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,291
[MALE STAFF 4A] Attention,

361
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,000

362
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,166
