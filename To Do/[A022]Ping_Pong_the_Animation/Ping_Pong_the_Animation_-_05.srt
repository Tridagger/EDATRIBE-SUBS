1
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,708
Hey, Smile, you're
still taggin' along

2
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,291
with this whiny loser
wherever he goes?

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,833
Well, say hi to
the old lady for me.

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,833
Kaio's varsity squad, huh?

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,250
Well, way to go, Akuma.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,541
[CROWD cheering]

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,458
[KAZAMA] Any ideas on how
to get him to join our team?

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,708
Let me tell you a secret to
spare you all that future pain.

9
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,541
The only way to not
lose is to not fight.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,833
[SAKUMA]
Wait a sec, where's Kazama?

11
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,541
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Are you sure about this, Wenge?

12
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,250
You don't have
to stay here alone.

13
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,333
[KONG, in Chinese]
Well, I'd feel ashamed

14
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,625
to show my
face there, anyway.

15
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,166
Plus, I was hired to beef
up that weak little club,

16
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,916
even if that
wasn't the real goal.

17
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,958
[in English] Hello,
it's good to meet you.

18
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,333
Thank you very much.

19
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,500
[chuckles]

20
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,125
[KONG, in Chinese]
I sound good, right?

21
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:52,750
The one saving grace is that
Kazama won worldwide, too.

22
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,291
If he'd lost the high
school championship,

23
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,000
I'd have asked a witch
to turn me into a frog.

24
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,041
[CHINESE COACH laughs]

25
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,791
[in Chinese]
I'll miss you, Wenge.

26
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,208
[in Chinese]
I'll miss you, too.

27
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,375
[REPORTERS shouting]

28
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,291
Hey, Kazama!

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,750
Great job at the Youth Olympics!

30
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,625
How's the gold feel?

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,208
Can I get a quote, Dragon?

32
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,125
[KAZAMA] I wish we'd done better
in the team and doubles events.

33
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,083
But I'm satisfied with my
win in the singles, at least.

34
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,500
Above all, I'm worried.

35
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,875
My school means more
to me than anything else.

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,291
And right now
my school's in trouble.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,708
Let's face it.

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,416
The last few years, the
collective strength of our team

39
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
has sharply declined.

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,375
Kaio Academy used
to be like a fortress.

41
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,291
And if we're going to
be that fortress again,

42
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,125
we need stronger players.

43
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
Like Tsukimoto from
Katase High School.

44
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,708
No further comment.

45
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,583
[REPORTERS shouting]

46
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,750
[MALE REPORTER 5C] Isn't that
the girl from those commercials?

47
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,291
[MALE REPORTER 5D]
The Poseidon ones?

48
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,625
[MALE ANCHOR 5A] And that was
our all-too-brief interview

49
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,541
with Ryuichi Kazama,
our very own Youth Olympian,

50
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,208
who just took gold in
the table tennis singles.

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
We'll be back with
weather, right after this.

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,416
[YURIE] All the gear
you need to play!

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,166
Come on down today!

54
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,666
Congratulations, Ryu!

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,125
You totally killed it!

56
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,666
I've never seen Aunt Emiko
so excited, it was great!

57
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,875
Did you call her yet?

58
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,208
No.

59
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,541
Well you definitely should.

60
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,250
It'd make her super happy.

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,083
I hear she's always
showing clippings about you

62
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,416
to her customers.

63
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,125
So home?

64
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,166
Not yet.

65
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to stop
by the school first.

66
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,708
Guess there's no
rest for the weary, huh?

67
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,250
There's a great
pancake house nearby.

68
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,500
We could sit down.

69
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,125
[YURIE]
Okay, I get it.

70
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,375
Soon-to-be World Champ
has no time for pancakes.

71
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,833
The whole world revolves around
grampa and his precious school.

72
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,625
[HOSHINO]
Kinda pricey.

73
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,583
[HOSHINO'S GIRL 5A]
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,750
It's a steal!

75
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,791
That'd cost double
at any decent resort.

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,458
[HOSHINO] You sure
we need that stuff?

77
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,166
[HOSHINO'S GIRL 5A] I'll burn
to a crisp in half an hour

without a parasol.

79
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,416
And chairs are a must.

80
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,458
Ugh. You're so cheap.

81
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm gonna have sand everywhere.

82

I guess the sea doesn't
agree with me, either.

Maybe the mountains, then.

[KAIO PRESIDENT]
You did very well, Ryuichi.

103

our next ad campaign.

105

a stunt you pulled today.

I'm certain.

109
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,125

realize what we can offer 'im.

110
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,416

invincible at all costs.

Very sorry sir!

116
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,541
I know you made those
comments to the press

117
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,916
'cause you're concerned
about Kaio's future.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,375
But the guys are
still recovering

119
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,125
from getting thrashed
in the tournament.

120
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,375
How do you think they feel

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,041
hearing their captain
only cares about a guy

122
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
who's not on our team?

You're right, sir.

124
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,250
I apologize.

125
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,500

called into Coach's office?

--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sir!

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,833
You saw him on TV today?

129
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,458
What he said at the airport?

130
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,666
[KAIO PLAYER 5A]
Yeah.

131
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,125
[NEKOTA] Dude's supposed
to be like a robot.

132
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
They say he never smiles.

133
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,333
Yeah his name's
Tsukimoto, right?

134
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,583
Thing is, that
was not a slip up.

135
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,541
It was a completely calculated
move on Kazama's part.

136
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,791
Just watch.

137
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,291
He'll try and get
"Mr. Roboto" on our team.

138
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,000

Probably so, yeah.

Don't let up!

Push through it!

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,541
Okay, that's enough!

148

Come on, walk it off.

149
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,750

Ota, how's it going?

151

Yessir.

153

We're callin' it a day,

154
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,291
but I can hang back if
you need help with somethin'.

155
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,333
No, I think we're
good, but thanks.

156
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,833

Jeez. He's freaking obsessed.

159

Hey, Ota.

160
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,333
You got plans?

161

Gotta study for my license.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,916
I need it soon so I can
drive my family's work truck.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,875
Work truck?

164
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,208
Lucky dog.

00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,375
We gotta get saddled
with college debt.

166
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,708
Dumbass.

167
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,416
It's a small town
appliance store.

168
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
That really sound
glamorous to you?

169
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,625
[KOIZUMI]
Your old pal Mr. Chili-bowl

170
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,916
didn't come today, either.

171
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,791
[TSUKIMOTO]
Let's go inside.

172
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,416
It's starting to get cold.

173
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,791
[KOIZUMI]
Mm, I suppose that's fine.

174
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791

practice is next, right?

175
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,833
[KOIZUMI]
Can't wait!

[KOIZUMI]
Move your feet!

177
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,041
That return was weak!

178
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,166
Don't just use your hands!

179
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,208

Move your legs with purpose!

182
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,458
Yeah, when it comes
to popsicle brands,

183
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,083
this has gotta be
my all-time fave.

184
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,250
Their company's famous

185
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,000
for their free-wheeling
management style.

186
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,333
And that "black pop"
commercial was pure genius.

187
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,625
They could survive for years

188
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,166
on the success
of their orange cream.

189
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,833
But instead they keep
reinventing themselves

190
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,750
with great new stuff.

191
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,291
Almost didn't recognize you.

192
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,208
You look like burnt toast.

193
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,041
I thought you quit, Hoshino.

194
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,958
I don't see Smile anywhere.

195
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,041
It kinda looks like
you put on some weight.

196
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,333
What? You think so?

197
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,541
Tsukimoto's out running
laps with the old man,

198
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,125

training plan from us.

you believe that?

203
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,166
He's gotta have three
times the energy we do.

204
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,333
And the old man sets him up
with a crazy number of matches.

205
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,125
I'm telling ya, it's nuts!

Hello, everybody.

good day of practice?

You've put on some weight.

211

What, you too?

212
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,333
No, man.

[HOSHINO]
What?

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,125
Now you know how it feels.

219
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,333
He looks down on us all.

220
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,416
That's why he's playin'
in so many matches.

221
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,375
Nobody on our team's good
enough to practice against.

222
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,625
That means the rest of us have
to play schools at his level,

223
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,708
so we don't stand a chance.

No such thing as team spirit
on this club anymore.

227
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,708
He's a one-man army.

We just collect the balls.

You serious?

00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,083
Sakuma's not here today?

231
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,250
No sir.

232
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,416
He said he was coming
down with a cold,

233
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,166
so he'd spend the day
in his dorm room.

234
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,500
He's got a cold?

235
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,250
Understood.

236
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,333
Okay, forget about it.

237
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,166

00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
Dude, Sakuma's got a cold?

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,333
That doesn't sound
like the guy at all.

242
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,125
Hm?

243
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,500
Come on.

244
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,000
He's the type who'd play
right through appendicitis.

245
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,166
He's got a poster of that runner

246
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,875
who killed himself
for winnin' bronze.

247
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,250
So what would
be important enough

248
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,416
to make him skip practice?

249
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,416
He worships you
like a god, you know.

250
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,166
Kaio Academy doesn't let us
play other school's athletes

251
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,041
without special permission.

252
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,875
But if Sakuma was motivated,
maybe that wouldn't stop him.

253
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,375
It's fine with me if you
want to have your little crush

Finding a stronger

will be a major
challenge for us.

How can you
even talk like that?

feel if he heard you

casually planning his
future with the team

some freaking loyalty!

Showing compassion
and playing favorites

will do nothing to
restore Kaio's reputation.

If a player can't
win internationally,

291
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,875
he shouldn't compete in high
school tournaments, either.

Is he any good?

302
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,833
Let's just say
if an art gallery

303
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
were doing an
"awkwardness" exhibit,

304
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,166
this kid'd be on a pedestal.

305
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,791
I didn't scout him at all.

306
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,833
In fact I was against
him being on the team

307
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,041
for the longest time.

308
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,541
I kept turning him away.

309
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,500
Told him it would
only end in suffering.

310
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,875
But he wouldn't listen.

311
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,750
Said he came to Kaio
to become "just like Kazama."

312
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,000
Eventually I caved, figuring I
could make him a team manager.

313
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,000
But you know what?

314
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,250
Kid surprised me.

315
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,916
If you tell him to
drop and give you twenty,

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,208
he'll do
a hundred, a thousand.

317
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,250
But table tennis takes
speed and coordination.

318
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,250
You need a
natural aptitude for it.

319
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,416
Sadly, he can never
be like Ryuichi.

320
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,458
But what can I say?

321
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,166
Your old man's a softy.

322

but root for the kid.

Right here.

352
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,041
Hello sir!

353
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,833
I'm Sakuma, a First Year
at Kaio Academy!

354
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,708
I have come here today to
challenge Tsukimoto to a match.

355
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,208
If you'll allow it, sir!

356
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,333
You heard him.

357
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,708
Okay Akuma, I'll play you.

358
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,000
But you'll lose.

359
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,625
Look who thinks he's so cool!

360
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,666
[OTA]
There goes practice.

361
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,083
I give up.

362
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,583
[KOIZUMI] I don't mind
you playing a match, son.

363
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,291
But doesn't Kaio Academy have
a rule against its students

364
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,333
playing other teams
without permission?

365
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,541
Yes, sir.

366
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,000
If I lose I will be
immediately expelled.

367
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,291
Y'hear that, Tsukimoto?

368
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,208
They run their team
like a police squad.

369
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,250
What, your squad commander
didn't give you his blessing?

370
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,833
I didn't even tell
dispatch I was coming.

371
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,833
So you're ready to face
the firing squad, huh?

372
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:56,958
Okey doke.

373
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,291
We don't mind giving
you a bit of time.

374
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,791
Just don't blame us when
they're loading the guns.

375
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,000
I want this match
over in fifteen minutes.

376
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,500
We still need to finish
today's training regimen.

377
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,833
You got it, Coach.

378
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,458
Give me your worst.

379
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,416
[SAKUMA] It's been two
years and four months

380
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
since we last
had a game, Smile.

381
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,458
[TSUKIMOTO]
You don't say.

382
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,333
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Time!

383
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,416
And I'm currently ahead

384
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,541
ninety-six
games to thirty-seven!

385
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,166
[TSUKIMOTO]
I forget the silly details.

386
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,083
Ready!

387
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,625
Don't get cocky just because

388
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,500
Kazama's got it in his head
you're some kinda wonder boy.

389
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,791
Your fancy winning streak
is from playing with amateurs

390
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,166
who can't do much
of anything besides block.

391
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,375
You been splashin'
around the kiddie pool.

392
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,416
Heads up.

393
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,333
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
One-Love!

394
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,875
[SAKUMA]
What do you know, Smile?

395
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,875
It's almost like
you've gotten better.

396
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,791
[KATASE PLAYER 5A]
This guy's got some skills.

397
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,625
He actually made
Smile return a couple.

398
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,750
Well that's Kaio Academy for ya.

399
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,250
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Love-two!

[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Love-three!

401
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,000
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
That's four-love!

[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Eleven-love!

403
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,041
Game to Tsukimoto!

404
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,041
Damn you. Damn you!

405
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,625
Come on, don't fall for
a simple spin shot like that!

406
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,750
Moron!

407
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,583
[HOSHINO (CHILD)]
Hey! Stop it, Akuma!

408
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,500
Don't hit Smile, he's my friend!

409
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,833
He's dumb, Peco!

410
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,208
I can't teach him,
he just keeps sucking!

411
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,791
He never gets any better!

412
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,250
[SAKUMA]
Bring it!

413
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,291
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
That's out!

[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Two-Eleven!

415
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,250
Game to Tsukimoto!

416
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,458
[SAKUMA]
Son of a bitch.

417
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,375
I can't read his moves at all.

418
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,125
I can't knock him off balance.

419
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,375
He's not even fazed
by my knuckleball.

420
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,916
[KATASE PLAYER 1H]
Tsukimoto leads.

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Two games to zero.

422
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,250
[SAKUMA] It's like I'm
playing a college student.

423
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,708
Or a full-on pro.

424
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,500
Where the hell
did I go wrong?

425
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,541
[growls frustratedly]

426
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791
How is he tripping me up?

427
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,208
You've got a severe
astigmatism, Manabu.

428
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,833
[SAKUMA]
Where did I go wrong?

429
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,291
When your eyes get tired,

430
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,041
stare off into
the distance, okay?

431
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,625
[SAKUMA]
Why am I failing?

432
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,125
I'm hoping you got
your mom's eyes,

433
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,833
instead of bad ones like mine.

434
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,958
Look over there, Manabu.

435
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,041
What do you see?

436
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,916
[SAKUMA'S FATHER]
No, Manabu, look again.

437
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,458
That's a choo-choo,
not a beep-beep.

438
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,500
[SAKUMA]
Where did I go wrong?

439
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,291
In fact, after I
dominate high school

440
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,958
I'm gonna go play in Europe.

441
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,125
Coach says you're gonna
lead off for us, Sakuma.

442
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,458
You should be proud.

443

Why do you get
to be the one, Smile?

450

It's not freakin' fair!

451
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,541
I've worked way
too hard for this!

452
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,833
I've worked a hundred times.

453
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,166
No, a thousand times
harder than you ever will!

454
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
All so Kazama
would acknowledge me!

455
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,875
And I could put
Peco in his place!

456
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
I've given everything
to this game!

457
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,625
Practicing and thinkin'
about it every day and night!

458
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,083
I've read every book,
studied every technique!

459
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
So why?

460
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,041
'Cause you don't
have a natural talent

461

for table tennis, Akuma.

[TSUKIMOTO]
That's all it is.

00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,000
Just fact.

464
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,083
It's not something
worth screaming about.

That's a load o' crap.

I refuse to believe it.

If you're not gonna
finish our match, Akuma,

go home.

watch a meltdown.

It can't!

all these different theories
