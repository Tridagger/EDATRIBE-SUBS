00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,375
[TAKU]
You're going now?

2
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,625
But I could see you
off after Qualifiers.

3
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,666
[YURIE] No way, Dad,
you'll just cry if you do.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,291
Besides, after the
tournament I know you'll want

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,375
to jump back into
practice mode.

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,000
You know,
your mom will miss you.

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,416
When are you coming back home?

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,041
When my dreams come true.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,166
You should visit me!

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
Flying overseas is not for me.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,250
Where'd you get the money?

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,916
[YURIE]
Sold my car!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,625
[TAKU]
I'll be damned.

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,375
Have you told Ryuichi?

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,875
Are you gonna?

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,083
[YURIE]
Mm...

17
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,125
No.

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,166
But Ryu will be fine.

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,291
No one's waited for a
hero longer than he has,

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,958
and all that waiting is
bound to pay off eventually.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,500
In fact, I'm sure of it.

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,958
Someday, somebody
will come and save him.

23
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,000
[YURIE]
When he wins,

24
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,166
tell him he has to call
Aunt Emiko, all right?

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,625
[HOSHINO (CHILD)] I've traveled
far from Planet Ping Pong

26
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,666
to protect Earth's peace!

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,375
I am the unbeatable hero!

28
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,666
The bringer of justice!

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,125
Yes! It is I!

30
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,166
The totally invincible
ping pong player!

31
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,791
My name is--!

32
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,583
My name is--!

33
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,666
Can you still
play on that knee?

34
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,750
[KAZAMA]
That's your paddle?

35
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,875
I ran up to
Don-Quijote to buy it

36
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,416
so I could have some
real fun with you, Dragon!

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,375
[MALE SPECTATOR 10A]
A twiddle penhold blade?

38
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,000
Never seen anyone use one!

39
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,458
[MALE SPECTATOR 10B] He's
gonna flip it during play?

40
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,541
The inverted rubber
should strengthen his returns

41
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,750
when he gets pushed back.

42
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,541
But we can't forget Peco's gift,

43
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,750
which is his speed attack
close to the table.

44
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,916
So I put one of his
springy, pips-out rubbers

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,541
back on one side.

46
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,875
And gave him a blade with
a twiddle penhold grip

47
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,583
to make twiddling easy.

48
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,500
Now he can choose pips-out for
speed, or inverted for spin,

49
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,500
and switch on the fly, for both
forehand and backhand strokes!

50
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,166
Constantly changing sides
will drive his opponent nuts

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,166
trying to guess what's
gonna come at him next.

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,500
Not an easy play style, but
Peco picked it up in no time!

53
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,458
[KAZAMA]
This is a toy.

54
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,333
You won't stand a chance
against me with this thing.

55
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,791
[HOSHINO] You're right
about my knee, you know.

56
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,916
It is messed up pretty bad.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,666
But as an athlete,
you're really high up there.

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,291
So I think I'll
take advantage of that.

59
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,708
I'm just gonna
climb on your back,

60
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,916

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,125
...and fly.

62
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,333
Sounds to me like you need
a strong dose of reality.

63
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,250
The way you're
talking is delusional.

64
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,625
We humans aren't built to fly.

65
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,833
Ha!

I'm sick in the head!

[HOSHINO] Hot damn,
this guy is intimidating.

Guess that's a world
champ for you, though.

Don't let him get to you,

that backhand return.

[KONG, in Chinese] He doesn't
want to admit Hoshino's talent.

[SAKUMA]
Their reactions are sick!

352
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,750
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Eleven-eight!

353
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,666
Game to Hoshino!

354
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,625
[HOSHINO]
Yeah!

355
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,458
[crowd chering]

356
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,916
[in Chinese]
They're neck and neck now.

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,958
[in Chinese]
Yeah.

358
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,833
[SANADA]
Come on, Kazama!

359
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,125
By the way, don't
worry about my knee.

360
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,125
'Cause we're making this match
one for the record books.

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,166
Still love ya though, Dragon.

362
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,208
Mm-wa!

363
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,250
Don't push your luck.

364
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,208
[KAZAMA]
Yes!

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Out!

366
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,250
--[KAZAMA] Yeah!
--[TAKU] There you go!

367
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,583
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Five-six Kazama!

368
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,083
[in Chinese]
This is a good game.

369
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,833
[NORIO]
Here comes, Ryuichi!

370
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,166
That's great!

371
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
You're good at this, little guy!

372
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,750
Havin' fun?

373
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,500
You like playing this, buddy?

374
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,541
[SANADA]
Don't step back, Kazama!

375
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,125
[KAZAMA]
Shut up!

376
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,416
[SANADA]
I think he actually smiled.

377
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,833
[NEKOTA]
At what?

378
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,541
It's about time.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,291
[KAZAMA] All of my cells
are singing out with joy.

380
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,666
"Faster," they command me.

381
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,458
"Faster! Faster!"

382
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,916
My concentration is a
force, shutting out the world.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,333
As I speed up, reality
around me slows to a crawl.

384
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,291
Yet he keeps learning and
growing, like a sponge.

385
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,166
I explode into motion.

386
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,583
But I'm steadily
being outpaced.

387
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,666
I feel myself being left behind.

388
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,458
It's becoming obvious
who the better player is.

389
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,791
And yet, I don't feel anxious.

390
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,958
I'm striking with all I've got.

391
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,291
Reacting with all I am.

392
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,666
There's no time to be afraid.

393
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,666
Problem?

394
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,375
Not at all.

395
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,583
Truth is,

396
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,166
I feel really good.

397
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,166
Yeah.

398
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,291
Me, too.

399
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,458
So uh, this is match
point for me, Dragon.

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,708
[KAZAMA]
Yep.

401
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,166
This is as far as I go, hero.

402
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
[HOSHINO]
Seriously?

403
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,000
[KAZAMA] My wings
can't take any more.

404
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,625
Will you bring me
to this place again?

405
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,791
I get it now.

406
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:44,041
[KAZAMA] All of my cells
are singing out with joy.

407
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,666
"Faster," they command me.

408
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,125
"Faster! Faster!"

409
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Reality around
me slows to a crawl.

410
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,958
Yet he keeps
learning and growing.

411
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,416
I'm being outpaced,
but I don't feel anxious.

412
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,708
There's no time to be afraid.

413
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,583
There's no need to be afraid!

414
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,375
I like this place.

415
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,041
It's glorious.

416
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,208
[HOSHINO]
You were so cool, Dragon.

417
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,083
[KAZAMA]
And you were right.

418
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,625
People can fly.

419
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,458
We can fly.
