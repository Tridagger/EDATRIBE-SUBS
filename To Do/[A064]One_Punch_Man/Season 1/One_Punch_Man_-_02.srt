00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,267
Newscaster:
What could be the cause

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,603
of the massive mosquito outbreak
plaguing our nation this year?

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,671
We'll ask Mr. Kafetch,
a mosquito expert

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,007
who has written
several books on the subject.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,143
Kafetch: Thank you
for having me.

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,745
These mosquitoes belong
to an entirely new species.

7
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,748
Therefore, I honestly
know nothing about them.

8
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,950
Newscaster: Ah, come on!
What good are you?!

9
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,084
Get him off my show!

10
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,286
( Clears throat )
I mean, how interesting.

11
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,222
Let's take a look at our map...

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,091
Saitama: Man, city z's
right in their path.

13
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,761
Now we've got a mosquito plague
to deal with?

14
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,963
Newscaster:
We interrupt this program

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,766
with a breaking news bulletin.

16
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,102
A large swarm of mosquitoes
has been sighted in city z.

17
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,971
Mummified remains
of attacked farm animals

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,305
have also been found.

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,441
If you encounter
a large swarm of mosquitoes,

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,411
it is strongly suggested
that you flee immediately.

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,785

22
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,394

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,297
Announcer: This is
an emergency evacuation warning.

29
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,166
Threat level: Demon.

30
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:45,504
No resident is to go outside
under any circumstances.

31
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,573
Please remain indoors.

32
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:52,378
I repeat, no city z resident
is to go outside.

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,179
Man: Acquiring target.

( Looter laughs )

38
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,082
Thanks to that warning,
they're all empty.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,019
Like someone's actually
gonna die from a mosquito bite.

40
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,087
Heh.

41
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,288
What's losing a little blood

42
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,158
if I get to walk away
with all of this?

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,497
Was that the wind?

44
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,236
( Gasping )

45
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,038
What the--

46
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,040
( yelling )

47
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,130
( Monster sighs )

48
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,665

( Moans )

50
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,606
( Groans ) Come on.

51
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,676
That wasn't nearly enough blood
to satisfy my needs.

52
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,545
Now go get some more for me.

53
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:34,680
Huh?

54
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,116
Cyborg:
Target has been acquired.

55
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,887
Monster: Hmm?

56
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,624
Cyborg: I see. You make
the mosquitoes suck the blood

57
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,427
and then take it all
for yourself.

58
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:53,232
You must be controlling each one
by using some sort of signal.

59
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,234
That would explain
their mysterious behavior.

60
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,903
So if I were to get rid of you,
their leader,

61
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,241
would the swarm disperse
as well?

62
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,308
( Monster chuckles )

63
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,044
Our next meal is here.

64
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,512
Go drain that fool dry.

( Monster gasps )

68
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,664
Cyborg: I will eliminate you.

69
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,700
Stay right where you are.

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,935
( Monster gasps )

71
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,604
( Giggles )

72
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,207
You believe
that you can eliminate me?

73
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,274
( Giggles )

74
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,776
Then go on and try!

75
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,750
Saitama: I got you.

00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,518

00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,960
Damn mosquitoes.

83
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,337
Maybe a leg next time.

84
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,739
( Gasps ) Huh?!

85
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,874
What the--

86
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,677
what happened to my legs?

87
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,752
( Gasps )

88
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,753
Hmph!

89
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,388
Cyborg: Futile.

90
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,827
You cannot escape from me.

91
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,830
Monster: What the hell
is that guy?

92
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,567
He'll get me if I
don't come up with something.

( Chuckles )

94
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,904
The townspeople may be hiding,

95
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:16,775
but there are plenty
of animals around to feed on.

96
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,043
That's it.

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,512
Come here, little ones.

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:25,050

cyborg: So many.

101
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,592
If she has been collecting blood
from the whole town

102
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,127
as well the surrounding area,

103
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,464
then it may be more than
a simple food source for her.

104
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,668
I should put an end to this
as soon as I can.

105
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,403
Saitama: Get back here, damn it!

106
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,740
You and I aren't done yet,
you little bastard!

107
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,476
Cyborg: Who is this idiot?

108
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,943

Cyborg: Evacuate.

116
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,490
That swarm is conscious,

117
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,093
and if it senses you,
it will attack.

118
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,429
Saitama: Seriously?

119
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,564

Cyborg: Since she could speak,
I thought she would have

125
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,135
at least
human-level intelligence,

126
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,205
but in the end,
she was just a bug.

127
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,541
Bringing the mosquitoes together

128
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,609
made for one
easy-to-burn swarm.

129
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,077
When I first spotted her,

130
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,546
I confirmed that there
were no living beings

131
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,016
within 500 meters
in all directions,

132
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:07,753
so this location
allowed me to fire at will.

133
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,687
Wait a second. That guy might--

134
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,289
saitama: Man, you saved me.

00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,958
You're pretty amazing,
aren't you?

136
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,361

The more blood

the more powerful she becomes.

Genos: Indeed. My body
is mostly mechanical,

187
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,044
so my parts can be replaced.

188
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,779
Saitama: You're an odd one,
aren't you?

189
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:48,980
Genos: What kind of parts

190
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,783
have you installed
on your body, master?

191
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,518
Saitama: Don't use any.

192
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,653
Genos: But what about the
skin-colored armor on your head?

193
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,188
Saitama: Yeah,
that's just my skin, dude.

194
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,656
Genos: That's odd.

195
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,525
You appear far too young
to already be bald.

196
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:00,726
Saitama: So I'm bald?!

197
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,927
What's your problem, huh?!

198
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,395
Genos: My problems?

199
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,598
You are asking me
to list each one of them?

200
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,734
Saitama: Yeah, no, thanks.
I'm good.

201
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,537
Genos: Four years ago,
when I was 15,

202
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,538
I was still a real human being.

203
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,941
Saitama: You heard me say,
"no, thanks," didn't you?

204
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,544
Genos: Though we were poor
and had to pinch pennies,

205
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,546
we were still able to get by.

206
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,748
We lived a peaceful
and happy life together

207
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,817
until that fateful day
when a crazy cyborg

208
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,620
went out of control
and attacked our town.

209
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,222
We never knew why it happened.

210
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,224
Most likely,
a failed body modification

211
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,760
generated an irregularity
in his brain.

212
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,895
He destroyed
everything in sight,

213
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,698
parks, schools,
buildings, my house.

214
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,701
He even took the lives
of everyone in my family.

215
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,037
Miraculously, I survived,

216
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,039
but being
only a weak 15-year-old,

217
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,909
I was alone and at the end
of my strength in a ruined town.

218
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,511
That's when Dr. Kuseno
happened to pass through.

219
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,581
The doctor,
a scientist for justice,

220
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,916
was on a mission
to stop the rampaging cyborg

221
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,518
and end his oppression.

222
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,122
I asked the doctor to give me
body modification surgery

223
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,658
to make me better,
stronger, faster.

224
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,194
That's how I was reborn as
a cyborg who fights for justice.

225
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,796
I promised Dr. Kuseno I would
terminate the evil cyborg

226
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,666
and return peace to this world.

227
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,067
Saitama: Huh, I see--oh.

228
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,735
Genos: It's been
four years since that day.

229
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,270
At 19 years old,
I'm focused and driven.

230
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,940
I wander from town to town
eliminating evil.

231
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,676
The monsters
and criminal organizations

232
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,276
I have destroyed are numerous,

233
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,812
but I have been unable
to locate any clues

234
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,681
about the insane cyborg
and have become

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,016
increasingly frustrated
and restless.

236
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,952
I find myself chasing
a virtual image of that cyborg

237
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,554
whenever I face my enemies.

238
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,157
Then last week, when
that mosquito monster appeared,

239
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,959
I let my concentration slip
and paid the price.

240
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,829
I thought I could lose to no one
but the rampaging cyborg,

241
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,298
so I neglected to analyze
the data on my opponent

242
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,966
and rushed in headlong
to confront her.

243
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,768
- The result, as you know...
- ( Bird flaps )

244
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,637
Was that an enemy with
immense strength bested me.

245
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,239
If you had not been in the area,
master saitama,

246
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,107
I would have
undoubtedly been destroyed.

247
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:58,110
Master, you saved
my life that day.

248
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,380
The life that was once saved
by Dr. Kuseno many years ago

249
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,782
has now been saved yet again
by you, master saitama,

250
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,850
and I feel the weight
of that responsibility.

251
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,319
I must not allow myself to die

252
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,388
before finding and destroying
that cyborg once and for all,

253
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,189
and to achieve that,
I have to continue

254
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,858
fighting evil
as a righteous soldier

255
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,860
until that fateful day comes
when he appears before me.

256
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,261
I need to get stronger.

257
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,664
Last week, when I saw
what your punch was capable of,

258
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,265
I knew immediately
that I had to study

259
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,734
under you as your disciple.

260
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,935
If only I could be
as strong as you have become.

261
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,604
Such awesome power.
I have an old enemy

262
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,005
who must be defeated
at all cost,

263
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,474
though the battle
is not for me alone.

264
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,876
It is for my entire hometown
and for Dr. Kuseno as well.

265
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,944
I fully realize
I am still inexperienced,

266
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,480
but now, more than ever before,
I need incredible strength

267
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,348
so that I can eradicate
the greatest of evils.

268
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,818
- Dr. Kuseno is a man who--
- saitama: Enough, you idiot!

269
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,054
Shorten this stupid story
to 20 words or less!

270
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,958
Man: Mosquito girl
was defeated in battle?

271
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,360
And with one punch, you say?

272
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,961
Oh, well.

273
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,398
She was little more than
a prototype unit, after all.

274
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,903
Why is he naked?

275
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:58,970
Man #2: Unknown.

276
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,438
Man #1: Well, whatever.

277
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,642
I'm sure he'll make
quite an excellent specimen.

278
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,112
We shall study his physiology,
by force if necessary.

279
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,915
Send a messenger,
and invite him here,

280
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,318
to this,
our "house of evolution."

as requested, master.

284
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,524
Please teach me the way

285
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,428
to become strong like you are.
I beg of you.

286
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:25,464
Saitama: Hey, genos...

287
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,531
Genos: Yes?

288
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,133
Saitama: How old are you again?

289
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,134
Genos: 19, sir.

290
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,468
Saitama: So young.

291
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,938
I'm sure you'll surpass me
in no time.

292
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,539
Genos: Do you really mean that?

293
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,342
Saitama: I'm 25 years old now,

294
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,411
but I didn't even begin training
'til I was 22.

but it won't be easy.

298
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,950
Sure you can you handle it?

It seems our advance agent,

Wasn't he one

00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,717

There's a front door

Oh.

361
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,514
( Saitama yawns )

362
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,516
Being underground
keeps you cool,

363
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,786
but at the same time,
it's nice and warm.

364
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,654
- ( Lion monster growls )
- Saitama: I'm sleepy.

365
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,522
- Could you get lost?
- ( Lion monster scoffs )

366
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,391
( Laughs )

367
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,861
It would appear that I need
to teach you your place.

368
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,864
Listen up! I'm gonna slice
your eyes out with these.

369
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,534
Then we'll see if you're
still such a smart-ass!

370
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,402
And just so you know,

371
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:53,539
the beast king never
lets anyone off easy.

372
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,674
( Ground dragon gasps )

373
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,610
Saitama: Well,
enough fooling around then.

374
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:01,746
Listen up. This is your
only chance to apologize.

375
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:04,717
You clumsy oafs
smashed up my ceiling.

376
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,754
Beast king: Heh.
Well, is that so?

377
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,889
Then prepare to witness
the true power

378
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,224
- of the mighty beast--huh?
- Saitama: Aw, man.

379
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:15,561
I got dirt
in my special pants place.

380
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,562
Beast king:
Hey, are you even listening?

381
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,732
Saitama: Let me
just shake this out.

382
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,701
Beast king: You done yet?

383
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,936
Saitama: One sec.

384
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:27,572
Okay, I'm done.

385
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,441
Beast king: Then once again,

386
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,844
prepare yourself
to witness the true power

387
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,645
of the almighty beast king!

388
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,647
¶¶

389
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,649
lion slash!

390
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,658
Slug monster:
Are you okay, frog man?

391
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:47,993
Beast king:
Outta my way, pissants!

392
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,528
( Laughs )

393
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:53,332
Such is the law of the jungle,
and you're next!

394
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:56,802
( Roars )

395
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,804
Ground dragon:
No, wait! Don't kill him yet!

396
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,005
Beast king: Lion slash!
Meteor power shower!

397
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:04,476
( Yelling )

398
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,612
¶¶

399
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,023
Saitama: Consecutive...

400
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,559
Normal punches.

401
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,043
( Ground dragon gasps )

402
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,878
Saitama: Oh.

403
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,582
Ground dragon: No one told me
he'd be that strong.

404
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,785
It's best we retreat now
and regroup.

405
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:47,720
( Yelps )

406
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,454
Saitama: Found you.

407
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,858
Ground dragon: No! Impossible!

408
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,194
( Rumble )

409
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:02,701
Saitama: Huh?

410
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,545
Genos: You will answer
the question,

411
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,882
or you are going to be
eliminated. Your choice.

412
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,951
Armored gorilla: It is you
who will be eliminated,

413
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,019
you blithering fool.

414
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,288
I am the third
most powerful fighter

415
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,557
in the house of evolution.

416
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,094
At your power level, you will
never beat the beast king,

417
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,829
the second
most powerful fighter.

418
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,631
You will be destroyed.

419
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,901
Saitama: Is this
the guy you mean?

420
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,703
Genos: I believe it is.

421
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:42,641
( Armored gorilla sighs )

422
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,043
( Normal )
Hey, look, I'm sorry!

423
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,244
I'll tell you everything!
Just don't kill me!

424
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,914
Saitama: Wait. What happened
to your high-tech robot voice?

425
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,116
Armored gorilla:
Sorry about that.

426
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,085
I was just
trying to sound cool.

427
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,221
¶¶

428
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,294
( singing in Japanese )

429
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,484
¶¶

430
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:26,752
man: What do you mean?

431
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,287
Man #2:
Are you sure about this?

432
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,022
Man #3: The hit team
wiped out?

433
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,824
- Man #4: Confirm it.
- Man #5: What's the conclusion?

434
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,492
( Overlapping chatter )

435
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,161
- Man #6: It may be a mistake.
- Man #7: What's going on?

436
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,364
Dr. Genus:
What's all the commotion?

437
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,399
( Men stammering )
