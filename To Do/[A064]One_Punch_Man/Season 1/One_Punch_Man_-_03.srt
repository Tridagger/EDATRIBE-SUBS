00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,901
¶¶

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,139
storyteller: Long ago,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,242
there existed
a brilliant young scientist.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,480
Through the musings
of his astonishing genius,

5
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,415
he was able to make a number

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,318
of significant contributions
to human knowledge.

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,290
Eventually, however,
his accomplishments

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,193
led him to be disillusioned
with the world.

9
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,031
Though he was constantly
showered with praise

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,232
for the intricacies

11
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,435
and revolutionary creations
of his mind,

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,237
none of his ideas or theories
ever received

13
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,506
even the slightest bit
of support

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,242
from the scientific community.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,247
Rather than advancing
human civilization,

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,248
his goal was
the artificial evolution

17
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,050
of humans as a species.

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,720
That was the only dream
he had ever had,

19
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,055
but not a single person
came forward

20
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,324
to help him achieve his vision.

21
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,193
Dr. Genus:
Damn these simple apes!

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,929
"Dangerous ideas"?

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,397
Treating me like a freak?!

24
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,733
( Scoffs ) Do these
lowbrow simians really think

25
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,136
humans have come this far
by avoiding risks?

26
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,206
Idiots who think that mankind
no longer has the need to evolve

27
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,675
have no right
to call themselves scientists,

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,743
let alone pass on their genes.

29
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,546
Of course,
this plan and its fruition

30
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,147
were always for my sake.

31
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,684
I will carry it out,
even if I must do it all myself.

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,757
Storyteller:
He devoted himself to research,

33
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,560
but it was only
after he turned 70

34
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,694
that his efforts yielded

35
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,463
the results
he'd been searching for.

36
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,169
( Dr. Genus gasps )

37
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,239
Storyteller: First,
the scientist regained

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,841
the prime age-range
of his youth.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,711
Next, he began
cloning himself en masse.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,648
He named his laboratory
the house of evolution,

41
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,516
and with his clones,

42
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,386
he conducted countless
experiments with animals,

43
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,522
creating new life
and new species.

44
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,259
His experiments then shifted
to human subjects.

45
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,261
Saitama: This is
taking too long!

46
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,396
Armored gorilla: Huh?

47
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,330
Saitama: What's this
got to do with me?

48
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,066
You're just tryin'
to sound cool again.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,134
( Armored gorilla sighs )

50
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,735
Saitama: Enough jibber-jabber.

51
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,337
Just get to the point, okay?

52
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,672
Genos: My master
is a very busy man.

53
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,074
Summarize it all
in 20 words or less.

54
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,743
Armored gorilla: Uh...

55
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,746
Sure. Sorry about that.

56
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:28,813
¶¶

57
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,783
( singing in Japanese )

58
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,305
¶¶

59
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,108
armored gorilla:
So, in other words, uh,

60
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,577
the boss man has become
passionately curious

61
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,311
about you and your body.

62
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,446
Saitama: Too bad.

63
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,114
I'm not interested in dudes.

64
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,417
Genos: Master,
that is not what he meant.

65
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,655
Your body surpasses
normal human limitations,

66
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,592
so he plans on using it
for his research on evolution.

67
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:17,729
Unless he is stopped, I am
sure he will try this again.

68
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,399
We cannot allow him
a free hand.

69
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,202
Our move should be
to attack him.

70
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,604
Saitama: Sure. Let's go.

71
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,806
Genos: Right.

72
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,808
( Footsteps )

73
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,743
Huh?

74
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,411
Now?!

75
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,680
Saitama: Yeah.
There's a sale on tomorrow.

76
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,881
Can't do it then.

77
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,482
Genos: But, master!

78
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,751
Armored gorilla:
This doesn't sound good.

79
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,420
Better tell the doctor.

80
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,688
Genos: Hey, you.

81
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,223
( Armored gorilla yelps ) Yes?

82
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,225
Genos: I have one last question.

83
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,360
The house of evolution's
cyborg development,

84
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,629
did it begin
over four years ago?

85
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,363
How many were created?

86
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,633
Have any of them destroyed towns
in the past?

87
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,235
Armored gorilla: Um,
I'm not really sure,

88
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,238
but at the house of evolution,
I'm the only combat cyborg.

89
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,175
Genos: Hmm.

90
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,644
Dr. Genus: Impossible!

91
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,514
Our elite force,
formed for the destruction

92
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,315
of these archaic humans,
wiped out?!

93
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,184
Clone #33: According
to armored gorilla's report,

94
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:16,121
the two responsible for doing so
are on their way here now.

95
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,656
( Dr. Genus gasps )

96
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,792
Second clone: If they manage
to make it to the lab,

97
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,861
all of our research, everything
that we've been working on,

98
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,929
could be destroyed.

99
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,332
Clone #78:
We're in serious trouble.

100
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,533
( Dr. Genus sputters )

101
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,469
We're forced to use
our trump card.

102
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,137
( Clones gasping )

103
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,939
Dr. Genus: Begin preparations

104
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,141
for the release
of carnage kabuto.

105
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,275
Clone #50: No way!

106
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,676
Fifth clone: No, not him!

107
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:39,945
Sixth clone: What?!
That's crazy!

108
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,613
Seventh clone:
He'll finally be released?

109
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,548
Eighth clone: He's right.
That might be the only way.

110
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,617
- Maybe we should stop him.
- This is too dangerous!

111
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,019
- There is no turning back now.
- There's no other way!

112
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,622
Dr. Genus: Quiet down.
He'll be our very last resort.

113
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,491
Clone #33: But, sir...

114
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,427
Dr. Genus: We'll start
by activating all our traps

115
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,495
from the first floor
to the eighth.

116
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,365
If we're lucky, they will
take care of the intruders.

117
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,435
I'm aware of what will happen
to us should we fail,

118
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,571
especially to me.

119
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,373
( Bird trills )

120
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,510
Genos: I did not think we
would be running the whole way.

121
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,246
Saitama: How else
are we gonna get there?

122
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:17,182
Genos: It was my assumption
that you had the ability to fly.

123
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,983
Saitama: You know humans
can't do that, right?

124
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,854
Genos: It is amazing
that you are never late.

125
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,855
You are a true hero.

126
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,391
Saitama: Really? You're kidding.

127
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,393
I hardly ever arrive on time.

128
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:30,662
Genos: We're here.

129
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,432
This is the place
we were told about.

130
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,868
Saitama: So this is...

131
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,803
Genos: The house of evolution.

132
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,872
Saitama: One, two, three,
four, five, six.

133
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,642
Looks like it's
about eight stories high.

134
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,555
Uh...

135
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,091
That seemed a little rash.
Don't you think?

136
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,894
Genos: You see,
in the interest of efficiency,

137
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,561
I thought it would be best

138
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,031
to destroy them all
in one fell swoop.

139
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,899
Saitama: Well,
that was efficient, but...

140
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,768
We could have at least seen

141
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,970
what our enemies
had in store for us.

142
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,306
You didn't really
think that one through.

143
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,714
Looks like there's a basement.

144
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,321
( Clone yells )

145
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,459
( Clone panting )

146
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,895
Stop it! Just stay away!

147
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:43,635
( Carnage kabuto growls )

148
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,814
Dr. Genus: Hey, uh,
carnage kabuto,

149
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,882
tell me,
are you feeling all right?

150
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,819
It would appear you've killed
a bunch of my clones again.

151
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,555
Are you satisfied?

152
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,756
Carnage kabuto: Eh?

153
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,625
You fool!

154
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,695
Why would I be satisfied, huh?

155
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,432
I've been kept locked up
deep beneath the earth.

156
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:19,571
I'm the strongest warrior in
the entire house of evolution!

157
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,906
Dr. Genus: You were imprisoned,

158
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,508
because you're
mentally unstable.

159
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,908
We couldn't control you.

160
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,378
There was no choice
in the matter.

161
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,647
Carnage kabuto:
You couldn't control me?

162
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,049
( Laughs ) Moron!

163
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,119
I am the ultimate culmination
of the "new human"

164
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,588
you guys have sought
for so long.

165
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,857
My intelligence
and physical strength

166
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,859
are incomparable to your own.

167
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,594
The way I see it,

168
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,665
you and all of your clones
should be the ones obeying me.

169
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,600
( Slurps )

170
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,735
( Dr. Genus thinking )
No, you're a failure.

171
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,005
It's true you perform
at unheard of levels,

172
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,673
but you lack humanity.

173
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,009
( Aloud ) Go ahead
and kill me if you want.

174
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,611
Plenty of clones
could take my place.

175
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,413
Carnage kabuto: Oh?

176
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,416
Dr. Genus: But I have
a favor to ask first.

177
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,452
There's a specimen
I simply must have.

178
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,555
He's proven to be
extremely strong.

179
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,358
Only you could defeat him.

180
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,627
I want you
to catch him for me...

181
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,962
( Carnage kabuto chuckles )

182
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,432
Dr. Genus: Dead or alive.

183
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,768
( Footsteps )

184
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,903
Saitama: This basement is huge.

185
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,906
I'm getting kinda fired up.

186
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,974
( Genos gasps )

187
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,443
Saitama: Huh?

188
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,579
Genos: I sense living beings
deeper inside.

189
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,449
Master, two of them
are approaching us.

190
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,516
Saitama: Hmm?

191
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,651
( Glass shattering )

192
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,187
Carnage kabuto: Yeah!
Here we go!

193
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,522
Which one is it?!

194
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,125
Dr. Genus: The one...
On the right.

195
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,526
Carnage kabuto: In that case,

196
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,562
you don't need
the one on the left!

197
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,932
Saitama: Genos?

198
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:55,934
Oh.

199
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,937
Whoa.

200
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,874
Carnage kabuto:
My name is carnage kabuto.

201
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,542
We've got a combat
experimentation room

202
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,145
back this way.
Let's throw down in there.

203
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,947
( Chuckles )

204
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,117
Saitama: You just turned genos
into a piece of bad modern art.

205
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,887
Let's do this.

206
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,625
( Carnage kabuto chuckles )

207
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,660
¶¶

208
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,631
pretty big, huh?

209
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,767
It's the largest room
in this facility.

210
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,969
This is where we fight
to test our combat abilities,

211
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,906
which means there's plenty
of room here to kick your ass.

212
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,544
Well, then,
let's start the killing.

213
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,915
Hmm?

214
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,918
Ah. Still alive, are you?

215
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,721
( Genos gasps )

216
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,624
¶¶

217
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,741
You fool!

218
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,077
Genos: Machine-gun blows.

219
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,158
He got me good.

220
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:28,960
Let me...

221
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,028
( Carnage kabuto chuckles )

222
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,763
Genos: Take him.

223
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,632
Saitama: Your face is cracked,
and you're all smashed up.

224
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,068
Don't push yourself.

225
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,842
( Genos gasps )
With his breath?

226
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,877
Impossible!

227
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,249
Saitama: Genos.

228
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,984
Hey, are you all right?

229
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,152
Genos: Yes, master.

230
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,054
Saitama: No, you're not!

231
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,923
Look at your head!

232
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,593
( Carnage kabuto laughs )

233
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,662
( Babbles )

234
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,864
Saitama: Well, I've gotta admit
that was pretty impressive.

235
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,766
You've gone
and gotten my hopes up.

236
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,441
( Dr. Genus gasping )

237
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,412
I have always been critical

238
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,282
of humans
and their inferior abilities.

239
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,351
Aside from myself,

240
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,287
the entire species can
only be viewed as dumb animals.

241
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,291
That realization
was agony for me.

242
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,161
If memory serves,
I was 15 years old at the time.

243
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,698
That's when I hit upon my plan
to evolve the human animal

244
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,235
and create a world
where I could live contentedly,

245
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:47,639
a utopia of my very own,
created by my genius,

246
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,709
a realm populated
by a new human breed

247
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,244
transcending humanity,

248
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,312
bringing about
a new world order.

249
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,749
( Gasping )

250
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,922
I must see it through.

251
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,792
Compared to the horrible anguish
I endured back then,

252
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:11,397
this physical pain I feel now
is nothing.

253
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,265
Carnage kabuto:
What's the holdup?

254
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,333
Let's get this thing going.

255
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,670
Bring everything you've got.

256
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,538
Dr. Genus: Carnage kabuto,

257
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,473
the strongest
and most brutal creation

258
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,341
of the house of evolution.

259
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,545
Let's see how your archaic human
processes fare against a monster

260
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:30,749
that is the apex
of artificial evolution.

261
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,152
Or will you and this challenge

262
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,554
reveal new avenues
for experimentation?

263
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,657
I can't wait to find out.

264
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,659
( Boot squeaks )

265
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,228
Carnage kabuto: Oh, I see it.

266
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,296
I see it!

267
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,232
You're supposed to be strong.

268
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,633
Saitama:
Don't disappoint me now.

269
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,902
You're supposed to be

270
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,636
the ultimate weapon
in this place, right?

271
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,372
Clearly, you're not the same
as those guys this morning.

272
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,909
Look at you,
just oozing with confidence.

273
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,879
( Carnage kabuto laughs )

274
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,515
Genos: Such speed.

275
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:08,721
( Carnage kabuto gasps )

276
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,827
Saitama: What are you doing?

277
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,829
Hey.

278
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,334
Dr. Genus: Absurd!

279
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,336
Carnage kabuto retreating?!

280
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,605
Carnage kabuto:
If I'd attacked him just now,

281
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,740
- he would have killed me.
- ( Heart beating )

282
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,342
Who the hell is this guy?

283
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,612
He's leaving himself wide open,

284
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,348
yet all of my instincts
are screaming,

285
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,350
sending out danger signals!

286
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,418
Saitama: Huh?

287
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,487
Carnage kabuto: Bastard!

288
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,423
What are you,
some kind of freak?!

289
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,493
How in the hell
did you get that strong?!

290
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,294
( Genos gasps )

291
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,432
( Carnage kabuto panting )

292
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,969
Saitama:
So you wanna know as well?

293
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,438
Okay, fine.

294
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,774
¶¶

295
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,776
genos, you listen
carefully, too.

296
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,514
Genos: Wait. You mean he is
going to tell us right now,

297
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,715
the secret to his amazing power?

298
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:12,618
Dr. Genus:
I want to know as well.

299
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,522
Saitama: Huh? Who are you?

300
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,790
Dr. Genus: I am genus.

301
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,824
Saitama: Huh?

302
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,928
Fine. Whatever. Listen up.

303
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,998
Genos: No, it is too risky.

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,468
He must not let them
know his secret.

305
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,802
Saitama: First,
what's important

306
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,004
is to make sure you really stick

307
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,674
to this intense
training regimen.

308
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,476
Dr. Genus: Wait a minute.

309
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:40,745
Not modification surgery
or genetic enhancement?

310
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,414
Just training?

311
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,983
Carnage kabuto: What training?

312
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,421
Saitama: Listen, genos.

313
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,457
You have to keep doing it...

314
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,494
No matter
how difficult it gets.

315
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,565
It took me a full three years
to get this strong.

316
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,835
100 push-ups...

317
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:05,104
100 sit-ups...

318
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,839
And 100 squats...

319
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,975
Then a 10-kilometer run!

320
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,544
Do it every single day!

321
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,785
( Saitama panting )

322
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,922
And of course, make sure
you eat three meals daily.

323
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,659
Just a banana
in the morning is fine.

324
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,928
But never, ever use the
air conditioner in the summer

325
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,499
or heat in the winter,
so you can strengthen the mind.

326
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,805
In the beginning,
you'll wish you were dead.

327
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,673
You might start thinking,

328
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,410
"what's the harm
of taking a day off?"

329
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,414
But for me,
in order to be a strong hero,

330
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:51,082
even if I was spitting blood,
I never stopped.

331
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:54,086
I toughed it out
and endured the pain.

332
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:58,090
I did squats even when my legs
felt like they couldn't move.

333
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,626
Even when my arms started
making weird clicking noises,

334
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,695
I kept doing push-ups.

335
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,896
( Growling )

336
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,699
A year and a half later,

337
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,500
I started to notice
a difference.

338
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,836
I was bald...

339
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,005
And I had become stronger!

340
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,174
In other words,

341
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,841
you gotta train like hell

342
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,178
to the point
where your hair falls out.

343
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,614
That's the only way
to become truly strong.

344
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,717
Guys fooling around

345
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,454
with this "new human race"
and evolution junk,

346
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,190
they're never
gonna make it this far.

347
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,458
Human beings are strong,

348
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,128
'cause we can change ourselves!

349
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,063
Dr. Genus: W-what did he say?!

350
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,065
Carnage kabuto:
Is this guy for real?

351
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:43,134
Genos: Master...

352
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,071
You are so...

353
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,606
Full of crap!

354
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,808
Saitama: Huh?

355
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:53,078
Genos: That is nothing more
than standard strength training!

356
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,481
And it is really
not even that intense!

357
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,950
It is just a normal level!

358
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,952
I--i have to get stronger!
Understand me?!

359
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,421
I cannot believe
you would do this!

360
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,958
I did not ask to study
under you to hear jokes!

361
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,496
Master saitama, please.

362
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,832
Your power is more than one
could achieve by just training.

363
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,100
Dr. Genus: Yes, that's right.

364
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,568
I want to know your--

365
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,405
genos: Your true secret,
please reveal it!

366
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,575
Saitama: Look, genos,

367
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,578
you may not believe me,
but that's really all I did.

368
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,913
( Genos gasps )

369
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,915
Carnage kabuto: Oh, yeah?

370
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,186
Dr. Genus: No! Don't do it!
You mustn't!

371
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:38,790
Carnage kabuto: If you don't
wanna tell us your secret,

372
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,727
so be it.

373
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,128
Dr. Genus: Oh, my god.

374
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,130
Looks like he's going
on another rampage!

375
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,733
Carnage kabuto: I bet
you aren't stronger than me!

376
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,101
- Not even close!
- ( Alarm blaring )

377
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,537
( Whirring )

378
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:56,674
Carnage kabuto: But since you
seriously pissed me off--

379
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,743
( growls )

380
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,512
I'm gonna annihilate you.

381
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,950
Carnage mode!

382
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,119
¶¶

383
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,094
when I get like this,
I lose control for a whole week,

384
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:18,230
and my lust for death
cannot be quelled!

385
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,166
After I kill you,
I'll head into town.

386
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,702
Once I'm there, I'll go
on a bloody killing rampage

387
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,772
until next Saturday!

388
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:32,778
If you really are a strong hero,
then try and stop me!

389
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,182
( Roars )

390
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,685
¶¶

391
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,793
saitama: No way. It can't be.

392
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,601
Genos: Master?!

393
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,670
Saitama: Damn it.

394
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,940
I may have inadvertently
made a horrible mistake.

395
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,879
This guy's in carnage mode,

396
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:10,683
and he said he'll be
on a rampage for a whole week?

397
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,286
Carnage kabuto: Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

398
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,620
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die!

399
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,956
Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

400
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:21,360
Saitama: So he'd be like
this through next Saturday,

401
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:25,029
one whole week from today.

402
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,032
"Next Saturday."

403
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:32,237
In other words, he's saying
today is Saturday, too.

404
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:34,706
That means...

405
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,908
Dr. Genus: It's all over.

406
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:40,679
There's no one in this world who
can stop my glorious creation.

407
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,915
Saitama: That means...

408
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,317
Today is...

409
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:51,156
Bargain day at the supermarket!

410
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:54,927
¶¶

411
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,332
( screams )

412
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,402
Dr. Genus: Who the hell
is this guy?

413
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,872
Saitama: I screwed up!

414
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,206
Dr. Genus:
What is he talking about?

415
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,675
Genos: I believe...

416
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:13,178
He is upset
because he is missing this.

417
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:18,016
Master, the store
closes at 10:00 P.M.

418
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,352
That is about
four hours from now.

419
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,422
If we really hurry,
we can still make it.

420
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,958
Saitama: Wait. So you're saying
there's still a chance?

421
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,358
Genos: Right.

422
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,161
- Saitama: Let's go, genos!
- Genos: Yes, master!

423
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,765
Dr. Genus: I think I'm finished
dabbling with evolution.

424
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,434
( Rumble )

425
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,770
It would appear...

426
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,506
I'm the one who must change.

427
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,041
( Sniffs )

428
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:46,445
¶¶

429
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,651
( singing in Japanese )

430
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:20,946
Man: Yes, the on-site
investigation is under way.

431
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,348
Yes, that's correct.

432
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
Like the other cases,

433
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,753
the area has been thoroughly
burnt by intense flames.

434
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,354
Everything we've seen

435
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:32,758
points to the young cyborg
as the one who's responsible.

436
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,294
Yes. Got it.

437
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,265
Look at this.
Such devastating power.

438
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:43,102
Man #2: Yeah.
