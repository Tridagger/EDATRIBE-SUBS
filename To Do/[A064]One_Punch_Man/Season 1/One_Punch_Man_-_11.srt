¶¶

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,405
( explosions )

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
( Explosions continue )

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,449
( Woman vocalizing )

5
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,701
Alien:
T-this can't be happening!

6
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,370
Even the mighty groribas,

7
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,639
the best warrior we had,
was defeated?!

8
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,111
What manner of creature is he?

9
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,114
And how'd he get aboard our ship
in the first place?

10
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,517
Damn it! Melzargard was
supposed to be guarding

11
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,118
this ship against any threats!

12
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,654
Now he and I are
the only elite fighters left

13
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,322
to fend off
this barbaric biped!

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,724
( Operators chatter )

15
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,326
( Fighter sighs )
I bet he's just mucking about!

16
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,528
I need him now.
Curse the bastard!

17
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,131
Leader: Geryuganshoop,
what is the problem?

18
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,866
Geryuganshoop:
Lord boros, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,601
I've made a terrible mistake.

20
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,737
I've allowed one
of the natives of this planet

21
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,271
to infiltrate the ship.

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,541
In the mere four minutes
since he came aboard,

23
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,544
23% of the ship
has been damaged.

24
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,079
It seems he is alone,

25
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,214
but has somehow managed
to instantly kill

26
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,882
every warrior
sent to intercept him.

27
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,217
I'm at a loss here.

28
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,418
Lord boros: Do not panic.

29
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,221
As long as the power sphere
remains intact,

30
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,823
the ship
will continue to function.

31
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,293
The damage thus far
seems to be limited

32
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,762
to the crew's living quarters,

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,099
but our pawns alone
won't be enough.

34
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,500
Geryuganshoop,
my top lieutenants--

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,370
you, groribas, and melzargard--
will destroy him.

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
Show him what we're made of.

37
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,707
Geryuganshoop: Uh...

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,843
Groribas has unfortunately
just fallen, sir.

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,445
Lord boros: He what?

40
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,848
Geryuganshoop: But let me
get melzargard back here.

41
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,916
The two of us working together

42
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,320
will wipe out the intruder
without fail, I assure you!

43
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:15,801
¶¶

44
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,803
( singing in Japanese )

45
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,528
¶¶

46
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,902
Anchor: Our top story--
over city a,

47
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,772
an enormous object
has suddenly appeared

48
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,376
and is hovering in the sky.
We now go live at the scene.

49
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,578
Reporter: Reporting for news 4.
The city's on high alert.

50
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,383
All the main roads leading in
to city a have been closed off,

51
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,653
and officials
are keeping a watchful eye.

52
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,455
According to survivors,

53
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,723
city a has been almost
entirely demolished

54
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,692
and lays in ruin.

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,400
( Helicopter thrumming )

56
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,270
Reporter #2: This image
of the giant flying object

57
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,871
was captured
with a telephoto lens.

58
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,008
We have a local expert here
to comment on the situation.

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,410
Expert: Most likely,

60
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,545
this is the act
of an extraterrestrial being,

61
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,947
or it's an unidentified
life-form that has

62
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,616
a highly advanced civilization
unbeknownst to us.

63
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,885
Of course,
these are all hypotheses.

64
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,288
Other possibilities
exist as well.

65
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,757
Reporter #2: I see.

66
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,427
Reporter #3: There have
also been eyewitness accounts

67
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,361
of very powerful life-forms
descending to the ground

68
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,297
from what is considered
to be the spacecraft.

69
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,632
Several class-s heroes
are presently at the location

70
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,368
tackling the issue.

71
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,937
We'll keep you updated
as more information develops.

72
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,779
( Puri-puri prisoner panting )

73
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,720
Iairon: He pummeled that thing

74
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,322
with nothing but the power
of his bare fists.

75
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,258
That's a class-s hero for you.

76
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,327
Even so...

77
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,996
( Puri-puri prisoner grunts )

78
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,931
Iairon: That won't do any good!

79
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,668
It possesses
incredible regenerative powers.

80
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,005
And be sure not to let it
hit any part of you.

81
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,641
A single blow instantly
tore my entire arm off.

82
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,277
( Melzargard chuckles )

83
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,213
Iairon: Dodge its attacks
at all costs!

84
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,515
Bang: Let me give it a try.

85
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,895
( Melzargard grunts )
Should we use a bombardment

86
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,497
to finish off these humans?

87
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,898
Head #4: Yes, that is good.

88
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,700
Head #1: Contact the ship.

89
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,635
Head #4: I will go.

90
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,304
( Chuckles )

91
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,972
Metal bat: Get back here!

92
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,842
- ( Head #4 grunts )
- Metal bat: Scummy bat!

93
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,678
You'd better mind your manners!

94
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,582
I hope you like mincemeat,
freak!

95
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,918
Geryuganshoop: Melzargard!
What are you doing?

96
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,453
Melzargard: I'm in battle.

97
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,921
Geryuganshoop: Intruder here!

98
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,055
Melzargard: Ridiculous.

99
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,657
Geryuganshoop: It's true! Hurry!

100
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,360
Finish them off,
and get up here immediately!

101
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,670
Saitama: Crap,
this one's locked, too.

102
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,439
Hey, open the door!
You've got a visitor!

103
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,444
Oops. Think I broke it.

104
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,618
Metal bat: Huh?

105
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,887
Head #4: I know.

106
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,622
I'll rip your limbs off,

107
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,357
then make you the ship mascot.

108
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,892
That is good.

109
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,294
( Metal bat gasps, spits )

110
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,097
Put yourself
together again, huh?

111
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,099
( Yells )

112
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,902
I'm gonna keep you
for batting practice!

113
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,738
( Bang grunts )

114
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,443
( Melzargard yells )

115
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,978
¶¶

116
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,923
Iairon: Comrades!

117
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,058
Direct physical attacks
have no effect on it!

118
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,660
All of our efforts
have only been in vain!

119
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,462
Let's withdraw for now.

120
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,664
There must be some other way
we can destroy it,

121
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,533
like using heat.

122
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,070
Metal bat: Smashing is
all I'm good at! Forget it!

123
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,473
Bang: This is all I know
how to do as well.

124
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,143
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks. My apologies.

125
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,545
Puri-puri prisoner:
That goes for me, too.

126
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,013
Sorry, sweet iairon.

127
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,149
Atomic samurai:
Iai, I'm disappointed.

128
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,151
Don't you have faith in me?

129
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,819
There's nothing I can't cut.

130
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,888
Iairon: It's pointless.

131
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,825
These guys are used
to coming out on top.

132
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,861
They aren't the type to listen.

133
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,633
Geryuganshoop: Melzargard!

134
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,902
Look, I really need you
on the ship.

135
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,971
Getting rid of the intruder
takes priority!

136
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,508
Melzargard: I'd love to,
but I'm still busy down here.

137
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,042
These creatures are persistent.

138
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,777
Geryuganshoop:
You've gotta be kidding.

139
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,580
The life-forms down there are
proving tough to handle, too?

140
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,048
What the hell's with this place?

141
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,850
Melzargard:
Nothing tough about them.

142
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,053
What's the ship's status?
Is it going down or what?

143
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,523
Geryuganshoop:
It's not going down,

144
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,458
but more than half the crew

145
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,126
have already been killed
by this intruder.

146
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,494
Melzargard: There's no way!

147
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,199
I need to end this fast, then.

148
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,869
Begin cleansing my location with
a bombardment from the ship.

149
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,539
Geryuganshoop: Like I said, I've
got my hands full right now.

150
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,075
Besides, artillery bombardment's
the job of the lower ranks.

151
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,810
Melzargard: Well,
I'm in a situation

152
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,211
where I can't return onboard.

153
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,814
Geryuganshoop: All right, fine.

154
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,416
I'll notify the artillery crews
of your predicament.

155
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,484
Don't get caught up
in the barrage

156
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,553
and die, understood?!

157
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,055
Melzargard: Wait!
Hold on a second!

158
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,693
You should come down here
and help me.

159
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,229
That'd be
a much faster solution.

160
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,898
Hey! Geryuganshoop!

161
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,966
Damn him.

162
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,470
Just how tough is this intruder?

163
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,775
Metal bat: How about
another one?!

164
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,243
¶¶

165
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,580
head #4: More attacks?
Keep trying.

166
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,849
It is good that you're
exhausting yourself.

167
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,783
Metal bat: Hmm?

168
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,653
What the hell is this?

169
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,189
( Head #4 gasps )

170
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,659
Metal bat: A marble?

171
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,261
Why have you got one of these?

172
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,864
Head #4: G-give it back!

173
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,732
Metal bat: Here you go.

174
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,035
Head #4: Yaah!

175
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,005
Metal bat: Whoa!

176
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,741
Damn! That's nasty,
you nasty bastard.

177
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,942
Are you dead?

178
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,144
Hey! I just
discovered somethin'!

179
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,613
These guys have
a marble-thing inside 'em!

180
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,215
Destroy it, and they die!

181
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,016
( Melzargard gasps )

182
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,084
Bang: Oh!

183
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,819
Atomic samurai:
Yeah, nice work!

184
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,623
So I just
have to slice away at you

185
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,558
until I hit this vital marble
he's talking about!

186
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,628
¶¶

187
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,164
melzargard: Impossible.

188
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,101
I've been growing that head
for a hundred years,

189
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,104
and it got killed in this dump?

190
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,908
Either way, you scum
are dead when the shells hit.

191
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,242
They're coming,

192
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,044
and there's nothing
you can do to stop them.

193
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,014
( Alarm blaring )

194
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,186
Geryuganshoop:
A-attention, intruder!

195
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,654
Cease your destructive acts,

196
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,656
and depart from this vessel
immediately!

197
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:53,058
This is your only warning.
Leave at once!

198
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,793
- I-If you do not comply...
- Saitama: Hmm?

199
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,928
Geryuganshoop:
We'll have no choice

200
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,729
but to unleash
all our forces against you!

201
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,930
Saitama: That's kinda weird.

202
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,667
I'm hearing a voice
from inside my head.

203
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,268
Geryuganshoop:
Take one more step,

204
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,204
and you're dead!
Eh, we'll show no mercy!

205
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,939
Saitama: Even if
I wanted to leave,

206
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,409
I'm lost, and I can't
find my way out of here!

207
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,210
Geryuganshoop:
Really? You'd leave?

208
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,279
Okay. Then I will guide you.

209
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,282
Take a right.
Then go up the stairs.

210
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,351
Wait there
for further instruction.

211
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,619
Saitama: A right?

212
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,889
Geryuganshoop:
E-exactly, a right.

213
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,090
( Saitama chuckles )

214
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,092
I guess I'll go left then.

215
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,094
Geryuganshoop: No, wait!
Not that way! Eh,

216
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,895
w-wait a second! Hang on!

217
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,764
Didn't you hear me? That's not--
you ca--

218
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,367
all right, that was my fault.
Poor directions.

219
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,704
Uh, I'll come to you.
Please, just stay right there!

220
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:42,040
( Stammers ) No!

221
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,208
( Operators stammer )

222
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,645
Saitama: Now, this place

223
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,847
looks like a control room
or something.

224
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:49,915
Geryuganshoop: You...

225
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:50,916
Saitama: Hmm?

226
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,119
An octopus?

227
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,854
Huh?

228
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,725
Geryuganshoop: You dare
enter this place uninvited

229
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,660
and bust up our ship?

230
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,262
Saitama: Hey! What the?

231
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,998
The debris is flying at me.

232
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,935
Geryuganshoop:
Now geryuganshoop,

233
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,670
the supreme telekinetic power
in the universe,

234
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,708
will grind you
into blood sausage!

235
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,489
( Panel beeping )

236
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,827
Gunner: Good. Just about there.

237
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,428
Okay, my lord!

238
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,431
Bombardment preparations
are nearly complete.

239
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,200
Shall I proceed as ordered?

240
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,371
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

241
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,506
Well, when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

242
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,242
( Geryuganshoop gasps )

243
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,511
Gunner: Hey, lord geryuganshoop!

244
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,246
Saitama: Telekinetic?

245
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:55,914
Like psychic powers?

246
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,451
Geryuganshoop:
You leave me no choice, worm.

247
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,387
Telekinetic gravitational wave!

248
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,188
( Operators shriek )

249
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,858
Geryuganshoop: Die, earthling!

251
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,395
( crew gasp, scream )

252
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,664
Geryuganshoop:
There's nowhere to run.

253
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,799
My unparalleled
telekinetic powers

254
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:17,402
allow me to manipulate
the forces of gravity!

255
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,472
Do you know
what a black hole is, you ape?

256
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,941
Inside one, the gravitational
effects are so strong,

257
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,744
even light itself cannot escape!

258
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,745
What the...

259
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,282
Saitama: Hmm?

260
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,152

00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,692
Saitama: Eh,
now what are you doing?

263
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,428
Geryuganshoop: Take this!

264
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,629
Telekinetic shower of rubble!

( Gasps )

268
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,443
Saitama: Psychic powers?

269
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,912
Too bad you're just wasting 'em.

270
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,581
All you're doin'
is tossing pebbles around.

271
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,718
You don't really need powers
to do that.

272
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,318
Geryuganshoop: How could...

273
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,854
I, geryuganshoop--

274
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:11,924
impossible.

275
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,593
Saitama: Excuse me.

276
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,328
( Aliens gasp, stammer )

277
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,597
Saitama: I've got
a question for you.

278
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,334
Mind telling me
where your boss is?

279
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,769
Both: Eh?

280
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:26,805
( Beeping )

281
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,540
Child emperor: This isn't good.

282
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,942
Genos: Hmm?

283
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,348
Supervisor: Has that
been confirmed?

284
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,884
Sitch: Yes, I'm afraid so.
Child emperor said

285
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,019
that the energy level
in the spaceship

286
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,555
is rising
at an incredibly rapid rate.

287
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,091
Supervisor: What should we do
about the civilians?

288
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,827
Sitch: Recall the search
and rescue teams for now.

289
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,029
Have everyone find shelter
and take cover.

290
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,031
You'll be
under serious fire soon.

291
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,366

Gunner: There we go.

297
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,254
Geryuganshoop still
hasn't gotten back to me,

298
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,789
but whatever.

299
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,922
Let's see.

300
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,792
From what I recall,

301
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,794
the order
was to concentrate fire

302
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,462
around the enemies
on the surface

303
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:26,465

Metal bat: Only two heads left.

308
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,539
I'll bust
those suckers wide open!

Ship bombardment coming.

Hey, aliens,

00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:30,963

00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,388
Atomic samurai:
They got silverfang!

357
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,557
Iairon: No. A direct hit.

358
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,097
( Melzargard laughs )

359
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,565
Weak. Weak!

360
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,435
You are all so very weak.

361
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,036
Dead after a single hit.

362
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,571
( Metal bat scoffs )

363
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,974
Melzargard: A change of tactics
was all I needed.

364
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,710
If I forget about defense
and focus on my attacks,

365
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,712
this will all be over quickly.

366
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,214
You're next, swordsman! Hah!

367
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,718
I will spring past that blade

368
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:36,521
and squeeze your skull
'til it pops!

369
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,825
Atomic samurai: If you think
you can do it, then be my guest.

370
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,104
Lord boros: He's come.

371
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,596
¶¶

372
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,036
the finest warrior
this planet has to offer.

373
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,706
I can sense no limit
to his energy.

374
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,710
Saitama: Are you the boss man
of these invaders?

375
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,045
Lord boros: Wonderful!

376
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,580
Saitama: Huh?

377
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:38,851
Lord boros: Before we fight,
let us exchange names.

378
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,654
I lead the pirate band
known as dark matter,

379
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,256
and I am the dominator
of the universe.

380
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:48,527
My name is boros.

381
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,529
Saitama: I'm a hero for fun.

382
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,664
I mean, a--a real
professional hero,

383
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,266
and my name is saitama.

384
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,067
Lord boros: Saitama.

385
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,268
Saitama: Look, dude,
I don't know

386
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,137
what the denominator
of the universe

387
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,606
wants with earth,

388
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:04,610
but you sure did make
a big mess out of city a.

389
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,780
Lord boros:
What I want with earth?

390
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,616
There exists a prophecy.

391
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,085
Saitama: Prophecy?
What do you mean?

392
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,621
Lord boros:
I was once a traveler,

393
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,893
exploring the universe,
ravaging everything in sight.

394
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,228
But I was too strong.

395
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,298
Eventually, I found there were
none left who could face me.

396
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,300
I came to know the torment

397
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,770
of utter,
all-encompassing boredom.

398
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:35,174
Then one day,
a great seer told me,

399
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:40,378
somewhere on a faraway planet,
a being exists who is my match,

400
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:43,048
one who could rekindle
my passion for battle.

401
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,051
That was nearly 20 years ago.

402
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,786
Have you any concept

403
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:51,123
of the distance
I've traveled to get here?

404
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,858
My men thought
the prophecy was a ruse,

405
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,394
a fairy tale made up

406
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:58,130
to focus my attention
and lure me away,

407
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,665
but now I'm certain it was true.

408
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,203
Come, and give stimulation
to my existence.

409
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,138
That is why I am here!

410
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,143
¶¶

411
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,878
saitama: Are you an idiot?

412
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
You can't just go around
attacking other planets

413
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,816
simply to liven up
your boring little life.

414
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:21,020
Even telemarketers wouldn't
think of something that dumb.

415
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,726
Oh.

416
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,837
Lord boros: This set of armor,
which was used

417
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,306
to seal in my immeasurable,
irresistible power,

418
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,108
has now been broken.

419
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,110
Saitama: Okay.

420
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,413
( Chorus vocalizing )

421
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,083
( Lord boros grunting )

422
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,871
It is time!

423
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:16,375
¶¶

424
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,381
( singing in Japanese )
