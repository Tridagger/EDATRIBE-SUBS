- ( Monster laughs )
- ( Footsteps rumbling )

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,007
Humans, if you wish to be spared
from annihilation, take heed!

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,542
I come bearing
a message from the depths!

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,044
( Mumen rider panting )

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,481
( Monster laughs )

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,453
You will surrender the surface
to us, the clan of the seafolk!

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,293
Thereafter, you shall
become our nourishment,

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,695
bipedal human scum!

9
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,164
Hmm?

10
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,500
What a head!

11
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:37,369
Are you related to an octopus
by any chance?

12
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,038
( Laughs )

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,109
- ( Crowd murmuring )
- Man: Look at this,

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,178
and I heard it was
that same guy again.

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,645
Man #2: What was his name?

16
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,683
Man #1: I forget,
but he's super-strong.

17
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,154
( Mumen rider panting )

18
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,129
Class c?

19
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,600
Never seen him before.

20
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,202
I've gotta keep up.

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,808
¶¶

22
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,389
( Singer vocalizing )

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,292
( Woman screams )

24
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,362
Help, somebody!

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,429
( Man screams )

26
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,231
Monster: We,
the clan of seafolk,

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,565
now rule the surface, humans!

28
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,502
It is useless to resist!

29
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,769
( Man yells )

30
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,772
Monster: Eh?

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,175
You'll pay for that, human!

32
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,244
Hero: Don't worry.

33
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,245
The class-a hero stinger
is here!

34
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,582
I'm just 11th
and rising in the rankings,

35
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,516
but I'm the first one
here to help.

36
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,651
At your service, everyone!

37
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,652
Man #2: Yes! It's stinger!

38
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,787
Man #3: We're saved for sure!

39
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,188
Woman #2: Show 'em who's boss!

40
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,256
( Monsters growling )

41
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,791
Stinger: Listen up, fish!

42
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,127
Anyone who needs a new blowhole
drilled into their torso,

43
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,863
step right on up!

44
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:11,797
¶¶

45
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,799
( singing in Japanese )

46
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,558
Genos: Master,

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,295
it seems you have moved up
to rank two in class c.

48
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,564
You are close
to entering into class b.

49
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,166
Saitama: Class b, huh?
So that means

50
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,103
I won't have any more
weekly hero quotas, right?

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,303
- Genos: Correct.
- ( Telephone rings )

52
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,705
Oh, excuse me.

53
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,441
Hello. City j?

54
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,841
It is a bit far.

55
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,910
Are there no other
competent heroes nearby?

56
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,180
Saitama: That's one busy guy.

57
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,715
Genos: Master.

58
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,383
The aggressive monster
you defeated

59
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,452
on your way home the other day,

60
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,588
it called itself
one of the seafolk, right?

61
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,389
- Saitama: I don't remember.
- ( Genos gasps )

62
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,658
Reporter: Several monsters
calling themselves

63
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,660
the clan of the seafolk
have appeared in city j

64
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,862
and are attacking...

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,331
Genos: There is a class-a hero
fighting them

66
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,534
who is all alone
and on the brink of defeat.

67
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,602
Reporter: ...But the media
believes he is at his limit.

68
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,339
His extreme fatigue and pain
are apparent.

69
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,541
A response
from the hero association

70
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,476
is desperately needed.

71
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,676
Mumen rider: Hang on, buddy!

72
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,745
Reporter:
The threat level is tiger.

73
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,881
All citizens should stay out of
the area for their own safety.

74
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,617
( Stinger chuckles )

75
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,287
I gotta say, you've got spunk,
you slimy bastards.

76
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,689
My beloved bamboo shoot here

77
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,894
is stoked to battle enemies
with some grit for a change,

78
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,696
but I'm afraid
it's time to end this.

79
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,232
Monster #2:
Quit your boasting, human!

80
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,770
Your ridiculous fan club
ran off long ago.

81
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,105
Monster #3:
Your death will be painful.

82
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,442
For the taking of our brothers'
lives, you will suffer.

83
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,844
Stinger: Four fish to go.

84
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,580
It's actually a lot easier...

85
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,449
Without an audience!

86
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,917
Sing, bamboo shoot!

87
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,320
( Monsters yelling )

88
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,858
Stinger: Gigantic drill stinger,
quadruple thrust!

89
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,662
I did it.

90
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,730
I beat those bastards!

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,400
These monsters were
probably a god-level threat,

92
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,734
and I defeated them

93
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,403
all by myse--

94
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,005
deep sea king: You know...

95
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,873
When something's so annoying,

96
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,875
watching it die is a pleasure.

97
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,911
( Thunder crashes )

98
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,616
Saitama: How much farther is it
to city j?

99
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,817
Genos: We are almost there,

100
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,686
but I am not getting
any readings.

101
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,221
I will scout ahead.

102
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,822
Once their location
is confirmed,

103
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,957
I will let you know.

104
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,626
Saitama: Oh. Hey!

105
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,294
- ( Siren blaring )
- Hmm?

106
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,829
Announcer:
This is an announcement

107
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,898
from the hero association.

108
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,435
The threat level is tiger,
tiger.

109
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,272
All citizens,
please stay clear of the area.

110
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,842
Supervisor:
Was the warning issued?

111
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,443
Woman: The request
just went out, sir.

112
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,845
Man: Good. But now it's looking

113
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,712
like we're gonna need
to update the announcement.

114
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,047
- Woman: Huh?
- Supervisor: What do you mean?

115
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,983
Man: Stinger is down, sir.

116
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:18,984
( Supervisor gasps )

117
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,655
Mumen rider: Mumen rider here.

118
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,390
I'm heading in now.

119
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,792
Give me the location.

120
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,726
Operator: We're sorry.

121
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,394
All lines are busy at this time.

122
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,462
Mumen rider: Where are they?

123
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,930
Hero: Hey, best forget about it!

124
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,867
Class-c heroes
can't handle this one.

125
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,468
Mumen rider: Huh?

126
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,737
Hero #2: It's true.
The word just came down.

127
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,007
Announcer:
Emergency evacuation warning.

128
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,077
The threat level has been raised
from tiger to demon.

129
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,546
- All residents...
- Hero #1: See what I mean?

130
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,747
Announcer:
...Please evacuate immediately.

131
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:49,682
Hero #1: Hey!

132
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,283
Announcer: I repeat,

133
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,353
all residents of city j,
please evacuate immediately.

134
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,355
Deep sea king: Evacuate?

135
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,690
The fools.

136
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,027
As if I'd let even one
of these apes escape.

137
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,297
¶¶

138
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,832
hero #3: I see.

139
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,034
So that's the one
that got stinger,

140
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,636
but he's the last of 'em.

141
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,437
Should I wait for backup?

142
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,707
If it's one-on-one,
maybe I can--

143
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,509
( deep sea king chuckles )

144
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,511
( Hero #3 yelling, babbling )

145
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,651
Deep sea king:
That stings a little.

146
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:26,918
Why would you do this?

147
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,854
Hero #3: Damn it.
How'd he get behind me?

148
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,591
I was so surprised,
my voice went crazy.

149
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,860
Plus, my gunpowder-charged
lightning kick had zero effect!

150
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:35,927
I can't win.

151
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,397
Deep sea king:
And who might you be?

152
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,931
Hero #3: I am...

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,734
The hero called lightning Max.

154
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,802
Fight me!

155
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,070
Deep sea king: Fight you?

156
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,072
Lightning Max:
I'll run for it as soon as--

157
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,874
whaah!

158
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,079
What the hell happened?

159
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,015
( Groans ) I can't feel my body.

160
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,884
( Groans )

161
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,489
( Deep sea king chuckles )

162
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,690
Lightning Max: Damn it.

163
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,126
Arrogant guppy.

164
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,898
Lightning flying backwards
roundhouse kick!

165
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,851
Hero #4: I'm the class-s hero,

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,986
puri-puri prisoner.

167
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,589
I escaped prison
just to see you.

168
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,057
- Sonic: Well, well.
- Puri-puri prisoner: Hmm?

169
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,993
Sonic: Imagine that,

170
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,796
a hero serving time in prison.

171
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:47,666
I took a cue from you
and decided to escape as well.

172
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,000
Thanks for that.

173
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,669
Puri-puri prisoner:
Prisoner number 4188.

174
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,672
- The name's Sonic, right?
- Sonic: Hmm?

175
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,073
Puri-puri prisoner:
You surprised I know?

176
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,876
I check up on all the boys
who catch my eye.

177
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,144
I'm serving a life sentence

178
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,413
'cause I can't seem
to control myself.

179
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,815
I see a beautiful man,
and I take him.

180
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:04,883
Deep sea king: Well, well.

181
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,085
More soldiers have come for me?

182
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,687
Goodness.
My fins are quivering.

183
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,623
( Laughs )

184
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,761
Puri-puri prisoner: My!
I feel the strength

185
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,162
erupting out of him.

186
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,831
Hang back, Sonic, dear

187
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,165
( deep sea king laughing )

188
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,634
Class a, rank 11, sweet stinger

189
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,903
and class a, rank 20,
lightning Max,

190
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,173
I fancied
both of those lovelies.

191
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,176
Then you show up out of nowhere
and ruin them!

192
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,780
Now that genos passed me,
I rank lowest in my class,

193
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,915
but I'm still class s,

194
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,251
unlike those two
you've defeated.

195
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,586
I'll start things off
at half power

196
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,589
to Gauge how much you can take.

197
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,058
( Yells )

198
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,226
( Gasps )

199
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,596
Raah!

200
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,865
You made me rip
the hand-knit sweater

201
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,202
my boyfriend made for me!

202
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:03,074
I will never forgive you,
you bastard!

203
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:04,542
Deep sea king: Mmm.

204
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,212
A delectable slab of meat,
prime and tasty.

205
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,249
You've whet my appetite.

206
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,686
( Puri-puri prisoner grunts )

207
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,822
( Growls )

208
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,357
Deep sea king: Huh?

209
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,291
Oh, dear.

210
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,833
Deep sea king: I felt that...

211
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,234
( Bones pop )

212
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,569
Just a little.

213
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,838
Puri-puri prisoner:
I felt that as well,

214
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,773
a little. ( Snorts )

215
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,709
Sonic: Puri-puri prisoner
is acting tough,

216
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,578
but I can tell
that he's hurting.

217
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,914
So this is what a fight
between a demon-level monster

218
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,050
and a class-s hero looks like?

219
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,585
It's almost comical.

220
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,654
Neither one of them
could defeat me.

221
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,122
Puri-puri prisoner: Damn it.

222
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,659
His punch was stronger
than I expected.

223
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,994
Even so, I must not lose to him.

224
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,197
I can't have any more of my boys

225
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,933
so savagely destroyed
by this monster.

226
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,668
( Aloud )
I have no choice.

227
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,270
Gotta go all out.

228
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,539
Ready.

229
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,341
Transform!

230
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,942
Deep sea king: Huh?

231
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:16,347
Puri-puri prisoner:
Puri-puri prisoner, angel style!

232
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,085
Sonic: He's naked,
and he's definitely no angel,

233
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,020
nor is he human.

234
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,289
Nor do I want to watch.
I'm outta here.

235
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,291
Puri-puri prisoner:
No one's seen my angel style

236
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,427
and lived to tell
about it, fish man.

237
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,962
Sonic:
All the more reason to leave.

238
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,698
Deep sea king: Quite unsightly.

239
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,634
Puri-puri prisoner: Are those...

240
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,369
Your last words?!

241
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,040
Yaah!

242
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,107
Deep sea king: Huh?

243
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,176
( Puri-puri prisoner yells )

244
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,911
Angel rush!

245
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,846
( Yelling )

246
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
( Genos gasps )

247
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,856
Elevated energy levels nearby.

248
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,158
Found them.

249
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:05,064
Damn it.
I have no way to reach master.

250
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,865
It cannot be helped.

251
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,870
( Puri-puri prisoner panting )

252
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:18,744
Deep sea king: Done with
your little combo, human?

253
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,813
( Puri-puri prisoner gasps )

254
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,081
Deep sea king:
Felt that, too,

255
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,049
just a little.

256
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,290
Hear me.

257
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,027
The objective
of a combination move

258
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,895
is to finish your opponent.

259
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,965
Each separate attack must be
delivered with intent to kill,

260
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,234
like this!

261
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,911
Isn't this fun?

262
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,847
Sonic: All right, who are you?

263
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,649
Deep sea king:
I am the deep sea king.

264
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,852
As lord of the clan
of the seafolk,

265
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,920
I claim this world
as mine to rule.

266
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:05,190
Do you dare defy me
as well, human?

267
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,859
Sonic: Hah! You don't honestly
think you have the strength

268
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,995
to rule the surface
all alone, do you?

269
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:10,929
How pathetic.

270
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,197
Deep sea king: Oh?

271
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,067
Then I suppose
that I'll have to kill you.

272
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,201
Sonic: That's my line.

273
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,403
It's a shame, really.

274
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,071
I would have let you live

275
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,740
if you'd shown me
the respect I'm due.

276
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm not a hero, but you
will still be eliminated.

277
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,480
Deep sea king:
Ah, gentle rainfall.

278
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,982
( Chuckles )

279
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,952
Sonic: Too slow.

280
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,154
Wind blade kick!

281
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,822
Pathetic.

282
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:42,027
I see right through
your moves, deep sea king!

283
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,496
Deep sea king:
Are you sure of that?

284
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,900
Once it bites, my little
moray here never lets go!

285
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,236
Sonic: I'll make myself clear.

286
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,039
There's no way in hell
I'd ever lose to you.

287
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,913
It's useless.
You may have power...

288
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,149
¶¶

289
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,720
but you're far too slow.

290
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,455
You're never gonna defeat me.

291
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,390
Thank you, deep sea king!

292
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,525
Fighting something
with power such as yours

293
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,894
just confirms
how strong I really am!

294
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,999
My moves are the fastest
and the strongest!

295
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,502
( Deep sea king laughs )

296
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,139
Sonic: Now what?
Losing your mind?

297
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,141
( Gasps )

298
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,944
He's faster!

299
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,081
Stronger, too!

300
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,450
Where's this boost in power
coming from?

301
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:41,487
He's huge!

302
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,423
Deep sea king: The air
up here on the surface

303
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,091
shriveled me up a bit,

304
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,360
but this rain's helped me
feel like myself again.

305
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,965
Your attacks don't hurt me
even a little!

306
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,105
Reporter: At the time
of this broadcast,

307
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,840
the whereabouts of the seafolk

308
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,842
that attacked city j
are unknown.

309
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,511
Several heroes
who bravely tried to stop them

310
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,714
have been found
unconscious at the scene.

311
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,382
They remain
in critical condition.

312
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,784
Corpses of seafolk believed...

313
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,854
Mumen rider: Of all the times
to hit a red light. Huh?

314
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,523
Saitama: Aw, man.
Where'd he run off to?

315
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,858
Oh.

316
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,994
Mumen rider: Hold on.
Aren't you...

317
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,729
Class c, rank two?

318
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,297
Saitama: That's right.
You a hero?

319
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,733
Have you seen genos?

320
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,468
Mumen rider: Genos?

321
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,936
Reporter: Today as our guest,

322
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,672
we have the top-ranked
class-a superhero,

323
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,942
who's also been number one
in the popularity rankings

324
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,677
for the past 28 weeks.

325
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,679
But the list doesn't stop there.

326
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,882
He's also a successful model,
an actor, and a singer.

327
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,485
Let's welcome
the handsome Mr. Amai mask!

328
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,554
Amai mask:
Thank you for having me.

329
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,690
Reporter: Any time.
First off is this.

330
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,693
We are currently facing
a threat level of demon.

331
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,428
How do you assess the situation?

332
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,897
Amai mask: Hmm.
That's a difficult question.

333
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,632
Reporter: Really? Why is that?

334
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,634
Amai mask: I'm only a hero

335
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,837
during those moments
when I confront evil.

336
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,638
The rest of my daily life

337
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,707
is focused on my career
as an artist.

338
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,375
Reporter: I see.

339
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,578
Amai mask: To be honest,
the only reason I'm here today

340
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,845
is to promote my new song.

341
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,114
Reporter: Well, then,
my apologies.

342
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:19,318
In that case,
let's discuss your song.

343
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,919
Amai mask: No, it's fine.

344
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,121
Let me just say this.

345
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,858
To placate the public's
fears and worries,

346
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,859
heroes need to be tough.

347
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,861
They need to have
inner strength,

348
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,862
self-discipline.

349
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,465
With this, they can defeat evil

350
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,735
using speed, a touch of grace,
and brilliance.

351
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,004
I find it regrettable
that there were heroes

352
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,940
who were completely beaten
by evil this time around.

353
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,542
So that no hero
ever dies in vain,

354
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,346
I hope each will continue
to train his hardest

355
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,348
to push themselves
to the limit.

356
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,217
Sonic: My attacks
have no effect at all.

357
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,486
Am I lacking in power?

358
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,887
I can't kill him unarmed.

359
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,490
I need to retreat for now
and find a weapon.

360
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,491
Ugh!

361
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,493
Deep sea king:
I caught you, runt!

362
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,495
- ( Popping )
- ( Laughs )

363
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,764
Sonic: Crack-crack, snap-snap.

364
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,099
Deep sea king: Hmm?

365
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,767
Huh?

366
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:09,835
Sonic: You wait there.

367
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,904
Deep sea king: Hmm?

368
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,174
Sonic: The next time we meet
will be your demise.

369
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,843
Deep sea king: No matter.

370
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:21,513
The small fry can be let go.

371
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,121
Genos: Who might you be,
and what are you doing here?

372
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,723
There were orders to evacuate.

373
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,458
( Sonic scoffs ) A hero, huh?

374
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,594
If you're after
the deep sea king,

375
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:36,528
you'd better forget it.

376
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,130
Genos: Deep sea king?

377
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:41,400
Sonic: You heroes could all
jump him at once and still lose.

378
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,735
You're fine
at playing make-believe,

379
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,004
but when you're
up against true power,

380
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,907
not a single one of you
stands a chance.

381
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,545
Genos: Who was
that pervert, anyway?

382
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,080
( Beeping )

383
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,214
It is the seafolk.

384
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,751
I sense
numerous life signals nearby.

385
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,153
With so many--

386
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,688
the evacuation shelter!

387
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,157
¶¶

388
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,891
( overlapping chatter )

389
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,761
Boy: Daddy, are all those
scary monsters still outside?

390
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,630
Father: Now, don't you
worry about a thing.

391
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,098
As long as we're
in this shelter,

392
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,232
we're safe and sound.

393
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,968
Besides, if it
comes right down to it,

394
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,770
I'm sure all of us together
can beat a monster or two.

395
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,739
( Man grunts )

396
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,642
Deep sea king: I sense them,

397
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,712
yes, so many.

398
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,847
It's coming from...

399
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,749
Over there!

400
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,921
( All screaming )

401
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,257
Deep sea king:
What do we have here?

402
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,660
Greetings, and good-bye.

403
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,062
( Citizens gasping )

404
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,931
Man: Please wait!

405
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,666
We surrender! We surrender!

406
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,602
We will happily comply with
any demands that you might have,

407
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,672
but do not attack us,
I beg you. Please.

408
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:58,610
( Thinking ) I'm only a class-c,
so I evacuated. Now I'm trapped.

409
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,814
I'm no hero. I'm a failure.

410
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,148
Deep sea king: Surrender?

411
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,817
( Laughs )

412
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,819
I've come to kill you.

413
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,020
Your deaths are inevitable.

414
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,957
And as for my demands,

415
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,692
how about this?

416
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:17,028
I demand that you scream nicely
as I slaughter you.

417
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,296
Allback-man: I can't win.

418
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,899
I know it's not much,
but all I can do

419
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,302
is buy time for
the class-s heroes to get here.

420
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,237
I mean, look at this monster.

421
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,706
- ( Deep sea king laughing )
- Allback-man: Who am I kidding?

422
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,109
It's pointless. I can't buy time
just by talking to him.

423
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,044
( Gasps )

424
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,047
I pissed my pants.

425
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,848
I'm pathetic.

426
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,117
( Hero yells )
I'll fight with you!

427
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,054
Allback-man: Heroes?
There are others in here, too?

428
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,991
Snek: I may be
the lowest ranking at 38,

429
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,393
but I'm still a class-a hero.

430
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,862
We can do this.

431
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,130
Allback-man: Uh, that's right!

432
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,532
I'm a hero, too!
Allback-man is ready!

433
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,733
Boy: Heroes?

434
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,201
Man: The heroes
are here to save us!

435
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,136
Man #2: Heroes rock!

436
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,804
Father: Go get 'em! Yeah!

437
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,273
Hero #2: Class a?
Man, I'm glad you're here.

438
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,009
- Snek: Happy to help.
- Man #3: Take him down!

439
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,079
Allback-man: Two class cs,
one class b, and one class a.

440
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,815
We can do it. We can win!

441
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,051
( Deep sea king growls )

442
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,220
Saitama: You sure
this is the way?

443
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,089
Mumen rider: Yes.
Since local residents

444
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:20,091
are fleeing from this direction,
we'll find monsters further up.

445
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,161
Saitama: Oh.

446
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:25,029
Did you just see
a butt-naked guy run past us?

447
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,231
Mumen rider: What?

448
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,167
Saitama: Must have
evacuated mid-bath.

449
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,035
I'll check it out.

450
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:31,370
Go on without me!

451
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,105
Mumen rider: Right! Got it!

452
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,372
( Cell phone rings )

453
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:35,908
Mumen rider here.

454
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,309
Yes, sir. Correct.

455
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,111
We're on our way there now.

456
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,045
What?! Did you say the shelter?

457
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,615
( Groans )
It was the other way.

458
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,921
( Cell phone rings )

459
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,990
( Citizens cheering )

460
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,961
Snek: All right, when I
give the signal, charge him.

461
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,199
One...

462
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,334
Two...

463
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,002
Saitama: That's weird.

464
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,271
I know I saw a naked guy.

465
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,406
Huh?

466
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,074
( Cell phone rings )

467
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,110
¶¶

468
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,279
( snek groans )

469
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,817
( Deep sea king laughs )

470
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,754
Now, why so quiet
all of a sudden?

471
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,689
Genos: You there,
are you one of the seafolk?

472
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:25,657
Deep sea king: Huh?

473
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,962
Man: Mumen rider went in there?

474
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:32,097
Supervisor: Yes.
I couldn't stop h--

475
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,100
hello! Mumen rider?!
What's your location?

476
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,302
This is beyond
what you can handle.

477
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,705
The monster even
took out a class-s hero.

478
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,774
We need to assemble
a subjugation squad, and fast!

479
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,910
Saitama: A class-s hero
was defeated?

480
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,178
Supervisor: Who is this?

481
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,313
Where's mumen rider?
What's going on?!

482
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,716
( Mumen rider yells )

483
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,051
Stand-up peddling mode!

484
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,654
It's the roar of justice!

485
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:58,189
Saitama: Wait.
Is this the hero association?

486
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,725
Supervisor:
Yes, and who are you?

487
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,262
Put on the owner
of that cell phone right now!

488
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,864
Saitama: This is
the hero saitama.

489
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:06,932
Supervisor: Saitama?

490
