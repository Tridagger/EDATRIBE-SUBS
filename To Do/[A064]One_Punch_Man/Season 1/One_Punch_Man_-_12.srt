00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,445
( Lord boros yells )

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,703
( Groans )

4
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,839
Even though my true power
has been unleashed on you,

5
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,309
somehow,
you're still able to keep up.

6
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,411
Saitama: Yep.

7
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,814
You're tough. Cool.

8
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,256
Tank-top master:
Putting city a back together

9
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,591
might be impossible.
I'll think about that later.

10
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,727
Right now, I should be
focused on the battle.

11
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,930
She may be way up
at rank two or whatever,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,533
but I can't just leave
everything to one little girl.

13
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,537
I happen to have my own ways
of fighting enemies in the air.

14
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,440
Like this!

15
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,013
( Yells )

16
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,683
Tornado: Hey!
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,418
( Tank-top master yells )

18
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,420
Tornado: This area's got
some nice rubble to play with.

19
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,089
Get out of my way,
and let me do so.

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,492
Tank-top master: S-she's using
her psychic power?!

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,894
I give up!

22
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,832
¶¶

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,572
Alien: Oh, no!
We're under attack again!

24
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,040
Alien #2: Return fire!

25
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,577
Alien #3: We can't!
The guns are completely jacked!

26
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,579
Alien #4: Seriously?!
Then we're all dead meat!

27
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,514
Alien #5: This planet's
too tough to steal from!

28
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,783
Alien #6: Lord boros, save us!

29
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,486
Gunner: I just wanna go home.

30
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,991
Genos: Such incredible power.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,994
Tornado may actually
bring it down on her own.

32
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,396
Drive knight: I have
some errands to run.

33
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,064
Therefore,
I will be heading out now.

34
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,601
Things appear
to be under control.

35
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,669
Child emperor: Sure.
Go ahead then.

36
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,538
Some of the other heroes
have already left, too.

37
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,008
Drive knight: Before I go,
genos, have you got a second?

38
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,078
There's something
I wish to tell you.

39
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,348
Genos: Drive knight,
class s, rank nine.

40
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,949
This is a first.

41
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,485
Drive knight: Listen.

42
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,020
Metal knight
is actually your enemy.

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,955
( Genos gasps )

44
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,423
Drive knight: Be careful.

45
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,892
Genos: What do you mean?

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Drive knight:
You will know soon enough,

47
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,562
but for now,
stay away from him.

48
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,532
¶¶

49
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,937
( melzargard laughs )

50
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,049
( Laughs )

51
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,717
Atomic samurai: Bastard.

52
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,453
You sure are making things
interesting around here.

53
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,522
( Melzargard laughs )

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,124
I'm beginning to taste victory.

55
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,526
- ( Bang groans )
- Melzargard: Huh?

56
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,794
Bang: Ah, that's better.

57
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,663
The stiffness in my shoulders
is gone.

58
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,064
Guess I'm a little rusty.

59
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,533
Melzargard: No.
How can you still be alive?

60
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,468
Atomic samurai: Hey.

61
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,802
Forgetting something?

62
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,740
Atomic slash!

63
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,543
Melzargard: Insolence.

64
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,012
Such complete insolence!

65
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,749
Bang: You move
that heart-marble-thing around

66
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,885
inside your body
in order to hide its location,

67
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,755
but your regeneration process
always begins with your head.

68
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,558
Therefore, in the center
of that must lie...

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,692
Your heart.

70
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,429
After seeing it
happen so many times,

71
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,897
even a monkey
could figure it out.

72
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,899
See? Checkmate.

73
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,768
Melzargard: No!

74
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,036
( Marble shatters )

75
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:58,971
( Groans )

76
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,640
Iairon: Silverfang!

77
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,976
Atomic samurai: All I needed
was one more swing.

78
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,710
Keep your hands to yourself,

79
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,980
and let me finish
what I start, silverfang.

80
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,648
Bang: My goodness.

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,584
I really need to do
more full-body workouts.

82
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,587
Puri-puri prisoner:
We got all the heads.

83
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,990
That was the last one.

84
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,524
Victory is ours!

85
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,925
Metal bat: Yeah,
but there's still

86
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,927
that big-ass ship up there
to deal with.

87
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,065
( Explosions echoing )

88
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,800
Lightning Max: Okay.
I believe this is

89
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,270
the last
of the reported survivors.

90
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,671
Let's move.

91
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,573
Stinger: Yeah, sure.

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,479
Lightning Max: Mumen!

93
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,815
Quit your staring, and come on!

94
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,951
Mumen rider: Right! Coming!

95

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,961
( Singing in Japanese )

98
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,072
Lord boros: Nice moves.

99
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,941
As I thought, you are strong.

100
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,545
Of the myriad beings
I have battled thus far,

101
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,881
only you survived
for this long!

102
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,018
( Yells )

103
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,154
Now to release

104
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,190
the destructive energy
held within me!

105
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,093
Any normal creature hit by it

106
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,829
would find
even their bones vaporized!

107
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,864
( Singing in Japanese )

108
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,775
- Lord boros: Behind you!
- Saitama: Huh?

109
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,744
( Singing in Japanese )

110
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,186
Lord boros: You were
a worthy opponent,

111
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:31,990
but the outcome
of this battle is clear.

112
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,726
My species won
the struggle for survival

113
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,796
amid the harsh environment
of our home world.

114
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,266
We possess the ultimate
in regenerative abilities.

115
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,203
I in particular
have the godlike traits

116
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,338
of self-healing,
physical prowess,

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,007
and latent energy
beyond your conception.

118
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,810
A wound
that would be fatal for you

119
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,879
heals on me in mere moments.

120
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,082
By focusing all my energy
on my destroyed arm,

121
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,019
I can exponentially speed up
the healing process.

122
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,021
Good as new.

123
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,957
You, on the other hand,
will only get injured more,

124
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,226
all while your stamina
gradually decreases down to--

125
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,629
- saitama: Shut up.
- Lord boros: Huh?

126
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,364
Saitama: Blah, blah, blah.

127
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,633
You're boring me out of my mind.

128
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,902
Are you finished?

129
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,375
Not yet!

130
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,110
( Chorus singing )

131
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,688
Meteoric burst!

132
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,926
Saitama: Uh...

133
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,297
( Crew scream )

134
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,202
¶¶

135
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,146
Lord boros: The energy
shunted from my body

136
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,048
transforms
into a propelling force...

137
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,952
Elevating speed and power
to a level

138
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:11,022
beyond the limitations
of living flesh!

139
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,991

140
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:34,846

( Silence )

142
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,340
( Muted boom )

143
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,944
( Lord boros panting )

144
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,947
Doing this places
enormous stress on my body,

145
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,283
similar to anaerobic exercise.

146
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,886
As a result,
it shortens my life.

147
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,222
Therefore, it should
only be used as a trump card

148
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,425
for settling fights as quick--

149
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,232
Metal bat: It's tilting!

150
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,435
Blackluster: Nice!
You're doing it!

151
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,403
Awesome work, tornado!

152
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,243

154

saitama: Cool.

155
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,351
I made it back.

156
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,089
Lord boros:
This infuriating man...

157
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:56,061
Makes me want to give this
everything I've got!

158
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,130
( Yelling )

159
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,935

( Coughs )

162
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,148
That's the way, saitama.

163
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,886
You are indeed
worth the effort.

164
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,889
( Saitama calmly )
Consecutive normal punches.

165
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,028

¶¶

167
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,367
I will defeat you!

168
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,040
All my energy will be released,
blasting you...

169
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,445
And this planet
straight to hell!

170
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:58,323
Collapsing star,
roaring Cannon!

171
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,329
Saitama: In that case,
I'll use my own final move.

172
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,531
Killer move, serious series...

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,867
Serious punch.

( Wind blowing )

177
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,099
Lord boros: Did I lose?

178
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,433
I can feel nothing.

179
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,237
Saitama: You're still conscious.

180
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,373
You really are strong for real.

181
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,375
Lord boros:
The prophecy held true.

182
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,511
The battle was...

183
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,513
A hard-fought one.

184
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,981
Saitama: Yeah.

185
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:57,983
It sure was.

186
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,053
¶¶

187
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,321
lord boros: You lie.

188
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,191
You were holding back,
weren't you?

189
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,061
I never stood a chance.

190
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,463
It wasn't even a battle.

191
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,200
You obliterated me. Heh heh.

192
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,672
So much
for the words of prophecies.

193
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,542
You were just too strong.

194
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,181
Sai...tama.

195
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,325
¶¶

196
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,100
Tornado: It's crashing?

197
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,536
Genos: Is this master's doing?

198
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,440
Alien #1: The power sphere's
been broken!

199
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,175
Alien #2: We're going down!

200
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:58,310
Alien #3: Lord boros
let loose his full power!

201
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,445
- Alien #4: Get out! Get out!
- Alien #5: Run!

202
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,579
Alien #6: Stop shoving, stupid!

203
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,581
Gunner: I just wanna go home!

204
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,317
Mama!

205
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,585
- Iairon: It's coming down.
- Metal bat: Huh?

206
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,388
Hey, we better get outta here.

207
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,726
Bang: Whoa, this is bad.
Run for the association hq.

208
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,261
Atomic samurai:
Iai, hold on to me!

209
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,463
Iairon: I'm okay, master!

210
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,797
Atomic samurai: Damn it!

211
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,799
How did old man silverfang
get so fast?

212
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,801
Iairon: Now's not the time
to be competitive.

213
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,403
Puri-puri prisoner: Angel dash!

214
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,805
Metal bat: Hey, pansy,
don't you run in front of me!

215
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:27,740
You're too slow!

216
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,475
Puri-puri prisoner: Angel dash!

217
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,210
Metal bat: Stop calling out
your stupid moves, and just run!

218
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,547
Aliens: We're gonna crash!

219
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,558
Genos: It is down.

220
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,360
Blackluster:
All right, let's go.

221
00:13:55,102 --> 00:14:01,707
¶¶

222
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,643
amai mask: How did city a
end up like this?

223
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,047
All of class s
was meeting here today.

224
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,081
Hmm?

225
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:14,653
Care to enlighten me
on this, metal bat?

226
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,988
Metal bat: Huh?

227
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,791
Amai mask: Explain it to me
so I can understand.

228
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:21,727
Metal bat:
Handsome kamen amai mask.

229
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,797
Where in the hell
did you pop up from?

230
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,798
Amai mask:
I was filming a TV drama

231
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,133
in the next town over.

232
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,803
There was a loud roar
and tremors,

233
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,071
so I came
to check things out,

234
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,073
only to find city a destroyed.

235
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,209
Metal bat: Monsters
on this big-ass ship behind me

236
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,610
came and attacked us.

237
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,613
They fired artillery
and did all this,

238
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,882
but we still took care of it.

239
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,816
( Amai mask sputters )

240
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,219
"Took care of it," you say?

241
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,554
Really?

242
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,956
You call this devastation
victory?

243
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,559
What utter incompetence!

244
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,027
I'm completely appalled
at all of you!

245
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,563
Metal bat: Hey...

246
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,832
You didn't even show up
until this was over,

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,767
so get off your high horse.

248
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,104
Amai mask: Yes, it's true
I didn't make it here in time.

249
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,506
But every single one
of you did, correct?

250
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,908
And you didn't even
save one brick!

251
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,976
Atomic samurai:
We were having a meeting

252
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,246
inside the headquarters building
when it all started.

253
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,649
We went outside as soon as we
heard the enemy attacking,

254
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,185
but the city had already
been reduced to ruins.

255
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,988
Amai mask: And? So what?

256
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,125
You think if you say that,
the media will just let this go?

257
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,259
Puri-puri prisoner:
Hey, handsome,

258
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,594
whose side are you on here?

259
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,863
We worked together
and did our best.

260
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,333
Amai mask: I'm on the side
of peace and justice.

261
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:39,204
Having class-s heroes
this clueless and pathetic...

262
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,541
Is an embarrassment.

263
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,145
Anybody that's this useless
should voluntarily retire.

264
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,746
Metal bat: Hey!

265
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,615
Don't start talking crap
with us, pretty boy!

266
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,016
Who's gonna care
about a pop idol

267
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,885
with his face up his ass?!

268
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:58,022
Amai mask: Do you have any idea
why I don't move up to class s?

269
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,692
It's simple, really.
I remain class a, rank one

270
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,361
so I can prevent
weak, good-for-nothing pissants

271
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,664
like you from ever moving up.

272
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,845
Nice timing, metal knight.

273
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,248
So you skip the meeting
and just now decide to show up?

274
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,217
¶¶

275
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,187
metal knight: This is...

276
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,589
Magnificent.

277
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,858
- Genos: Metal knight!
- Metal knight: Hmm?

278
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,193
Genos: What exactly
are you doing here?

279
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,928
The battle is already over.

280
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,397
Drive knight: Listen.

281
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,799
Metal knight
is actually your enemy.

282
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,333
Metal knight: Genos, right?

283
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:44,336
Genos: Do not tell me
you have come

284
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:45,804
to recover the spaceship.

285
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,340
Are you here to create
more powerful weapons

286
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,942
by incorporating
alien technology?

287
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,744
Metal knight: Precisely.

288
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,947
Powerful weapons
are a necessity

289
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,850
for the sake
of maintaining peace and order.

290
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,353
Amai mask:
Even with powerful weapons,

291
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,355
in the hands of heroes
like these, they'd be wasted.

292
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,825
Metal bat: That's it.
You're goin' down, pretty boy,

293
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,026
so watch your ass.

294
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,161
Blackluster: Yo!

295
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,363
I found some alien survivors!

296
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,302
Alien #1: Crappity-crap!
I thought lord boros never lost.

297
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,970
Alien #2: I know, right?
Think they're gonna kill us?

298
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,973
Alien #3: Maybe we can
talk our way out of this.

299
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:21,907
They seem reasonable.

300
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,042
Alien #6: Agh!

301
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,977
I'm so hungry, you guys!

302
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:28,847
Gunner: You idiot! Now's not
the time for--( Gasps )

303
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,784
- Shh! I hear someone coming.
- ( Footsteps )

304
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,056
Blackluster: What?!

305
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,457
Amai mask, why did you do that?

306
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:43,061
Amai mask: They did not deserve
to live. They were evil.

307
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,732
I merely implemented
justice swiftly. That's all.

308
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,467
I'm sure you understand,

309
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:51,337
don't you, genos?

310
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,339
You've been busy
since the exam,

311
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,108
but after the deep sea king
and today...

312
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,311
You've mostly been
a disappointment.

313
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,149
Bang: Leave it be.

314
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,218
Genos: Do not worry. I am fine.

315
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,289
He reminds me of how I was
before I met master,

316
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,959
a man on the edge

317
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,294
too eager to eliminate evil.

318
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,963
Just like me,

319
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,100
he must have gone through
something terrible in his past.

320
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,167
( Gasps )

321
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,970
Wait! Where is master saitama?

322
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:31,977
- ( Rumble )
- Tornado: Mm?

323
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,118
Saitama: Cool. Out for real.

324
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,254
Tornado: Hey!
Where'd you come from?

325
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,389
No way a class-b like you
would be inside that ship.

326
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,457
Genos: There you are!

327
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,926
Glad you are safe, master!

328
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,260
Saitama: Oh! Hey, genos!

329
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,929
We're done here. Let's go.

330
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,864
Genos: Were you able
to defeat their leader?

331
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,067
Saitama: Yeah.
He was really strong, too,

332
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,802
maybe the strongest
I've ever faced.

333
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,737
Genos: I see.
So without you, master,

334
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,872
the prophecy about
the destruction of the earth

335
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,407
- would have come true.
- ( Tornado gasps )

336
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,076
- Genos: Once again...
- Tornado: They're ignoring me?

337
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,343
Saitama: Nah.
It's these prophecies.

338
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,413
Turns out
you can't trust them at all.

339
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,347
- Tornado: Hold it right there!
- Saitama: Huh?

340
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,149
Tornado: I have no idea
how you did it,

341
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,951
but you went in the ship
on your own?!

342
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:15,153
You're just a class b.
How dare you butt in like that?

343
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,222
I didn't need you. I could
have handled it by myself!

344
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,425
Baldy! Octopus! Boiled egg!

345
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,226
Light bulb!
Avocado! Lame face...

346
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,228
Saitama: Hey, genos,
say something to her.

347
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,296
Genos: Sir.

348
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,565
Look, spoiled brat,

349
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,101
shut up, and get lost,
or pay the price.

350
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,202
Saitama: That's it! Yeah!

351
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,573
Tornado: Unforgiveable.
So I'm a brat, huh?

352
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,575
I'm older than you,
metal jackass!

353
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,445
Saitama: Whoa! Genos!

354
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,446
You're next, class-b baldy!

355
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,182
Bang: That's enough, tornado.

356
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,185
This sort of behavior isn't
becoming of a hero, now, is it?

357
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,454
Tornado: Uh...

358
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:49,388
Hmph!

359
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,789
Whatever.

360
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,526
Bang: Why are there
so many pigheaded troublemakers

361
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,127
amongst the elite heroes?

362
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:57,396
Saitama: Hey, genos,

363
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,199
your--your joints are
all bent the wrong way.

364
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,067
Here. I'll fix you up.

365
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,603
Oh, sorry. Your arm came off.

366
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,005
( Bang groans )
My back is killing me.

367
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,274
¶¶

368
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,878
genos: City a was
completely wiped off the map.

369
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,414
The arrival of aliens
and city a's annihilation

370
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,149
were history-making events

371
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,418
and were
the top stories for days,

372
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:22,821
but eventually
the coverage died down.

373
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,958
After that, no one mentioned
the city that had disappeared.

374
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,962
Metal knight
salvaged the spaceship.

375
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,362
Soon thereafter,

376
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,633
the hero association
headquarters was reconstructed

377
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,169
and became an impenetrable
fortress of steel.

378
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,904
The infrastructure was rebuilt

379
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,374
with new roads
leading out of h.Q.

380
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:46,111
This allowed heroes the ability
to deploy quickly to every city.

381
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,579
Heroes class a and above

382
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,182
were given the option
to live at headquarters,

383
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,051
letting them do
what they do best.

384
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,987
( Singing in Japanese )

385
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,952
Reporter:
You can see it clearly!

386
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,420
The entire building's
has been ripped out

387
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,488
down to the foundation!

388
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,689
Based on initial reports,

389
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,691
the monster appeared in city z.

390
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,360
Now city y--( Shrieks )

391
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,429
( Monster breathing deeply )

392
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:46,532
¶¶

393
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,970
( growls )

394
00:22:57,378 --> 00:23:02,047
You humans waste your existence
in decadence and gluttony,

395
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,383
littering the earth
with worthless objects.

396
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,251
- ( Boy crying )
- Pluton: Now you shall rot

397
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,120
in the depths of the underworld

398
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:10,155
that spreads
below my mighty snout!

399
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,459
Who do we have here?

400
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:16,061
Genos: Who, you ask?

401
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,597
A great man
who is a hero for fun

402
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,732
and profit.

403
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,768
Pluton: A great man. Hmm?

404
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,439
¶¶

405
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,478
genos: With his disciple.

406
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,713
( Boy gasps )

407
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:42,353
Saitama: Oh, come on!
I'm back to one punch again?!

408
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:47,393
Damn it!
