I made you my disciple,

I said to train
like your life depended on it.

I don't think your skills
will ever improve.

You've no talent

He changed my training

00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,603
he beat me mercilessly.

He'd been so kindhearted before.

I guess the group has grown.

Genos: However,
I can make an educated guess.

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,960
It probably
has to do with garou.

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,696
Charanko: Garou?!

40
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,964
The guy who was
kicked out of our dojo?

41
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,965
What'd he do?

00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,234
Genos: I see.

43
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,569
So you have not heard,
I take it?

44
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,771
Garou is now known
as a criminal.

45
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,973
He has been added
to the association's wanted list

46
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,375
as a violent monster.

47
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,577
Bang himself has volunteered
to take him down.

00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,646
Charanko: A monster?! Garou?!

49
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,716
Genos: Apparently
there was an incident at hq.

50
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,252
The association has been
keeping it under wraps,

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,254
but, should
a violent battle ensue,

52
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,256
it could quickly
spin out of control.

53
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,925
Perhaps that is the reason
why bang pushed you away.

54
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,262
Charanko: I had no idea.

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,930
So master bang...

56
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,432
Considers me a burden?

57
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,001
Genos: But that is
simply my hypothesis.

58
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,002

Now, that's a cool hero name.

How'd I get stuck

00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,426
You two have met.

00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,662
Saitama: Huh? For real?

72
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,902
Charanko: I just can't
allow myself to be a burden.

73
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,971
For the sake of my master,
I need to stop garou.

74
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,376
But it's not like he's
gonna pop up right next to me.

- Mumen rider: Hunt?

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,459
What on earth
are you talking about?

83
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,661
This entire discussion
is a bit odd.

84
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,464
Garou: To complete my evolution
into a monster,

85
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,466
I need prey like you.

I'll have you know

he'll come after my dojo

129
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,645
Of course I came!

130
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,780

master's tackle,

137
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,529
I was scared for a second!

Tank top master:
One thing's for certain.

140
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,468
He is human.

141
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,205
But then, why?

142
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,475
Why are my senses telling me
to kill him here and now?

00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,884

( Gags )

148
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,487
Tank top master:
Why'd you stop me?

149
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,022
( Mumen rider gasps )
Have you forgotten who you are?

150
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,692
A class-s hero on the verge
of killing a human?

151
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,026
You already won the fight!

152
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,028
We're supposed
to protect people!

153
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,698
Tank top tiger:
This bastard attacked a hero!

154
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,700
- It's his own damn fault!
- Blackhole: Stay out of it!

155
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,501
We'll teach him
not to mess with the tank tops.

156
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,769
Tank top master:
Pipe down. That's enough.

157
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,105
What he says is true.

158
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,508
I didn't earn the right
to wear the tank top of a hero

159
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,577
so I could do harm to humans.

160
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,579
Listen up.

161
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,949
Let this be a lesson
to never harm others again.

162
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,051
Garou: Yeah, all right.

163
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,053
I'm leaving.

164
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,955
Sorry for the trouble.

165
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,858
Like hell!

166
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,528
I'm gonna slaughter
every last one of you bitches!

167
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,931
Tank top master:
That's too bad, but expected.

168
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,866
You die right here, right now!

169
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,603
- ( Gags )
- Garou: Damn.

170
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,204
Looks like it slipped out.

171
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,874
I try to avoid using
the old geezer's style.

172
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,676
Eh, whatevs.

173
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,619
Tank top master: No way.

174
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,021
He was hiding his true strength?

175
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,756
Garou: Imagine that.

176
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,759
A class-s hero
down on his knees.

177
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,894
Tank top master:
Don't think you've won.

178
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,696
You caught me off guard is all.

179
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,831
- ( Groans )
- ( Garou laughs )

180
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,833
Shut up,
and stay right where you are.

181
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,969
You got a front-row seat

182
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,571
to see garou the monster
murder all your bros.

183
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,974
Tank top master: Garou? Oh, no!

184
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,777
He's that human
who calls himself a monster!

185
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,780
No, please! Don't do it!

186
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:28,781
Leave them alone!

187
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,715
Mumen rider: Justice crash!

188
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,785
♫

189
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,522
( gagging )

190
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,260
Garou: Now...

191
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,796
Which one of you is next?

192
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,797
( Heroes gasping )

193
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,700
( Tank top master roars )

194
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,337
Garou: That fighting style
of yours is pretty predictable.

195
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,206
( Tank top master gasps )

196
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,209
Garou: You're all done,
tank top master.

197
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,145
Right. All that's left
is a little cleanup.

198
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,881
Hero #1: You cocky scumbag!

199
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,651
Let's see how you do against
a whole legion of tank tops!

200
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,024
Hero #3: Damn you!

201
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,762
- ( Heroes gasp )
- ( Garou chuckles )

202
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,698
- ( Heroes gagging )
- ( Blows striking )

203
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,841
( Hero shrieks )

204
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,575
Charanko: That's enough, garou!

205
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,245
You're a disgrace to the dojo!

206
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,779
Take this!

207
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:35,781
Fist of flowing water crush...

208
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,058
Bang: It seems
we have arrived too late.

209
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,727
Bomb: Truly a horrible sight
to behold.

210
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,262
So tell me,

211
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,033
do you have any idea
what garou's next move might be?

212
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,002
What's wrong?

213
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,508
Bang: Charanko.

214
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,010
Hero: I heard a rumor
that the hero hunter

215
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,812
took down tank top master.

216
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,415
Hero #2: No way.
He defeated a class-s hero?

217
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,350
Hero #1: I heard
tank top's disciples

218
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,887
and mumen rider
were all beat to hell, too.

219
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,223
Hero #2: So he's hunting heroes
from class s and class c?

220
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,758
What are we supposed to do?

221
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,760
Hero #3: Come on. Show
a little backbone, will you?

222
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,027
How about the three of us

223
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,029
capture this "hero hunter"
ourselves?

224
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,098
Hero #2: Yeah, right.

225
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,900
Hero #1: He beat
a class-s, remember?

226
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,768
Hero #3: Yeah,
but think about it.

227
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,704
This dude
isn't some scary monster.

228
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,772
He's just a tough human being.

229
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,308
Hero #2: Yeah, but he learned
how to fight from silverfang.

230
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,111
Hero #3: Well, I happen to know
a little martial arts myself.

231
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,379
If an opponent comes at you
like this, deflect!

232
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,116
Attack from the front?
First you dodge, then punch!

233
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,385
And if he managed
to drop in on you from above,

234
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,320
- kapo--
- ( Hero #2 whimpers )

235
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,454
Hero #1: Hi, sir!

236
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,123
Mumen rider: I can't believe

237
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,925
you came all this way
to see me.

238
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,127
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

239
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,662
Saitama: Sure. Picked up
some bananas on the way.

240
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,131
Mumen rider:
Ah, that sounds great.

241
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,401
Oh, they're for you, then.

242
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,137
Saitama: I read about
everything that happened

243
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,606
in the hero association
newsletter.

244
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,941
Mmm.

245
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,743
It said that dozens of heroes

246
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,145
were beaten by a single
butt-kicking monster.

247
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,813
Lucky you survived, huh?

248
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,414
Here. Have a banana.

249
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,283
Mumen rider:
It was a human that did it.

250
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,618
Saitama: What?

251
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,886
Mumen rider:
But he called himself a monster,

252
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,223
and he was tough as hell,
scary strong for a human being.

253
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,159
Saitama: Was he stronger
than that fish-monster thing

254
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,294
- we faced before?
- Mumen rider: Huh.

255
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,030
While deep sea king
was insanely tough,

256
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,032
this guy was different somehow.

257
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,033
Saitama: Oh?

258
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,835
Tank top master: His moves,

259
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,037
they're sophisticated
martial arts techniques.

260
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,440
It seems silverfang
raised a true monster

261
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,642
when he trained
that freakin' guy.

262
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,311
Saitama: Uh, who's this guy

263
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,781
that butted in
to our conversation?

264
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,849
Mumen rider: What?
That's tank top master,

265
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,451
- the class-s hero.
- Saitama: Oh, right!

266
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,186
He was in the newspaper.

267
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,054
It said he took
the worst beating of all.

268
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,389
( Tank top master scoffs )
At least say

269
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,924
that I put up
the best fight! Damn.

270
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,461
I never imagined
I'd lose to a punk like him.

271
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,797
Those martial arts he used
were brutal as hell.

272
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,331
Saitama: Martial arts?

273
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,266
- How 'bout a banana?
- Tank top master: Huh?

274
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,135
Uh, okay.

275
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,270
Saitama: So, this monster guy,

276
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,073
think maybe
you could give me the deets?

277
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,177
( Wind blows )

278
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,014
- Garou: Hey there, kid.
- Boy: Huh?

279
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,016
Garou: That's
an interesting-looking book

280
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:24,983
you got there.

281
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,822
( Heroes groaning )

282
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,824
Boy: This blonde guy is king.

283
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,957
He's a class-s hero.

284
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,493
He's the strongest ever.

285
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,962
And this is lightning genji,
a class-a hero.

286
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,499
I see him patrolling around
my neighborhood all the time.

287
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,434
I got his autograph. See?

288
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,903
( Garou laughs )
Yeah, so you did.

289
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,372
I want his autograph, too.

290
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,307
You think maybe
you could help me find him?

291
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,843
Boy: For sure.

292
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,911
So you're into heroes,
too, mister?

293
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,914
Garou: That hero almanac
is pretty cool.

294
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,517
Say, you think I could
borrow it for a week or so?

295
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,720
Boy: No way!
Get your own if you want one.

296
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,790
Garou: Don't be all stingy!
What's with these kids?

297
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,195
Whoa! Look at that!

298
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,131
It lists all the monsters, too.
Now, that's exciting.

299
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,868
Boy: What?
You like the monster pages?

300
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,070
But they're so scary. Uh...

301
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,205
Garou: The scarier, the better.

302
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,940
These guys are way cooler.

303
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,275
Boy: You're kidding.

304
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,210
That's some weird taste, mister.

305
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,478
Garou: Aw, man.

306
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,214
I wish I were listed
in this book.

307
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,482
Boy: You wanna be a hero?

308
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,417
Me, too. Same here,

309
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,486
but I suck at sports and stuff.

310
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,889
Garou: That's probably
for the best.

311
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,957
Boy: That really
wasn't very nice.

312
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,094
Garou: Well, it's patrol time.

313
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,428
I better get going.

314
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,365
According to that almanac,
golden ball from class a

315
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,301
shows up at his usual pub
around this time.

316
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,103
Catch you later, turd.

317
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,439
Boy: Be careful on patrol,
mister. See you.

318
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,374
Garou: I will. By the way,

319
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,910
don't call me "mister." Got it?

320
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,912
I'm not some old grandpa.

321
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,180
Boy: Huh? Sorry.
You say something, mister?

322
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,250
Garou: It's like that, huh?
Go home, runt.

323
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,786
Tank top master: He was fast.
He parried, sidestepped,

324
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,922
or slipped through
every attack I threw at him,

325
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,323
and he was able to read

326
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,391
any attempt I made
at throws and counters.

327
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,929
His moves reflect his opponent's
power back at double strength.

328
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,532
They target pressure points
and joints, any weaknesses.

329
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,068
Where he strikes, you suffer
a loss of physical function.

330
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,539
Most monsters rely on
their immense strength and size,

331
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,541
which they unleash
with extreme violence,

332
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,543
but garou is different.

333
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,280
His techniques are devised
for breaking humans.

334
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,015
In other words,

335
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,084
he's built for the sole purpose
of defeating heroes.

336
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,420
Saitama: Huh.

337
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,323
?

338
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,192
Saitama: Yeah.
Just feeling curious.

339
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,326
Thought I'd give it a shot.

340
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,596
Know anybody good? Uh, was it...

341
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,130
Chumpo?

342
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,131
Charanko:
It's charanko, damn it!

343
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,199
Saitama: Have a banana.

344
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,001
No hard feelings, okay?

345
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,603
Charanko: That's
a terrible place to put it!

346
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,272
( Sighs ) If you want help
learning martial arts,

347
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,940
you should ask master bang.

348
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,875
He seems to have
taken a liking to you, so--

349
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,877
saitama: Nah. I mean,

350
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,146
the old dude
might strain himself.

351
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,481
Charanko:
That's ageist and rude!

352
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,483
You can't just waltz
into a tournament

353
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,018
and challenge professionals.

354
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,220
First, you master
the basic forms.

355
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,555
No, may be best
to build stamina.

356
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,225
Running up and down a couple
hundred stairs would help.

357
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,094
Actually the dojo
could use a good cleaning.

358
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,430
Saitama: Look, if you don't
know anyone, just forget it.

359
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,763
Charanko: No! Wait a second!

360
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,565
- Saitama: Huh?
- Charanko: Just wait, okay?

361
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:31,102
There's a mixed-martial-arts
tournament I signed up for.

362
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,104
I'm pretty sure I still
have the admission ticket.

363
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,039
Here.

364
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,441
Saitama: It's all crumpled up.

365
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,375
Charanko: I registered to fight,

366
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,445
but I'm gonna have
to forfeit my spot.

367
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,113
This'll get you inside, though,

368
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,449
so take it,
and go watch the matches.

369
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,452
You'll get to observe
lots of fighting styles.

370
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,453
Saitama: Cool, man. Thanks.

371
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,121
( Echoing ) Staring.

372
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,456
You said you're
gonna forfeit, right?

373
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,923
Charanko: Well, yeah.
I'm injured.

374
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,460
Saitama: It says
the top prize is three million.

375
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,528
Charanko: Yeah.
I mean, it's a big tournament.

376
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,664
Saitama: Three million
is a nice chunk o' change.

377
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,132
Charanko: Just to be clear,

378
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
you can't enter
in someone else's place.

379
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,336
Hey. Are you listening?

380
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,473
Garou: You're the class-a hero,
golden ball, right?

381
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,074
Golden ball: Huh?

382
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,209
Garou: I'd like a word
with you, outside.

383
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,878
Golden ball:
I'm kinda drinking here.

384
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,412
Kick rocks.

385
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,613
What in the hell?!

386
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,215
Aw, man, you wasted it.

387
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,084
( Garou chuckles )

388
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,418
( Golden ball chuckles )

389
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,287
All right, then, tough guy.

390
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,223
There's a parking lot nearby.
We'll do it there.

391
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,093
- ( Footsteps shuffling )
- I've seen your kind before,

392
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:31,096

a professional hero.

393
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,564
( Groans )

394
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,632
If it's liquid courage
giving you brass balls,

395
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:35,834
better step off now.

396
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,103
While you can still walk,
that is.

397
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,172
Garou: Quiet down.
I'm not drunk.

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,074
But you're--

399
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:44,510
( gasps )

400
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,444
Bastard.

401
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,180
Golden ball:
Not too sharp, are you?

402
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,448
Some hero hunter.

403
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:53,785
How did tank top master lose
to a jerk-off like you?

404
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,588
See, I ain't too bad
at hunting, myself,

405
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,390
so I'll lay you out quick

406
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,992
and get me another beer!

407
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,528
Huh? ( Scoffs )

408
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,263
He read the trajectory
from my hand movement.

409
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,133
In that case,
try this on for size!

410
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,468
Rebound shot!

411
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,470
- ( Garou groans )
- Golden ball: Whoopsie.

412
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,540
You're lucky
nothing vital got hit.

413
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,275
So what do you think?
Ain't heroes incredible?

414
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,677
Garou: You think
that was just luck?

415
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,079
I'd say it's about
your coordination

416
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,281
being off
'cause you're hammered.

417
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,351
You're gonna wish you'd
finished me with that shot,

418
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,553
- 'cause now you're a dead man.
- Golden ball: Don't worry.

419
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,354
I got plenty of balls
left for you,

00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,423

421
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,291

422
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,692
Killer move...

423
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,029
Golden breakout!

424
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,569
He's dodging all that
with minimal movement.

425
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,670
This guy's on another level.

426
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,706
Still, I got one last shot.

427
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,275
Better make it count!

428
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,546
( Gasps )

429
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,454
Garou: So what do you think?

430
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,989
Ain't monsters incredible?

431
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,124
It's over now.

432
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,325
Die.

433
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,693

in the pub for our rendezvous,

437
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,073
so I thought perhaps
you'd forgotten about our drink.

438
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,209
Garou: Class-a hero
spring mustachio. ( Scoffs )

439
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,344
Spring mustachio:
How kind of you to know.

440
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,814
And I presume you are
the much-rumored hero hunter.

441
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,748
Garou: We have a winner!

442
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,419
And your prize is that
you're gonna get crushed, too.

443
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,821
Golden ball: I managed
to injure his right leg,

444
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,490
so he'll be a little slow
on his footwork.

445
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,625
Spring mustachio: I see it.

446
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,226
Thank you
for the helpful information.

447
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:44,162

These are pretty tight quarters

448
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,897
for that pointy stick
you're waving around.

449
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,634

Let's find out, shall we?

450

Your fancy moves
are listed in the hero almanac.

Listen up, you cocky dirtbag.

you can take me down, go for it.

Don't talk nonsense, my dear.

469

As a director
of the hero association,

00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,171
having fun with you
is a necessary expenditure.

People like me who fight evil
on the front lines

478
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,441
must take every chance we get
to relax

Is he a hero, too?

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,304
There is an emergency.

524
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,573
No. It has to do with
master saitama's condition.

525
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,776
Those reinforced
artificial hair fibers,

526
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,578
is it possible for them
to be grafted into living skin?

527
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,914
Yes. It appears
necessary after all.

528
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,183
Black hair-fibers
are available, correct?

529
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,518
How soon would you be able

530
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,986
to perform
the implant procedure?

531
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,456
I see. Wednesday next week?

532
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,858
All right, then.
Yes, I, too, will be there.

533
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,461
Understood. Begin preparations.

534
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,395
Thank you, doctor.

535
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:38,730
Master saitama!

536
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,332
Are you available
anytime next wednesday?

537
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Saitama: Look, you can't
transplant hair fibers

538
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,069
into someone's head
without asking.

539
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,805
I'm using this to enter
a fighting tournament...

540
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,474
As charanko.

541
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,608
( Genos gasps ) This is today.

542
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,410
Saitama: Yep!

543
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,012
Just kinda curious.

544
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,882
Gonna see what's up with all
this martial-arts stuff.
