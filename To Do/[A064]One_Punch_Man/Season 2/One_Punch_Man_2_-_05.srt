1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:02,734
Man: You've lost contact
with metal bat?

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,270
Man 2: Yes.
I've already put out a call

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,273
for backup,
all class-a heroes and above.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,743
Man 3: Centichoro,
the gigantic bug monster,

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,612
threat level dragon. Thoughts?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,213
Woman: It's like
a force of nature.

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,150
Man 3: This far exceeds
what happened two years ago.

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,819
We may not have the numbers
to defeat a monster like this.

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,622
Woman: King is engaged
in another battle somewhere,

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,624
but what of
the other class-s heroes?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,225
- ( Alarms blaring )
- ( Telephones ringing )

12
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,362
Man 1: Multiple
emergency calls coming in.

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,896
( Gasps )

14
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,298
What's happening?

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,633
( Rumbling )

16
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,634
Mohican: Damn it.

17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,235
It's got us cornered!

18
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,504
Pineapple:
If we don't do something quick,

19
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,572
we're dead!

20
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,573
Mohican: Aw, crap!

21
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,280
Pineapple: Look!
It's metal knight!

22
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,254
Mohican: There's our backup!
( Laughs )

23
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,590
Metal Knight: You're in the way.

24
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,794
A weapons test is not
some spectacle. Clear the area!

25
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,528
Heroes: Oh! Sorry, sir!

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,530
Metal Knight: Not a scratch.

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,533
For a biologic, its armor
is remarkably resistant.

28
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,735
( Centichoro growls )

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,538
Pineapple: Is that giant bug
still after us?

30
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,541
Mohican: I think metal knight is
trying to keep it off our backs.

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,943
Pineapple: That's good for us,
but what about metal bat?

32
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,479
( Both gasp )

33
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,348
( Monster laughs )
You in a hurry, heroes?

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,549
You can't escape!

35
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,351
Monster 2:
Hand those two over now!

36
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,219
Heroes: Monsters?!

37
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,420
( Monsters laugh )

38
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,822
Monster 3: Let's see.

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,556
The report said that metal bat

40
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,958
was going head-to-head
with centichoro.

41
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,362
Where is he? What is he doing?

42
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,365
Man 1: This is unprecedented.

43
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,300
Monsters of threat level demon
and above

44
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,769
are appearing simultaneously
in every city!

45
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,705
Our response teams
are being overwhelmed!

46
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,907
It's too much.

47
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:49,842
We can't keep up!

48
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:51,976

62
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,015
Garou: Guess you
were worn down already.

63
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,418
I wanted to see
how tough you were,

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,020
but I won't get a true taste,
since you're running on fumes.

65
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,589
Metal bat: Shut your mouth!

66
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,758
¶

67
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,566
Garou: All that blood loss.

68
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,435
I don't even know how
you're able to stay conscious.

69
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,037
On top of that, a bunch
of your bones are broken.

70
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,241
Is it hero pride
that keeps you standing?

71
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,482
( Gasps )

72
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,654
( Metal bat roars )

73
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,723
Garou: His swings
are coming faster?

74
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,592
( Metal bat yells )

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,994
Garou: More powerful, too.

76
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,796
That shouldn't be possible.

77
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,534
But that's
exactly what's happening.

78
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,336
( Metal bat yells )

79
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,475
Garou: With every hit he takes,

80
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,876
every time he gets hurt,

81
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,545
he becomes physically stronger.

82
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,348
How do you even make sense?

83
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,682
Metal bat: Screw makin' sense.

84
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,484
It's about fighting spirit.

85
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,086
Garou: Is he for real?

86
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,156
Metal bat: Let's get this show
on the road, "hero hunter."

87
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,826
I still got a giant centipede
to beat the crap out of.

88
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,694
Garou: This guy's a nut-bag.

89
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:53,498
Just how long's
that fighting spirit gonna last?

90
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,433
Either way, I'm game.

91

93
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,778
- Huh?
- Garou: Over here!

94
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,379
You jackass!

95
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,113
Metal bat: I got a personal rule

96
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,916
to never let muggers
or hero hunters off the hook.

97
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,519
I'm gonna take
that rotten spirit of yours

98
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,755
and pound it into shape!

99
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,793
Garou: Swing and a miss, moron!

100
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,461
- ( Metal bat growls )
- ( Garou laughs )

101
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,996
Is this your entire strategy?

102
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,598
Just gonna keep swinging that
thing around 'til you're dead?

103
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,733
Metal bat: 'Til I'm dead?

104
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,135
Ain't nobody got time for that.

105
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,771
'Til I win!

106
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,943
Killer move!
Fighting spirit brutal tornado!

- ( Roars )
- Garou: Hah!

108
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,815
'Cause i'm
so scared of spinning!

109
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,882
( Chuckles )

110
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,885
¶

111
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,153
hate to break it to you.

112
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,857
Parrying an amateur attack
like this one is kid stuff.

113
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,735
( Metal bat groans )

114
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,039
Garou: Finally.

115
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,440
And stay down this time.

116
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,775
Tank top master and metal bat

117
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,577
were both nothing
but muscleheads.

118
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,515
Against a human martial artist,
they have no way to compete.

119
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,983
Huh. Taking down
the hero association

120
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,519
might be easier than I thought.

121
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,455
Whoa. What's this?

122
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,792
Could that goon
really have so much power?

123
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,595
( Chuckles ) If you'd
have caught me square on,

124
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,730
I'd have been in trouble.

125
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,798
Girl: Big brother!

126
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,204
( Garou gasps )

127
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,540
Girl: Big brother bat.

128
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,541
( Metal bat scoffs )

129
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,008
Girl: What's going on here?

130
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,143
Who is that weird man?

131
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,945
Garou: Your sister?

132
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,147
Metal bat: Zenko! Stay ba--

00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,482
zenko: Big bro!

134
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,016
Garou: You had
your best chance there,

135
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,017
but you blew it.

136
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,887
You won't get another one.

137
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,021
Now to put you down for good.

138
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,623
Zenko: Stop right there!

139
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
My brother promised me
there'd be no violence

140
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,627
when I'm around,
so you can back off!

141
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,696
No more fighting allowed!

142
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,699
- Garou: Huh?
- Zenko: This fight is done!

143
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,034
Garou: You wanna tell me
exactly why I have to follow

144
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,836
your family's ridiculous rules?

145
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,105
( Zenko growls )

146
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,540
It's over!

147
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,581
Garou: Oh, right. Guess I did
have something else to do.

148
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,983
No time to waste on a jackass.

149
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,518
Until next time.

150
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,986
Metal bat:
You started this fight,

151
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,521
you arrogant bastard.

152
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,790
Garou: You get to live
for now, metal bat.

153
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,057
- Enjoy.
- Metal bat: I'll enjoy--

154
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,928
zenko: Forget him!
We need to get home now!

155
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:36,995
There's a monster!

156
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,530
( Metal bat gasps ) Oh, crap!

157
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,665
The executive and his kid
are in danger.

158
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,734
I gotta get to 'em!

159
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,936
Zenko: What?!
You're kidding, right?!

160
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,138
Hold it! I won't let you!

161
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,872
You're gonna get killed!

162
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,874
Metal bat: Zenko,
just go on home, all right?

163
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,875
Zenko: Hi-yah!

164
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,611
Stubborn blockhead!

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,750

monster 3: Hmm.

169
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:05,157
So that's the hero hunter
everyone's been talking about.

170
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,826
He's pretty good for a human.

171
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,762
Monster 2: He didn't
even finish off the hero

172
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,829
when he had the chance.

173
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,965
Monster 3:
You judge far too quickly.

174
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,234
That man could be put
to good use, hedro-jellyfish.

175
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,169
Hmm?

00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,642
Metal bat's younger sister.

178
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,110
Never can have enough hostages!

179
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,245
- Garou: Hey.
- Hedro-jellyfish: What?

180

00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,249
Garou: So the eyes that have
been watching me all day

182
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,250
were yours, huh?

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,251
( Hedro-jellyfish gurgles )

184
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,253
Garou: What? You survived that?

185
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,655
Monster 3: Hold, hero hunter.

186
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,323
Garou: Two against one, huh?

187
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,258
Monster 3:
We are not your enemies.

188
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,660
Take a look at this.

189
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,062
I'm sure
it will pique your interest.

190
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,832
- Garou: "Monster association"?
- Monster 3: I knew he'd bite.

191
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,934
Why not come with us?

192
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,070
We can escort you
to our hideout.

193
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,706
- ( Paper rips )
- Eh?

194
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,875
Garou: Not interested. Piss off.

195
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,610
( Monster 3 laughs )

196
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,145
I'll just pretend
I didn't see that.

197
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,216
One day soon,
we will meet again.

198
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,819
As long as you
continue hunting heroes,

199
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,821
it is simply inevitable.

200
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,023
Hedro-jellyfish:
We'll be watching you.

201
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,859
¶

202
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,895
garou: Whatever, creeps.

203
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,897
Monster:
Talk about disappointment.

204
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:19,898
Mohican: No way!

205
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,700
My mohi-punch did nothing!

206
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,035
Pineapple:
Same with my pine cannon.

207
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,104
Monster: Pineapple gets
5 points. Mohican get 2.

208
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,241
That's on a 100-point scale,
by the way.

209
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,643
You're so weak,
I can't even think of a joke!

210
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,713
Do you know how hard
I've trained for this,

211
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,849
how much I've pushed
my horn and body

212
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,983
for the day
of the final battle?!

213
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,385
Any idea at all?!

214
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,054
- Monster 3: Rhino wrestler!
- Rhino Wrestler: Hmm?

215
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,255
Monster 3: Bring the hostages!

216
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,256
We're pulling out!

217
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,990
Rhino Wrestler:
Aww, come on, now!

218
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,992
I thought we were gonna
take down metal knight!

219
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,728
Monster 3: No!
That thing you see

220
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,930
is nothing
but a remote-controlled drone.

221
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,733
Today is not the final battle.

222
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,801
You're not to go off
on your own.

223
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,336
Rhino Wrestler: All right, then!

224
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,739
So do I take
both of these creatures or what?

225
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,741
Monster 3: No.
Just the child will do.

226
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,342
Pineapple: Please! You can't!

227
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,144
Mohican: Damn it! We're not
gonna let metal bat down.

228
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,013
You can take the kid
over our dead bodies!

229
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,883
Rhino Wrestler: That's the plan!

230
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,419
Did you see that, Phoenix Man?

231
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,355
What threat level do you think
they're gonna give me?

232
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,623
Phoenix Man: Who knows?

233
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,293
Centichoro,
mission accomplished!

234
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,828
It is time to withdraw!

235
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,963
( Centichoro grumbles )

236
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,305
Metal Knight:
Escaping underground?

237
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,273
Not so fast!

238
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,043
I won't let go!

239
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,914
Phoenix Man:
That's good for now.

240
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,982
The final battle is yet to come.

241
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,918
Man: Kill it!

242
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,720
Man 2: Keep it up, heavy Kong!

243
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,723
Heavy Kong: Damn.
Still no backup.

244
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,990
Where the hell are they?

245
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,126
Monster:
You're a class-a hero, right?

246
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,729
Just how many
class-a scalps will it take

247
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,730
for me to raise my threat level?

248
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,132
( Blow lands )

249
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,334
Lightning Genji:
It's immune to my stun rods.

250
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,470
Bad luck getting matched up
with this monster.

251
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,273
Monster 2: Actually,
lightning genji of class a,

252
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,475
I'd say you're having
rather good luck,

253
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,877
for other cities are facing

254
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,479
far more violent monsters
than me.

255
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,281
- ( Rumbling )
- ( Lightning genji panting )

256
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,820
Good god. What in heaven's name
is happening?

257
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,021
( Pounding on door )

258
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,223
Sourface: Hey!
Stop sitting on your ass,

259
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,224
and come out of there!

260
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,160
It's go-time, charanko!

261
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,695
Hurry it up, you doofus!

262
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,096
Saitama: All right.

263
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,165
Guess I'll go.

264
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,869
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

265
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,871
we've kept you in suspense
long enough!

266
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,073
Competitors for super fight 22,

267
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,408
it is time to enter the arena!

268
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,744
( Crowd cheering )

269
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,347
First up, a newcomer,

270
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,483
the class-a, rank-19 hero

271
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,952

hyper karate max,

272

273
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,756
Lightning Max:
Got my eyes on the prize.

274
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,424
Announcer:
Our sole female fighter,

275
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,959
with blazing fast attacks,

276
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,362
including her palm bells fist,
ring-ring!

277
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,029
Ring-ring: Can we
just start already?

278
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,832
Announcer: From "the way
of the cruel" school, benpats!

279

The perennial

whose slithery arms
can strike opponents anywhere,

281
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,909
class a's lowest-ranked hero,
snakebite snek!

282
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,111
Snek: Why did he
have to say, "lowest-ranked"?

283
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,313
Announcer:
And that's not all, folks!

284
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,447
From the fist of thunder,

285
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,717
with his super-conductor body,
boltane!

286
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,919
Bazuzu, master of
the nuclear fist!

287
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,121
From the many fists, gatling!

288
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,724
With his gentle self defense,
hamukichi!

289
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,193
With his giant smothering
killing technique, Dave!

290
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,396
Master of psycho-analytic
martial arts, logy!

291
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,998
Mentai, the spice fist fighter!

292
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,000
Giga-pro wrestler, jakumen!

293
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,003
From the way of the chosen one,
choze!

294
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,472
Formerly of the fist

master of sourfacekempo,

Returning for
his seventh straight appearance,

298
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:57,349
will the man who won't quit
finally win his first fight?

00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:00,018
From the take-the-plunge
true fist, zakkos!

300
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,354

and propose to my lady.

301
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,156
Announcer: All right, moving on.

302
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,158
The man who wrote
"please don't aim for my head"

303
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,427
on his registration form?
Is he really here to fight?

304
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,897
From the fist of seltzer water
on the rocks, charanko!

305
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,099
( Crowd booing )

306
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,834
Saitama: Why are they
already booing me?

307
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,437
Man: Hey, isn't that
genos from class s?

308
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,172
Man 2: I guess he's a fight fan.

309
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,308
Announcer: A great contender,
some say the greatest,

310
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,310
he's already
won two championships.

311
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,113
He's conquered
every opponent come his way!

312
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,515
But the man himself
says he's never gone all out!

313
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:34,453
Master of the dark hell
killing jutsu, bakuzan!

314
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,388
Bakuzan: Winning
the championship today,

315
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,922
that will have true meaning.

316
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,391
Announcer:
Another face from the past,

317
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,393
he boasts
of unparalleled strength.

318
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,996
It's the first time we've
seen him in seven tournaments!

319
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,531
A four-time past champion,
the man himself,

320
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,067
dark corporeal fist, suiryu!

321
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,068
Suiryu: All right!

322
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,403
( Crowd cheering )

323
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:52,871
Announcer: He's spent
the past three years

324
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,206
travelling and enjoying life

325
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,809
and says he's only here
for the prize money.

326
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,545
Could his carefree attitude
be the secret to his power?

327
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,348
This time, he'll have
to contend with bakuzan.

328
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,418
Bakuzan: So that's suiryu.
If I kill him,

329
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,822
that would make me
the strongest active fighter.

330
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,024
Suiryu: I sense
his piercing aura,

331
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,426
but the one I was hoping to face

332
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,695
would be
the last tournament's champion.

333
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,567
As long as I'm here,

334
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,037
I'd at least
like to challenge myself.

335
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,972
Announcer: This is
your super fight 22!

336
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,443
And now that the introductions
are over, let the match begin!

337
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,046
( Sourface exhales )

338
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,914
Deep breaths. Stay calm.

339
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,050
You're okay.
It's all gonna be okay.

340
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,852
Saitama: Hey, gramps,
nervous about something?

341
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,053
Sourface:
Don't call me "gramps"!

342
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,588
I may outrank you,
but I'm 20, same as you!

343
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,323
Saitama: Wait.
He's younger than me?

344
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,991
Zakkos: Hey, you!

345
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:49,594
You claim a martial arts style
no one's heard of.

346
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,063
I smell an amateur.

347
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,598
Martial arts aren't a joke.
Withdraw now,

348
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,468
or else I'll have to crush you
without mercy.

349
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,002
Saitama: Not gonna respond?

350
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,271
Sourface: You're the one
he's talking to!

351
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,339
Zakkos: You can't even
tie your belt right.

352
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,541
Nice bow.

353
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,209
Sourface: Haven't you
learned anything?

354
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,343
You're hopeless.

355
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,079
Zakkos: Super fight
is the pinnacle

356
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,547
of mixed martial arts.

357
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,416
It's not some playground
for ignorant newcomers.

358
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,553
Sourface: He's not an amateur.
We were both in bang's dojo.

359
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,089
Zakkos: Seriously?
That's tragic.

360
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,423
How the standards have fallen.

361
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:19,892
Sourface: What'd you say?!

362
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,561
Zakkos: Bang was slated
to be chief judge today,

363
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,496
but he cancelled last minute,

364
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,432
and that little stunt
is causing all kinds of trouble.

365
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,901
Sourface: Master bang did what?

366
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,969
Zakkos: The "treasure
of the martial arts world"

367
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,171
decided to ditch
his dojo and disciples,

368
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,173
all so he could run off
and play hero.

369
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,242
Sourface: I won't stand
for this insolence!

370
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,043
And you,
why aren't you getting angry?

371
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,579
- Saitama: Uh...
- Sourface: I quit

372
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,648
and walked away, but you
stayed on as his last disciple!

373
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,183
Saitama: Oh, gotcha.

374
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,252
Ah, it's all right.
Let him have his say.

375
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,987
Sourface: What's that?!

376
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,989
Saitama: I didn't
come here to argue.

377
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,991
He says he's gonna
crush me in the ring.

378
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,327
Now, that's more my speed.

379
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,195
He doesn't seem
all that strong, though.

380
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,997
Sourface: Heh.
That's telling him, charanko.

381
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,332
( Zakkos scoffs )

382
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,267
I'm gonna butcher you
like a butcher butches!

383
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,537
Bomb: I don't mind
being on garou's trail,

384
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,273
but you're sure
he'll simply show up?

385
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,075
( Thinking ) Hmm.

386
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:13,211
He's certainly in a mood,
isn't he?

387
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,546
Huh?

388
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:16,481
I think something's
taking the bait.

389
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,483
It's after the class-a
we've been shadowing.

390
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,419
Bang: What? Let's move.

391
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,020
( Crowd murmuring )

392
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,356
( Monster laughs )
The demonic pugilist

393
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,491
is here to level this city
to the ground!

394
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,827
Bang: Well, it isn't garou.

395
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,696
You can sit this one out, bomb.

396
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,965
( Hero gasps ) Huh?

397
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,699
Silverfang? Great timing.

398
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,635
We can--uh...

399
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,236
Huh?

400
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,038
Demonic pugilist:
You're a class-s hero, right?

401
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,975
I know you. You're
that famous martial artist.

402
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:46,044
When I was human,
I was a fighter, too,

403
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,981
but sanctioned bouts
weren't nearly enough for me.

404
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,383
Eventually, my lust
for violence changed me.

405
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,986
See? Now I'm a monster!

406
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,455
( Screams )

407
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,192
Hero: That's, uh...

408
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,994
( Squelch )

409
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,728
Bang: We must find him

410
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,932
before he ends up
like this sad creature.

411
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,603
Announcer: All right!
It's time for our first match,

412
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,538
Max versus ring-ring!

413
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,606
- Referee: Begin!
- ( Lightning Max gasps )

414
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,342
Announcer: Ring-ring leaps in!

415
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,744
Ring-ring: Heart hard hit!

416
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,612
( Heroes yell )

417
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,550
( Hero gasps ) A whip
can generate that much power?

418
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,685
( Monster laughs )

419
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,488
You're about 100 years too young

420
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,423
to approach super s head-on!

421
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:35,227
You pathetic bunch
of worthless hero pigs!

422
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,561
( Monster chomps )

423
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,697
Man: Heavy Kong, no.

424
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,099
Monster: This is the best
class a can offer?

425
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,368
They sure don't have
much fight in 'em.

426
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,438
So, anyway, be sure to spread
the word for me, all right?

427
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,307
The one who took heavy Kong
down for the count

428
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,576
was the great martial gorilla.

429
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,478
( Chuckles )

430
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,116
( Monster roars )

431
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,655
( Lightning genji sighs )
This is going nowhere.

432
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,123
Monster: You won't escape.

433
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,325
( Pounds drum )

434
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,095
( Lightning genji groaning )

435
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:15,067
I-I just couldn't win.

436
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,134
( Groans )

437
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,670
Monster 2: Interesting

438
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,206
with the right matchup,
even threat-level tigers like us

439
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,208
are able to defeat
class-a heroes.

440
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,743
( Monster 1 giggles )

441
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,746
Perhaps there was no need
for us to hide away after all.

442
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,149
Man: We have word heavy Kong
was defeated in city w.

443
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,684
Man 2: The bad news
keeps coming.

444
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,087
We can't reach metal bat
or metal knight on comms.

445
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,155
Man 3: The mammoth creature
in city I

446
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,558
is devouring buildings
and seems to be growing!

447
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,761
It's also ossifying.
We cannot let it continue!

448
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,364
Man 4: Toxins!
The monster in city y

449
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,698
is using a neurotoxin

450
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,367
to paralyze the heroes
that try to stop it!

451
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,570
Man 1: It's no use.
There's just too many of them.

452
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,973
Man 2: If this continues,
we'll be wiped out.

453
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,310
Monster: Both the monsters
and the humans

454
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,246
appear to have misjudged
our relative abilities.

455
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:04,383
We were far stronger
than we initially thought,

456
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,118
while the humans were weaker.

457
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,321
Even their best heroes
hardly pose a threat.

458
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,656
Hero: Hey! Snap out of it!

459
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,125
- What's wrong with you?!
- ( Hero 2 growling )

460
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,327
Hero 2: Darkness blade,
pull it together!

461
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,396
Super s: When I punish someone
with my whip,

462
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,331
it imparts a special stimulus

463
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,466
that turns them
into love slaves.

464
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,335
Hero 1: No! Please! Stop this!

465
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,670
Super s: If you desire
a taste of my love,

466
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,339
you will fight to your deaths!

467
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:28,307
( All yell )

468
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,278
( Hero 1 gasps )

469
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,212
Are you guys...

470
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,880
Super s: My, my.

471
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,484
More suitors have come
to vie for my affection.

472
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,253
Oh, how titillating!

473
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,424
- ( Gasps )
- Blizzard: Really?

474
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,293
That's all it takes
to be threat level demon?

475
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,828
Not a bad wager.

476
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,432
If I defeat you,
their minds will be freed, yes?

477
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,833
Then they'll be in my debt,

478
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,702
like killing two birds
with one stone.

479
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,638
Hero 1: I knew it!
The blizzard bunch!

480
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,307
Blizzard: Soon, you'll be
bound and behind bars.

481
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:06,311
Super s: Oh, I wish you wouldn't
toy with my sadistic instincts.

482
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,313
I don't want kill you
too quickly.

483
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,381
Announcer: Well, that was quick!

484
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,250
An easy knockout
for Max against ring-ring!

485
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,385
( Crowd cheering, booing )

486
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:15,720
Rumor had it
that his fighting skills

487
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,722
were not yet
up to a competitive level.

488
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,792
Still, despite his low seed
in this event,

489
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,461
he advances uninjured
and seemingly with ease

490
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,062
past his first opponent!

491
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,598
Lightning Max: I wouldn't
exactly say I was uninjured.

492
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,866
Zakkos: He managed to win

493
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,402
without using
the gunpowder in his shoes.

494
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:32,537
Saitama: Hey, what's this
"low seed" stuff mean?

495
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,139
Sourface:
It's a preliminary ranking

496
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,607
for those considered
less capable.

497
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,409
They're strategically
placed in a position

498
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:39,544
where it's more difficult
to win at all.

499
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,946
Saitama: I see.
So the people running this thing

500
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,282
consider him to be weaker
than the others.

501
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,818
Sourface: Those who leave
the martial arts

502
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,752
to become heroes are looked at

503
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,621
as having taken
the easy way out.

504
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,156
It's a matter of discipline.

505
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,224
Saitama: What about bang?

506
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,692
Sourface: Master bang is unique.

507
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,160
And, unless you've forgotten,

508
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,895
you're a low seed
yourself, charanko.

509
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:57,896
Saitama: What?

510
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:58,797
Oh. You're right.

511
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,566
So the two in the corners

512
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,235
aren't necessarily
the strongest.

513
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,703
It's just
that they think I'm weak.

514
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,772
Zakkos: No, I assure you
those two are quite fierce,

515
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:08,973
but, once I beat you,

516
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,909
I'll face bakuzan,
a true contender.

517
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:14,312
Saitama: Uh,
according to these brackets--

518
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,448
oh! You're weak sauce, too.

519
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,384
Announcer: Our second bout,
zakkos versus charanko,

520
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,585
is about to begin!

521
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,654
Zakkos: I'm so gonna murder you.

522
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,655
¶

523
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,524
( singing in Japanese )

524
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,427
( Zakkos gags )

525
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,495
Announcer: Holy crap!

526
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:04,829
Charanko can hit!

527
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,231
He's off his feet!

528
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,433
Could zakkos be knocked out
by a single slap?

529
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,834
Hold up.

530
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,836
This isn't about charanko
being strong at all, is it?!

531
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:15,440
It's about zakkos
being just so weak!

532
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,375
He even invited
his girlfriend here today,

533
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,777
intending to propose to her,

534
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,779
but I'd say that now
all his life plans

535
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,781
have gone
completely off the rails!

536
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,382
- ( Crowd laughing )
- Saitama: Ooh.

537
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,650
I may have done a bad thing.

538
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,851
Announcer: Wait a minute.

539
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,653
I've just been given
some new information.

540
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,054
It seems his girlfriend

541
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,723
didn't show up
in the first place!

542
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,658
- Safe! He's safe!
- ( Laughter continues )

543
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,327
Saitama: Whew. I was worried.

544
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,730
Zakkos: This sucks so much.

545
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,665
Genos: The outcome
I was expecting.

546
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,067
At this rate, the tournament
will end before master

547
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,871
ever has the chance
to taste true martial arts.

548
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,010
Suiryu: Zakkos's moves
weren't all that bad.

549
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:57,015
Nicely done. See you
at the finals, Mr. New guy.

550
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,851
