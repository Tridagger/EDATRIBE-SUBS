00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,400
Blue fire: I can’t believe
what i’m hearing.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,300
We’re here to ask
a bunch of criminals for help?

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,910
There’s no way
the association approved this!

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,280
Sitch: But they have!
We’re in a crisis,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,350
one mankind will never overcome

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,050
unless we band together
and unite as one!

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,520
Our current heroes,
comprised of 390 class cs,

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,220
101 class bs, 38 class as,
and the 17 of class s,

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,690
are clearly not enough!

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,990
No one expects you
to work for free.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,330
You will be compensated

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,530
for every individual monster
you defeat!

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,230
Heavy tank loincloth:
Compensated?! That’s madness!

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,640
The association is putting
their faith in this trash

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,570
to help the world?

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,410
Criminal: And what
makes you so special?

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,110
I’ve killed more people
than you’ve met, Mr. Hero.

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,380
Wanna try me?

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,480
Heavy tank loincloth:
These little wimps...

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,350
( Criminal groans )

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,250
Heavy tank loincloth:
Have no heart at all.

23

- Sitch: Listen. We have no--

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,720
garou: Well, now, look at this.
Color me impressed.

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,390
She’s good.
Her prophecy’s spot-on.

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,630
She knew a god-level threat

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,200
like no one had ever seen
was on its way.

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,300
But meathead there’s
got a point.

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,330
All of these nobodies combined

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,070
wouldn’t be enough
to take me down.

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,140
Sitch: Huh?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
Tell me, who are you?

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,370
Garou: The name’s garou.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,510
Wrecked a ton
of so-called tough guys,

35
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,410
and I guess you could say
i’ve got a thing for monsters.

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,980
Want a demonstration?

37
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,980
Come at me,
and i’ll take you all down.

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,120
Let’s find out
who’s the strongest in here.

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,920
Now don’t make me wait all day.
Bring it on.

- Garou: Foolishness?

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,190
Sitch: We don’t need you.
Get lost.

42
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,560
Garou: I can’t believe
you treat your guests this way,

43
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,630
Mr. Big shot of justice.

44
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,430
Let me show you how it’s done.

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,230
Each and every coward here
is cordially invited

46
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,540
to a little slaughter party.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,970
Sitch: I’ve got a job
for you three heroes.

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
Toss this joker out.

49
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,680

Huh?

53
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,350
Garou: Tough break, grandpa.

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,160
Looks like you forgot to put
some heart into that punch.

55
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,060
The only thing
that really matters

56
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,400
is that the strong are strong!

57
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,170
Night-night, gramps!

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,130

You showed him!

61
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,340

- Criminal #4: All right!

62
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,510
Garou: What are you vermin
cheering about?

63
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,210
You’re all gonna die, too.

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,940
Criminal #5: Wait.
What did you just say?!

65
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,180
Criminal #6: We’re supposed
to be on the same side here!

66
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,680
Garou: Not true. Heroes are
always late to the party,

67
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,520
while monsters
take the initiative.

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,020
They appear without warning,
out of the blue.

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,120
Listen up.
You’re on the humans’ side,

70

while i’m
on the monsters’ side.

Blue fire: A human
who calls himself a monster?

72
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,000
You’re delusional.

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,930
I’ll burn your body to ash!

( Winces )

75
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,910
Garou: These little tricks
certainly liven things up,

76
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,310
but once you see through them,
they’re ugly.

77
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380

84

That might be
a bit much right now.

85

Well, i’m sure this pile
of bodies gets my point across.

In six months,

was just defeat
whatever monsters I bumped into.

117

That’s a big boost.

118
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,050
Genos: It is because nowadays
monsters appear almost daily.

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,580
You defeat them, but you

120
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,390
do not report those victories
to the association.

121
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,260
Since your rank is increasing
despite that fact,

122

this crystal clear.

182

Every hero
who ascends to class b

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,930

themselves to hellish blizzard.

192

In this industry,

you don’t survive.

it’s impossible

getting this at all,

200

talking to you!

203

to join our little group.

to align myself with you,

212

like a gang leader?

213

to those who catch my eye.

might take your rank-one spot?

moved on to class a?

for your answer.

the answer is no.
