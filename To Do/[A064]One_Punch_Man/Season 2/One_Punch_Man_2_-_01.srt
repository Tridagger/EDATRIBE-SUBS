¶

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,804
Genos: Master...

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,005
Where should we go next?

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,941
Saitama: Uh, let's see.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,675
We got the hot-pot ingredients,

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,811
so I guess that leaves
the toilet paper

7
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,313
and sham...Poo.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,583
Uh...

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:19,952
Wow.

10
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,887
I guess popularity
gets you places.

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,889
His own action figure.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,558
Must be awesome.

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,961
Genos: I will contact
the toy companies.

14
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,963
Saitama: Nah.
This is a "don't call us,

15
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,765
we'll call you" situation.

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,432
Let's roll.

17
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,700
Genos: Right!

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,702
But, master, where to, exactly?

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,437
- ( Woman screams )
- ( Crowd gasping )

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,373
- Man: What the hell is that?!
- ( Monster chuckles )

21
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,841
( Growls )

22
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,777
My obsession with reptiles

23
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,645
ended up turning me into one.

24
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,647
Feast your eyes
upon the great tongue-stretcher!

25
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,714
- ( Woman whimpers )
- ( Tongue-stretcher laughs )

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,450
Man: It's a monster! Run!

27
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,386
Tongue-stretcher: All you pretty
young things are mine now.

28
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,721
You're gonna bear my brood!

29
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,058
- ( Woman whimpers )
- ( Tongue-stretcher babbles )

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,463
¶

31
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,930
where the hell
did you come from?!

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,800
( Loud thumping )

33
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,469
Whoa. What's that aura?

34
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,305
( Gasps ) And that face!

35
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,876
H-He's no ordinary man.

36
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,411
King: Not again.

37
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,480
I'm so tired of being a hero.

38
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:22,747
Man #2: That hero's
supposed to be

39
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,282
the strongest man on earth!

40
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,950
- He'll save us for sure!
- Man #3: It's king!

41
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,552
Tongue-stretcher:
No wonder he looks familiar!

42
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,887
This dude's a living legend!

43
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,622
Man #4: He'll take you out
with one punch!

44
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,824
Woman #2: Can I
have your autograph?!

45
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,157
Man #3: King! King!

46
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,427
Crowd: King! King! King!

47
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,961
- ( Tongue-stretcher whimpers )
- King! King!

48
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,964
King! King! King!

49
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,500
Tongue-stretcher:
I'm so, so sorry

50
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,101
for what I've done, Mr. King!

51
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,503
Man #5: Way to go, king!

52
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,038
Woman #3: Gross pervert.

53
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,039
Women: Super gross.

54
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,973
Man #6: Teach him
a lesson, king!

55
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,975
King: How did it come to this?

56
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,111
Man #7: That's right! Get on
your knees, and apologize!

57
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,047
- Man #8: King's the real deal!
- Man #9: Are you here

58
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,849
because you sensed
the monster's presence, king?

59
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,917
King: No. I was just
out shopping, and I happened--

60
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,586
Man #10: Hey, hold up!
Who are you to question king?

61
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,922
- You better back off!
- King: It's okay. I don't--

62
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,257
Man #11: May I shake your hand?

63
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,393
King: I have things to do.

64
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,928
Would you mind
letting me through?

65
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,463
Man #11: Ooh, we're so sorry.

66
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,666
Man #9: Make way!
Give him some room!

67
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,470
Clerk: Enjoy your new game!

68
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,405
King: Finally got a copy.

69
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,542
"Heartbeat hottie sisters 2,"
limited edition.

70
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,810
Nothing like that feeling
on the walk home

71
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,480
after you buy a game
you've been waiting for.

72
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,416
Can't wait to get back home
and play it.

73
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,351
( Chuckles )

74
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,556
Genos: Master,
that man appears to be king.

75
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,424
Saitama: Who?

76
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,627
Genos: One of the heroes
from the class-s meeting.

77
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,763
King: I've been
waiting three years

78
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,931
for this sequel.

79
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,535
My body is ready!

80
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,773
Genos: King.

81
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,109
He managed to outrank you
quickly, master,

82
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,444
and claimed the title
of strongest hero.

83
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,713
Saitama: Huh.

84
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,447
Genos: It is strange.

85
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,449
I wonder what brings him
to this part of town.

86
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,517
( Woman screams )

87
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,719
It's a monster!

88
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,453
- ( Saitama grunts )
- ( Crowd yelling )

89
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,588
Genos: Another monster.

90
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,589
Master, we should--

91
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,857
no, wait.

92
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,661
This might be a good opportunity
to observe king's capabilities.

93
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,230
We shall see what he does.

94
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,001
G-4: My moniker is g-4,

95
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,537
a machine god
created by the organization.

96
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,673
You are class-s hero king.

97
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,475
Prepare to be liquidated.

98
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,611
Man: Look! Over there!
King'll save us!

99
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,547
King: You seem to know
my rank and hero class,

100
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,018
yet you still choose to face
the man who's seventh ranked?

101
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,957
G-4: Killing you
is the reason I've come.

102
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,094
( Loud thumping )

103
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,630
( Man #2 gasps )
What the heck is that sound?

104
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,832
Man #3: You don't know
about the king engine?

105
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,035
It's the sound you hear
when king goes into battle.

106
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,703
They say there's
not a single monster

107
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,372
who's heard it and survived.

108
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,707
G-4: Our battle
will serve as a live test

109
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,709
of my combat a.I. Systems.

110
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,712
To collect accurate data,
I expect your full strength.

111
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,982
( King thinking )
So this thing is a robot?

112
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,384
Built by "the organization"?

113
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,518
What's he talking about?

114
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,920
( Aloud ) Very well,

115
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,990
but I'm gonna have
to drop a deuce first.

116
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,792
When I have to hold it in,

117
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,527
I can only exert
50% of my power,

118
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,364
and that would throw off
your data, wouldn't it?

119
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
G-4: I will wait ten minutes.

120
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,737
For every minute beyond that,
ten humans will die.

121
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,539
- Understood?
- ( Crowd screaming )

122
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,409
Saitama: That's
one tough-looking monster.

123
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,744
Genos: Actually, master,
that is a robot,

124
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,814
quite a powerful one, too,

125
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,017
possibly more capable than me,

126
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,085
a troublesome foe
that I would estimate

127
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,488
at threat level demon, at least.

128
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,558
What will king's strategy be
against such a formidable enemy?

129
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,495
King: So you've come
to kill me, have you?

130
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,629
( Whimpers )

131
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,498
( Panting )

132
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,966
Why is this happening to me?!

133
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,903
I'm scared! Scared, damn it!

134
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,438
I'm not a strong hero!

135
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,575
I'm just an unemployed
29-year-old otaku loser!

136
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,712
The whole king engine thing
is just my heart pounding!

137
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,713
I'm a coward, okay?!

138
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,483
Twice--no, ten times over!

139
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,585
Rampaging monsters just show up

140
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,255
wherever I go! Then,
while I look the other way,

141
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,590
someone else defeats them!

142
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,761
And somehow this keeps
happening over and over!

143
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,864
That's all it is!

144
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,999
Before I knew it, I was sent
a class-s hero certificate,

145
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,536
and they were calling me
the "strongest new hero."

146
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,937
- What a joke.
- ( Stomach gurgling )

147
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,940
It's my bad for not denying it
from the get-go,

148
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,876
but I never dreamed
it'd come to this.

149
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,611
( Shuddering )

150
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,746
( Gags )

151
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,548
I'm so screwed.

152
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,749
I'm no hero.

153
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,017
( Boom )

154
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,953
( Gasps, whimpers )

155
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,890
- Here it comes.
- ( Rattling )

156
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,825
Think! There's gotta
be a way out of this!

157
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,826
( Boom )

158
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,562
There's no way out of this!

159
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,963
No robot's afraid of my name!

160
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,765
If I fight, I'm a dead man!

161
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,766
- ( Boom )
- ( Grunts )

162
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,501
( Gasping )

163
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,705
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

164
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,910
( Gasps )
Someone's fighting in my place.

165
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,344
I'm safe!

166
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,879
¶

167
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,486
( G-4 groans )

168
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,996
Saitama: Wow.
Was that a rocket punch?

169
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,736
Hey, genos,
you need a hand, or...

170
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,739
Genos: No! You gave me a goal

171
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,409
to be one of the top 10 heroes
in class s!

172
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,811
He is mine!

173
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,615
I have to be able
to handle this on my own!

174
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,816
Saitama: Okay, then.

175
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,817
( Rapid punches clanking )

176
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,952
Try not to lose.

177

179
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,957
in the vicinity
of city m central park.

180

( King panting )

183
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,565
I made it home,
but holy crapola.

184
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,901
That robot scared
the hell out of me.

185
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,704
It's gonna give me nightmares.

186
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,941
I'll just play my new game
and forget about it.

The "heartbeat
hottie sisters" series

190
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,785
has a knack
for nailing their intros.

191
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,787
Now, this is
excitement I can handle.

192
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,389
Woman: Hi there, big fella!
Input your name, please.

193
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,123
King: My name, huh?

194
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,527
Using my real name
would be lame.

195
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,062
What should I use?

196
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,064
Saitama:
"King" seems fine to me.

197
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,667
King: No, not my hero name.
If they said,

198
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:49,802
( high voice )
"Hey there, king,"

199
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:50,803
( normal )
Then people might find out--

200
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,404

203
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,543
who the heck is this guy?

204
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,944
- How'd he get in?
- ( Wind blows )

205
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,279
Saitama:
Your window was open, so...

206
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,183
King: Yeah,
but I'm 22 floors up.

207
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,087
H-Hey, listen!

208
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,290
You can't just barge
into a person's home like that.

209
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,026
( Sighs )

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,227
( Coughs )

211
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,629
Look, I assume you're aware

212
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,564
that I'm a class-s hero,
aren't you?

213
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,766
Saitama: Yeah, totally.
I mean, you're king, right?

214
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,635
King: Huh?! I remember now.

215
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,771
H-He's the class-b hero
from the class-s meeting

216
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,972
Saitama: Can I have some tea?

217
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,709
Hmm. You know,
you don't exactly seem

218
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,845
like the type that would
play this sort of game.

219
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,847
Woman: Hi, big fella!
Input your name, please!

220
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,781
- King: Kill me now!
- Saitama: Hmm?

221
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,450
What's this game?

222
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,852
Looks like a fun one.

223
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,587
King: Huh?
Oh, that's a cool action game!

224
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,456
Saitama: Do you control a robot?

225
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,124
- King: Yeah, exactly!
- Saitama: Oh.

226
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,659
King: That's actually
my kind of game.

227
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,461
I thought this was
an action title, too,

228
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,463
but it turned out to be
a stupid romance game.

229
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,865
Damn, I bought the wrong one!

230
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,467
Saitama: It says "heartbeat
hottie sisters" right on it.

231
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,335
King: I thought it said
"heartblood hatred slayers"!

232
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,404
Oh, I've been scammed!
I'm tossing it!

233
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,472
Saitama: Then let's
play this one.

234
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,340
King: Good call!
That one's way better!

235
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,277
Wait. What? You actually
want to play with me?

236
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,680
Saitama: Yeah, if you want to.
You've got nothing to do, right?

237
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,014
King: What's with this guy?

238
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,617
I mean, I outrank him by a lot.

239
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,620
He's pretty pushy
for a class-b hero.

Your components
are molten slag now.

244
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,606
Your huge body
was your downfall.

No, its true form.

Watch it!

252
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,326
Man, you're really good at this.

253
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,061
King: Thanks. I've won
a fighting game tournament

254
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,797
or two in my time,
so it comes with the territory.

255

Saitama: A tournament champ?

256
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,066
Wow, so you're
super-strong in real life

257
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,868
and a top-tier gamer, too?

258
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,004
King: How long
is this guy gonna stay?

259
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,806
- Just go hom--
- Saitama: So, anyway,

260
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,408
- why'd you run off earlier?
- ( King shrieks )

261
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,478
I mean, Genos has got things
under control,

262

but you're, like,
a crazy-strong class-s hero.

263
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,484
Why'd you hotfoot it
away from that robot monster?

264
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,420
That's why I initially
followed you here, to ask,

265
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,957
but then you were
playing games, so...

266
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,759
Are you bored
of fighting monsters?

267
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,428
Maybe you're so strong
and have fought so many

268
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,896
that you just don't feel
like it anymore.

269

276
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,912
That's the third one today.

Seems like these monsters

282
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,860
keep coming straight for you,
don't they?

283
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,797
It's almost like they're
homing in on you or something.

would you handle this?

just keeps getting worse.

Saitama: I mean,
this thing came to your house.

beats the monster.

302
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,652

Then, boom,

who saved the day.

304
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,726

352
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,255
Saitama: Nah,
it's not as bad as it looks.

353
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,059
( Laughs ) Plus,
victory takes the sting off.

354
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,195
King: Wait a minute.

355
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,664
It's...you.

356
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,202
( Sobbing )

357
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,005
Saitama: Hey, what's the matter?

358
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,207
King: I'm so sorry!

359
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,609
( Weeping )

360
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,612
Saitama: Is it fun for you
or something,

361
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,816
telling lies about being a hero
and running away?

362
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,750
King: No, not at all.

363
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,286
Saitama: Well, it's none
of my business, really.

364
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,288
I'm not gonna lecture you
or anything.

365
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,756
King: Um...

366
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,358
I might have gotten some credit

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,161
that should have
actually gone to you.

368
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,096
Saitama: The issue here
isn't about who gets the credit.

369
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,166
You're everyone's hero now,
understand?

370
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,501
King: No, I'm just a nobody.

371
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,503
Saitama: How that came to be
doesn't matter.

372
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:07,506
Everyone thinks you're
the strongest hero there is.

373
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,708
So tell me,

374
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,776
are you gonna
keep lying about it

375
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,111
or quit being a hero?

376
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,714
King: I can't find
the courage to decide.

377
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,783
Saitama: Well, I mean,
why don't you just get strong?

378
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,386
- King: Huh?
- Saitama: I'm heading out.

379
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,387
See ya.

380
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,389
King: Hold on a second.

381
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,557
So you're not angry?

382
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,594
You worked so hard
to become a hero,

383
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,329
while I just...

384
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,166
Saitama: I'll drop by again
to play games. Cool?

385
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,135
King: Hey!

386
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,103
Yeah...

387
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,809
Sure.

388
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,078
Genos: Dr. Kuseno...

389
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,347
This came from a machine god
called g-4.

390
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:53,085
It possessed incredible power
and a highly advanced a.I.

391
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,087
If any of its components
are compatible,

392
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,821
please install them on me.

393
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,356
Dr. Kuseno: But this is a--

394
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,826
genos, how did you
obtain this thing?

395
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,963
Genos: Listen. I have
to become stronger, doctor.

396
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:08,567
Dr. Kuseno: Very well, then,
Genos. I'll look into it.

397
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,970
There are still places
where we can improve you.

398
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,171
Genos: I appreciate it.

399
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,574
Dr. Kuseno:
Now you listen to me.

400
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,310
I know you became a cyborg
to pursue justice,

401
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,712
but you mustn't
take it too far.

402
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,248
Genos: No. Pushing my limits
comes with the job.

403
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:27,586
My current goal is to make it
to the top 10 of class s.

404
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,254
Dr. Kuseno:
Yes, the reckless goal

405
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,190
set by your mentor,
if I recall correctly.

406
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,226
I had a feeling
that you would mention it.

407
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,997
We'll discuss that later,
but, speaking of cyborgs,

408
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,133
have you been able
to find any clues

409
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,735
concerning the one
that destroyed your hometown?

410
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,736
( Genos sighs )

411
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,605
Dr. Kuseno: It seems lately

412
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,274
you've been more focused
on being a hero.

413
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,210
Genos: No, sir. No clues
regarding that incident.

414
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,746
Dr. Kuseno: How unfortunate.

415
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,149
- Even so--
- Genos: I have not forgotten.

416
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,351
That rogue cyborg
has attacked several towns

417
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,153
and killed many people.

418
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,555
No matter what,
I will find him

419
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,691
and tear him apart
with my own hands,

420
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,093
whatever it takes. I swear it.

421
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,564
Dr. Kuseno: He has become a hero
and found a mentor,

422
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,833
yet the relentless hatred
remains.

423
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:19,171
I only ask because
I'm worried about you, genos.

424
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,707
I am on the trail
of that murderous cyborg as well

425
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,778
and painfully aware
of how dangerous he can be.

426
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,714
If you should encounter him,
just don't do anything rash.

427
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,250
Instead, you should
contact me immediately.

428
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,920
You are coolheaded
and quite intelligent,

429
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,124
but the passions of youth
can lead one to ruin.

430
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,126
Do not try to fight him alone.

431
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,329
Genos: I understand
and will obey.

432
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,466
That battle,
we must fight together.

433
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,269
Sitch: I lead
the hero association

434
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,139
earthdoom prophecy
emergency response team.

435
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,274
You can call me sitch.
Pleasure to meet you.

436
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,344
Let me begin
by thanking all of you,

437
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,279
the members
of the criminal underworld,

438
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,482
for answering
our call to be here today.

439
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,750
As I mentioned
in the invitation,

440
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,753
nothing of your nefarious pasts,
records, or activities

441
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:09,954
will be discussed here.

442
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,691
This is not a trap of any sort.

443
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,627
The heroes beside me
are only here for my protection.

444
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,562
Criminal: Did he say, "heroes"?

445
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,964
Criminal #2: Sounds like fun.
We'll kill 'em dead.

446
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,633
Sitch: They will take no actions

447
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,369
unless you decide
to do something foolish.

448
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,907
Criminal #3: Like take over your
little hq here? ( Chuckles )

449
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,176
Hero: I see wanted men
with bounties on their heads,

450
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,111
top assassins, and fugitives

451
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,980
I don't understand.
Why would sitch invite

452
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,183
such wretched scum
into our sacred hq?

453
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,984
Hero #2: To be perfectly honest,

454
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,986
I don't give a damn
why they're here,

455
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,989
but seeing these dirtbags
laugh it up is pissing me off.

456
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,592
Hero #3: At the first sign
of trouble, I'm letting loose.

457
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:48,927
They'll get no mercy.

458
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:51,864
Sitch: I have three
class-a heroes as protection,

459
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,599
each with class-s combat skills.

460
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:55,934
With them here, I doubt anyone

461
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,803
would be stupid enough
to try anything.

462
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,005
Okay, let's get this meeting
under way, shall we?

463
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,274
- Criminal #4 :Hold it.
- Sitch: Huh?

464
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,210
Criminal #4: Where is
the hero called Saitama?

465
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,612
Doesn't he live in this building
with the other heroes?

466
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,082
Sitch: Hmm?
And who might you be?

467
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:13,818
Either way, please save
unrelated topics for later.

468
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,688
What I have to say is important.

469
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,489
Criminal #4:
So he won't be here.

470
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,823
Guess I'll be leaving, then.

471
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,892
Blue fire: Think you can leave

472
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,626
without hearing
what we have to say?

473
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,896
You came, so you're
staying 'til this is over.

474
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,699
Criminal #4: "Occurrences
of tiger-level threats and above

475
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,767
"are increasing in frequency.

476
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,035
"This month, levels
are six times the average

477
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,705
"of the past three years.

478
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,973
"This could indicate
the 'earthdoom' prophecy

479
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,910
"of the great seer shibabawa

480
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,578
"or perhaps that it

481
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:40,979
"has already begun.

482
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,981
"If this rate continues,

483
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,784
"our heroes will become
exhausted and overwhelmed.

484
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,320
"The prophecy says
an unprecedented disaster

00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,256

"Current conditions

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,593
"that the threat
remains a possibility.

488
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,596
"We've even started
to send out class-s heroes

489
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,932
"for such terrorizations,
but there are simply

490
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,267
too many of these instances
to handle them all."

491
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,802
( Criminals gasp )

492
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,270
Sonic: "It's clear
that this situation

493
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,738
"will only escalate,

494
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,074
"and we fight
to protect all of humanity.

495
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,876
"Despite your character issues,

496
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:16,148
we ask the able among you
to assist us in our efforts."

497
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,750
So that's why
you called us here?

498
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,219
You can count me out.

499
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,288
Sitch: Wh-why, that--

500
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,824
I didn't hand those out yet.
How did he--

501
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
Sonic: If I had to sit around

502
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,228
and play hero
with you do-gooders,

503
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,631
I'd puke my guts out for sure.

504
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,233
( Sitch growls )

505
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,971
Sonic: Damn.
What a complete waste of time.

506
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,572
It was a good opportunity

507
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,841
for an outsider
to slip into hero hq,

508
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,043
but that doesn't help
when all I know

509
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:49,314
is his name, face,
and that he's class b, rank 33.

510
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,049
Man: This guy? For real?

511
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,652
Man #2: I don't believe it.

512
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,320
Blizzard: It's true.

513
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,990
Don't let that goofy
profile picture fool you.

514
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,126
His scores were the highest ever
recorded on the physical tests.

515
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,661
Men: Miss blizzard!

516
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,929
Blizzard: Despite
no further notable reports

517
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,998
of achievements in the field,

518
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,001
he Rose from class c
to class b,

519
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,869
and so soon after his debut.

520
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:13,605
There's something
about this man.

521
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,141
Sonic: He has to be
hiding something,

522
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,610
a secret to his strength.

523
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,615
Blizzard: The first thing
we'll need to do is locate him.

524
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,949
Men: Right!

525
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,285
Sonic: I'll make sure
I find him,

526
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:28,821
and then he'll regret

527
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,156
making a fool
of speed-o'-sound Sonic.

528
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,891
He'll pay double
for doing it twice.

529
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,093
Blizzard: We're coming
for you, Saitama.

530
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,829
Sonic: You're a dead man.

531
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,598
Both: Just you wait!

532
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,103
Saitama: Hey, why are you
taking all the items?

533
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,771
Quit hoarding everything.

534
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,707
King: Hey, if you snooze,
you're gonna lose, dude.

535
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,842
Saitama: This is
co-op play, dumb-ass.

536
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,376
I haven't gotten
one power-up yet.

537
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,111
We can't beat the boss
like this.

538
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,180
King: I'm pretty sure
I can handle him without you.

539
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,181
( Crunch )

540
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,916
Saitama: Eh...

541
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,784
Uh, the controller broke.

542
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,619
King: What?!

543
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,023

( Criminal #1 laughs )

563
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,749
Criminal #5: Guess we'll be
compensated for our time, huh?

564
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,618
Garou: Well, well, look at this.

565
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,122
The prophecy they've got here
is pretty sweet.
