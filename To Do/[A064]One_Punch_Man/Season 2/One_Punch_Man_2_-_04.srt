Now I will cover
the world in darkness!

( Cackles )

00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,948

- ( Boy gasps )

00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,350
- Man #2: Devil Earl!

( Fist creaks )

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,154
( Boy sighs ) Aww, man.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,089
That lame theme song
means justice man is here.

10
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,160
Just when it's getting good,
the hero always butts in.

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,094
- ( Punches whacking )
- Hang in there!

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,363
Don't give up, devil Earl!

13
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,165
Kick justice man's butt!

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,567
Justice man: Justice punch!

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,568
Devil Earl: Nyaah!

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,236
Boy: Darn it!

17
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,573
He got beat again.
It's not fair!

18
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,510
Why doesn't any monster have
a chance against justice man?

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,711
What?

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,581
Heroes never lose? Really?

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,117
Why not? Why does good
always have to win?

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,119
That's totally not fair!

23
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,255
Monsters have things
they want, too.

24
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,326
And monsters try.
They try really hard.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,263
So why do they always end up
losing and getting killed?

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,865
I root for them.

27
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,201
What about what I think?

28
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,137
I mean, monsters are cool, too.

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,206
Why should the popular win

30
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,607
- while the hated lose?
- Garou: While the hated lose?

31
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,942
Both: It's tragic!

32
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,345
Garou: If that's
how the world works,

33
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,015
then I will become
the strongest monster,

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,050
and I'll lose to no one.

35
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,054
( Birds squawking )

36
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,493
( Groans ) Huh?

37
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,096
What the hell am I doing here?

38
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,502
What happened last night?

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,504

00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,280
it was almost
certainly the work

54
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,682
of the vicious hero hunter,
garou.

55
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,085
Man #2: Then, he's not
just targeting heroes now.

00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,753
It's the entire association!

57
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,156
Man #3: He was able to defeat
tank top master quite easily,

58
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,093
and the usual protocols
will not dispel fear.

59

Man #1: Executives should
remain indoors if possible.

62
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,770
When going out, they must be
accompanied by a class-s hero.

63

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,574

the conduits to our sponsors.

67
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,248
Their safety takes precedence.

"Why not?"

71
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,055
Because I'm already

they call a critical assignment?

00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,613
Executive: It seems
association executives

82
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,148
are targets, too,
now apparently,

83
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,683

84
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,885

Executive: How droll.

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,226
Our tab won't even
be 10,000 yen.

89
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,695
What an amusing experience
this is,

90
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,498
trying to make their inferior
cuisine more fun to eat.

- Boy: Why shouldn't I?
- ( Metal bat growls )

95
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,641
They need these plates
to tally your bill.

96
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,242
Executive: Come, now.
It's only good manners

97
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,710

98
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,782
Metal bat: Pretty sure I just
told you not to put them back.

Executive: Is this sea urchin?

100
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,185
The color is off-putting.

101
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,453
Perhaps they have caviar.

102
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,254
Boy: Medium fatty tuna?

103
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,591
Is any kind other than
extra fatty tuna even edible?

104
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,259
Metal bat: Stop doing that!

105
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,529

Uh, hang tight for a sec.

An important assignment
came up out of nowhere.

114
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,281
I'll take you shopping
another time. I promise.

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,484
Huh? Where am I now?

116
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,819
Nezumi Sushi.

117
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,821
( Gasps ) No, that's not it!

118
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,823
This really is an assignment.

119
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,424
Oh, come on. Please don't cry.

120
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,493
I'll explain everything later.

121
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,294
( Gasps ) Gotta go.

122
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,763
I'll call back soon.

123
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm the one
who should be crying.

124
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,636
Last time I do a favor
for some executive douche bags.

125
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,770
( Rumbling )

126
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,740

Boy: Papa!

128
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,245
Metal bat: Pretty sure
that bug's not him.

129
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,581
Executive: Save my son!
That monster has him!

130
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,316

Perfect!
Let's take the runt and bail!

134
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,491
Metal bat: I don't think so.

135
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,129
Neither one of 'em
is going anywhere. Understand?

136
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,064
( Spits )

137
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,467

Charanko said he signed up

00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,139
for this "super fight"
tournament thing on a whim.

140
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,741
What a knucklehead.

141
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,543
But this might do.

142
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,747
There could be some
seriously strong fighters here.

143
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,550
Worker: What name
did you register under?

144
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,352
Saitama: Oh. Uh, charanko.

145
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,889
Worker: All right. Please
write in your fighting style.

146
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,492
Saitama: Fighting style?
Huh. What was it again?

147
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,062
I feel like it's...

148
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,365
Let's see how the tournament
bracket turned out.

149
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,366
Oh.

150
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,502
Some fighters got seeded

151
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,905
this bakuzan guy must be tough.

152
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,506
In the opposite bracket,

153
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,076
looks like suiryu
is the top seed.

154
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,511
Man: What's up?

155
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,513
You're charanko
from the dojo, right?

156
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,315
Saitama: Oh, crap!
Someone who knows charanko!

157
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,849
Man: Hey, what's the matter?

158
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,986
Surely you haven't
forgotten me already, have you?

159
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,054
"Fist of seltzer water
on the rocks"?

160
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,456
Quite the jokester.

161
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,926
Well, I don't blame you
for being nervous.

162
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,895
After all, you never
could beat me, could you?

163
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,866
Charanko: Aww, man.

164
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,571
That jerk better not
be competing in my place.

165
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,274
Nah, he wouldn't
be that stupid.

166
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,409
Oh, actually,

167
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,811
saitama does tend
to be pretty stupid.

168
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,946
- Mumen rider: Saitama?
- Charanko: Huh?

169
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,481
Hey, do I know you, or...

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,618
Mumen rider: Tell me,
are you friends with saitama?

171
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,487
Man: Now, I bet you're
thinking to yourself,

172
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,889
"why's a guy like sourface
entering the tournament?"

173
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,491
( Saitama thinking )
Don't know. Don't care.

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,627
Just hurry up,
and go somewhere else.

175
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,562
Sourface:
I've got myself two reasons.

176
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,031
The first,
this super fight is ideal

177
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,501
for making a name for myself
as a big-time martial artist.

178
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,571
Master bang was the champion
once, and just look at him.

179
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,908
The second reason, the incident
at the last tournament.

180
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,980
A masked fighter named wolfman
won the championship,

181
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:32,250
but afterwards the real wolfman
was found unconscious.

182
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,452
The winner was a fake.

183
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,455
And, because of that,
registration under an alias

184
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,058
and use of headwear
was strictly prohibited.

185
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,661
Saitama: Headwear? Wait. Like...

186
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,129
Sourface: You've already lied
about your fighting style,

187
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,666
but that might be
a bit of a gray area.

188
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,868
Saitama: What happens
if they find out?

189
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,604
Sourface: At the very least,
you'd be banned for life.

190
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,139
Who knows?
They might even follow that up

191
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,609
with a heavy fine and a lawsuit,

192
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,944
maybe even have you arrested.

193
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,414
Saitama: Oh, really?

194
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,748
Sourface: Huh?
What's the matter?

195
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,484
No way.

196
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,887
You... ( Chuckles )

197
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,423
Know exactly
who the fake wolfman was, too!

198
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,558
Saitama: I'm safe.

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,495
Sourface: I studied his
fighting technique in a video.

200
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,497
There's no doubt.

201
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,232
The fake wolfman was...

202
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,633
Garou.

203
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,769
( Garou chuckles )
So we meet again.

204
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,039
Boy: Huh? Oh, hey, mister!

205
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,507
You out patrolling again?

206
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,843
Garou: I told you
not to call me "mister."

207
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,444
Now lend me that book.

208
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,179
Boy: I told you to get your own.

209
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,647
Garou: Huh?

210
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,850
Boy: Hey, I know.
Let's read it together.

211
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,652
( Garou sighs )

212
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,920
Ah...

213
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,589
Saitama: Garou, huh?

214
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,658
That name keeps popping up.

215
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,861
Sourface: It was six months ago,

216
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,664
right after it went down
and he was expelled.

217
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,997
It had to be him.

218
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,533
Saitama: What went down?

219
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,468
Sourface: You were
skipping classes then,

220
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,736
so you wouldn't know.

221
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,372
It was on a day
when master bang was out.

222
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,008
( Students grunting )

223
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,544
Sourface: Hmm?

224
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,679
- Garou: I'm finished.
- Sourface: Huh?

225
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,748
Garou: There's nothing left
for me to learn here.

226
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,349
It's a waste of time.

227
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,252
Let's fight for real.

228
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,488
Sourface: He'd hidden
his true nature

229
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,290
as he sharpened his fangs.

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,493
If it hadn't been for him,

231
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,428
we wouldn't have
had to leave the dojo.

232
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,563
Damn that arrogant bastard!

233
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,765
That's why I'm here today,

234
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,800
to win this tournament...

235
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,636
And get my mojo back.

236
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,440
I have to prove to myself that I
can hold my own against garou.

237
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,377
( Laughs ) But look at you.

238
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,245
I never imagined
master bang's runt

239
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,714
would enter
the super fight tourney.

240
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,048
You think a lot of yourself,

241
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,651
calling yourself
the top disciple.

242
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,388
I'd pump the brakes
if I were you.

243
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,590
Mumen rider: I see.

244
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,258
So you think saitama

245
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,794
might enter this competition
in your place, then?

246
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,862
Charanko: Yeah. An amateur

247
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,265
wouldn't stand a chance
in this tournament.

248
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,666
He'd likely
get himself killed.

249
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,534
Mumen rider:
There's nothing to fear.

250
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,668
Charanko: Huh?

251
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,903
Mumen rider: You're forgetting.

252
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,940
He's a hero.

253
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,874
Sourface: It's so annoying!

254
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,411
If I'd have known
that garou would be expelled,

255
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,613
then I'd never
have left the dojo.

256
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,080
And, if that were the case,

257
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,483
you know who master bang's
top disciple would be.

258
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,152
All sourface, baby.

259
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,821
What you think?
Wanna relive old times

260
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,391
and practice choke-holds
'til you black out again?

261
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,893
Saitama: You left
the dojo, right?

262
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,562
Sourface: So what?

263
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,031
Sourface: Well,
I took on garou by myself.

264
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,568
That's why I'm here,
to get rid of that guy for good.

265
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,971
And if he keeps up
his hero hunting,

266
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,705
we're gonna meet one day.

267
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,842
What I'm trying to say here
is someone who runs off

268
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,710
shouldn't be acting
like a big shot.

269
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,780
( Sourface growls )

270
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,115
You're gonna eat those words.
You hear me?

271
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:53,585
The super fight
is a one-day tournament.

272
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,721
If by some miraculous chance
you win and move up,

273
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,923
then we'll meet in the ring.

274
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:02,126
When we do, you're
gonna learn a hard lesson.

275
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,131
You'll find out what it's like
to be in a real fight.

276
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:06,665
( Door slams )

277
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,438
Saitama: A real fight, huh?

278
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,811
I honestly don't remember
what they're like.

279
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,150
Boy: Did you see that, papa?!

280
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,086
He sure showed those monsters!

281
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,955
Executive: Let me snap a pic,
as the kids say.

282
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,624
Metal bat:
Hey, it's still dangerous.

283
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,792
I gotta get you back.

284
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,561
Centipede:
Venus peopletrap and I

285
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,896
were no match for you,

286
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,834
but we knew that before
the fighting ever started.

287
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:46,104
You are truly a class-s hero,
metal bat. No doubt about it.

288
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,307
Yet the strong
often become delusional

289
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,843
and mistakenly believe

290
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,178
they're at the top
of the food chain.

291
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,048
I believed that myself once.

292
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,716
Metal bat: You sure do die slow.

293
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,852
Want me to finish you off?

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,187
Centipede:
When centisempai appeared,

295
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,057
I knew how wrong I was.

296
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,497
( Rubble crashing )

297
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,401
- Metal bat: Another one of you?
- ( Both whimper )

298
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,071
Centisempai:
Rest now, little one.

299
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,974
I will avenge you.

300
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,009
( Boy yelps )

301
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,811
That thing is so gross!

302
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,881
Metal bat: This one
won't be as easy to squash.

303
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,150
( Executive gasps )

304
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,952
What's that odor?

305
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,987
( Gags )

306
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,690
( Metal bat gasps )

307
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,792
¶

308
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,036
Looks like these things
have nothing to do with garou.

309
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,640
Whatever!
No use thinking about it!

310
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,044
Just smash 'em
and be done with it!

311
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,180
Mumen rider: That's right!
No matter what terror he faces,

312
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,648
he stands up and fights!

313
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,917
- Charanko: Uh...
- Mumen rider: That's why

314
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,319
you don't have
to worry about saitama.

315
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,720
Charanko: Uh...

316
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,054
Mumen rider: He's not like that.

317
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,856
He'd never use a false identity

318
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,992
and break the rules.
He's a hero!

319
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,193
Charanko: Uh, well,

320
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,330
I guess I'll take
your word for it.

321
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,999
Mumen rider: Good call!

322
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,134
( Saitama sneezes )

323
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,602
( Gasping )

324
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,005
( Sighs )

325
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,807
I hate killing time.

326
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,145
Boy: And this one
is watchdog man.

327
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,879
- Cute, isn't he?
- ( Garou chuckles )

328
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,415
Just looks like a guy
in a dog suit to me.

329
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,751
So is he tough?

330
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,085
Boy: Well, of course he is.

331
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,887
He's a class-s hero.

332
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,023
Garou: Class s, rank 12, huh?

333
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,159
Boy: He keeps watch over city q

334
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,694
from his lookout
in watchdog Plaza.

335
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,230
You can always find him
hanging out there.

336
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,498
Garou: Really?

337
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,033
( Sirens blaring )

338
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,102
Announcer: Warning!
Emergency evacuation! Warning!

339
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,772
A monster has appeared

340
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,106
in the shopping district
of city s,

341
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,976
threat level demon.

342
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,110
( Boy gasps )

343
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,845
Announcer:
The class-s hero, metal bat,

344
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,847
is currently
engaging the monster.

345
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,985
Citizens outside are requested
to move indoors quickly.

346
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,052
Boy: Mister, i'm--

347
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,855
garou: You heard what she said.

348
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,056
Hurry up, and get home.

349
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,124
Boy: Okay!

350
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,795
Announcer: We repeat, warning!

351
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,764
- Emergency evacuation! Warning!
- ( Garou chuckles )

352
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,775
- Lafreshidon: Huh?
- ( Metal bat yells )

353
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,277
( Centisempai buzzes )

354
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,980
Centipede parade!

355
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,117
( Metal bat yells )

356
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,420
( Panting )

357
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,889
¶

358
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,891
lafreshidon: He is obstinate.

359
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,293
Centisempai: No wonder
he could beat centikohai.

360
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,830
Metal bat: What are
you disgusting bugs after?

361
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,165
What could they
possibly be worth to you?

362
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,834
( Lafreshidon chuckles )

363
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,168
How about this?

364
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,704
Defeat us, and we may tell you.

365
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,239
( Metal bat gags )

366
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:11,376
Lafreshidon: No one can escape
my hypno-scent for long.

367
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,945
Centisempai: Excellent!

368
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,386
Metal bat: That was brutal

369
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,121
( centisempai laughs )

370
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,089
Gah!

371
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,463
Eternal rest is yours, hero!

372
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,199
( Metal bat babbling )

373
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,401
( Centisempai laughs ) Daah!

374
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,870
( Bat thunks )

375
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,338
¶

376
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,008
lafreshidon:
Did he just hit himself?

377
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,879
Centisempai: Huh?

378
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,247
He's out of his mind!

379
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,886
( Gasps )

380
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,153
Metal bat: There!

381
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,354
That cleared my head.

382
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,489
( Centisempai gasps )

383
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,758
He's become even more powerful?

384
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,493
Lafreshidon: How was he able

385
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,162
to clear
the sedative so quickly?!

386
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,030
It's not possible!

387
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
Metal bat:
Once my fighting spirit's up,

388
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,101
I can take almost anything.

389
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,168
( Both gasp )

390
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,704
Metal bat:
You know, you really

391
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,872
slapped the hell
out of me just now.

392
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,242
But I'm nice,
so I'll let you two

393
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,043
off the hook easy!

394
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,044
( Lafreshidon screams )

395
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,380
Metal bat: Just one whack each,

396
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,315
and we'll call it even!

397
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,184
¶

398
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,926
( Sighs )

399
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,829
It's been a while
since I had to try that hard.

400
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,466
( Gasps ) Ah, crap!

401
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,002
I forgot to find out
what they were after!

402
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,671
Way to space on that one.

403
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,006
- ( Both snoring )
- Metal bat: Doesn't look

404
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,407
like the nimrods were hurt.

405
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,276
Wake up, you two!

406
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,345
Maybe a good smack'll
get you moving.

407
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,346
Hmm?

408
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,814
Hero: We're here to help!

409
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,883
Hero #2: We'll fight
those monsters with you!

410
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,286
Metal bat: Sorry,
but you missed the party.

411
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,622
( Both gasp ) What?!

412
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,157
( Man sighs )

413
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,760
Crisis averted.
Thank you, metal bat.

414
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,629
The director and his son
are safe and sound. Hmm?

415
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,498
- What? Something wrong?
- Man #2: I don't like this.

416
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,235
Centisempai and centikohai
appeared so close together,

417
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,303
which can only mean--

418
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,438
man #1: No, it can't be!

419
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,173
Man #2: How long has it been?

420
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,907
Two years? Maybe less?

421
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,243
- If he appears again--
- man #1: Right.

422
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,912
A few heroes
would never stand a chance.

423
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,314
The entire city
will be leveled.

424
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,750
( Rumbling )

425
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,189
Pineapple: Wait. Is that--

426
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,793
it's the giant bug monster,
centichoro!

427
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,663
That thing
is threat level dragon!

428
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,465
Metal bat: Dragon, huh?

429
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,600
Mohican: I'll request
some class-s assistance.

430
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,268
Let's wait for backup.

431
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,404
Metal bat: The bastard's here
for those two.

432
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:55,174
Get them to safety
while I keep this creep busy.

433
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,609
Get a move on!

434
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:58,943
Mohican: You got it!

435
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,479
Metal bat: Now, then...

436
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,114
How do you wanna do this?

437
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,484
Pineapple: Did he see us?!
I can't really tell!

438
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,422
Centichoro: You won't escape!

439
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:11,757
Metal bat:
Get the hell out of here!

440
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,161
Mohican: Don't look back!
Just keep going!

441
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,296
( Metal bat spits )

442
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,466
- ( Centichoro roars )
- ( Metal bat yells )

443
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,569
- ( Bat vibrating )
- It's friggin' hard!

444
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,038
Centichoro: Pathetic.

445
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,906
¶

446
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,180
( Metal bat sighs )

447
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,516
Full-swing hit, and it
didn't even scratch him,

448
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,453
but the bastard protected
his face-thing when I went in.

449
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,256
That's where I need to bash it.

450
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,859
¶

451
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,401
Mohican: He's coming after us!

452
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,003
Pineapple: Wait! Look! On top!

453
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,405
Mohican: Hell, yeah!

454
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,673
¶

455
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,742
metal bat: Killer move!

456
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,277
Fighting spirit...

457
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,945
Dragon pummeling!

458
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,482
( Centichoro roars )

459
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:11,583
( Metal bat gasps )

460
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,891
Centichoro:
Centipede undulation!

461
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:22,360
( Heroes panting )

462
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,563
Mohican: Screw this!
Level dragon's insane!

463
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,830
Pineapple:
Mankind was never meant

464
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,233
to face a monster like this!

465
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:30,302
( Sirens blaring )

466
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,304
Announcer: Emergency evacuation!

467
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:35,840
Warning! A new monster
has appeared in city s,

468
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,309
threat level dragon.

469
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,444
( Crowd screaming )

470
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,646
Woman: What happened
to all the heroes?!

471
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,648
Man: It's the end of the world!

472
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,183
Let's get out of here!

473
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,120
Garou: Well, well.
Everyone's all excited.

474
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,255
Threat level dragon
gets announced,

475
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,190
and, boom,
suddenly it's a party.

476
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,127
I wonder if metal bat
will still be alive

477
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,395
by the time I find him.

478
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,530
Huh?

479
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,601
Metal bat?

480
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,137
How'd he--

481
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,739
oh, that's how.

482
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,407
( Scoffs )

483
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,610
So some other monster
got to beat up a class-s, huh?

484
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,478
- I wasted my time.
- ( Metal bat groans )

485
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,347
Back to the grind.

486
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,617
( Garou stammers )
Metal bat, hold up!

487
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,485
- You're not dead yet?
- Metal bat: Huh?

488
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,221
Garou: You being alive
changes things.

489
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,823
( Laughs )

490
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,225
My second class-s hero.

491
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,694
From here on, you face me.

492
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,763
I'm hunting you.

493
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,631
Metal bat: Huh?
Get real, dipshit.

494
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,100
Can't you see that centipede?

495
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,268
Get your ass--

496
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,238
¶

497
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,643
now I see. You're that guy
who's been running around,

498
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,511
calling himself a hero hunter.

499
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
Garou: Damn right.

500
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,448
This monster won't fall to you.

501
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,383
( Chuckles )

502
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,786
Metal bat: You can see
I'm busy here.

503
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,855
But, sure,
I can spare a little time

504
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
and crack you wide open.

505
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,361
( Singing in Japanese )

506
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,633
Woman: Whoa! City s
is at threat level dragon.

507
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,235
Woman #2: Think everyone'll
be okay there?

508
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,438
Man: Ladies, pardon me.
Got a question for you.

509
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,573
Headed to super fight?

510
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,642
If so, would you mind
if I tag along?

511
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,244
Woman #2: Wait. Aren't you--

512
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,245
woman #1: It's him!

513
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,581
Man: So, yeah? Cool.
