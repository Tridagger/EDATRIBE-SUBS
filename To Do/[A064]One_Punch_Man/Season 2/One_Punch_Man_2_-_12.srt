1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,068
Ng: Fist of flowing water
crushing rock!

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,404
( Blows pounding )

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,807
¶

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,744
( garou yells )

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,019
Genos: Offense and defense
in perfect harmony.

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:25,089
It is the same fighting style,
but bang's form is flawless.

7
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,126
The Victor is already clear.

8
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,319
( Garou groans ) What the hell?

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,388
The old s.O.B. Doesn't usually

10
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,590
just whale on an opponent
like this.

11
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,794
Damn it. I'm blacking out.

12
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,797
I'm about to die.

13
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:05,964
( Bang gasps )

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,072
What is that preposterous style?

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,107
Where did you pick it up?

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,343
It's like you're
a damned animal.

17
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,278
Garou: I'm not done.

18
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,414
I'll grab him
and carve out an advantage.

19
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,916
Bomb: No, you don't.

20
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,424
I took care of the monsters,
as I said I would.

21
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,759
And now your turn.

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,528
Take out garou.

23
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,634
¶

24
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:46,171
Phoenix Man: We sent in a team
to bring garou back alive,

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,943
but we had no idea demon cyborg
was such a strong adversary.

26
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,514
And then there's silverfang
and the other one.

27
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,050
I see no way
of retrieving garou,

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,985
but, if I return empty-handed,

29
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,988
orochi may devour me
like the others.

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,393
I need garou to somehow
get through this alive...

31
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,263
But it's starting
to look hopeless.

32
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,199
Bang: Bomb, look at the wounds
covering him.

33
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,935
If you'd received as many,
would you still be standing?

34
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,937
Bomb: If I were
60 years younger,

35
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:23,208
I'm confident I could hang in
there without a problem, maybe.

36
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,344
Now just a little more.
Let's finish this, bang!

37
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,379
Bang: Hah!

38
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,015
( Blows pounding )

39
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:35,019
Garou: Bang, you bastard.
Attacking your former student

40
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,089
when I'm already
beaten all to hell.

41
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,758
And, worse,
the other old fart is bomb,

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,228
master of fist of whirling wind
slashing steel.

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,630
Have they no shame,
ganging up on me like this?

44
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,101
Even if I put on a sob act
and begged for my life,

45
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,437
demon cyborg
would never let me go.

46
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,973
I don't see
any other way out of this.

47
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,476
The only thing I can do
is kill all three of them.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,914
But that's impossible.

49
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,182
Bang: I will repay you
for every ounce of pain

50
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,383
you gave to charanko!

51
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,219
- Suffer!
- ( Blows pounding )

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,591
Boy: Let's play
heroes and monsters.

53
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,593
You're gonna play, too,
right, garou?

54
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,994
Boy 2: Come on, man!

55
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,930
Garou: Uh, okay.

56
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,531
( Boy 1 hums fanfare )

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,066
Justice man is here!

58
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,001
Whaah!

59
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,203
Justice kick!

60
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,338
( Boy 2 groans )

61
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,140
Garou: Be more careful

62
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,474
boy 1: Huh?

63
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,342
Garou: That must have hurt.

64
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,477
¶

65
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,146
( chuckles ) Okay, then.

66
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,748
- Why don't you be the monster?
- Garou: What?

67
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,750
Boys: Why don't you
be the monster?

68
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,353
- Young garou: Uh...
- Garou: What's this?

69
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,822
My life flashing before my eyes?

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,691
Everything about this sucks.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
What was his name?

72
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,495
Boy 1: You're the monster now.
Got it?

73
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,297
Garou: That's right.

74
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,099
It was tatsu,

75
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,168
the most popular kid in class.

76
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,170
Girl: What's going on?
What happened?

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,704
Girl 2: Garou was fighting.

78
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,039
Boy: We were playing.

79
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,707
Then, out of nowhere,
garou got mad.

80
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,311
Boy 2: He went totally crazy!
We were just playing!

81
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,446
Boy 3: What the heck?
What's wrong with him?

82
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,149
Boy 4: Why'd you
hurt tatsu like that!

83
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,387
Man: Now tell me, garou,
why did you get into that fight?

84
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,655
Garou: I don't know.

85
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,256
Man: Is it true
you became violent

86
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,392
over heroes and monsters?

87
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,727
Garou: Tatsu's always--
I mean, he's--

88
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,262
man: Can you not
tell the difference

89
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,064
between reality and fantasy?

90
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,533
Garou: No, that's not it at all!
I'm always the monster, and--

91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,469
man: You're the one
who lost his temper,

92
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,671
so you're the one
who will be punished!

93
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,273
Garou: It's not like I didn't
want to be the monster.

94
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,677
Did I hate that tatsu
was always the hero?

95
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,146
No, that wasn't it, either.

96
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,548
It's because the game itself

97
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,418
just felt so incredibly
one-sided and unfair.

98
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:50,155
Heroes and monsters
is just a game of pretend

99
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,557
based on kids' TV shows.

100
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,560
Everyone's free to choose
what role they play.

101
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,763
Tatsu was the most popular kid
in class.

102
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,299
But me, I was friendless,

103
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,768
always with a dark cloud above.

104
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:07,305
Everyone knew who the hero
was going to be.

105
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,641
I didn't stand a chance in hell.

106
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,243
Tatsu: Justice cross chop!

107
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,245
( Grunts )

108
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,047
Hey, why'd you dodge?

109
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,114
Garou: Huh?

110
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,916
Tatsu: Guys...

111
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,318
Hold garou still.

112
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,254
- ( Boys laugh ) Okay.
- Young garou: Wait!

113
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,257
Garou: Naturally,
there was no scenario

114
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,859
where the monster
would ever win.

115
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,727
I was always the loser.

116
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,362
Tatsu: Justice kick!

117
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,733
Garou the poop monster is dead!

118
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,736
Garou: The popular kid
always beats up

119
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,205
the little guy
that no one likes.

120
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,174
That's just the way
the world works.

121
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,343
Young garou: I've had enough!

122
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,279
Come on! Fight me, tatsu!

123
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,282
Tatsu: Huh?
What are you talking about?

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,750
Garou: I don't want
to be the monster

125
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,086
in your games anymore!
If I win, that's it!

126
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,355
You have to promise
to leave me alone forever!

127
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,557
( Tatsu chuckles ) Guys...

128
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,325
Hold garou for a second.

129
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,695
( Garou gasps )
Hey, that's cheating!

130
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,732
Let go! I wanna fight
tatsu one-on-one!

131
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,571
Man: The other kids
say you were all playing games

132
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
and then you got
violent out of nowhere.

133
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,174
Garou: That's not what happened.

134
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,310
Tatsu is just super popular,

135
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,245
so everyone's
making me the bad guy.

136
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,647
Man: Wrong! You did
something you shouldn't have,

137
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,116
so now you have to apologize!

138
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,784
( Young garou crying )

139
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,454
Garou: Screw justice,
and screw evil, too.

140
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,855
I'm gonna be killed

141
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,925
simply because that's what
everyone else wants?

142
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,728
It's not fair. I can't stand it.

143
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,529
It pisses me off!

144
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,265
All I want
is to make them understand.

145
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,400
¶

146
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,203
I'm here to fight
for underdogs everywhere.

147
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,339
Good? Evil?

148
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,341
I reject them both!

149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,177
Bang: This is the end, garou!

150
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,480
Garou:
That's where you're wrong!

151
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,584
- ( Both gasp )
- Garou: Nothing's ended!

152
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,654
- Bang: What the...
- ( Garou roaring )

153
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,425
Bang: Garou.

154
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,560
( Genos gasps ) Look out!

155
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,262
Above you!

156
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,298
Phoenix Man: Yaah!

157
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,767
( Heroes groan )

158
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,437
( Garou yells )

159
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,438
( Groans )

160
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,710
Bomb: That monster.

161
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,913
Bang: Genos, wait!

162
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,850
Genos: No, bang!
Garou is a monster now!

163
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,387
I will shoot them both down
and end this!

164
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,855
Phoenix Man:
Listen up down there!

165
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,724
I've got garou with me!

166
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,794
The others, I leave to you...

167
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,329
Genos:
Spiral incineration cannon!

168
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,799
Phoenix Man: Centichoro!

169
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,767
( Chorus vocalizing )

170
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:57,743
Bomb: Dear god, what's that?

171
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,887
Is that a living creature?!

172
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,823
( Bang grunts ) Down there,
the other heroes!

173
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,595
- ( Genos grunts )
- ( Bang grunts )

174
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,302
¶

175
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,775
it took the full brunt of geno''
attack like it was nothing,

176
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,511
not even a scratch.

177
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,778
Whatever this creature is,

178
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,881
it will no doubt
be a fearsome adversary.

179
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,554
¶

180
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,658
( garou gasps )
What's the big idea?

181
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,593
Nobody asked you to butt in.

182
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,797
Phoenix Man: Never you mind.
Centichoro will handle the rest.

183
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,734
He's a living catastrophe,
destroying all in his path.

184
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,737
I admire
such indiscriminate destruction.

185
00:08:58,806 --> 00:08:59,738
( Garou groans )

186
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,072
Phoenix Man: As usual,

187
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,408
you didn't kill your opponents,
hero hunter.

188
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,411
Once they're down, you have
to keep hammering away at them

189
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,013
until they're truly done.

190
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,750
Those heroes lying on the ground
could live to fight another day.

191
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:12,751
( Garou sighs )

192
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,354
Phoenix Man: Well, not to worry.

193
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,689
Centichoro will see to it
that they don't.

194
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,824
( Garou grunts )

195
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,026
You all can piss off. Got it?!

196
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,627
Those are my prey!

197
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,563
Phoenix Man: Enough of that.
Stop squirming.

198
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,898
Garou: Eat shit! Put me down!

199
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,500
I won't let you do this to me!

200
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,435
Phoenix Man: Why are you upset?

201
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,339
It's your own fault
for not finishing them.

202
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,109
The elimination
of two class-s heroes

203
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,680
makes everything that happened
here very worthwhile for us.

204
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,518
They are our greatest enemies,
after all.

205
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,654
You experienced that firsthand.

206
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,057
Fights, you see,
are all about matchups.

207
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,394
According to our strategist,
gyoro-gyoro,

208
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,596
the only heroes
who are powerful enough

209
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,732
to resist centichoro
are the psychic with abilities

210
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,536
beyond any other,
terrible tornado,

211
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,138
the loner with an arsenal
of military technology,

212
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,473
metal knight,

213
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,011
the hero known
as the strongest human, king,

214
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,745
and the top-ranked hero

215
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,616
who nearly killed centichoro
two years ago, blast.

216
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,086
Centichoro is working
with the monster association

217
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,556
just to have a chance
for vengeance against blast.

218
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,825
He's quite desperate
to do whatever he can

219
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,961
to lure the number one hero
to the battlefield.

220
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,698
From a matchup perspective,
those class-s heroes

221
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,901
lack the means to escape
their present circumstance.

222
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,038
Silverfang boasts
peerless technique, no doubt,

223
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:43,174
but it's only effective against
opponents of a certain size.

224
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:46,712
Demon cyborg's capabilities
are outstanding,

225
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,515
but his strength cannot exceed
the firepower of his components.

226
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:54,653
Those three
face only certain slaughter.

227
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,190
( Centichoro roars )

228
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,792
Genos: Here it comes!

229
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,061
- Bang: All right, genos.
- Bomb: You're up!

230
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,996
- Genos: Understood!
- ( Centichoro roars )

231
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,399
¶

232
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,771
bomb: Whirling wind.

233
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,677
Bang: Flowing water.

234
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,880
Both: Roaring qi
rending sky fist!

235
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,416
¶

236
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,130
Genos: What an amazing move.

237
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,834
Against such a hard exterior,

238
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,171
it serves
as the perfect counter!

239
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,507
Both: Again! Again!
Again! Again!

240
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,175
Again! Again!
Again! Again! Again!

241
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,043
Again! Again! Again!
Again! Again!

242
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,846
- Again!
- ( Centichoro groaning )

243
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,621
( Both groan )

244
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,758
( Centichoro screams )

245
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,731
Bomb: We should have
seen that coming.

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,065
Bang: Yes, that's true,

247
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,267
but we only had one shot
with that technique.

248
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,537
Thank you for the assist, genos.

249
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,805
Genos: It was no trouble.

250
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,141
Bomb: That was
a devastating attack.

251
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,010
The shock will travel
throughout its body.

252
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,746
May you shatter
into a million pieces, demon.

253
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,149
( Bang grunts )

254
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,483
We're done here.

255
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,087
Hmm?

256
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,599
( Centichoro grunting )

257
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,236
( Snarls )

258
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,904
Bang: Damn it.

259
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,240
The cursed beast just molted!

260
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,908
Bomb: That's all we did?

261
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,244
If we can't beat it,
then what do we do now?

262
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,646
Bang: The city's close by.

263
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,116
If it makes it over there,
it will be a massacre.

264
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,252
- Genos: Bang.
- Bang: Hmm?

265
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,588
Genos: Go. I will face it.

266
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,657
I will hold the monster here
for as long as I can

267
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,726
while you two make a run for it.

268
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,063
Bang: Damn fool. You know
we'd never agree to that.

269
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,999
Bomb: You shouldn't
make rash decisions

270
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,800
simply because you cannot win.

271
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,603
The future needs
young heroes like you.

272
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,206
Dr. Kuseno: Listen, genos.

273
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,609
Don't do anything rash.
You understand?

274
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,077
( Genos sighs )

275
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,747
Is caution truly
the path I should choose?

276
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,682
( Sighs )

277
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,685
No. I do not accept that!

278
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,587
( Both gasp )

279
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,925

280
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,163
bang: It's suicide!

281
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,133
Your cannons
won't work on that beast!

282
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,072
( Centichoro roars )

283
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,847
Genos: Centichoro,
goketsu, even garou,

284
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,050
they are all
with the monster association.

285
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,154
There is simply
no avoiding this fight!

286
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,894
Dual blade rush!

287
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,800
Fighting one of them is
the same as fighting them all!

288
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,970
( Centichoro roars )

289
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,242
I will smash you apart!

290
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,313
Genos: If battling them
is rash...

291
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,088
( Centichoro chuckles )

292
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,693
- ( Bomb gasps )
- Bang: No! Genos!

293
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,266
Genos: ...Then being rash is
all I am worth in a fight!

Genos: Jet drive arrow!

297
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,447
Centichoro: Insignificant flea!

Bang: He went into its mouth!

301
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:31,897
Centichoro: Die!

302
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,269
Genos: This is stomach acid.

303
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,739
Centichoro: I'll melt
your body down to nothing.

304
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,942
Genos: You are mistaken.

305
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,644
You are the one who will melt!

306
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,416
Ultra spiral
incineration cannon!

307

I...

317
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:47,940
I could not win.

318
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,810
I could not save them.

319
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,081
Bang: We're going
to have to run for it!

320
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,051
Centichoro: Futile.

321
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,888
Phoenix Man:
What's the matter, hero hunter?

322
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,223
You're awfully quiet.

323
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,958
Are you seeing things
our way now?

324
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,761
Garou: This is not
how all that I fought for

325
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,962
was supposed to end.

326
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,298
The heroes,
I wanted to defeat them

327
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,301
using my own strength,
and, by doing so,

328
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,037
become the symbol that
strikes fear in their hearts.

329
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,373
Why else even be
the hero hunter?

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,976
Phoenix Man: "The symbol that
strikes fear in their hearts"?

331

( Laughs )

332
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,914
Your power
doesn't even come close

that I am lacking?

There are many more
like this monster.

339
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:53,004
Am I destined to be
a mere spectator

340
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,408
when the heroes face
an enemy such as this?

341

Bomb: I hate to say this,
but we've got a problem.

342
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,345
It's driving us toward the city.

343

00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,324
Centichoro!

355
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,458
Listen up, bug!

356
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,261
I brought blast out here
to kick your ugly ass!

357
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,597
Bang: Wait.
Isn't that king's voice?

358
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,999
Genos: And blast is with him?

359
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,934
Bomb: Look!
I guess it heard him!

360
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,603
It's turning toward the voice!

361
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,605
Centichoro: Blast!

362
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,407
- ( Heart pounding )
- King: That's right!

363
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,076
The hero
who once beat you so badly,

364
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,413
you ran away crying
and soaked in your own piss!

365
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,017
Class s, rank 1, blast!

366
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,686
You want a rematch, bug boy?!

367
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,022
What's the problem? You scared?

368
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,623
Uh, coward!

369
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:23,228
If you're gonna shit yourself
in fear, do it at home.

370
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,231
A lowly bug like you
has got no business here!

371
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,168
Go back to your hidey-hole,
and suck on your mommy's milk!

372
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,371
Man: Looks like king
made it in time.

373
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,240
Woman: Yes, it seems so.
He asked for information

374
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,442
that he could use
to provoke centichoro.

375
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,578
Man: He's planning
to draw the monster in

376
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,312
for a head-to-head clash.

377
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,647
Woman: I know it's classified,

378
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,650
but I told him about blast,
their last fight.

379
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,586
Man: And his response?

380
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,522
Woman: All he said was,
"understood."

381
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,257
( Heart pounding )

382
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,195
But I also heard
the roar of the king engine.

383

384
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,265

385
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,600
"lure him in for me.

386
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,002
Keep him away from the city
and the civilians."

387
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,404
That should do it.

388
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,873
( Centichoro yelling )

389
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,044
King: Saitama?

390
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,549

395
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,088
That you, genos?

396
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,591
Huh. Guess he was here.

397
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,327
King: Yeah. Good thing we came.

398
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,964
Huh. Look at you! You seem
so relaxed all of a sudden.

399
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,402
Saitama: Punching that bug
in the face kinda refreshed me.

400
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,071
I must have been stressed out

401
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,539
from you handing me my ass
at all those games.

402
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,575
King: Was he really
still pissed about that?

403
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,478
- Genos: Master saitama...
- Saitama: Huh?

404
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,547
- I must ask you something.
- Saitama: What's up?

405
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,684
Genos: What do you think it is
that I am lacking, master?

406
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,486
Saitama: Uh, it's power, right?

407
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,090
Genos: Thank you
very much, master!

408
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:34,425
King: Oh, man!
Don't tell him that!

409
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,828
You can't use saitama
as a baseline!

410
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,764
Don't do it, genos!

411
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:44,303
Genos: Master's battles and
wisdom show me the true path.

412
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,772
He is a symbol of strength,

413
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,307
of what I strive to be.

414
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,646
I will get there, too...

415
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,814
Someday.

416
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,384
