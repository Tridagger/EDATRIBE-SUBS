1
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,583
I got her!

2
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,500
[gasps]

3
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,041
[screams]

4
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,791
Damn, our sneak attack
is a bust!

5
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,125
Then let's rush her!

6
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,458
Now!

7
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,958
[running footsteps]

8
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,333
[shouting]

9
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,375
Hmph.

10
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,041
[grunting]

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,750
Why, hello there, Tor.

12
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,750
Lilith.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,375
Now then,
let us dance.

14
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,208
To the accompaniment
of clashing shields

15
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,375
and smoking guns.

16
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,375
I really didn't think
we'd encounter one another

17
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,625
so soon, Tor.

18
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,708
But I'm so
pleasantly surprised.

19
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,500
Let's make this quick.

20
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,041
Um, hold on.
Can I say something first?

21
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,958
What is it?

22
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,041
Well?

23
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,083
When you initially asked
to be Duo partners,

24
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,708
I never apologized to you
for turning you down.

25
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,750
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,000
But why bring it up now?

27
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,250
Do you think by doing that

28
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,541
I'll somehow go
a little bit easier on you?

29
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,791
No, and in fact,
I hope you don't.

30
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,708
I want to fight you
at full strength.

31
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,666
What?

32
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,500
If we fight each other
at full power,

33
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,125
then we'll understand each other
better afterwards.

34
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,125
That'll help us become friends.

35
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,666
Don't you think so?

36
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,333
I think you might be
an idiot, Tor.

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,166
You know, sometimes
I think the same thing.

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,500
But this seems to be

39
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
the only way
that we can do this.

40
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,666
Huh. Well, all right.

41
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,875
But I do wonder
if you're going to be able

42
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,500
to keep up with me
at full power.

43
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,958
Quit breaking things!

44
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,375
Think of the shopkeepers!

45
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,958
Oh, relax.
I'll reimburse them

46
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,041
so they can get it fixed up
as good as new.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,250
[grunts]

48
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,958
It's nuts you rented out
the A La Mode Mall

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,500
for your Survive Dance Party.

50
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,666
Oh, come on, admit it,
this is fun.

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,291
A whole lot more
than being stuck

52
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,125
in a stuffy old classroom.
Right?

53
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,041
So it's manageable
from this distance, huh?

54
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,166
Oh, wow.

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,041
So you're calculating
the trajectory

56
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,500
from the angle
of the barrel?

57
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,250
--Well done.
--Oh, yeah?

58
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,291
Well, you still haven't seen
nothing yet!

59
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,416
[shouts]

60
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,208
[shouting]

61
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,166
Take her down,
you guys!

62
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,958
[TOR thinking]
Julie? She's early!

63
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,375
[LILITH thinking]
Hm.

64
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,375
They're using a decoy
and an ambush

65
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,916
to force me to dodge
to a very specific point.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,416
One where your best fighter
will finish me off, eh?

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,541
Someone put this together well.

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,750
But still.

69
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,250
[LILITH] You need to put
just a little more thought

70
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,541
into an Exceed's
physical capabilities.

71
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,208
If Julie's timing
hadn't been slightly off,

72
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,958
I might have found myself
in a spot of trouble.

73
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,666
Now listen up, Tor.

74
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,583
You really amuse me
a great deal.

75
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,375
That's why I'm saving
you for last as my main course.

76
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,625
[LILITH chuckles]

77
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,208
[gasps]

78
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,250
[MIYABI yelps]

79
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,041
Ow, that hurt.

80
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,500
Are you okay, Miyabi?

81
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,166
I'll be all right, Tor.

82
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,833
But thank you for asking.

83
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,291
[yelps]

84
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,291
Did you see anything?

85
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,458
No, I sure didn't,
so you can rest easy, okay?

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,791
[gunshot]

87
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,250
[TOR]
Lilith.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,416
We better work out
our next move, guys.

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,083
And quickly, too.

90
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,125
[TOMOE]
From the sound of things,

91
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,458
Lilith is fighting
in the Sky Court up ahead.

92
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,666
That means we can
either go after her now

93
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,666
or wait and intercept her
when she arrives here.

94
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,041
I say we go after her.

95
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,875
You won't hear
an objection from me.

96
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:03,916
[TATSU grunts]

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,458
Um, then I'm in
if you guys are!

98
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,583
Uh.

99
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,291
[TOR]
Something wrong, Julie?

100
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,541
Nej, and I agree
with the group's decision.

101
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,208
[TOR]
Oh, okay.

102
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,583
All right, it's settled then.

103
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,125
There are two routes
into the Sky Court.

104
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,500
Tor, you, Tatsu, and Julie
will take the main route.

105
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,541
The rest of us
will take the long way,

106
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,708
and hopefully we can attack her
from both sides.

107
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,958
Tor.

108
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,250
She took everyone out already.
Dammit.

109
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,958
[TOR thinking]
Lilith, where are you?

110
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,083
[grunts, groans]

111
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,250
Tatsu!

112
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,958
As an avid hunter,
I'm quite skilled at camouflage.

113
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,916
[shouting]

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,666
Come on, don't you remember
you're tonight's main course?

115
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,625
So, be a good boy
and wait already.

116
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm real sorry,
but I can't stand waiting.

117
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,458
Well, I can't stand
a man who's impatient!

118
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
[TOR thinking]
She's gonna shoot me this close?

119
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,833
Crap!

120
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,083
We'll take the rest
nice and slow

121
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,083
after I've eliminated
all the others, okay?

122
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,708
Julie, no!

123
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,041
We need to wait
for Tomoe's group!

124
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,083
Nej, it's all right, Tor!

125
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,250
Ah, an all-too
predictable move.

126
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,666
Oh!

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm so very disappointed
in you, Julie.

128
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,625
I expected you to put up
a much bigger fight.

129
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,750
Julie!

130
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,833
So much for standing
by her always.

131
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,125
Not so fast!

132
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,458
Let's go! Move!

133
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,625
Right! Gotcha!

134
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,166
[TORA]
She's not coming after us? Huh.

135
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,875
I guess she was serious

136
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,125
about leaving Tor
for last then, wasn't she?

137
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,708
[TOMOE groans]

138
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,958
Tomoe, did you get hit?

139
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,958
[JULIE]
Oh, no, what is that?

140
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,416
This? Don't fret.
It's nothing.

141
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,958
[TOMOE]
Forget me.

142
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,791
What about that
shoulder of yours?

143
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,875
[MIYABI]
Tomoe!

144
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,791
This is my fault.

146
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,416
Hey, we're friends.

147
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,833
You would have done
the same for me.

148
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,333
Yes, but--

149
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
You've really been rushing
into things today.

150
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,916
[TOMOE]
Is something going on, Julie?

151
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Nej. Nothing, I swear.

152
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,250
[TOMOE]
All right.

153
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,875
But please remember this.

154
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,541
Your Blaze has a lot to do

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,083
with speed
and keeping a cool head

156
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,041
to find the right moment
to use it.

157
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,708
Ja.

158
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,125
'Kay.

159
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,333
So how do you guys propose
we take Lilith down?

160
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,833
It looks like
we'll have to wait

161
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,916
for our chance
at close combat, I suppose.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,708
But we're not as strong
as we were

163
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,000
and Tomoe's hurt.

164
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,541
Plus, Julie's got
a slight injury as well.

165
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,416
And Miyabi's lance is
so ginormous and awkward.

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
She can't get very close.

167
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
Yeah.

168
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,125
We've all got our own strengths
and weaknesses here.

169
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,416
But in terms of raw,
destructive power,

170
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,833
Miyabi's got us all beat,

171
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,625
and I think
she is our best shot.

172
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,125
Do you think so?

173
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,708
Heh. Yeah, but Lilith
is a real sneaky fighter.

174
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,000
And not only that,
but she's cocky too.

175
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,583
She's such a pain!

176
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,875
Cocky? Wait a sec.

177
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,708
Yeah, that might be the answer.
Maybe.

178
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,833
What is it you're
mumbling about, Tor?

179
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,208
Hmm.

180
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,708
--[footsteps]
--Huh?

181
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,916
--Tor.
--Julie?

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,958
Hold on, why aren't you waiting
at your assigned position?

183
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm sorry, but I have
to talk to you now, Tor.

184
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,208
It'll only take
a second, okay?

185
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,333
All right, what's going on?

186
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,458
Tomoe was right.

187
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,750
I have been
rushing into everything.

188
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,625
Is it because of that
Duo stuff with Lilith?

189
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,750
[JULIE] I know you said
that you turned her down, Tor,

190
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,833
but even so.

191
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,875
I'm worried about
what might happen

192
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,083
if she does well in this Survive
and really impresses you.

193
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,375
I get it now.
So all this time, you thought...

194
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,708
[JULIE whimpers]

195
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,625
[TOR]
I want to protect you, Julie,

196
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,416
and be the one that
you can rely on, remember?

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,333
Oh, Tor.

198
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,666
Listen, there's no reason
to worry, okay?

199
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,041
You.
You're my only Duo partner.

200
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,041
I mean that.
Got it?

201
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,375
Ja.

202
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,125
[LILITH]
Did you two forget the theme

203
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,166
of this dance party is
"Survive," not "Talk"?

204
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,541
[TOR] That was some
nice shooting, Lilith.

205
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
I had no idea that
you were even up there.

206
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,666
[LILITH] Blending in with your
environment is Hunting 101.

207
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,500
That and bagging your prey,
of course, so...

208
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,708
Isn't it about time
we wrapped this thing up?

209
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,291
Oh, and I can see your
friend hiding over there.

210
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,291
Huh. Didn't I tell you guys
she was a real pain?

211
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,916
Where's the rest?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,083
I know that
I wounded one of you.

213
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,125
And the other one
is pretty slow.

214
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,666
Did you leave those two
behind somewhere?

215
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,041
Nej, we would never do a thing
like that to Tomoe and Miyabi.

216
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,500
That's an admirable
trait to possess,

217
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,125
and I do respect that you
look after your teammates.

218
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,375
But nevertheless.

219
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,791
[LILITH]
Let's end this, shall we?

220
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,458
And now, it's time for
the last dance, my darlings!

221
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,541
[grunting]

222
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,958
That strike had a lot
more feeling to it, Julie!

223
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,666
But it appears
my previous attack

224
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,291
did some
lasting damage to you

225
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,416
because you're too slow!

226
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,208
[JULIE whimpering]

227
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,708
Blaze on!

228
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,333
Wow, nicely done!

229
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,958
Hey, over here, I hope you
haven't forgotten about me!

230
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,791
Oh, don't you worry!
I haven't!

231
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,916
Then do your worst!
Oh!

232
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,541
This isn't over yet!

233
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,958
--Dammit, no!
--Tor!

234
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,875
Don't worry about me, guys!

235
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,125
We're taking her down
just like we planned!

236
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,208
In the shape you're in?
I doubt it, Tor.

237
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,666
Oh, yeah?

238
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,083
Well, I've finally got you
right where I want you!

239
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,583
Mjolnir!

240
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,791
[shouting]

241
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,833
That's impressive!
But still not enough!

242
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,250
[shouting]

243
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,291
I will not be defeated!

244
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
She hasn't cocked!
Do it now!

245
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,708
Ja!
This dance is over, Lilith!

246
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,166
Oh, the only one
it's over for is you.

247
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,625
Oh!

248
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,375
[gunshot]

249
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,125
[gunshot]

250
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,125
Julie.

251
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,791
This is such a pity.
It was a fake-out.

252
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,291
Wow, so you guys really thought
that I have to cock my rifle

253
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,666
every time I shoot it?

254
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,708
[chuckles]

255
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,166
[TOR] No, but it is what
we wanted you to believe.

256
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,583
What?

257
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,208
Tora had you pegged.

258
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,625
You're so "cocky," you just
revealed the truth to us!

259
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,333
That makes this checkmate,
Lilith.

260
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,916
But how? I'm positive I shot you
right through the chest.

261
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,125
So that's the reason
you were moving so slowly.

262
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,541
You were both
fighting together.

263
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
Huh, I get it.

264
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,125
There were two of you
waiting in ambush.

265
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,375
[TOR] You almost had me
at first, Lilith.

266
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,375
But then I remembered--

267
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,208
you never reloaded once
that time at the mall.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,708
Ah. Nothing gets
past you, does it, Tor?

269
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,166
It's over.
So just give up, okay?

270
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,625
And surrender to us now.

271
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
[LILITH]
Don't say it again!

272
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,041
I won't give up, not now
and not ever, you hear me?

273
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
[ALL gasping]

274
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,833
[JULIE]
Tor!

275
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,833
That isn't from her Blaze.
It's a real bullet!

276
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,750
[MAN] He got close, didn't he?
Lilith Bristol.

277
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,375
Who are they?
Do you know, Lilith?

278
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,708
Not at all!
Who are you people?

279
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,583
And just what is it
that you want?

280
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,875
We come bearing an invitation
for you, Miss Bristol,

281
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,833
and it's from none other
than Equipment Smith,

282
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,291
the Master Armorer.
That should suffice.

283
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,250
Well, does it?

284
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,958
Oh.
Yes, it does, quite.

285
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,583
And I thank you very much.

286
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,916
But you can tell him
that I refuse!

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,791
And I won't accept anything
from someone rude enough

288
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,291
to interrupt my dance party!

289
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,000
[gunshot]

290
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,625
Sorry about that.

291
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,750
We're to bring you in, even if
it means getting a little rough.

292
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,250
So now you're coming with us.

293
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,875
Like hell she is!

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,916
[shouting]

295
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,375
[TORA]
What the hell?

296
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,166
I know we're exhausted,
but still.

297
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,250
Our attacks,
they didn't do anything.

298
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,500
It's because Exceeds
aren't the only ones

299
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,208
who've surpassed humanity.

300
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,708
That's the reason.

301
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,791
[scream]

302
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,458
[K]
You be still now.

303
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,416
It would be a real shame
if you were to make

304
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,625
my trigger finger slip,
wouldn't it?

305
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,166
[LILITH]
Let her go!

306
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,458
I'll accept the invitation.

307
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,875
But only if you
release her right now!

308
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,625
[K]
You have my thanks.

309
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,625
Now I'm going to be able to
show my face to the bossman.

310
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,166
We're leaving this place now

311
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,958
so follow me
and don't try anything.

312
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,458
Lilith, I--

313
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,166
I'm sorry we couldn't
finish things properly, Tor.

314
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,708
It's been fun, though.

315
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,041
[crying]

316
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,291
[TORA]
Damn it.

317
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,875
Just who the hell were
those creeps, anyway?

318
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,083
[TOR]
That doesn't matter, Tora!

319
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,833
The only thing
that does is Lilith!

320
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,250
Ja.

321
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,416
Huh, isn't that just like you?

322
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,291
[crying]

323
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
Tor, I'm so sorry about this.

324
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,083
Hey, don't worry,
we're gonna get Lilith back.

325
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,541
And when we do that--

326
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,000
you greet us
with a smile, okay?

327
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,958
[crying]
Uh-huh.

328
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,541
[LILITH]
What are you doing here?

329
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,083
My question exactly.

330
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,541
I'm here to get Lilith back,
why else?

331
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,250
[LILITH]
Stand down, Tor!

332
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,708
You're in
no condition to fight.

333
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,041
Do you have a death wish?

334
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,416
[TOR]
No, but it's like you said.

335
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,916
I want to finish things properly
between you and me.

336
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,916
I won't say it again,
you mule-headed idiot!

337
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,416
Well, the same goes for me,
Lilith!

338
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,041
C'mon,
we're at full strength!

339
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,791
We've gotta fight so we can
better understand each other!

340
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,375
This is such a childish game.

341
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,750
Would you gentlemen end it
since we're on a schedule here?

342
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,083
--No!
--[gunfire]

343
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,458
[TOR] I've gotta put
the last of my strength

344
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,000
into one single blow!

345
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,416
And then... Shatter!

346
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,208
You must be getting desperate.

347
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,583
You don't get it, do you?

348
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,458
Don't you know
where we are?

349
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,333
[K]
No!

350
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,166
[loud rumbling]

351
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,083
[TOR]
Lilith!

352
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,541
[LILITH]
You've got me, Tor.

353
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,916
Julie! Tora!

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,208
--[JULIE] Ja!
--[TORA] We got this!

355
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,250
[rumbling continues]

356
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,666
[K]
To resort to such a tactic!

357
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,375
Lend me your strength, Lilith.
We can do this.

358
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,708
Right, Blaze on!

359
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,750
Here we go, Tor!
But you pull the trigger!

360
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,166
It's over for you, buddy!

361
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,916
[TOR] Um, you're
really sure about this?

362
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,541
[LILITH]
Of course.

363
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,625
You want to fight
with me at my full power

364
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,625
so we can understand
each other better, right?

365
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,958
Yeah, but after everything
that happened today,

366
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,333
I'm pretty beat up.

367
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,458
Well, I've hurt my arm,
so in my book,

368
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,166
I'd say that makes us even.

369
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,708
All right then.

370
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,958
If you're willing, I won't
object to settling this thing

371
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,416
--once and for all!
--Atta boy, Tor!

372
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,708
[grunts]

373
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,708
Hmm.

374
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,500
[shouting]

375
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,125
Sir, my apologies.

376
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,791
The Unit got a little
scuffed up during this op.

377
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,083
[MASTER ARMORER]
It's no matter,

378
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,291
the adjustments
have yet to be made anyway.

379
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,333
Besides,
the data you got is plenty.

380
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,541
What shall we do
about Lilith Bristol,

381
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
the so-called Exception?

382
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,750
[MASTER ARMORER]
She's an intriguing subject,

383
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,666
but there's no need
to go overboard.

384
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,666
After all,
the one I'm really after is--

385
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,625
[K] Yes, the witch
who's pulling the strings,

386
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,500
Blaze Diabolica.

387
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,625
You know, I half expected
she'd show her face here today.

388
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,333
[MASTER ARMORER]
She's keeping herself guarded.

389
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,916
Speaking of the lady
in question, tell me,

390
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,333
how are those Exceeds
she made, anyway?

391
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,666
[K]
The Exceeds?

392
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,458
Hey, help me! Please!

393
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,666
Well, sir, I think that
they'll be quite amusing.

394
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,791
[gunshot]

395
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,875
I'm so bored. Ugh!

396
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,250
I so wish
I could start moving again.

397
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,416
Nej. The doctor said
you have to stay in bed.

398
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,750
Listen to Julie,
Tor, she's right.

399
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,000
She certainly is. Fighting
with Lilith was reckless.

400
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:06,916
[grunt]

401
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,041
--[knocking]
--[TOR] Come in.

402
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,833
[TOR]
Uh, hi, Lilith.

403
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,916
[TORA] Huh,
what do you doing here?

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,750
It's only natural to visit
an injured friend, isn't it?

405
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,083
--Huh?
--[ALL] You're friends?

406
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,291
Aren't we, Tor?
Don't you remember?

407
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,958
You said we'd be friends
after we fought at full power!

408
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,083
Oh, and I also
wanted to come here

409
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,833
because you came to rescue me.

410
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,125
So, um,
thank you, Tor.

411
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,500
[TOR]
Sure.

412
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,166
[LILITH]
I also wanted to say I'm sorry

413
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,833
for slapping you at
the theme park the other night.

414
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,375
I bet that hurt.

415
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,875
Eh, I've survived worse.

416
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,833
Good to know.

417
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,958
And to all of you, I'm sorry
for not taking you seriously.

418
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,291
No prob.
It actually turned out to be

419
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,416
a pretty good experience
for every one of us.

420
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,375
--Hmm.
--[grunts]

421
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,166
I came here
for one more reason.

422
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,666
Is that other thing
still a no-go, Tor?

423
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,750
Yeah, I'm sorry, but I've
already got a Duo partner

424
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,166
that I'm committed to.

425
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,625
Very well.

426
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,541
But if you should
ever change your mind,

427
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,833
you'll tell me, won't you?

428
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,250
Tor is my Duo partner!

429
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,208
But of course!

430
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,750
Oh, I almost forgot!

431
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,416
There's one more important
thing that I need to tell you.

432
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,375
Now I won't say it again.
So please listen closely.

433
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,833
[BOTH]
Aah!

434
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,416
I've decided this.

435
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,125
You, Tor Kokonoe,
will be my future husband.

436
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,833
[ALL]
What?

437
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,000
Tor, does this mean
that you two have been--?

438
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,208
Oh, Tor, how could
you do such a thing?

439
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,666
Don't you have any shame,
you perverted dog?

440
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,625
You've got it wrong!
All of you!

441
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:51,916
Right.

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,291
[TOR]
Don't leave, Lilith, tell 'em!

443
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,750
I'll tell them this--

444
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,875
I'm serious about winning
Tor's heart and I'll do it!

445
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,625
Just you wait!

446
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm not giving up on becoming
Tor's Duo partner, Julie.

447
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,916
Nej.
Tor's partner is--

448
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,625
Fine, then I
won't give up, either!

449
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,458
--What?
--Okay, I won't give up, either!

450
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,791
[gasping]

451
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,333
[JULIE] Next time,
"Silver-Blonde, Yellow Topaz."

452
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,708
Well, I won't give up, either!

453
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,583
[GIRLS]
What?
