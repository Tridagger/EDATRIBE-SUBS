00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,250
And I really didn't want
to get out of bed this morning.

00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,250
Ditto, but at least we get
to work out in the pool!

00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,166
I know!

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,500
Wait, hold on, a rifle Blaze?

5
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,458
Are you sure you didn't mistake
what you saw?

6
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,958
I'm sure. Her Blaze
was definitely a rifle.

8
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,750
But, Tor, how can that be?

9
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,208
A Blaze can't manifest as any
weapon with a complex structure.

10
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,291
Well, I guess it actually can

11
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,541
if you're an Exception,
like she is.

12
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,750
--Huh?
--An "Exception"?

13
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,625
I'd let her explain,

14
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,125
but it looks like Lilith
might not be joining us today.

and the Irregular.

the power of a Level 2, huh?

20
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,541
That Tomoe chick is
on a whole other level!

21

We're all gonna have
to try harder, you guys!

22
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,375
Right!

23
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,916
Level 2, eh? So that's what
the Rite of Sublimation does.

I didn't feel any different

it actually does give you

to me before!

[chuckles] You know,
I probably only did well

41
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,291
because you've been cheering
me on, Tor. So thank you.

42
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,375
I didn't have
anything to do with it.

43
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,291
You're the one
who's been working so hard.

44

Hm-mm. No, not really.

45
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,458
Um. I'd say it's all because
of your encouragement.

46
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,416
No. It's because
of you, Miyabi. He's right.

47
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,791
I guess, maybe?

48

To Sublimate, your physical
and spiritual strength

have to match your new level,
so stop being so humble, okay?

50
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,500
You should
be proud of it, Miyabi.

51
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,166
Yes, exactly, just like
you girls should be proud

52
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,458
of your pert, young breasts
that all the boys keep ogling!

53
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,333

Isn't that right, Tor?

54
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,708
Wait, what are
you asking me for?

I'm sorry.
You see, we don't really swim

what I saw the rest
of you do, but...

69
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,333
I never saw that coming.

00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,916
Wow. Julie is actually bad
at something.

there's a first time

all right, Julie?

00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,333

how to swim,

he'd pay attention to me.

84

teach me how to swim sometime?

85
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,625
Yeah, no problem.

my high school studies ages ago.

for me to go to class,

by doing this.

make friends by being alone.

the right thing to do.

for just a moment.

Whoa, hunting and shooting, huh?

176
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,583
Well, that's pretty uncommon
where I come from.

177
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,041
Really? Back home in England,

178
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,000
doing things like that
isn't rare at all.

179
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,000
I've dismantled and assembled
guns time and again.

180
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,208
You should learn and know
everything you can

181
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,916
about a weapon
that can take a life,

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,458
especially if you'd entrust
your own life to it.

183
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,833
As a result of this,

184
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,750
guns are the weapons
I'm most familiar with.

185
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,166
In fact, to be real honest,

186
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,750
it's like they're my soul.

187
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,000
So, they mean that much.

188
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,291
Isn't your Blaze the same way?

189
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,083
Um, I guess so.

190
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,500
--[LILITH] Look out!
--[gasps]

191
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,333
[roars]

192
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,000
--[gasps]
--Nicely done!

193
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,041
--Uh...
--[giggles]

194
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,333
You two are
our top scorers today,

195
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,958
and, actually,
you're the highest, ma'am,

196
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,041
so you take home
a special prize!

197
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,500
[giggles] I can't believe
I won a Rogers!

198
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,833
Even better, this chap's

199
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,208
a limited-edition
park exclusive!

200
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,666
Geez, you're acting
just like a little kid!

201
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
And what exactly's wrong
with that?

202
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,250
[both chuckle]

203
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,458
--[fireworks popping]
--[BOTH gasp]

204
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,333
[BOTH] Ah.

205
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,166
[LILITH] Since you've fulfilled
your part of the deal,

206
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,333
what was it
you wanted to ask me?

207
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,291
[TOR] Well, why did
you use your Blaze

208
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,291
in front
of all those people yesterday?

209
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,875
[LILITH] Oh, that?
It's only natural

210
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,833
to use your Blaze
in front of your Duo partner.

211
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,250
Huh?

212
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,583
[LILITH] I was so excited
when I learned there was

213
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,250
another wielder
of an Unrivaled Blaze out there.

214
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,500
I felt like I was
the only one, Tor,

215
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,500
but then to hear
I wasn't alone--

216
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,666
that was when I knew it.

217
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,500
That you, the Irregular,

218
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,125
could be the only
Duo partner for me.

219
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
I'm the only one? Are you sure?

220
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,875
[gasps]

221
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,875
My Blaze is an offensive weapon,
but yours, it's a defensive one.

222
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,625
You-- you're just like
a guardian knight, Tor.

223
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:10,250
As you know, I usually tell
people, "I won't say it again,"

224
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:15,333
But in your case, I will,
so please be my partner.

225
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,166
[music continues]

226
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,375
[no discernible dialog]

227
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,958
Mmm?

228
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,333
--[rattles]
--[grunts]

229
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,041
[sighs] Well, I guess
it is way past curfew.

230
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,750
--[JULIE] Tor. Tor!
--Uh... huh?

231
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,625
[grunts]

232
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,916
Welcome back, Tor.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,041
Hey, thanks for letting me in.
I owe you one.

234
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,541
[BOTH gasp]

235
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,291
[TOR]
The resident advisor.

236
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,083
[grunts]

237
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
[sighs]

238
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,916
Uh, ah! Oh, by the way,
I'm sorry that I'm so late.

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,708
Nej. It's no problem at all,

240
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,625
but where exactly have you been?

241
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,208
Actually... a theme park.

242
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,291
I went to it with Lilith.

243
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,916
Lilith, huh?

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,916
And that's not all.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
She also asked me
to be her Duo partner.

246
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,625
But still...

247
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,916
[fireworks exploding]

248
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,208
What?

249
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,875
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I told you

250
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,833
I've already got a Duo partner,
so I can't be yours, Lilith.

251
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,541
[gasps]
But we're more alike!

252
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,875
That may be so,
but I swore to her,

253
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,083
and to myself,
that I'd stand by her always.

254
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,583
[no discernible dialog]

255
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,958
I'm flattered, but my feelings
aren't going to change.

256
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,208
[gasps]

257
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,958
I'll never forgive you for
rejecting my invitation twice,

258
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,333
or myself for asking again.

259
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,833
[sighs]

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,791
So, I guess now
she really hates my guts.

261
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,166
And to be honest, she did ask me
to be her partner before,

262
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,541
but I didn't want you to worry.

263
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,708
I should've told you.
I'm really sorry.

264
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:39,083
Nej. You were doing it
just to protect my feelings,

265
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,250
and I appreciate it.
But more than that...

266
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,541
[gasps]

267
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:49,750
I'm so thankful, Tor,
that you chose me over her.

268
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,291
No, wait. I'm the one
who needs to be thanking you.

269
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,375
[sneezes]

270
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,375
Let's head back
to our room, okay?

271
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,333
It's pretty chilly out here.

272
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,041
It is, so...

273
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Julie?

274
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,666
...I'll do this to warm up.
It's helping already.

275
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,291
[chuckles]

276
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,375
Yeah. It's nice and toasty.

277
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,375
Ja.

278
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,375
Wherever you went, I hope
you made it back safe, Tor.

279
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,916
[TOMOE] I'm done, so the
bathroom's all yours, Miyabi.

280
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:33,916
Thanks.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,583
Please be okay, Tor. All right?

282
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:44,333
Um, Miyabi. Look,
I'm not a prude or anything,

283
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,250
but do you think
maybe you could do that

284
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,833
somewhere a little more private?

285
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,166
Like, oh, I don't know,
in the bathroom?

286
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,750
Huh? [gasps]

287
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,083
Yes, sorry about that.

288
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,208
Guess my head's focused
somewhere else tonight!

--Uhh...
--[door opens, closes]

00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,416
This is so unfair!

292
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,375
[RITO] Now that the naughty
student who unwisely decided

293
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,875
to skip class yesterday
has been duly punished,

294
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,666
I have an announcement!

295
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,125
It's time you guys took on
the second-year students

296
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,125
in an interclass battle

297
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,791
in what's called...

298
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,375
The Mordraco!

299
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,333
--[STUDENTS gasp]
--Another battle so soon?

300
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,875
The Mor-what-ha?

301
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,583
[RITO] This time
you won't be fighting

302
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,041
as Duos against other Duos,

303
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
but as class against class!

304
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,125
In fact, all the first-year
students will take on

305
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,875
a select group
of second-year ones!

306

--[weapons clanging]
--[STUDENTS grunting]

307
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,041
[RITO] If you guys think
you've got the upper hand

308
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,250
because there are more of you,

309
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,500
boy, have you got
another think coming!

310
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,000
Those second-year students
are all Level 2,

311
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,500
and some are even Level 3!
In other words,

312
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,875
some of the students
that you'll be fighting

313
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,916
are just as powerful as I am!

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,666
[STUDENTS gasp]

315
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,333
So if you don't have a firm
strategy, you guys are gonna get

316
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,125
the ever-living snot
kicked out of you!

317
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,375
Now, good luck
and do your best, okay?

318
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,958
I hope my words
were encouraging!

319

No, they were anything but that!

320
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,583
And we don't need you to see

321
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,958
that these guys are gonna
give us a run for our money.

Even so, we're not inexperienced
fighters any more.

00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,500
Ja. And not only that,

324
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,750
but all of us are
much stronger now, as well.

are stronger than us, Tatsu.

who's really scared
about this fight?

Hey, don't worry, Miyabi.
This is gonna be a group effort.

331
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,708
We're all gonna pull together,
rely on each other,

332

and win this battle
as a unified class.

get this Mordraco battle
started right away?

As the first year
student representative,

339
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
I'll be taking on
all of you alone.

340
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,666
No one fights
in the Mordraco alone.

341
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,500
You must be pulling
our legs, right?

342
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,916
Quit joking around
and just get off the field.

[TOMOE]
Her Blaze is a rifle!

348
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,458
[gasps]

349
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,208
Well, now that that's sorted,
let's get started, shall we?

350
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,666
--[gunshot]
--[grunts]

351
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,916
Lilith took all of 'em out.

352
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,625
[SAKUYA] My, this is a problem.

353
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,416
I do realize that you're
an Exception, Lilith,

354
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,791
but now you've ruined the chance

355
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,208
for our first year students
to test their strength.

356
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Oh, they'll still get
their chance.

357
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,583
In fact, to allow them
the opportunity,

358
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,583
I've decided to hold
a dance party for everyone.

359
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,708
It will be a very different type
of party, however.

360
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,208
We'll dress up in Blazes,

361
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,041
the music will be
the clash of weapons,

362
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,250
and as host,
I'll dance with everybody.

363
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,750
Hmm.

364
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,458
Wow! So then
you're gonna take on

365
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,583
all these first-year
kiddos alone?

366
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,750
You sure are a feisty
little thing, Miss Priss!

367
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,541
Now as for the theme
of our dance, let's think.

368
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,875
[BOTH gasp]

369
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,791
Yes, that's apropos.
It's "Survive."

370
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Lilith is an Unrivaled,
and she's a crack shot

371
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:09,500
with that rifle Blaze of hers.
We can't let our guard down.

372
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,791
Ja. You're right.
And we won't lose!

373
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,958
Julie?

374
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,625
Next time, "Survive."

375
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,208
Don't worry,
I've got your back, Tor.
