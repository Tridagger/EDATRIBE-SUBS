00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,583
[RITO]
Good morning!

2
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,708
I'm so very excited that all of
you have worked out your Duos.

3
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,041
From now on, you'll be
sitting in your Duos, too.

4
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,958
You could even think of it
as sort of a new beginning.

5
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,333
Although, I can already see that
some of you have decided

6
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,291
to stay in the exact
same seats as before.

7
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,208
Yeah. The two of us
fit together nicely.

00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,500
[STUDENTS snickering]

00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,750
Whoa, hang on!

10
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,333
She's talking about
our personalities!

11
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, now that all of your Duos
have been officially decided,

12
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,500
it's just about time for us
to go ahead and move on

13
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,916
to the much anticipated
mock Blaze battle.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,375
Your first Novgladius!

15
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,041
You might be wondering
how all of this will work.

16
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,500
Well, each and
every one of you,

17
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,916
will fight everyone else!

28
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,166
Ah!

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,333
Yaaah!

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,916
And that's checkmate.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,291
You got me.

32
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,708
That makes four losses in a row.

33
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,208
[sighs]

34
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, to be honest,

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,125
the way you move is
a little bit awkward.

36
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,250
I haven't really gotten used to
fighting with this shield yet.

37
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,958
But you'll get better.

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,958
Yeah, but the problem is the
Novgladius is next Saturday.

39
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,625
Right now, there's no way
I'll be up to snuff.

40
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,041
I've got an idea.

41
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,791
Hmm?

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,083
It's about how to use
your shield.

43
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,916
I want you to try to punch me.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,416
Okay. I'll try.

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,708
[JULIE]
I! Two!

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,583
That's too close for it to work!

47
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,166
That was one step
too close, huh?

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,708
Try it from here then.

49
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,375
On "I," step forward while
blocking your opponent's attack.

50
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,708
And on "two,"
strike with Mjolnir.

51
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,166
What is "Mjolnir"?

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,958
I hope it doesn't bother
you, but that's the name

53
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,666
I've given to your right fist.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Mjolnir is the most
powerful weapon

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,916
wielded by
the thunder god, Thor.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,958
[TOR thinking] Now she's
coming up with pet names?

57
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,583
So, what do you think?

58
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,000
I think you've got a
pretty excellent idea there.

59
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
Haaaaaah!

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,333
The thing is, this
attack isn't a Blaze,

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
so if it connects with anyone,
it'll hurt 'em for real.

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,208
That's why I don't want
to use it unless I have to.

63
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,625
Oh, I see.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,166
All of that stuff aside,

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,875
I think this new way of using
my shield will totally work.

66
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,166
Would you mind practicing
with me for a little while?

67
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,583
Nej.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,291
Hmm?

69
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,833
I... I made it!

71
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,250
Hey, Miyabi!

72
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,375
Where am I?

74
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,666
Well, look who
decided to wake up.

75
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,208
Oh, hey, Tor. What's up?

76
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,833
[gasps]

77
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,416
Hang on, wait. What the heck
are you carrying me for?

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,708
Stop! I'm getting down
whether you like it or not,

79
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,000
so let me go!

80
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,791
Would you calm down
before you hurt yourself!

81
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,708
Not to mention
you're rubbing on me.

82
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,041
I'm what?

83
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,958
Everything'll be fine,
just stop freaking out!

[MIYABI screaming]

85
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,916
Are you feeling better?

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,541
Uh. A little.

87
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,833
But why did you...

88
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:41,833
You know?

89
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,583
You collapsed on the track.

90
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,666
You don't remember?

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,333
No.

92
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,166
Are you telling me
that you came to my rescue?

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,333
More or less.

94
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,791
Why don't we get you
to the infirmary,

95
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,583
just to be on the safe side.

96
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,166
Right. Thank you, Tor.

97
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,708
It's good to try hard,
just not too hard.

98
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,833
[MIYABI sighs]

99
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,666
[TOR]
What is it?

100
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,708
[MIYABI] If I don't push
myself to the limit,

101
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,666
then I'll just hold Tomoe back.

102
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,208
[sighs]

103
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,541
My main problem is

104
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,708
that I'm not particularly
good at anything.

105
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,041
In fact, I'm terrible

106
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,666
at both schoolwork
and physical training.

107
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,250
You see, when I learned

108
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,583
I was suited for a Lukifer,
I was so thrilled.

109
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,125
It was great.

110
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,958
It was like I finally had
my chance to be special.

111
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,791
But then...

112
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,166
I met Tomoe, and Julie
and you, Tor.

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,916
Now that I'm around
all these amazing people,

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm back to feeling like I've
got absolutely nothing to offer.

115
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,458
So you ran until you
collapsed on the track?

116
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,916
What else could I do?

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,291
I've gotta get better.

118
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,875
Physical activity is

119
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,875
is the most important part
of getting stronger.

120
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,791
So running's not
a bad idea at all.

121
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,333
Wha? Really?

122
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,375
Talent doesn't mean
anything unless you've spent

123
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,583
enough time
working on the basics.

124
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,375
So if you don't give up
on the running,

125
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,041
you're sure to get stronger.

126
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,375
But try not to overdo it
next time, 'kay?

127
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,916
[laughs]

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,250
Okay.

129
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:23,541

of your help, Tor.

136
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,833
[RITO] Now then, let's review
the Novgladius rules!

137
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,250
It lasts for two hours,
from 5 to 7 p.m.,

138
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,708
and will happen at the north
end of the school grounds!

139
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,458
You'll be fighting
face-to-face,

140
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,333
drawing on your Blaze's
unique qualities,

141
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,333
as well as doing
anything else you can

142
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,833
to try and gain the upper hand!

143
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,708
Best of luck to everyone!

144
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,333
It's time to do this. Let's go.

About our plan...

146
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,833
Are you sure it's going to work?

147
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:12,916
Of course.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,416
Just keep moving ahead.

149
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Knock down whoever's there.

150
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,833
We'll keep this very simple.

151
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,333
You know, we really
do fit together nicely.

152
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,208
[RITO]
Okay, here we go!

153
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,625
Let the Novgladius begin!

[clock tower chiming]

155
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,291
Okay, you ready?

156
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,458
I am.

157
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,875

Blaze on!

158
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,625
Aaa-yah!

159
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,791
What? No way!

00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,791
Wait! I give up!

00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,666
Looks like our first
win of the day.

166
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,708
Yeah.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541

[BOTH shrieking]

170

Sneak attacks, mimicry,
and old-fashioned seduction.

I guess everyone has
their own tactics.

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,333
Yeah.

One hour left.

174
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
With so many Duos
out of the competition,

175
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,875
it'll be harder to find
who we fight next.

176
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,125
Why don't we go somewhere
we haven't been yet?

177
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,166
Ah. Do you mean?

178
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,125
Yah!

179
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,458
We've got to be careful.

180
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,458
It's clear that we're
now in striking distance.

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,500
Well, hello to you, too!

183
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,833
Tomoe.

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,375
[chuckles]

185
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,291
I figured that you were too
good for such a simple attack.

186
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,291
I've gotta say, I've really
been looking forward

187
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,916
to taking you two on.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
And we feel
the same way about you.

189
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,125
Well, then...

190
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,416
Tachibana-Style Eighteen Arts!

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Tomoe Tachibana.

192
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,208
Attack!

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,958
Hah!

194
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,708
What else is up her sleeve?

195
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,875
The Tachibana School covers
a variety of martial arts.

196
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,000
You should know,

197
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,916
this and judo
are my specialties.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So, shall we begin?

199
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,458
Try and block my
Tachibana Oro-chi Form!

200
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,166
Do your thing, Miyabi!

201
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,041
Blaze on!

202
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
All right, guys.

203
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,583
Prepare yourselves. Ah!

204
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,416
[screaming]

205
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,250
You've got me to deal with, too!

206
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,208
Tor, you cover
the back. Got it?

207
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,208
Yeah, no problem, partner!

208
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,541
Come on!

209
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,208
Please don't take
this personally, Tor!

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,041
[MIYABI screaming]

211
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,083
[grunting]

212
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,083
[TOR screaming]

213
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,791
[panting and whimpering]

214
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,208
I can't keep going like this!

215
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,708
[grunts]

216
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,958
I knew it.

217
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm just not strong enough.

218
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,166
[TOR]
I'm impressed.

219
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
Huh?

220
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,958
Pushing me back
the way that you did.

221
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,625
That's pretty incredible.

222
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,791
Nice job.

223
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,750
Yeah? You really think so?

224
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,083
I do.

225
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,291
There's no letting my
guard down around you now.

226
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,625
And I'll have to train harder.

227
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,458
I will, too!

228
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,416
Just you wait, you'll see!

229
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,333
I'll get stronger and
stronger till I can--

230
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,416
[sighs]

231
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,458
That's right.

232
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,958
We'll both work hard.

233
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
Sound good?

234
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
Huh? Mm.

235
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,250
So this is you
with your gloves off.

236
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,250
You're good, but I refuse
to lose this fight!

237
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,416
It's not over!

238
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,416
And that's checkmate.

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,166
Did you actually see
that last attack

240
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
that came from behind you?

241
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,958
Yeah.

242
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,666
I know that you're
very powerful,

243
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,083
so I have to stay
as alert as I can.

244
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,333
You win this round, Julie.

245
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,333
We both did our best.

246
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,291
Yeah. We sure did!

247
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,916
The Novgladius isn't
quite over yet.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,916
Looks like we have enough
time for one more match.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,166
I'd like a go at Tora
and his partner.

250
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,333
[distant screaming]

251
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,750
Tora!

252
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,041
Tatsu!

253
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,208
Are you both okay?

254
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,916
[WOMAN]
Mr. Kokonoe.

255
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,541
Oh, Miss Tsukimi!

256
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,083
What in the world
happened to these two guys?

257
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,708
I don't know. We just
got here ourselves.

258
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,958
They need medical
attention immediately.

259
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,791
Tora! Can you hear me?

260
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,916
Tora!

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
It's a trap,
you have get out of here.

262
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,708
A trap?

263
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,625
It was her,

264
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,291
behind you.

265
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,041
[evil laughter]

266
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,416
Yaaaaah!

267
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
You know, it's a good thing
you guys are so quick,

268
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,125
because if you'd been
a split-second slower,

269
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,250
my Blaze would have
chopped you right in half!

270
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
Why are you doing this?

271
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,500
I don't get it!

272
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,208
You haven't figured it out yet?

273
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,000
I attacked you
because I'm the one

274
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,166
who took out these
two cretins here.

275
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,541
No way.

276
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,666
Tor, do you have any injuries?
You should check.

277
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,541
Right. [grunts]

278
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,791
You cut me.

279
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,375
How's this possible?

280
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,625
[chuckles]

281
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,708
You know what doesn't
make any sense to me?

282
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,125
These weapons could
smash through a brick wall

283
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,458
and yet, they don't seem
to do any harm to humans.

284
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,958
Blaze power is just the physical
manifestation of one's soul,

285
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,416
and, as we all know,

286
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,625
one's mental attitude can
shift in a variety of ways!

287
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,083
Your reactions are
truly impressive.

288
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,000
So you're saying if you wield
a Blaze with deadly intent,

289
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,583
that it can actually be used
to injure your opponent?

290
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,750
Looks like you're finally

291
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583
starting to catch on,
Silverlocks!

292
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,500
[grunting]

293
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,416
Lesson one! 'Kay?

294
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
You can in fact use your Blaze
to hurt or even kill someone.

295
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,041
But this information
is super classified,

296
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,916
so you're gonna have
to keep it to yourselves!

297
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,416
And now for tonight's
second lesson.

298
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,750
We'll find out what happens when
someone's Blaze is destroyed!

299
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,291
[groaning]

300
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,625
[screaming]

301
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,500
Tora!

302
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,750
As you can see here,

303
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,333
His psyche takes enough damage

304
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,541
to keep him knocked out
for at least a day.

305
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
But if you stop
and think about it,

306
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,541
things could be
a whole lot worse

307
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,375
considering his spirit has been
pretty much annihilated.

308
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,625
You monster.

309
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,125
Why would you do that to him?

310
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,875
This is all in a day's work.

311
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,125
I guess you could think of it
as my own special way of

312
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,000
dealing with some of our
most promising newcomers.

313
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,250
Enough talk. I say we get
back to the business at hand.

314
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,666
[laughs]

315
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,166
It's time for you to die.

316
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,333
Above us! Tor!

317
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,250
[grunting]

318
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,958
[RITO shouting]

319
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:49,916
[whimpers]

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,291
Too slow!

321
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,958
[yelps]

322
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,583
Too bad, so sad!

323
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,208
Come on, put your back into it

324
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,166
since you're fighting
for your life and all!

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,166
[groans]

326
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
Pathetic.

327
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,875
This was even easier than
I thought it was going to be!

328
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,291
[screams]

329
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,416
Looks like it's
game over for you!

330
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,708
Julie.

331
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you all right?

332
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,083
Yeah.

333
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,125
Do you think now is
really the time

334
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,125
to worry about anyone
but yourself?

335
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,833
[groaning]

336
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,833
You're trying your best,
but it's not good enough.

337
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,791
You're going to die
because you're weak!

338
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,416
She only died
because she was too weak.

339
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,125
[growling]

340
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,666
Shut up!

341
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,541
Yah!

342
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,625
[gasps]

343
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
Oh, goodness!

344
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,250
If only that had
connected, am I right?

345
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,166
It's the time between attacks
that's really killing you!

346
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,000
[laughs maniacally]

347
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,458
[growls]

348
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,250
[TOR groans]

349
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,750
Are you okay, Tor?

350
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,666
[TOR grunts]

351
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,500
But she's definitely a
whole lot stronger than me.

352
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,916
And she's also a whole
lot faster than me.

353
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,916
All we need is one opportunity.

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,750
We could take her down if we
just landed a single solid hit.

355
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't think there's any way
we're gonna get that lucky.

356
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,833
What, Tor?

357
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,375
So!

358
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,666
Have you decided which
one of you will die first?

359
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,375
Nej. I'll protect Tor
no matter what!

360
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Ha! You two make
such an adorable young Duo.

361
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,250
It's hard-working students like
you who make your teacher proud!

362
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,333
Tor!

363
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,000
If you want to get to her,

364
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,416
you're gonna have
to go through me!

365
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,625
Ha! Fine with me,
you irregular freak!

366
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,083
If you want to be the first
to die, then so be it!

367
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,083
[grunting]

368
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,583
Take that!

369
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,625
And that! And that!

370
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,125
You can't do this alone!

371
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,166
Stay back!

372
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,833
I can handle this!

373
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,291
Let me help!

374
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,958
Guess what? You can swing
that sword of yours all day,

375
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,708
but it's never going
to dent my shield!

376
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,125
Bluffing isn't going to do
you any good here!

377
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,416
You were tenacious,
I gotta give you that,

378
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
but I'm afraid this is where
you bid your life farewell.

379
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,833
If you've got
any witty last words,

380
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,625
then now is the time
to say them.

381
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,583
[laughs maniacally]

382
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,916
All right.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,916
I think there's only
one thing left to say and...

384
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,625
It's Julie, I...

385
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,958
[laughs]
Hang on!

386
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,708
You're confessing
your love for her now?

387
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
You guys are a barrel of laughs.

388
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,208
But the real fun will be
cutting you into ribbons!

389
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,583
Hiyaaah!

390
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,416
What?

391
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,958
Okay, Tor, take two!

392
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,291
[yelling]

393
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,291
You're still far too slow!

394
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,041
My Blaze? You can't!

395
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,833
Thanks for
all the lessons, Professor!

396
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,416
Now it's time to smash it.

397
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,791
Mjolnir!

398
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,166
[RITO screaming]

399
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,916
Let's toast to our
Novgladius victory.

400
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Yeah.

401
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,083
Ow, ow, ow.

402
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,625
Julie,

403
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,125
you did a heck of a job jumping
in for that last combination.

404
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,916
Thanks to you,
I could focus long enough

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,291
to make that attack count.

406
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,875
I really appreciate it.

407
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,750
We did practice the "I, two"
combo over and over again.

408
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,125
Thing is,

409
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,250
Only you would realize
in all that craziness

410
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,875
that you had the power to
destroy Miss Tsukimi's Blaze.

411
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,625
Well. With Tora
and Tatsu both safe,

412
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,250
and Tsukimi apprehended,

413
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,125
I think we're all right for now.

414
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,708
Except.

415
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,250
Why would she say that
it's "all in a day's work"?

416
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,458
What do you think
she meant by that?

417
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,541
Mm.

418
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
Not that you'd know
anything about it.

419
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,666
The best thing
we can do right now

420
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,208
is focus on tending
to your wounds.

421
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
Yeah. Right.

422
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,125
[groans]

423
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,916
How about I help
you out a little?

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,083
[BOTH grunting]

425
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,458
Oh no, I'm so sorry, Tor.

426
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,416
We brought some
food for you guys.

427
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Hungry?

428
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,708
Are you feeling
any better today, Tor?

429
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,125
Uh...

430
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,750
What? No, not again!

431
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,458
Tor, you lousy, no-good dog!

432
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,875
This isn't what it
looks like, I swear!

433
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,791
Deep down inside
I knew it all along!

434
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,291
Knew what all along?

435
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,166
Tell them
what happened, Julie!

436
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,875
Hmm?

437
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,875
[flames roaring]

438
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,125
[gasps]

439
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,291
What happened?

440
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,333
She only died
because she was too weak.

441
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,333
[screaming]

442
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,125
[gasps]

443
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,833
What's wrong, Tor?

444
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,375
I'm so sorry.

445
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,916
I was just having
a bad dream, that's all.

446
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,750
I'm going to go outside
and get some fresh air.

447
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,708
Why don't you go
back to sleep, okay?

448
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:51,583
Mm.

449
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,541
[JULIE]
Who's Otoha?

450
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,791
You kept repeating,
"Otoha, why?"

451
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,875
So, Tor.
Who is that?

452
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,375
Tell me.

453
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,125
Don't worry about it.

454
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,750
No, tell me.
I want to know.

455
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,250
Forget about it, okay?

456
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,125
I won't forgive you
if you don't, Tor.

457
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,458
I said drop it!

458
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,166
Is that the real reason
you're doing all of this?

459
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,000
Is that why you
took the Lukifer?

460
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,666
And the Blaze?

461
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,166
Julie?

462
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,583
What are you doing?

463
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,041
[gasps]

464
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,416
Don't you see that
I'm just like you?

465
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,625
I'm an Avenger.

466
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,750
[MIYABI]
Hey, Julie.

467
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,291
Have you heard about the new
transfer student from England?

468
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,666
[JULIE]
Nej. Nej, sorry. No time.

469
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,125
[MIYABI]
Is something wrong?

470
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,166
[JULIE] Tomorrow I'm
going shopping with Tor.

471
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,208
[MIYABI gasps]

472
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,208
[JULIE]
Next time: "Exception."

473
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,750
[MIYABI]
That sounds like a date to me!
