Miyabi.

00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,708
I wonder what could
have happened to her.

3
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,833
Let's go look for her
one more time. Okay?

4
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,750
Uh, yeah.

5
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,541
I need your attention, class!

00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,791
Hello!

7
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,208
Our super-fun seaside
camp has come to an end,

8
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,041
so now we're heading back!

9
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,833
No, I'm not leaving!

10
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,125
Not until I've found Miyabi!

11
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,916
Oh, my, how rebellious!

Defying the orders
of your teacher

13
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,500
and the headmistress as well?

14
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,375
Even if we allowed
you to stay behind,

15
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,583
you couldn't do much!

16
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,166
Wait, but you can't just--

17
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,166
I can and will, so shut it.

00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,458
Of course,

00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,041
There's not much I could
do, either, silly me!

00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:43,791
Oh, Tor.

00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,083
Hyah!

[BOTH grunting]

26
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,500
We'll take over the search
from here, 'kay, Tor?

27
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,500
And don't worry.
We'll find Miyabi.

[TOR thinking]
That was days ago.

29
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,583
And still no word about
Miyabi being found yet.

Well, go figure.

34
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,416
It seems Tor's more upset
about Miyabi being missing

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,250
than even Tomoe is.

36
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,041

in embarrassing positions?

Good morning, Lilith.

It's so nice that my future

To be honest,

Oh, drat!

Well, I don't mind.
At least you recognize my voice!

Ja, correct, Tor.

Well, perhaps. But that
still remains to be seen.

going to get any smaller.

I wonder how it could
have turned out.

No, please just let me do this.

you here for one reason.

As a token of my

I was only one half
of the rescue team.

Julie was the other half.

150
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,416
It took the both of us
together to pull it off.

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
So then why am I
the only one who's here?

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,958
Hmm.

153
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,916

and not do it for Julie?

157
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,583
Just what is there
to hesitate about?

You, of all people, want
more power, don't you?

00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,250
Isn't that why you came to
the Academy in the first place?

With power, you could have
been able to avert a tragedy.

but I don't think I can do this.

168
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,250
Then let's do this, Tor.

169
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,166
Take it and give it
a little more thought.

170

However, keep in mind
the world waits for no one.

Nor is it so kind to let
you have your way.

Not since it's grown
so dark and full of malice.

You'll know soon enough
since the Academy is

about to host
the Reign Conference.

What is the Reign Conference?

the Master Armorer.

00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,041
Uh.

184
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,833
What's wrong?

185
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,041
[birds chirping]


186
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,458
[RITO]
Well, well, Look who's here.

187
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,041
If it isn't the pride
of the Dorn Agency.

188
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,541
The elite security
force Ethnarchs.

189
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,875
A-ha!

190
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,166
They think they're so special
just because they've graduated

191
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,083
and get to wear
those fancy uniforms!

192
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,791
[KIBITSU] We've been forbidden
from leaving school grounds.

193
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,041
I'm not exactly sure
what's going on here,

194
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,125
but I bet it's something big.

195
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,083
[TATSU grunts]

196
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,791
[fountain flowing]

197
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,875
So now they've
pushed Level 3 students

198
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,500
into serving as security.

199
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,791
Sakuya sure knows how
to use people all right.

200
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,291
Well, actually, that just
goes to show you

201
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,000
how important this meeting is.

202
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,000
Besides,

203
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,125
you could do a lot worse

204
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,333
as far as getting
real-life practice goes.

205
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,000
So stay on your guard, okay?

206
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,000
[MAN]
Just leave everything to us.

207
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,416
Appreciate the help,
but we're on top of things.

208
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,416
Right, so if anything
happens today,

209
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,583
you just let us
handle it. Got it?

210
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,625
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,458
We will. And thanks so much.

212
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,750
[chuckles]

213
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,875
Still.

214
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,958
Ideally, nothing will
happen, of course.

215
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,583
Locked down tight.

216
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,000
I suppose Reign really
is quite the big deal.

217
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,208
It's an invitation to
the Reign Conference.

218
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,625
Isn't it?

219
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,916
Sakuya! How did you know?

220
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,958
[TOR] Lilith!

221
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,083
That's odd.

222
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,958
It's not like you to
leave your post.

223
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:58,958
Not that I mind.

224
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,041
There's something
I want to know.

225
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,125
You might be able to tell me.

226
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,500
Oh, dear.

227
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,625
If you want to know
how I feel about you,

228
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,416
well, I told you that ages ago.

229
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,791
No, it's about Equipment Smith

230
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,833
and the Reign Conference
on campus.

231
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,750
Just what the hell is
going on around here?

232
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,791
That's what I want to know.

233
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,458
I don't know who told you
I knew, but listen up,

234
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,083
because I won't say it again.

235
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,125
Mmph.

236
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,291
[LILITH]
Equipment Smith.

237
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,875
A key member of
a certain nation's

238
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,208
shadowy military organization.

239
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,333
He's also known in some
circles as the "Master Armorer,"

240
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,791
and he put together the
so-called "god-slaying corps,"

241
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,041
the Rebels.

242
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,458
But for what purpose?

243
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,583
To reach the ultimate
goal that he has,

244
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,166
which is Absolute Duo.

245
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,958
Are you serious?

246
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,166
Just like--

247
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,875
You victors. Congratulations.

248
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,750
May you all someday
reach Absolute Duo.

249
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,583
People brought together with
Absolute Duo at their core.

250
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,625
That's Reign.

251
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,500
And now, its members

252
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,000
are all gathered here.

253
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,708
Hey, I hope you didn't mind if
I poured myself a little drink,

254
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
Miss Blaze Diabolica.

255
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,833
I wish I had more to offer.

256
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,875
And please make
yourself at home.

257
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,500
Mister Grave Phantom.

258
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,666
Enchanté.

259
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,041
Pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Diabolica.

260
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,625
Ah, yes, Tempest Judge, is it?

261
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,500
Thank you for coming
and for the rose.

262
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,958
It looks as if you
and Judge are still

263
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,500
like oil and water, aren't you?

264
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,958
Eh, Darkray Disaster?

265
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,708
Like you have to ask.

266
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,916
What a lovely academy you have.

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,416
I so envy you.

268
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,958
I would be very proud

269
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,916
if my country had
a school like this.

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,500
Thank you so much,

271
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,791
Silent Diva.

272
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,666
[door opens]

273
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,666
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,791
Shall we start?

275
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,333
[TOR]
Absolute Duo.

276
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,791
What is it, exactly?

277
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,083
The best way I can describe
it is the final frontier.

278
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,916
Your soul-power's extremes.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,833
Why don't we just
leave it at that?

280
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,875
The final frontier you say?

281
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,708
So then by soul power,

282
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,625
do you mean the extremes
of our Blaze weapons?

283
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,916
That's the reason, isn't it?

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,333
Why we're all gathered here?

285
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,541
Yes, you see, Koryo Academy
was founded for one purpose

286
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,250
and one alone.

287
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,583
To use the Lukifers
inside us to awaken

288
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,708
the power within our souls,

289
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,291
then that, in turn,
would create Exceeds

290
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,916
all in an attempt to help
us reach Absolute Duo.

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,375
Sakuya's path leads there.

292
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,916
That's what she told me.

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,333
[LILITH thinking]
Yes, it does,

294
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,500
but she's trying to
reach it all on her own.

295
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,875
Contrary to everyone else.

296
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,625
And rejecting their help.

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,958
An alliance?

298
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,583
Exactly.

299
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,000
It is enticing, eh?

300
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,333
Gotta admit,
didn't see one that coming.

301
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,375
Oui, très bien!

302
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,833
I, too, am surprised.

303
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,833
To think a member of Reign
would want to team up!

304
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,708
I'm assuming that all of you
know how powerful my Units are.

305
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,041
Imagine what would
happen if they

306
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,000
joined forces with your Exceeds.

307
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,708
Together we would
control a formidable

308
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,708
army to be reckoned with.

309
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,833
So what do you say,
Miss Sakuya?

310
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,791
My answer is no.

311
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,458
Mm?

312
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,916
[chuckles]

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,541
That which I seek and that
which you seek, Mr. Smith,

314
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,500
they both lie down two separate
paths that will never cross.

315
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,000
Their outcomes would
differ as well, naturally.

316
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,250
If I were to join
forces with you,

317
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,000
it would be nothing
but sheer folly.

318
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,375
You stress soul-power here.

319
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,916
Right?

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,125
What passes for training at this
academy is very antiquated.

321
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,500
It's nothing but the impurity
of the everyday, in fact.

322
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,750
Dear me, that method is far
too dull for this old fellow.

323
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
I doubt in your case

324
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,250
that you'll ever be able
to understand it at all.

325
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,375
I'm like my grandfather.

326
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,875
You not only lost to him once,

327
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,333
but you were also cut
out of his organization.

328
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,833
That is how things occurred.

329
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,791
Unless perhaps
I'm somehow mistaken?

330
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
It appears you still
wish to fulfill your ambitions

331
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,166
of days gone by.

332
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,500
Count me out since I have
no interest in the desires

333
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,000
of a pitiful old man.

334
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,083
[MASTER ARMORER laughs]

335
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,208
That's quite harsh!

336
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,541
It's been said your words are
steeped in poison, witch,

337
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,291
but I didn't know
they'd be so toxic.

338
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,333
And,

339
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,208
I won't stand for such rudeness,

340
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,958
or take petty insults such
as yours lightly, so.

341
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,333
How about we settle this?

342
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,416
I suggest we do so
with a little game,

343
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,750
Miss Sakuya.

344
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,875
A game?

345
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
What kind?

346
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,666
One that's easy as pie.

347
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,000
The rules are very simple.

348
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,541
My Rebels will attack
this academy.

349
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,500
And in response, your
Exceeds will try to stop them.

350
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,750
And then, whoever wipes out
the other side first wins.

351
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,208
Why don't we call it
a killing game, yes?

352
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,791
I accept. Let's play.

353
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,958
Then it's decided.

354
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,916
[laughs]

355
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
Tor, um.

356
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,666
Absolute Duo.

357
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,375
To be honest with you,
I'm still not entirely certain

358
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,958
I understand
what it's all about.

359
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,583
But so many people, they end up
getting hurt in its pursuit.

360
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,833
[TOR thinking] It's true that I
did come to the Academy seeking

361
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,125
to get stronger.

362
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,583
But now,

363
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,958
I wonder,

364
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,000
if I should.

365
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,666
Huh?

366
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,083
I guess,

367
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,208
it's like gaining one thing
while losing another.

368
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
But this is reality.
Get used to it.

369
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,958
Doesn't make it any less sad.

370
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
[TOR]
You and Sakuya may be right.

371
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,041
What?

372
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,458
What you've said.

373
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,291
I've actually been thinking
that you two may be right.

374
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,333
But I just

375
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,125
didn't want to admit it.

376
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,458
You silly man.

377
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,166
No, of course you wouldn't.

378
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,916
[jet engines approaching]

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,375
[ALL gasp]

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,916
[ETHNARCH]
Wait, what?

381
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,166
A Rebel attack?

382
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,250
An attack?

383
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,833
It's happening in 10 minutes?

384
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,666
With all due respect, how do
you even know this, sir?

385
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,333
Did you say a killing game?

386
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,291
Oh no, they're here!

387
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,666
Now it's time for
today's feast to begin!

388
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,958
Bring on the bacchanalia
of bloodshed!

389
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,041
Thanks for the invitation.

390
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,875
This should be a lot of fun.

391
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,458
So this is a killing game?

392
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,791
Our dear headmistress
loves playing around with

393
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,791
our lives, doesn't she?

394
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,625
You ready, Julie?

395
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,708
Ja.

396
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,750
It's Miyabi!

397
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,333
Oh, thank goodness!

398
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,208
Wait, hold on!

399
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,458
What, but why?

400
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,500
[gasps]

401
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,875
Guys, watch this.

402
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,541
Miyabi?

403
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
You see?

404
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,833
I'm a whole lot stronger now.

405
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,875
What do you think, Tor?

406
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,708
[MIYABI]
I wanted to be stronger,

407
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,208
so I could catch up to the rest.

408
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,458
So I could stand
before him, too.

409
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,041
And so I could
be true to myself.

410
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,833
[JULIE]
Next time: "Killing Game."

411
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,875
Hey, Tor.
Watch this, okay?
