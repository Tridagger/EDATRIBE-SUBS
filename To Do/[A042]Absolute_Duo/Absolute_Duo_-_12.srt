00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,000
[TOR]
And that's why, Julie.

189
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,083
I'm going to protect you, too!

190
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,416
[groaning]

191
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,666
[screams]

192
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,875
Julie. That's enough.

193
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not dead, see?

194
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,708
I'm alive and right here.

195
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,041
[screaming]

196
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,416
So please.

197
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,250
Come back to me, Julie!

198
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm here, Tor.

199
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,375
I'm glad to have
you back, Julie.

200
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,208
Tor, I could've killed you but

201
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,208
you risked your life.

202
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,916
Like I've told you before
I will always protect you.

203
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,416
Your big brother will always
protect you, okay, Kev?

204
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,458
The strength of your resolve.

205
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,708
There is no such thing!

206
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,000
[growling]

207
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,791
Just give it up.

208
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,250
Continuing's pointless.

209
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,583
You're right.

210
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,125
But everything's
pointless once you've lost.

211
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,708
And that's why I'm going
to kill the both of you!

212
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,208
Because this power

213
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,125
is the only thing
I have left!

214
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,041
Fine, then I will
protect her to the end!

215
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,666
Julie?

216
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,625
No, we'll protect each other.

217
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,041
Because you and I
are Duo partners, Tor.

218
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,250
That's right.

219
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,416
[BOTH]
Now, Aegis Desire!

220
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,125
Time for you to die,

221
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,458
Tor Kokonoe!

222
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,166
Julie Sigtuna!

223
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,166
I've done it!

224
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,250
What? How?

225
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,916
What I give Julie...

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
And what I give to Tor...

227
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,041
[BOTH]
Is protection!

228
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,541
That's impossible!

229
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,375
Where did
this power come from?

230
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,916
[TOR]
That's simple.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Alone, I couldn't defeat you.

232
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,375
But,

233
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,708
by my side I have Julie.

234
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,541
We're friends and partners
bound to each other!

235
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,625
That's what makes us a Duo.

236
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,291
That doesn't matter to me!

237
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,708
I will never lose
to the likes of you!

238
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,958
[yelps]

239
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,375
Julie!

240
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,833
My Blaze, Tor.

241
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,041
Please take it,

242
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,500
and use it with yours!

243
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,416
Gotcha!

244
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,833
[panting]

245
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,000
Yaaaaah!

246
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,000
Hiyaaaaaaaaah!

247
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,875
Ahhhhh!

248
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,833
[BOTH screaming]

249
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,000

Ryan.

250
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,291
[panting]

251
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,250

252
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,166
[laughs weakly]

[birds chirping]

255
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,166
[MIYABI]
I'm sorry!

256
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,250
Uh?

257
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,291
I brought this on you guys.

258
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,291
This is all my fault,

259
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,000
and I'm so sorry!

260
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,375
Uh.

261
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,750
[TOR]
Look.

262
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,125
Why don't we forget it and all
work on getting stronger?

263
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,375
Yeah, we will!

264
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,583
And you know why?
Because you're my partner!

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,291
And likewise I've got
you as mine, Tomoe!

266
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,291
Miyabi, Tomoe, Tora, Tatsu.

267
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,916
We can do this together!

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,458
[ALL]
Yeah!

269
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,416
[RITO] Would you damn pests quit
following me around already?

270
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,125
[STUDENTS]
Wait up!

271
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,250
Dark Professor Bunbun, please!

272
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,875
[RITO] Leave me alone
or I'll have you brats

273
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,208
--running laps for days!
--Whoa, what's up with them?

274
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,375
Tsukimi defended the dorms
so now she's their hero.

275
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,500
[TATSU grunts]

276
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,708
Oh.

277
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,166
Okay.

278
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
[birds chirping]

279
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,000
[LILITH]
Here you go.

280
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
It's a gift for you, Tor.

281
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,875
Thanks, but what is it?

282
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,291
[LILITH] Materials
on Kevin Wayfair.

283
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,875
He was the young man
who we knew only as "K."

284
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,125
[gasps]

285
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,291
It turns out, he once
had an older brother.

286
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,333
One he was very close to
but also lost quite suddenly.

287
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,083
K's family then fell apart,

288
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,791
and as for himself, he
wound up in the shadows,

289
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,000
sold off into that
old man's organization.

290
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,416
He not only lost his brother,

291
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,666
but also his family
and his name.

292
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,208
Smith raised him
as a soldier who

293
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,250
sought only power and results.

294
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,333
That's the long and short of K.

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,083
[TOR]
So why would you give me this?

296
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,250
[LILITH] Well, I thought you
might be a little bit curious.

297
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,458
Thanks for thinking
of me, Lilith.

298
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,208
Don't mention it.
You are my future husband.

299
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,833
[TOR chuckles]

300
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,583
Oh, and about the other thing
that's been concerning you.

301
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,625
Huh?

302
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,458
I heard she left
the hospital today.

303
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,041
I've gotta go!

304
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,041
[sighs]

305
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,541
To be honest, Tor.

306
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,541
I can't say I like that
reaction of yours.

307
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,541
[gasps]

308
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,625
[exhales]

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,333
Mm.

310
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,666
However, I know you haven't
seen her all this time.

311
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,166
So I suppose I'll
allow it for today.

312
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,916
Off you go!
Spit spot!

313
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,791
Again, Lilith.
Thank you!

314
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,125
You're being incredibly
kind to Tor, you know,

315
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,166
by letting him see
the file on K like that.

316
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,833
Tor's soul has developed,

317
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,875
and I'd like to see
it do so even further.

318
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,541
And learning why his enemy felt
what he did might fuel that.

319
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,291
Sakuya. You haven't changed.

320
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,708
That's right.

321
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,583
It's so the path
that I'm on now

322
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,458
will one day reach
Absolute Duo, you see.

323
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,708
So, that's why.

324
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,250
[panting]

325
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,291
[uplifting music]

326
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,666
[bells jingling]

327
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,416
[bells jingling]

328
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,125
[bells jingling]

329
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,250
[TOR] Well, can you see
Gimle from here?

330
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,583
[JULIE]
Nej. Unfortunately.

331
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,458
Hey, Tor.

332
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,666
I want to confess that
I'm not an Exceed.

333
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,333
Huh?

334
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,791
The day that Papa was killed.

335
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,375
I did more than just
pray to get stronger.

336
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,791
I begged for it.

337
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,791
And then...

338
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,125
I found myself with fangs.

339
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,125
For the sake of revenge.

340
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,166
By wanting to get stronger I had
awakened the power within me.

341
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,333
So I'm not an Exceed.

342
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,166
What I am is an El Awake.

343
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,625
And what exactly
is an El Awake?

344
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,833
[JULIE] They're certain people
who have power hidden inside.

345
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,583
It's tucked away in
the depths of their souls.

346
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,541
Eventually their
power awakens and

347
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,625
it makes
weapons of their souls.

348
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,416
They are called El Awakes.

349
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,583
[TOR]
Wait a minute.

350
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,250
How is that any
different than an Exceed?

351
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,958
Well, actually, I've heard
that Exceeds are El Awakes,

352
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,333
but the difference
is they've had their

353
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,208
soul-powers
artificially awakened.

354
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,041
I couldn't control the power
when it emerged, it was awful.

355
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,083
But luckily, the Dorn Agency
stepped in and rescued me.

356
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,500
[TOR]
So that's what happened?

357
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,541
[JULIE] I'm sorry I never
told you about this, Tor.

358
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,625
I've been so afraid.

359
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,250
Afraid you'd find out
I wasn't an Exceed.

360
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,916
Afraid that once
you knew everything

361
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,625
about me and what I was,

362
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,541
that you'd drift away and then
I'd never get to see you again.

363
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,541
But more than anything,

364
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,250
I've been afraid that my
power would hurt you,

365
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,333
or worse, possibly
even kill you.

366
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,916

Julie.

367
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,666
[JULIE]
Even so,

368
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,583
Tor, I still--

369
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,416
I want be with you!

370
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,708
And be your Duo partner!

371
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,375
I can't help it!
I'm sorry!

372
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,416
[cries]

373
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,083
I need to apologize
to you as well.

374
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,500
Huh?

375
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,083
After I first saw your true
power back on K's boat,

376
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,375
I told myself,

377
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,333
"I can't let her use
that thing again."

378
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,375
Using it hurt you bad,
so doing it again

379
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,625
was out of the question.

380
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,375
But I went and let
you do just that.

381
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,250
And by doing so, it's my fault
you got hurt once more.

382
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,875
[JULIE]
No, it's not!

383
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:48,958
[TOR]
It's all right.

384
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,166
Just watch.
I'm gonna get stronger.

385
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,958
Strong enough to really protect
you when you need it. I promise.

386
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,625
Listen to me, Julie.

387
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,250
I want you

388
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,041
to keep being my Duo.

389
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,583
[TOR and JULIE]
Blaze on!

390
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,875
[BOTH] We two shall
remain together always,

391
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,458
and do everything as a Duo,

392
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,250
to the best of our ability.

393
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,625
In joy and sorrow.

394
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,208
In sickness and in health,

395
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,583
until death do us part.

396
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,916
We are a Duo,

397
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,541
now and forever.
