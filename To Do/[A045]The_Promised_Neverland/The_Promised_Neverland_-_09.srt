make string telephones

209
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,791

210

from camera parts?

from the rewards I got from mom

214
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,670

216

was the strobe.

these parts for six years,

218

wouldn’t figure it out.

219

222
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,655
and had to do it,

223
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,190

227

228

wouldn’t have realized it.

234

Emma: Uh-uh.

235
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,790
Ray: When most people
reach a certain age,

236
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,726
they don’t have any memories
from being a baby.

237
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,728
That’s infantile amnesia.

238

- ( Norman gasps )
- Ray: But, in some cases,

239

memories
from inside of the womb.

243

- ( Both gasp )
- Ray: Some of my memories

244
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,010
didn’t match
with what i’d been told.

245
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,711
That’s how I knew.

246
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,850
my first memory
is being in a dark liquid.

247
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,686
I could hear a lullaby
from somewhere.

248
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,723
Emma: Do you remember a lot,

249
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,924
or is it hazy?

250
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,992
Ray: All of it’s in fragments,

251
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,895
but in high detail...

252
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,931
Demons’s faces

253
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,834
and how there were
other babies there.

254
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,036
They implanted the trackers,

255
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,873
and then we were divided
into batches of five.

256
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,241
Norman: Five?

257
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,742
Ray: After that,

258
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,979
I went through a tunnel
and was here.

259
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,914
Norman: The tunnel
being the gate?

260
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,316

- Norman: Wait.

261
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,852

262

264

the adjacent five plants.

265
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,993
those are
what make up this house.

266
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,295

what krone said was true,

267

271

there’s not
just a few guards out there.

272
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,073

273

Emma: Isn’t that bad, though?

274
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,513
Ray: Not quite. Because of that,
the security is pretty thin.

275
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,815
Their main focus
will be on the gate,

276
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,483
so we won’t have to worry much.

277
