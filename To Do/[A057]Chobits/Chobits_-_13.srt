1
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,166
It's almost summer time.

2
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,633
This is going to
be my 18th summer.

3
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,333
But for a guy like me
who didn't get into college,

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,333
it doesn't matter
if it's summer or not.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,266
Studies come first,
studies come second,

6
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,033
and that's pretty
much all there is.

7
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,600
Hmm.

8
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,833
Your grades don't seem

9
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,666
to show much improvement at all.

10
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,333
I-I'm sorry.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, don't be so glum about it.

12
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:29,866
It's all right.

13
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,500
If you really apply
yourself this summer,

14
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,066
I'm sure you'll
be quite surprised

15
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,566
with the results by the
time fall rolls around.

16
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,366
Uh, do you really think so?

17
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,466
You'll be fine.

18
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,566
That's true, isn't it?

19
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:41,400
They say that summer's

20
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,966
when everything gets decided!

21
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,200
So I'll do the best I can!

22
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,600
That's right, Motosuwa,
do your best!

23
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,200
You bet I will!

24
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:24,700
Senpai!

25
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,733
Uh, Yumi, wha-

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,933
So tell me: what do
you think of my swimsuit?

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,700
I bought it just for today!

28
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,733
It, yeah, it looks great on you!

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,700
It really does.

30
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,900
Isn't it wonderful...

31
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,133
that it's so nice out today?

32
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,633
Oh, ah, Miss Shimizu...

33
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,266
Okay, we're ready.

34
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,266
I'm all done helping
Chi get dressed.

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,966
Miss Hibiya!

36
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,266
Chi.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,633
Hideki!

38
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,166
Hideki!

39
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,866
Chi!

40
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,700
So then, maybe I really
am here at the beach.

41
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,133
Senpai!

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,533
Is it all right for me
to be here right now?

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,100
Since I just got a D on
the practice exam...

44
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,733
...and with no money
or time to spare...

45
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,466
That's right,
Motosuwa, do your best!

46
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,633
You bet!

47
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,266
Okay then, that's great.

48
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,766
See you at the
beach this weekend!

49
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,066
Huh?

50
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,300
The beach. It was Shinbo's idea.

51
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,433
You've heard about it, right?

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,533
Huh?

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,566
Three days and two nights?

54
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,366
That's right.

55
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,266
You wouldn't want
to miss a chance

56
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,600
to go to the beach, would you?

57
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,433
No, but why does it
have to be so long?

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,733
I don't have that
kind of money...

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,233
Okay, just hear me out.

60
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,066
You know Kokubunji.

61
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,066
He goes to his private beach
about this time every year.

62
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,766
We just happened to get a chance

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,500
to tag along with him this time.

64
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,400
So that means it's free.

65
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,733
It's free?

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,766
We can't do those
kind of things;

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,566
we're not college students yet.

68
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,633
There's no time to
run off to the beach.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,266
Uh, Mr. Motosuwa?

70
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,300
Y-Yes?

71
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,266
I thought this might be
a good swimsuit for Chi,

72
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,266
if you need one.

73
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,233
It's one of my old ones,
and it should be fine.

74
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,266
Huh?

75
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,400
Yeah I invited our
landlord while I was at it.

76
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,000
And also what's-her-name, Yumi?

77
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,900
Everybody told me that
they're gonna be coming.

78
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,166
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

79
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh dear, Mr. Motosuwa,

80
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,800
you're really not
that busy, are you?

81
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,233
Oh no, that's not what I...

82
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,966
it's nothing like that. I just-

83
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,966
Chi?

84
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,800
Just make it through the
summer, entrance exam loser.

85
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,300
Am I gonna be alright?

86
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,800
Motosuwa, this girl's
your Persocom, right?

87
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,233
Oh, uh, yeah.

88
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,333
Chi, I think it's time

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,666
you said hello to Yumi
and Miss Shimizu.

90
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:54,933
Good evening.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,366
Oh no, so close.

92
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,200
It's afternoon now, right?

93
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,933
What's the greeting
for afternoon, Chi?

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,766
Chi?

95
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,200
Good afternoon.

96
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,733
Good afternoon to you.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,866
That was perfect Chi;
I'm proud of you.

98
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,333
That's a cute
Persocom you've got.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,033
It's nice to finally
get to meet you, Chi.

100
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,666
Chi.

101
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,433
Hey, Motosuwa!

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,633
Come on, hurry up and
get your swimsuit on!

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,433
Do you plan to
stand around all day?

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
We're gonna run out of
time to play you know;

105
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,333
you don't think
the sun's gonna wait.

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Go get Mr. Motosuwa.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,366
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

108
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,333
Chi?

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,366
One, two, three, four, two, two,

110
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,733
three, four, three,
two, three four.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,966
Lots of water.

112
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,633
Yeah. This is called the ocean.

113
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,166
Ocean?

114
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,566
Right.

115
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,266
Ocean.

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Okay, I know!

117
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,400
Is everybody ready to go
take a dip in the ocean?

118
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,733
Sure!

119
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, do be careful;

120
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,433
the water can get very deep
quite suddenly around here.

121
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,833
We will!

122
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,100
Wow, look at him;

123
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,533
he's just like a
great big puppy.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,266
Well, it's a good
opportunity, I'd say.

125
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's go have some fun.

126
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,100
It's so salty!

127
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:43,966
You got splashed

128
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,100
because you were
looking the other way!

129
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,133
Salty?

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,300
That's right.

131
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,733
It's not like regular water;
ocean water is real salty.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,233
Salty water.

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
By the way,
I wonder if it's safe'

134
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,233
for Persocoms to be immersed

135
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,100
in sea water like this.

136
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Chi?

137
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,233
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that;

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Persocoms are
definitely waterproof

139
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,000
for everyday life.

140
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,800
Oh, I see, that's true.

141
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,233
So you're even a nice guy

142
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,400
to a Persocom,
aren't you, Senpai?

143
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:18,733
Huh?

144
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:21,833
Gotcha!

145
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,566
You little rat!
Take this! And that!

146
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,566
I'll getcha!

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,466
Hey, I know, why don't
we all swim over there?

148
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,833
Yeah, that sounds
great! Let's go!

149
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm... well, I think
I'll pass on that.

150
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,400
I can't swim.

151
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,300
Oh please, come on.

152
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,333
No, I'm not kidding, it's true.

153
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,333
Well, I'm not gonna try

154
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,933
and force you or anything,

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,533
but, Motosuwa, I'm not
gonna let you go at night.

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,500
At night; why's that?

157
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,500
What's that supposed to mean?

158
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,900
We'll have a private lesson.

159
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:59,766
In my room tonight.

160
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,366
Be ready for it.

161
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,900
You bet I will!

162
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,366
Wow, for you to
have your own resort

163
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:16,533
at a place like this...

164
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
...you must really have quite

165
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,533
an amazing family, Minoru.

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,266
That's not necessarily true.

167
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,066
Well, after all, I mean,

168
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,700
this is what you call
a private beach, right?

169
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,900
Actually, not.

170
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,466
It's just that
nobody else is here

171
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,133
at the moment, that's all.

172
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,133
There.

173
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,666
I'm all done with the checkup.

174
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,033
Right.

175
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,166
Well, you know,

176
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,600
maybe we are getting in
your way a bit with all this?

177
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,766
What do you mean?

178
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,266
Well, you know:

179
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,066
a bunch of us being
so rowdy and all.

180
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,200
Well, it's true
that you're rowdy.

181
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:49,500
It really is quite lively
this year, Lord Minoru.

182
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,433
That's true.

183
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,533
Then again, it's rather nice

184
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,266
to have people around
every once in a while.

185
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, I see.

186
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,566
Hey!

187
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,533
You didn't come to the beach

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
to sit and read, did you?

189
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,500
Play time! Play time!

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,866
Shall we?

191
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:13,800
Here it comes!

192
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,133
Here we go! Try this one!

193
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,300
Here!

194
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,800
Here it comes, Chi!

195
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,966
Do your best!

196
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,766
A ball. Hideki gave me a ball.

197
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,000
Time to eat!

198
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,133
Mmm!

199
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,566
Chi.

200
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,433
All right! Here we go!

201
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,833
Here we go!

202
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,700
I guess this must be
what you call happiness.

203
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,800
Yeah, well you hafta admit

204
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:14,800
it did help clear your mind.

205
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,866
Yep.

206
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,033
But don't think for
a minute it means

207
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,133
that I've lost the will
to study or anything.

208
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
I said I'd spend
the summer studying,

209
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,966
and nothing can stop me!

210
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,400
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,200
I lose again!

212
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:31,933
Hey, why don't we play
a little poker next?

213
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,466
Let me think:

214
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,633
I'm pretty sure Miss Shimizu's
room was one of these,

215
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,633
but which one could it be?

216
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh... This is it.

217
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,166
We'll have a private lesson
in my room tonight.

218
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,133
A lesson at night?

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,566
A special summer memory,

220
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,266
or something along those lines?

221
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,933
Yes?

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,700
Um, it's Motosuwa.

223
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,866
Oh, hi, the door's open.
Come on in.

224
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,200
O-Okay.

225
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,500
Something wrong?
Please, come in.

226
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,033
Hm?

227
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,066
Um, here I come.

228
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:29,733
Is everyone here now?

229
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,133
Huh?

230
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,533
Hey!

231
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Huh?

232
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,700
Hm?

233
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,966
Very good, then we
can start our class now.

234
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,500
Right.

235
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,000
Good morning!

236
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,266
Oh, so you finally got up?

237
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,333
You should use
some of this. Here.

238
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,266
What's this stuff?

239
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,333
Anti-oxidation cream;

240
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
you're supposed to use
it on your Persocom.

241
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,100
Huh?

242
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,900
Ocean breezes, seawater,

243
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:05,866
and sand are the sworn enemies

244
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,100
of delicate electronic
equipment like her.

245
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,566
I highly recommend it.

246
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,700
But wait, they're waterproof

247
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,600
for everyday life, right?

248
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,566
Yes, that's definitely true,

249
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:18,100
but you're still much better off
taking good care of them.

250
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,233
Besides, all you
have to do is to rub it

251
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,800
all over their bodies,
so it's really not that hard.

252
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,933
Oh, I see...
All over their bodies.

253
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,166
Chi?

254
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,166
You mean I do it?

255
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,166
I hafta rub it all over Chi?

256
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,433
Three... two... one.

257
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:33,700
Chi?

258
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,133
Ah! I can't!

259
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,733
There's just no way I can do it!

260
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,666
Yes, well, I suppose you could

261
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,233
teach her to do it herself.

262
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Yeah!

263
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,933
Good idea!

264
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,533
Good morning, everybody!

265
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,300
Good morning, Yumi.

266
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,966
What's going on down there?

267
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,933
Let's see... All right, Chi.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,400
First off, you squeeze out
a little cream like this...

269
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,566
Ah! No, don't do it like that.

270
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:01,400
Chi?

271
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,666
Mr. Motosuwa!

272
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,100
Would you like me to come down
and give you a hand with that?

273
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,233
Great! If you
wouldn't mind, that is.

274
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Just wait here
for a minute, okay?

275
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,033
Splash splash,
splash splash. Whoa!

276
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,833
Splash splash.

277
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,100
Nice setup!

278
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:21,466
Chi!

279
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,300
Spike it!

280
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,500
Yeah!

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,933
Here!

282
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,333
Hideki, what is this?

283
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,066
Hm? What's what?

284
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,200
Oh, that's a seashell, Chi.

285
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,866
Seashell.

286
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,433
So, what's that?

287
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,400
Oh that? That's another shell.

288
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,733
Shell.

289
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:51,833
Is this, too?

290
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
That's right. Huh?

291
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,633
A walking shell?

292
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,766
N-No, it isn't, it's...

293
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,766
It's, um on the
tip of my tongue;

294
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,666
it's something like uh...

295
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,333
A hermit crab.

296
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,466
They're called hermit
crabs, Motosuwa.

297
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,800
Oh!, That's right!

298
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,033
Hermit crabs!, They're
called hermit crabs, Chi.

299
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,333
Hermit crabs.

300
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,466
So, have you been
teaching her new words?

301
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,000
As a matter of fact, yes.

302
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,566
There's so many
things she's never seen,

303
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,666
so I try to spend as much time
as I can explaining them to her.

304
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,866
Hideki, what's this?

305
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:24,433
Let's see, is it kelp?

306
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,133
Or "wakame"? Or "mozuku"?

307
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,833
Why not just say seaweed?

308
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
Good idea. Seaweed.

309
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:30,633
It's seaweed, Chi!

310
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,666
Seaweed, this is seaweed.

311
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,166
Chi.

312
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,400
So, what's that?

313
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,866
Hey, wait a second, Chi.

314
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,666
Hideki, what's that?

315
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,633
I'd be more than happy
to help, if you need any.

316
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,533
Uh, yes, please;
that'd be great.

317
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm sleepy.

318
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,900
I think I'll take a nap.

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,766
Hideki...

320
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,800
Huh?

321
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,066
What's that?

322
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,166
Huh?

323
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,733
They're dolphins!

324
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,333
Oh my gosh,
those are real dolphins!

325
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,500
Wow, Chi!

326
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:32,233
I'm so impressed that you
noticed them; that's great!

327
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,433
Chi?

328
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,266
Hey guys, look:

329
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,966
it's a whole buncha Dolphins!

330
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,300
Oh sure, you see
them around here

331
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,400
from time to time.

332
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,466
I had no idea.
That's really cool!

333
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,500
I've seen 'em on TV a few times,
but never anything like this!

334
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:45,866
They're beautiful, aren't they?

335
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,666
Wow, so does that mean

336
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,866
they live around here?

337
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:49,833
They're pretty far away,

338
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,333
but we saw 'em, didn't we?

339
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,533
They're really far out there.

340
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,933
I wish we could
get a closer look.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,200
I wonder if they'll
get any closer than that?

342
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,500
Closer?

343
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,433
But they mustn't do that;
if they come into the bay,

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,566
I don't think they'll
be able to get back out.

345
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,033
I see what you mean.

346
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,066
Yeah, but you just don't

347
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,500
get a chance like
this every day.

348
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,933
I'd like to get closer too.

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,433
Mmm hmm.

350
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,800
Okay, then let's just
swim out to where they are.

351
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,000
They can't be that
far out, can they?

352
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,166
S-Senpai?

353
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,600
Yesterday, when you told us

354
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,233
that you didn't
know how to swim,

355
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,333
you really weren't kidding
about that, were you?

356
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,166
No, I wouldn't joke
about anything like that.

357
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,033
Yeah, but still,

358
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
you can do something really easy

359
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,500
like the breaststroke, right?

360
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,733
For real?

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,733
For real?

362
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,766
Yes, well don't let
that bother you;

363
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,800
everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

364
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,900
Yeah, that's right, Senpai!

365
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:41,633
There's a bright side,

366
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,066
just so you don't get depressed.

367
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,633
You'll be happy to
know there's no swimming

368
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,766
on the entrance exam.

369
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,166
Hideki cannot swim.

370
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,766
Is that amazing? Is he amazing?

371
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,300
Dolphins...

372
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,566
They're right in
front of my eyes.

373
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:59,100
Well, I guess I have no choice.

374
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,766
Amazing! His very
own personal boat.

375
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,466
Yep, it's something, all right.

376
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:14,700
You know, it's
starting to bug me.

377
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,000
Isn't it a little unfair

378
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,700
for one person
to have everything?

379
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,666
It doesn't seem right, does it?

380
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,400
Look at that!

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,866
This is the best place to be

382
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,533
if you want to go
dolphin watching.

383
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,133
Look at that!

384
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,133
Did you see that, Chi?

385
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,933
Hideki, is it fun to
watch dolphin splashing?

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,333
Of course it is!

387
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,366
Wow, cool!

388
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,966
Amazing!

389
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,966
Wow, look how awesome they are.

390
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,166
Splashing.

391
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,733
It's fun.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,133
Chi will splash, too.

393
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,466
Miss Chi!

394
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,633
Chi?

395
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,866
Oh, no!

396
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:32,533
Chi!

397
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,466
What? Where'd she go?

398
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,100
Motosuwa, you gotta save her!

399
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,700
Huh?

400
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:37,633
But she's supposed

401
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,000
to be waterproof
enough for everyday life.

402
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,666
Idiot!

403
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,466
What's the matter with you?

404
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:41,466
This isn't "everyday life"!

405
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:42,833
This water's really deep!

406
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,400
Chi.

407
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,600
Motosuwa!

408
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,133
Senpai! I thought
you couldn't swim!

409
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,466
Where am I?

410
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,133
Kokubunji's resort house.

411
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,833
Geez, Senpai, don't go
doing things like that, okay?

412
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,933
That's right.

413
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,166
But it's so like you, Motosuwa,
to try to rescue her

414
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,933
without even thinking about it.

415
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,700
I-I'm sorry.

416
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:00,000
W-Where's Chi?

417
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,833
Hideki.

418
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,633
So then you're all right?

419
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,733
Chi is all right.

420
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,933
It looks like she didn't get
any water inside of her, either.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Is Hideki angry?

422
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,900
Did Chi do something bad?

423
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,166
I'm not angry.

424
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,933
I'm just glad you're all right.

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,500
Chi.

426
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,233
Hideki!

427
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,066
Boy, she certainly is
one peculiar Persocom.

428
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,966
Usually, when they're submerged

429
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,733
in the ocean,
water seeps in somehow,

430
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
and they get all messed up.

431
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:38,766
That's true.

432
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,633
You know, the truth is that

433
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,900
if Chi had been
a normal Persocom,

434
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:45,066
the outcome might've
been very different today.

435
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,233
Yes, that's true.

436
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,166
Huh?

437
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:50,066
What she's getting
at, Mr. Motosuwa,

438
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,133
is that Chi was the
one who saved you.

439
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,266
Huh?

440
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,833
I see. Well, thank you, Chi.

441
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,600
One, two, three, four,
two, two, three, four.

442
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,333
My summer is over.

443
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,633
Studies come first,
studies come second.

444
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,833
Summer's the crucial battle,

445
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
and I look forward
to better grades.

446
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,833
My grades are going down!

447
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,233
Hideki, is summer hot?

448
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,133
Boy is it ever.

449
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,733
Summer's really hot;
your brain gets fuzzy,

450
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,466
and it's hard to get motivated.

451
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,766
Summer means mosquito incense?

452
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,333
That's true.

453
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
The smell of that
incense burning

454
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,500
is the very smell of summer.

455
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,700
Miss Shimizu comes
in the summer?

456
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,066
That's right.

457
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,733
Nothing like Miss Shimizu
in the summer time.

458
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,766
Which means...

459
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,766
Huh?

460
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,433
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Entertains."

461
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,766
My pleasure!

462
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,066
My pleasure.
