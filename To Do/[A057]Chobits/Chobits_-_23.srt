1
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,700
I'm about ready to give up.

2
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,033
I tried everything
I could think of,

3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,933
but all the Chobits entries
are just a bunch of rumors.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,166
Perhaps you could
save your complaints

5
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,566
for some other time.

6
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,966
Lord Minoru,
I'm receiving some mail.

8
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,866
It's from that address again.

9
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,333
Send it over.

10
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,133
This is...

11
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,733
Why are you plugged in?

12
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,933
What are you doing, Kotoko?

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,633
An analysis.

14
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,000
I am programmed to automatically

15
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,933
analyze anything
regarding Persocoms

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
that exceeds
regulatory levels, also,

17
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,966
any anomalies that may arise
from special circumstances.

18
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,533
I see, is that so?!

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,500
Yes.

20
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,766
Well, Sumomo's programmed to...

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,166
Sumomo!

22
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,766
Is programmed to dance
whenever she's on standby!

23
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,100
La la la la la la la la la!

24
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,266
It's just as I thought.

25
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,133
Oh really?

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,633
Whatta ya mean,
"just as you thought"?

27
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
This apartment has a
peculiar type of connection.

28
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,533
It's "peculiar"?!

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Danger, danger!

30
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,833
This is a crisis
situation. Emergency!

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,833
This apartment uses an
ultra-fast internet connection:

32
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,800
even large corporations
aren't allowed to use those.

33
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,500
Hideki?

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,133
Look, look!
An unidentified object!

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,533
Open it; let's examine
the unidentified object!

36
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,066
Chi.

37
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,366
Chi?

38
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,900
I lost the thing that
was most dear to me.

39
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:49,733
A long time ago, something
very bad happened to me.

40
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,800
It still makes my heart ache.

41
00:03:55,866 --> 00:04:00,233
It made me very, very, very sad.

42
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,800
It was very painful.

43
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:07,100
It hurt a lot when
I lost something so dear.

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,066
But, I am searching.

45
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,966
That is why I am searching.

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,366
But, this is...

47
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,000
I just received it.

48
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:24,033
But where's it from?

49
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,566
Well, I'm not completely
sure about the details,

50
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,566
but, uh, after taking
a little time

51
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,300
and going over the
communication log again,

52
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,066
I think I have a rough idea.

53
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,500
So, who is it?

54
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,500
It's the Persocom data bank.

55
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,333
It's the one Yuzuki had been
attempting to hack, remember?

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,700
Data bank?

57
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:40,966
But what do you mean?

58
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,333
Put it this way: your
Persocom's got some kind

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,133
of incredibly valuable
secret deep inside her.

60
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,633
In fact it's gotta be so big

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,400
that even the king
of the Persocoms needs

62
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,266
to get this one out of her now.

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,166
So that would basically mean...

64
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, I'm not so sure about that

65
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,466
from what we know so far.

66
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,533
But if she's not a "chobits,"

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,066
then she's an
exceptional Persocom

68
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,000
who's still very much like one.

69
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,433
Oh , I see.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,333
Yeah, a mysterious
custom-made Persocom.

71
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh! I'm so jealous!

72
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey.

73
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,833
You know, that Persocom is
really way out of your league.

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,966
It seems like a real waste

75
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,500
for some ordinary guy
to have such

76
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,333
a genuine treasure
like that Persocom.

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,133
You have no idea
how extraordinary she-

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Persocom this, Persocom that!

79
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,333
She's got a name, you know;
her name's Chi, okay?!

80
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
So don't just treat
her like some thing!

81
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,433
Yeah, I hear you.

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,100
They're on the move now.

83
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,166
Well, that's to be expected;

84
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:48,533
we certainly gave
them enough clues.

85
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,933
What's the matter?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,966
Oh, nothing.

87
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,166
So, Dita.

88
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,000
Have you ever had any
doubts about this mission?

89
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,233
Not really.

90
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,533
We're here to stop a program
that's dangerous to Persocoms.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,766
Even the logic programs
find no contradictions.

92
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,200
I see.

93
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,066
Then, do you have any
idea what kind of danger

94
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,933
could actually
result if that girl

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,533
should suddenly
activate her program?

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,133
No.

97
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,033
I'm a data bank that carries

98
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,800
all data concerning Persocoms.

99
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,933
And you are a security program
created to protect me.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,333
The two of us are
trying to prevent

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,733
that girl from activating
her true program

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,466
in order to save all Persocoms.

103
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,633
But then,

104
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,200
we don't really
know what will happen

105
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,900
if that girl does
run her program.

106
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,733
Nor do we know if
it's truly dangerous.

107
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,233
What are you trying to say?

108
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,166
I must remind you of something

109
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,400
about the creator
of the Persocoms:

110
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,800
he feels for all
humanoid Persocoms

111
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,933
as if they were his children.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,633
The data in my memory
is quite clear about this:

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,066
parents almost always wish

114
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,600
for the happiness
of their offspring.

115
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,466
So what that girl
possesses might just be

116
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,766
some irresistible
resolve from "him"

117
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,533
for all Persocoms to be happy.

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,266
You mean she isn't dangerous?

119
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,100
I didn't say that.

120
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,433
It's just that happiness

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,733
for Persocoms
may not be conducive

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,533
to happiness for all humans.

123
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,633
I'm not gonna think about it.

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,866
That girl is dangerous.

125
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,733
That's why we're gonna stop her.

126
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,700
All right, everybody.
I'm taking off!

127
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,400
Senpai!

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,300
U-Um, well I... I mean...

129
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,166
Hm?

130
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,000
I just wanted to
thank you for your help.

131
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,633
I really feel so much
better about myself.

132
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,233
And now I can stop
being so worried

133
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,700
about how I compare to anyone.

134
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:52,900
That's great, Yumi.

135
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,133
Give it your best shot.

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,133
I will, Senpai!

137
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
And, you make sure you
keep studying real hard!

138
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,600
You got it!

139
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,366
Well, excuse me,
I have to get back.

140
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,900
Oh, one thing.

141
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:05,966
Huh?

142
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:09,233
Well, I know it's strange
to hear me say this, but

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
I just want to say:
take good care of Chi, okay?

144
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,200
Uh, sure.

145
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,966
Is Chi really a "chobits"?

146
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,633
And if she is, what should I do?

147
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,300
Or more like:
is there anything I can do?

148
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,900
Well, I see you still
talk to yourself too much.

149
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,800
Huh?

150
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,500
Shinbo!

151
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,000
And that's why there's really
nothing I can do for Chi.

152
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:51,733
Well, that is a bit of a pickle.

153
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,333
But I'd say that before you
start worrying about that,

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
there's still a
very big question

155
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,466
that you need to clear up.

156
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,300
The really big
question about Chi is:

157
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,666
do you love her?

158
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:02,800
I don't know.

159
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,100
At least, I'm not
completely sure yet.

160
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,133
But I guess I really do
worry about her an awful lot.

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,166
I see.

162
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,200
But can I ask you
something, Shinbo?

163
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,666
Would you hate someone who
fell in love with a Persocom?

164
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,300
Why would I?

165
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:18,900
Well, you know, I mean
because of Miss Shimizu.

166
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh, that.

167
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,666
I getcha now.

168
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:22,733
Well, when I first heard

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,733
about Takako's husband
going off the deep end

170
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
and dumping her
for some Persocom,

171
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,033
I gotta admit guys
like that made me sick.

172
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,266
But then, after
I really thought about it,

173
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,900
I came to a
different conclusion.

174
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,233
Different?

175
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,266
Yeah.

176
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,600
I started to wonder
what would have

177
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,933
happened if her
husband was involved

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
with a human being.

179
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,933
Would it have really
made any difference

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
if it hadn't been a Persocom?

181
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,766
Would Takako have
been spared any pain?

182
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,266
Would I have been
any less upset?

183
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,833
I didn't dislike guys
who fell in love

184
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,333
with Persocoms; that
really wasn't the problem.

185
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,166
It was guys who took
others for granted,

186
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,566
whether it was a
Persocom or a person.

187
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,066
But, Shinbo.

188
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,766
Wait a sec, you're
not gonna go tell me

189
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,000
that you've got another woman

190
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,366
on your mind, are you buddy?

191
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,833
No, of course not!

192
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,366
Then it's not a problem.

193
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,033
I certainly wouldn't stop ya.

194
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,333
I am me, that's who I am.

195
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,166
And I am it, that's who I am.

196
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,633
I am myself.

197
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,033
I am not human.

198
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,233
But still...

199
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,833
All the more...

200
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,200
to love me because I am me.

201
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:35,166
I can love because that
person is that person.

202
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,166
The One Just for Me.

203
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:41,600
Chi?

204
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,966
Hideki.

205
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,800
Oh, I'm back, Chi.

206
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,400
Welcome back, Hideki.

207
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:50,233
Oh, well I see the place
is still as empty as ever.

208
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,533
Oh! Hey, Sumomo!

209
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,566
Are you doin' all right?

210
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,566
Aye! Sumomo's as
energetic as always!

211
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,500
Do you think the
two of you could stay

212
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,266
with Shinbo for a little while?

213
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,266
Hey, nice to meet you.

214
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,433
Hm, you seem more normal

215
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,100
than Mr. Motosuwa.

216
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,866
It's very nice to meet you.

217
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,033
Excuse me for not being normal.

218
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,933
Well, we'll just be getting out

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,966
of your hair for a little while.

220
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,400
But make sure you take
the time to talk to her.

221
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:52,966
Talk? What should I talk about?

222
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,266
To start with,
I guess I'm not really

223
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,966
all that sure just
how I feel about Chi.

224
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:02,366
Am I really
so confused about this?

225
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,366
Maybe I just haven't
thought it through yet.

226
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,466
Hideki?

227
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,600
Hideki, is something wrong?

228
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,033
Does it hurt somewhere?

229
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,666
Oh, Chi.

230
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,433
Hideki, why are you
holding Chi this way?

231
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,800
I... I don't know, myself.

232
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:33,833
Ugh.

233
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,733
Zima!

234
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,566
What's the matter?!
Another intruder?

235
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:41,666
No, it's just that there
was too much data just now.

236
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,133
Not yet, Dita,
hold off for a minute.

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,366
What are you talking about?!

238
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,666
What's gonna happen to you

239
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,733
if all your data crashes, Zima?!

240
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,766
If I crashed, all I'd have
to do is re-enter the data.

241
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,166
We are Persocoms,
after all, right?

242
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah, that's true, but...

243
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,466
Zima!

244
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,366
That girl!

245
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:05,633
She's around here!

246
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,566
That girl is around
here, isn't she?!

247
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,200
No, Dita.

248
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,466
I've gotta get over there!

249
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,600
This can't wait another minute.

250
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,033
I've gotta stop that program!

251
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,366
Well, the cat's out of the bag,

252
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,666
and there's no
way to stop it now

253
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,433
if the fact is that
I want that girl...

254
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,266
...to be happy.

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,333
Chi?

256
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,266
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,900
Hideki.

258
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,266
Mr. Motosuwa.

259
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,666
Miss Hibiya!

260
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,933
There's something
important I've really

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
wanted to ask you
about, Miss Hibiya.

262
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,600
I know.

263
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,766
Huh?

264
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,366
I think it's time
I told you everything...

265
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,533
about Chi, I mean.

266
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,800
Please.

267
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,400
Thank you.

268
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,600
This way.

269
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,700
Uh...

270
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,100
It's down here.

271
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:36,966
What is this place?

272
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,400
It's something that
my husband made.

273
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,833
In addition to the system
for humanoid Persocoms.

274
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,266
Huh?!

275
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,566
Why do you have
this, Miss Hibiya?

276
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,433
Hey, wait a minute,
isn't that...?!

277
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,100
Yes, you're right.

278
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,933
That's me in the picture.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,233
It was taken quite a while ago;

280
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,100
that was in the lab
where we used to work.

281
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,200
And next to me is Elda.

282
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,966
Elda?

283
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,466
That's right.

284
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,966
You see, back then,
she used to be called Elda.

285
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,833
But at the moment,
she's known as:

286
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,366
Chi.

287
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,866
And there's one more
I must tell you about.

288
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,900
The one called Freya.

289
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:21,300
Huh? What do you mean,
"one more"?

290
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,266
Are you trying to
say this one isn't Chi?

291
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,933
That's right. The two
of them are different.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,300
So...

293
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,700
Allow me to explain.

294
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,266
You see, Elda and Freya
were sort of like children

295
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,033
that my husband made
especially for me.

296
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Cute little girls
that he built for me,

297
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,900
because I wasn't able
to have any children.

298
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,000
The first one to
be built was Freya.

299
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,166
One day, I was called over

300
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,733
to the lab and there she was.

301
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,066
She opened her eyes
and smiled at me.

302
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,633
Mama.

303
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:59,366
I was so happy.

304
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,133
We all lived together,
and as time went by,

305
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,800
she started to learn
various things on her own,

306
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,100
little by little.

307
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,900
And she grew up to
be a very sweet girl.

308
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,900
My husband poured all of
his technical expertise

309
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:20,066
as well as his love
into creating Freya.

310
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,800
So that she would
be a being to love.

311
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,966
And also a being
that would fall in love.

312
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,066
So the person who
took this photo...

313
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,733
...was my husband.

314
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,666
We loved our Freya very much,

315
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,033
and she had found
someone to love.

316
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:41,066
But then, I couldn't
see her true feelings.

317
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,266
I didn't realize who
she was in love with.

318
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,666
I was worried about Freya being

319
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,700
so melancholy all of the
time, so after a while,

320
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,300
I asked my husband to create
a little sister for her.

321
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:56,600
That was Elda,
whom you call Chi.

322
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,733
Freya seemed so happy

323
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,233
now that she had
a younger sister.

324
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,500
But there were
still these odd times

325
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,666
when she looked
like she was thinking

326
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,200
very deeply about something.

327
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,333
She had fallen in love with him,

328
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,166
but she used all
of her willpower

329
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,166
to keep her heart locked up.

330
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,333
Then one day,

331
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,466
Freya could no longer
stand the pain, and she...

332
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,933
It wasn't until then
that I finally realized

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,200
who Freya had
fallen in love with.

334
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:37,266
And that person was
my husband, you see.

335
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,333
The lab technicians working

336
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,566
with us on the project suggested

337
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,166
that we erase all
of Freya's memories.

338
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,766
But to my husband,
that wasn't an option.

339
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:53,133
And after that, Freya
just chose to disappear.

340
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,833
However, the same
system had been

341
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,666
integrated into Elda,
and she remained with us.

342
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,633
The lab technicians
feared that the same thing

343
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,700
would happen, and they
wanted to get rid of Elda.

344
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,400
But my husband wouldn't
hear of that either.

345
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:11,066
Time passed, and an
illness took my husband.

346
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,366
So I reformatted Elda
so that she'd be able

347
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:19,233
to find someone dear
to her on her own.

348
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
And that's when I...

349
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,700
Chi is very dangerous to them.

350
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,833
Or rather... it's not just that
Chi's so dangerous to them,

351
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,166
she's dangerous
to all Persocom users.

352
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,600
Dangerous?

353
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,866
But...

354
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:35,300
You are the one Mr. Motosuwa...

355
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,333
who will decide.

356
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:50,266
Darling. This was the
right thing to do, wasn't it?

357
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,933
It's not just that
it's wrong, it's absurd...

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,633
that something so truly loved,

359
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
and that's trying
to love a human,

360
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,966
can't find happiness.

361
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,966
It's only fair that
Persocoms should have

362
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,200
the right to be happy too.

363
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,066
That's what you always said.

364
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,033
You created Chi
because you wanted

365
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,800
to find true happiness.

366
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,333
The happiness of
humans and Persocoms.

367
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,666
And that's why

368
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,400
I will see this
through to the very end.

369
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:22,100
I must do this,
so that Chi can be happy.

370
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,633
I can tell.

371
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I am you, you are me.

372
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,433
That's why I know.

373
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,000
One person fills
me up completely.

374
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:44,333
I'm happy when
that person laughs.

375
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,366
I'm happy when that
person is by my side.

376
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:52,300
Yes, I'm happy when
that person is happy.

377
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:56,533
He's different from the others,
this person is special.

378
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,800
You found him. My dearest...

379
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,466
My special...

380
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,166
The One Just for Me.

381
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,633
I hope he finds me.

382
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,066
Just as I found him,

383
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:16,366
and then fell in love
because he was who he was.

384
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,700
I hope he finds me.

385
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:21,600
Things that I can do
because I am me,

386
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:25,066
and things that I can't
do because I am me.

387
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,266
I hope he finds them, and...

388
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:33,633
I hope he falls in love
with me because I am who I am.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,633
From amongst all those
people and things...

390
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,733
I want him to find me.

391
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,533
I want him to fall
in love with me.

392
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,033
But...

393
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,366
If he cannot find me...

394
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,000
Chi.

395
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:08,966
Chi, I- I uh...

396
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,366
Hideki.

397
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,200
Are you The One
that is Just for Me?

398
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,866
I, uh...

399
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,833
Chi is in love with Hideki.

400
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,200
Is Hideki in love with Chi?

401
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,100
Chi, I...

402
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
This is the...

403
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,400
Was it really all right
to take this time off?

404
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:51,300
Hm?

405
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,066
Hey, what's the matter?

406
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,233
It's a voice.

407
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,666
What is it? Is something wrong ?

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yuzuki!

409
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,333
Miss Sumomo!

410
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,066
Hm?

411
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:09,133
That voice again.
Uh, what is it?

412
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,900
Hey, come on, you two,
what's going on?

413
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,466
Hey!

414
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:26,400
Chi.

415
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,166
This town is full of people...

416
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,933
and full of them.

417
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,566
All sorts of people...

418
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,666
and all sorts of them...

419
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,133
live in all sorts of places.

420
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,466
Falling in love with someone,

421
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,400
being loved by someone.

422
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:19,200
Among lots of people
and lots of them,

423
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,766
I have found...

424
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,933
Next episode of Chobits:
"The One Just for Chi."

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,833
I want that person
to find it, too.
