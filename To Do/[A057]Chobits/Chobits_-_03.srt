1
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,666
Okay, for utility bills,

2
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:58,233
I'll have electricity,
gas, water.

3
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,366
Food should cost
about that much.

4
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,633
And then there's transportation,

5
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,333
the phone bill, and rent.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,900
Hmmm...

7
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:13,600
I guess I'll need
about 70,000 yen

8
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,133
And then that means,

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,266
if I can work four hours
a day, 6 days a week,

10
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,466
that's over 700 yen per hour.

11
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh wait, I've gotta
buy schoolbooks, too.

12
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,766
And then with
miscellaneous expenses,

13
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,533
I'm gonna have to make
at least 800 yen an hour.

14
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,966
Chi.

15
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:35,400
My puny little savings will
be gone inside of a month.

16
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:39,100
Worse than that, I might
not be able to make the rent!

17
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,500
I've gotta find a job soon!

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Chi.

19
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:44,566
Hmm?!

20
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,233
Calm down! Must remain calm.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,633
She's just a Persocom.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,266
She just wants to see
my bank book, that's all!

23
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,866
That's all, nothing more!

24
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,866
Chi.

25
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,700
Her breasts... so soft.

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,400
Motosuwa!

27
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,266
Huh?

28
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,100
Oh, sorry.

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,800
Already busy so
early in the day?

30
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,000
Ya idiot, I was just--
I mean, it's not like that!

31
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,766
Yeah, right, whatever;
but it's time.

32
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,533
You are coming to
class with me, aren't ya?

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah, yeah, I know.

34
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,466
I'll be right down.

35
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,433
Okay, I'll wait
downstairs, see ya.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,933
Sure.

37
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,166
All right, I have to go now.

38
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,100
Chi.

39
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,400
Oh, it'll be okay.

40
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,600
I won't be gone too long,
I'll be back by tonight.

41
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,466
Chi!

42
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:27,666
Just a minute.

43
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,100
Whenever people leave
for a little while,

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,766
you don't say
"Chi" to them, say:

45
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,866
"Take care of yourself."

46
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,166
Chi.

47
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,066
"Take care of yourself."

48
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,000
Tay- Tay care uh...

49
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,400
"Take care of yourself."

50
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,533
Take care of yourself.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
Right!

52
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,733
So when someone's
going out, you say:

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,866
"Take care of yourself."

54
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,933
Take care of yourself.

55
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm Hideki.

56
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,966
You understand?

57
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,300
Hi... deki.

58
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,966
Right! Hideki!

59
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,433
Hideki!

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
That's right, Chi!

61
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,600
Hideki.

62
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,333
All right!

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,166
Hideki.

64
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:07,900
That's right!

65
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:08,666
Hideki.

66
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:09,366
Oh really?

67
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:12,900
Hideki. Hideki. Hideki. Hideki.

68
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,800
Hideki. Hideki.

69
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,333
No, that's not it;
you got it all wrong!

70
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,866
I didn't think teaching
was going to be this hard.

71
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,800
Can I really do it?

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,733
Mr. Motosuwa.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,966
Huh?

74
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,366
Miss Manager!

75
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,633
Good morning!

76
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,066
And a good morning to you, too.

77
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,166
Is it your first day
of classes today?

78
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,033
Yes.

79
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,033
Well, give it your best, then.

80
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,433
Thanks.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,833
She's as pretty as always today.

82
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,266
It's so soothing.

83
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,200
Take care of yourself.

84
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,266
Right. Well, time to go.

85
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,700
Take care of yourself.

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,033
Take care of yourself.

87
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,266
Great!

88
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,533
Yeah, I can see it's definitely
gonna be a good day today!

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Sorry to keep you waiting!

90
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,700
He's awfully bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

91
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,266
Hideki.

92
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,300
Not that way, Hideki!

93
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,833
You're supposed
to get in the front!

94
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,100
So are junior high kids
all like that these days?

95
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,866
They've all got Persocoms.

96
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,533
I'd love to be back in
junior high kid again.

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,366
So tell me, how'd you
happen to meet Minoru?

98
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,466
Oh, it was on a really
cool internet site.

99
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,800
We were both posting on a forum

100
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,466
for custom-made Persocoms.

101
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,533
It just started from there,

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,433
and we've been swapping
e-mails ever since.

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,466
So what's up?

104
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,966
Was he able to
help you figure out

105
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,733
anything about your Persocom?

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,666
Even four of his Persocoms

107
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,433
and then another
one weren't enough.

108
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,900
What he was able
to do is to figure out

109
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:48,200
that she's definitely
a custom-made Persocom.

110
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,833
And she's got a
learning program installed,

111
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,266
which seems like a good thing.

112
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,066
Apparently she's
also something called,

113
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,900
"protected," but he doesn't
know all the details about that.

114
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,266
You're one lucky farmboy

115
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,266
to stumble onto such
a powerful Persocom.

116
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,133
There aren't a lot of
custom-made Persocoms

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
that could fry that
many of Kokubunji's!

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Well, if there's anything
else you need to know,

119
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,433
feel free to ask
either one of us.

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,233
Give us a call;

121
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,933
we're more than
happy to help out.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,900
I appreciate that.

123
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:16,066
Oh yeah, is your Persocom okay?

124
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,066
I was waiting for
you to ask me that.

125
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,433
Her circuits were
all messed up, big time.

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,433
It took a whole night to
get her back like before.

127
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
Hey, Sumomo!

128
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,866
Well that's a huge relief.

129
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,733
I was kinda worried about
the next time I'd see you

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,700
and what I would say if
you weren't able to fix her.

131
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,700
Aye!

132
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,800
I wouldn't let my little
Sumomo stay like that!

133
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,666
I've put too much time
and money into her!

134
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,666
It's a good thing I was careful
and backed up all her data.

135
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,466
If I had to buy new parts
I woulda charged you for 'em.

136
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't have any money.

137
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:52,966
You'd find a way to pay.

138
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:53,833
You're a fiend.

139
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,066
You know it.

140
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,866
So, if any of her components
were to get broken,

141
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,600
how expensive are
the replacements?

142
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,933
Um, well, um, that depends on...

143
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Hey, Sumomo!

144
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,700
Aye!

145
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,133
How much does your
memory go for these days?

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll do a search on the web.

147
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,366
What do you mean by: "memory"?

148
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,233
I have a few hits.

149
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,066
Here.

150
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,066
Aye.

151
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,300
Wow! That's amazing.

152
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,366
I didn't know that Persocoms
could write by hand.

153
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,233
You bet.

154
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,500
Course a printer
can also be attached.

155
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,566
Then why do you have her
write by hand like that?

156
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,833
She just looks
cute when she writes.

157
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,266
Huh, well that's kinda weird.

158
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
Is she really serious?

159
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,800
Yep, that's about right.

160
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:43,733
Do you have any
idea how many weeks

161
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
I could live off of
that kinda money?

162
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,966
Persocoms tend to have
big appetites for money.

163
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,366
Luckily, you don't
know about all that yet.

164
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,066
But as you start to get upgrades
and other software you want,

165
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,133
you're gonna wind
up spending quite a lot.

166
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm not really sure
what you're talking about,

167
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,600
but I can tell it's
gonna be pretty rough.

168
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,766
I was lucky enough to
find a cute computer,

169
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,500
but I'm just struggling to
get by and get into college.

170
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,600
Can I really deal with her?

171
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,033
That's it.

172
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,466
I'm gonna have
to find a job today.

173
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,766
All right, now everyone,
please take your seats!

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,333
Good Morning, my
name's Takako Shimizu.

175
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll be your teacher
for the rest of the term.

176
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,833
I will be teaching you
Japanese literature, math,

177
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
and English composition.

178
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,133
It's nice to meet you all.

179
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,233
Miss Takako Shimizu, huh?

180
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,566
Wow, another pretty woman.

181
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,266
Now then, first of all,
before getting started,

182
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,666
I'd like to take just a
minute to take roll call!

183
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,766
What's that all about?

184
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,900
Doesn't she trust us?

185
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:51,066
Roll call?

186
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,333
This isn't grade school ya know.

187
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,366
Indulge me!

188
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,233
As a matter of fact,
the truth is I wanted

189
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,733
to be an elementary
school teacher.

190
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,666
So answer cheerfully when
you hear your name called.

191
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,733
Let's get started, all right?
First up, Asaoka.

192
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,066
Here.

193
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,500
Imai.

194
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:07,433
Here.

195
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,533
There's something
really cool about her.

196
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,633
Boy, if somebody like her
taught elementary school,

197
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,366
I wouldn't mind starting
school all over again.

198
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,033
Motosuwa, you need to put

199
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,066
a little more effort
into it than that.

200
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,466
Okay.

201
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,033
Motosuwa, come on,
even a baby can jump over that!

202
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,733
Wow, Motosuwa,
that's really good,

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,733
you're quite an artist!

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,466
Motosuwa...
Motosuwa... Motosuwa...

205
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,600
Motosuwa! Motosuwa!

206
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,133
And where were you just now?

207
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Oh, hi there.

208
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,600
You know, if you spend your days

209
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,633
in class like that,

210
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,466
you'll be wasting a lot of time.

211
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,366
Uh, yes Miss Shimizu.

212
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,433
Okay, I'm gonna shoot
for 100,000 yen a month.

213
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,700
And if possible,
close to my apartment.

214
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,666
Hey, there's a
couple of listings.

215
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:12,800
All right!

216
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,633
Today's my day.
This is day I get a job!

217
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
When money's the thing
you're so worried about...

218
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,833
Make some!!

219
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,066
To end poverty, and to
have more computer time!

220
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,466
Nothing can stop me now!

221
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,200
Mommy, look!

222
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,066
Come on honey!

223
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,900
Just pretend you don't see him.

224
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,600
Hideki!

225
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,066
Oh, this is the place.

226
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,500
Excuse me!

227
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,500
Back here!

228
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,533
Uh, hi, it said that you
were hiring part-time.

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, I'm sorry, we
already found somebody.

230
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,233
Oh, I see.

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,666
Sorry.

232
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,466
N-no, that's fine, I'll just
try somewhere else.

233
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,433
No problem!

234
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,200
Excuse me!

235
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,733
We're done hiring.

236
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,833
I'm pretty sure
I'm strong enough!

237
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,066
I'm sorry, but...

238
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,633
I'll work as hard as you need.

239
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,166
We only hire girls.

240
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,600
I'll do anything!

241
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,566
Do you need a part-time job?

242
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,000
Ooh, you're cute.

243
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,166
I might have
something for you to do.

244
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,600
Uhh, I-I think I'm
in the wrong place.

245
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,300
Ah, boy.

246
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,433
Man, how'd it get so
late all of a sudden?

247
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,366
I never knew the world
was such a tough place,

248
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,866
I guess I'd better
get used to it.

249
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,366
It must be the recession.

250
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,566
But I guess,
if I stay like this,

251
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,633
I shouldn't even
have come to Tokyo.

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,066
If I don't find something soon,

253
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,333
I can forget about a Persocom!

254
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Well alright then,
so I can't pick

255
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,133
and choose my work anymore.

256
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Even if nothing's around here,

257
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,233
I swear I'll find it somewhere.

258
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,433
I don't know how
or where, but...

259
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Hm?

260
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,366
What is this?

261
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,866
Ah, oh my goodness.

262
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm so sorry!

263
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,400
I musta totally spaced
out or something!

264
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,900
Oh no, it's okay
don't worry about it,

265
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:06,833
I'm gonna be fine.

266
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,633
I can't just let you
walk away like that;

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,733
it wouldn't be right!

268
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,033
Geez, I'm such a
klutz sometimes.

269
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,066
Come on.

270
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,000
My hand.

271
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,400
Really, I'm so sorry.

272
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:18,233
Please, just let me fix you up.

273
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,966
Huh?

274
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,300
Come on, come on.

275
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,666
 Hey, wait a minute, I...

276
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,533
I'm really sorry about this,

277
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,233
but do you mind wearing
wear those for a little while?

278
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,166
I'll get these dry cleaned
for you right away.

279
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,533
Oh no, you don't really
have to go to all that.

280
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,533
Then if you don't mind,

281
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
I'll just use an iron
to dry them out.

282
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,800
Please, have a seat
while I take care of it.

283
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:38,833
Be right back!

284
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,933
Um, uh--

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,900
I really don't mind.

286
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:44,133
Just take a second!

287
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,433
But you don't --

288
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,633
Well, who'd have expected this?

289
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,966
But ya gotta admit,
she's pretty cute!

290
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,966
Her hand was so soft.

291
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,266
Perhaps the flowers
of love will bloom

292
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,133
from this, the very day
of our first meeting.

293
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,400
Mr. Motosuwa!

294
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
Oh no. Wait, what is it?

295
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,333
Oh, that was lame.

296
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
I should have at least
asked her what her name was.

297
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,800
Hey, isn't anybody here?

298
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,066
What's going on?

299
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:22,900
Hey, Yumi!

300
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,933
I need you to
help out for a bit!

301
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,333
Aw, man!

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,966
I'm never gonna
get all this done.

303
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,533
Uh, excuse me.

304
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,733
Oh, it's a Japanese pub.

305
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,300
Huh?

306
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,500
A Persocom hooked
to the register.

307
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,266
Wow, it's just amazing
the things you can do

308
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,466
with a Persocom.

309
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,300
I wonder if Chi'll be able
to do things like that?

310
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:56,500
Oh, ah, my pants got all soaked,

311
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,533
and well, don't be
suspicious, 'cause...

312
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,300
While I was waiting
for my clothes

313
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,800
to get dried, I heard someone...

314
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,900
Uh.

315
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,100
These clothes...

316
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,133
I guess you're wondering
how I got them.

317
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,133
Well that's better,
there's someone to help me.

318
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,900
Where were you
when it was so busy?

319
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:15,933
Hurry up, or we're not gonna

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,100
make it in time to open!

321
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,166
Come on!

322
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,266
Huh? Oh, sure.

323
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,333
Hey, so you ready to go yet?

324
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah we're just about, Boss!

325
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:36,900
Great.

326
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,233
I'm sure you'll work
as hard as usual.

327
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,633
Hm?

328
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,733
Oh yeah, I like him;

329
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,333
this new guy works like a dog.

330
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,666
He's a real keeper.

331
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,633
Excuse me.

332
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,500
Huh? Yes? May I help you?

333
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,766
So, who are you?

334
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,200
Oh.

335
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,933
Oh, so you were
here in the restaurant!

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,433
I was looking all over for you!

337
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
Ah, Yumi...

338
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,633
What's the matter, Dad?

339
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,833
Um...

340
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,733
Hey, well, sorry about all that.

341
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,700
Didn't mean to
startle you back there.

342
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,333
Seems one of the
employees got the idea

343
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,366
you're the new part-time guy.

344
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,666
Uh, what was it...?

345
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,133
Oh, it's Motosuwa sir.

346
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,566
Ah right, Motosuwa.

347
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,433
I apologize for the
misunderstanding.

348
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,933
Me too, I'm really sorry

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,333
I splashed water on you before.

350
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,933
Oh no, really,
it's not a big deal.

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,566
Don't worry about it.
Everything's fine.

352
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,500
Well thank you;
that's very nice of you.

353
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,766
Say, since I got ya here;
are you a student?

354
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,566
Uh.

355
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,066
Yeah, as a matter of fact I am.

356
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm at a college prep school.

357
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:36,833
Huh...

358
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,700
Don't suppose you're
looking for work?

359
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:43,633
Oh-well-I-uh...
Well-uh, actually I am.

360
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,200
Although I seem to
be having a rather hard

361
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,233
time finding anything
right at the moment.

362
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,033
Hmm...

363
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,666
So, those clothes
you're wearing right now.

364
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,333
Tell me, whatta ya think of 'em.

365
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,233
Ya like the way they feel?

366
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,400
Sure.

367
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,133
Yeah, they got
a good cut to 'em.

368
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,766
You don't look half-bad either.

369
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,266
How'd ya like to
wear 'em for a while?

370
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,333
Huh?

371
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,533
How'd ya like to work
part-time for us for real?

372
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,766
I guess is what
I'm trying to get at.

373
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,566
Huh?

374
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,666
You're not serious, are you?!

375
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:07,366
Sure.

376
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,633
Yeah, actually, I need a guy.

377
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,300
One of my part-time boys just
quit and I've got an opening.

378
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,833
I've been asking
my daughter Yumi

379
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
to work here after
high school lets out,

380
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:18,000
but it's still not enough,
I need more help.

381
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,233
Yes!

382
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,333
Just in time!

383
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,700
I really need to earn a whole
lot of money as fast as I can!

384
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,600
And I promise you that
I'll work real hard sir!

385
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,100
Well that's music to my ears,

386
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,266
so I guess it musta been
a case of good timing.

387
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,766
I'm sure you'll be a first-rate
employee, young man.

388
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,066
It's my pleasure!

389
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,033
Well, isn't that nice.

390
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,300
You already learned the
name of our little place.

391
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:44,300
Huh?

392
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,166
You've already
memorized the name!

393
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,966
That's the actual name
of our restaurant,

394
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,566
it's called: "My Pleasure"!

395
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,100
A-ha.

396
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,566
Oh, that's why. I see.

397
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,000
Excuse me boss,
we need you out here.

398
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,700
Okay, I'm coming.

399
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, right.

400
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,833
There's one more thing.

401
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,066
I don't suppose you
can bring me in a resume.

402
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,300
It's just a little formality,
if ya don't mind.

403
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,966
Yes, sir!

404
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,333
Well I guess I'll be seeing
you on a regular basis, hm?

405
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,133
All right, I did it!

406
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,900
I actually found a job!

407
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,466
It's gonna work out;
I'm gonna survive!

408
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,866
Good-bye poverty!

409
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,100
And hello Persocom!

410
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,833
You'll be happy, Chi!

411
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,866
Chi?

412
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,800
Huh?! Oh, yeah.

413
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,366
That's the name of my Persocom.

414
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:35,166
Oh, wow, I didn't know,
so you have your own Persocom?

415
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,133
Oh yeah, I do.

416
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,666
Well to be honest,
I sort of found it.

417
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,500
Really?

418
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,533
Where'd you find
something like that?

419
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
In the garbage.

420
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,433
That's strange.

421
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,866
You think it was an older model?

422
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,233
I have to admit I really
don't have the slightest idea.

423
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,433
And speaking of Persocoms,

424
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,766
I noticed that the restaurant
also seems to have one.

425
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,833
That's true.

426
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,933
So, um Yumi,
I guess you probably

427
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,033
have a Persocom, too, don't you?

428
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,933
Yeah, take a look,
it's right here.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,633
Huh? What's that?
Is that a Persocom?

430
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,233
That's right.

431
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,066
It's my very own
mobile Persocom.

432
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,233
It's got its limits,

433
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,133
but it handles most
smaller applications.

434
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,433
I can receive e-mail,
and it's really handy

435
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,900
for a lot of simple things,

436
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,133
like calculations
and memos and stuff.

437
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,366
Oh, that reminds me,

438
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,100
my resume's in here, also.

439
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:16,933
Oh!

440
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,066
Huh?

441
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,200
 Since you happen to mention it,

442
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,933
I've never written a
resume in my whole life.

443
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,633
I worked on the farm,

444
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,833
helped my folks,
and did lots of chores.

445
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,066
Oh, that's funny,
I never thought of it.

446
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,166
I guess I've never
actually worked

447
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,433
anywhere but the farm.

448
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,133
Oh, wow, I see.

449
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,866
Would you like me to teach you
how to put one together then?

450
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,933
Do you really mean it?

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That would be great!

452
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,766
If you're sure it's not
too much trouble.

453
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,266
It's my pleasure!

454
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,733
So do you understand the basics?

455
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Uh, yeah...

456
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, that's interesting,

457
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,733
so your family has
a farm in Hokkaido?

458
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,766
That's so cool.

459
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,533
Well it's not the biggest farm

460
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,266
you've ever seen,
but we call it home.

461
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,766
Okay, now that space,

462
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,833
that's for your
educational info.

463
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,666
And that's pretty
much all there is to it!

464
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,133
I just can't thank you enough.

465
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Yumi, you're a lifesaver.

466
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,100
Oh, that's quite all right,

467
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm happy to help when I can.

468
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:13,200
Any time Motosuwa-senpai!

469
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,500
Senpai?

470
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,800
Didn't ya hear me?

471
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,900
Motosuwa-senpai.

472
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,100
How did I suddenly
get to be your senpai?

473
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,333
Think about it.

474
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
You're older than me,

475
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:23,833
so even though
were not classmates,

476
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,233
you're my senpai in life.

477
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,766
So that means I call you
"Motosuwa senpai"!

478
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,733
Uh.

479
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,366
Well, if you say so,
I guess it must be true.

480
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,833
What can I say.

481
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,766
Boy oh boy, these
high school girls

482
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,300
are something these days.

483
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,433
I'm a D cup.

484
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,566
Gah?

485
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,600
Whaaaa--?!

486
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,366
Hey now just a cotton
pickin' minute here!

487
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,533
Did I say something that
I don't remember sayin'?!

488
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,166
Well, you were staring at them.

489
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,533
Well, it's not like
I was thinking about...

490
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,633
or thinking in any kinda
way about... or that...

491
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,766
Not at all?

492
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Not even a little?

493
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,500
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't

494
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,033
at all or wasn't
thinking about that,

495
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,200
but it really wasn't
like that kinda "that",

496
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,800
it's just, well, they were,
I mean they are such-well,

497
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,000
of course I-oh, I'm so confused.

498
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:10,066
Gee senpai, you sure are cute.

499
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,900
M-my pleasure.

500
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,800
I wonder if she was
just making fun of me.

501
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,766
Aw, who cares anyway?

502
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,800
I found a job,
and Yumi's really cute.

503
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,033
Hello, I'm home!

504
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Chi!

505
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:30,866
Chi.

506
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,866
Chi!

507
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:35,866
Chi.

508
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,866
Hey, are you really that happy?

509
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:39,566
Take care of yourself.

510
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,100
No Chi.

511
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,833
That's not what you're
supposed to say now.

512
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,766
That's what you say
when someone's leaving.

513
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,333
At times like this,

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,733
you're supposed to say
"Welcome home."

515
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
You say "Wel-come"

516
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,500
"Welcome home."

517
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,633
Wel- welcome home.

518
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,300
That's it, Chi. Good job!

519
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,100
Welcome home!

520
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
Boy, it's hard to
believe sometimes

521
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,166
just how cute you are.

522
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,100
Well I'm glad you're happy, Chi!

523
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,200
You know what I did today?

524
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:06,566
I found myself a job!

525
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,166
Found a- found a job?

526
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:13,000
That's right, well,
you see, a job is...

527
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,500
Hmmm...

528
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,266
How do I explain it?

529
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,166
Well, in any case,
things are looking better;

530
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,500
I'll be able to buy
you lots of things,

531
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:21,033
so you please don't worry.

532
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,866
Chi, don't worry?

533
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,566
Yep, that's right.

534
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,166
Are you happy, Chi?

535
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,766
Happy? Happy.

536
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,966
That's right, that's right.

537
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,733
"Ha-Happy"?

538
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Chi does not understand.

539
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,133
Well "happy" is sort of like...

540
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,266
Let me see... when
your face looks like this.

541
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,900
 Happy... Happy.

542
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,766
That's it, Chi,
that's what it means.

543
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,733
That's happy.

544
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
And I promise, I'll do
my very best for you.

545
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,133
Okay, now it's
time for some food.

546
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,800
Right as I was leaving,

547
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,866
the manager came over
and gave me this.

548
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,966
He said he hoped things
weren't too bad at home.

549
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,066
Chi, would you get
that for me, please?

550
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,933
Hideki!

551
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Uh.

552
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:15,133
Well, I guess I really
oughta teach her

553
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,866
that pointing at something
doesn't mean "Hideki."

554
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,300
Hideki!

555
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,500
Uh, you know, Chi...

556
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:21,366
Hideki!

557
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,100
What I'm trying
to say is: I'm Hideki.

558
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,900
Hideki!

559
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,066
Now that I've got
a part time job,

560
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,133
it looks like I'll be able
to handle all my expenses, Chi!

561
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,900
Chi.

562
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,466
Now, we can buy various things.

563
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,500
Various?

564
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,166
Yeah, like study guides,
curtains, and CDs.

565
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,133
I can buy all the things
I've ever wanted!

566
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Chi!

567
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:21,033
But, I can't buy the one thing
that Chi needs the most.

568
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,733
Chi needs the most.

569
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,433
Chobits.

570
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,600
Next episode: "Chi's Errand."

571
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,466
Since Chi is an
electronic appliance,

572
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,033
why can't they
sell her underwear

573
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,300
in the appliance section?!
