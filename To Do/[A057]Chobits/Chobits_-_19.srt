1
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,433
Hideki.

2
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,433
Here he is.

3
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,100
Oh, sorry!

4
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,233
He looks desperate.

5
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,133
Well, he's definitely very
worried about Miss Chi.

6
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,833
Motosuwa is a good guy.

7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,433
Successful dismount!

8
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,866
Sumomo avoids
falling on her face!

9
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,200
Here.

10
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,700
Do you feel better?

11
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah. Thanks, Minoru. I'm sorry.

12
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,966
So is that all
you have to go on?

13
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,066
Well, I know for a fact

14
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,333
that she was at the bookstore,
but that's about it.

15
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,833
She might have been in an
accident; for all I know.

16
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,866
Or perhaps was
abducted by someone.

17
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,066
Abducted?!

18
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,266
It's a possibility.

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,100
It could always be someone
related to that image, you know.

20
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,933
Excuse me;
I'm sorry to interrupt.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,066
What is it?

22
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't suppose you mind
if I make a suggestion?

23
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,900
There's another line of
inquiry you should explore.

24
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,266
If you think you
might know something,

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,866
just go ahead and tell us.

26
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,033
Although it is
possible that the one

27
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,233
who e-mailed the
image is also somehow

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,166
involved in Chi's disappearance,

29
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,966
we don't know this.

30
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,600
In fact, any number
of people could have

31
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,133
found out about Miss Chi by now.

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,766
Lord Minoru,
you posted a message

33
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,366
about Chi on a Persocom
website a while ago.

34
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,733
Do you think that might
have something to do with it?

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,766
Perhaps someone who
saw that post happened

36
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:50,933
to notice Miss Chi in town,
and then proceeded to--

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,666
...steal her for their
own personal interests.

38
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,600
You mean...?

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,233
Mr. Motosuwa?

40
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,833
Whatever it is, all I can
do now is keep looking.

41
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,700
So, if you hear anything,
please call Sumomo.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,366
Ueda!

43
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,466
Huh? Motosuwa.

44
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,633
Well, from the looks of it,

45
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,333
I guess you still
haven't found her.

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,633
No.

47
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,066
After I closed the
shop for the day,

48
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,633
I decided to take a look
around the area myself.

49
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,833
I thought it would
be a good idea

50
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,633
to see if any of the other
shop owners knew anything.

51
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,833
Sorry to bother you.

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,733
No, I really should
have gotten in touch

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,166
with you much earlier
about something like this.

54
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,933
Come on; I'll help
you look for her.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,433
But, you don't...

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,233
Think about it:

57
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,333
it'll be a lot faster if
we look together. Right?

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,300
Yeah. Thank you very much.

59
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,700
Sure, I've already
tried all the places

60
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,633
on the other
side of the florist.

61
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,000
Right

62
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,466
Well, good luck.

63
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,400
Sorry I wasn't able
help to you out any.

64
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,400
Thanks a lot anyway.

65
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,500
Thank you very much.

66
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,300
A longhaired Persocom?

67
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:12,366
No, I haven't seen one.

68
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,300
I see. Well,
thanks for your time.

69
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,500
This girl?

70
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:24,100
No, I don't think
I've seen her around.

71
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,166
Have you asked at any
of the other shops yet?

72
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,900
Well, not all of them, just
the ones on the other side.

73
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,033
I see.

74
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,800
Well, if you're gonna go
to all the shops in the strip,

75
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,500
wouldn't it be faster
to use a Persocom,

76
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,333
and have it post a message
about her on the bulletin board?

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,333
Maybe Tirol's Persocom-

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Oh, that's right: you don't have

79
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,766
a Persocom at the moment,
do you, Mr. Ueda?

80
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,200
No.

81
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,266
All right.

82
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,300
I'd be happy to post
something for you if you like.

83
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,366
I'll contact you if
I find out anything.

84
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,000
Can you contact her instead?

85
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,400
Sumomo is ready to
transfer her data!

86
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,733
Connect me to your Persocom,

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,133
and I'll give you my
contact information!

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,333
Sure, no problem.

89
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,133
Anything would help, so even
if it isn't much, please call.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
All right, then.

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Hey Motosuwa, you all right?

92
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,533
Yeah.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,166
Of course this is
just one possibility,

94
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:29,400
and I know it may not be true,
but, from what I heard earlier,

95
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,600
it looks like Chi could have
been abducted by someone.

96
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,600
And if she was,
she could be suffering,

97
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,866
or in a very tough
spot right now.

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,400
And when I start to
think about that, I...

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,733
Okay, I'm gonna take a look
around here one more time!

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,900
Telephone!

101
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,433
Answer it!

102
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Aye!

103
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,500
Yo, Motosuwa!

104
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,566
Shinbo!

105
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:58,800
Hey, listen, I finally
got the okay from Takako.

106
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,500
So I thought I'd at
least let you know--

107
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:01,433
I'm sorry, but...

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,866
You picked a really
bad time to call.

109
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,166
Huh?

110
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,533
I see.

111
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:14,900
Look, Shinbo, do Persocoms
feel pain like people do?

112
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:18,466
Does it hurt if someone does
something horrible to them?

113
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,100
Motosuwa...

114
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,866
You know,

115
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,833
Persocoms aren't like that.

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Unless they're
programmed for it, I guess.

117
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:35,800
But even if a Persocom is
programmed with a sense of pain,

118
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,833
all you have to do to
get rid of it is erase

119
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,866
those memories from the hard
drive and the memory slots.

120
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:41,666
Erase?

121
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah.

122
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:46,400
If you delete the data,
the Persocom loses it forever.

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,300
Physical pain and emotional
pain... everything.

124
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:54,466
Even though they
look like humans...

125
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,400
Persocoms are just
Persocoms after all.

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,366
Anyway, I'll let you
know if I hear anything.

127
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,700
Try not to let it
get to ya. See ya.

128
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,366
I'm... still worried.

129
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,333
But it doesn't matter
if I'm worried or not.

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,333
What about Chi? Where is she?

131
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,133
Mr. Motosuwa, do you
think you could hang out

132
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,033
with me for a little while?

133
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,700
I know what
Shinbo's talking about.

134
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,366
It's just that
I don't know what to do.

135
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,833
And besides,
I'm sure that Chi had

136
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,966
at least one previous owner.

137
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,400
And, since Chi is a Persocom,

138
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,833
it's no big surprise
that her memory's gone.

139
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,233
But when I look at Chi,

140
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,533
I just can't think
of her like that.

141
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm sorry, I know I'm
not making any sense.

142
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,400
No, I understand.

143
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:54,400
I do, because I was confused
about the exact same thing once.

144
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,666
To tell you the truth,

145
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,066
I don't talk about it much,

146
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:05,166
but for a while,
I was married to a Persocom.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
It's that store
right over there.

148
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,333
That store?

149
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,533
It was right after
I opened Tirol.

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,766
I'll never forget
the day I met her.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,566
The guy at the store suggested

152
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,500
that I buy one of
the newest models.

153
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,866
And they were all pretty,

154
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,733
but I couldn't really
tell them apart.

155
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,266
And then... There she was.

156
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,166
Back there in the corner,

157
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,366
marked down with
a bargain price tag,

158
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,500
under a thin layer of dust.

159
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,333
When I asked about her,

160
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,633
he said that she
was an old model

161
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,733
that was about to
go out of production.

162
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,500
And then, the next thing I knew

163
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:53,633
I'd already bought her
and we were home.

164
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,733
I tried to make some
sense out of the manual,

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,100
and somehow got her to boot up.

166
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,866
And then she said-

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Nice to meet you.

168
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,366
And what would your name be?

169
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,000
Huh?

170
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,633
I'm Ueda. Hiroyasu Ueda.

171
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,666
Mr. Ueda. I have
input your name.

172
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,400
Does this mean that
you're my master, Mr. Ueda?

173
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:31,233
What? Well, I guess it does.

174
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Nice to meet you.

175
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,066
Nice to meet you, too.

176
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,533
I guess you could say it
was love at first sight.

177
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,700
She was always smiling
and full of energy.

178
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:49,300
If something bad happened to me,

179
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,300
she cheered me up,
and when things went well

180
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,133
she was happy for me.

181
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,233
She was by my side
no matter what happened.

182
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,666
Before I knew it, I'd completely
fallen in love with her.

183
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,366
Her, a Persocom.

184
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,166
So...

185
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,000
So, I actually went
through with it.

186
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,733
I proposed to her.

187
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,200
She nodded yes, with
her usual happy smile.

188
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,866
Yeah, but, can you
really marry a Persocom?

189
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,666
Well, no, it's not possible
from a legal point of view.

190
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,466
But it was definitely
a real marriage.

191
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,933
Besides, you can give
property to Persocoms,

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
and they can also
inherit your belongings.

193
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,533
But your family.

194
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,133
Didn't your folks care or
try to talk you out of it?

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,966
No, both of them had
passed away by then.

196
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,800
The ceremony was
just beautiful. Perfect.

197
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,333
We had a wedding dress made,

198
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,566
and held the service
in a small restaurant.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,100
Someone even wrote
an article about it,

200
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,033
and the people in the
shopping strip teased me

201
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,900
a lot and made fun of me.

202
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,800
But, I was happy...

203
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:07,133
that I could be
together with her,

204
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
and that she would
continue to smile like that.

205
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,933
And yet, by then,

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,600
the signs had already
started to appear.

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,900
The signs?

208
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,266
She started to forget things.

209
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,100
Little by little,
all sorts of things.

210
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,600
At the time,
I thought it was just me,

211
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,900
so I wasn't all that concerned.

212
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:48,666
But then she started to forget
things from the day before,

213
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,266
and little errors about where

214
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,466
we kept certain
things in the shop.

215
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,733
It started getting
worse and worse.

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,633
And then she would
forget what kind of cake

217
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,633
a customer had ordered
just seconds before.

218
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,466
I looked through
all sorts of books,

219
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,333
but I couldn't figure
it out what it was.

220
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,466
So I took her back to
the electronics store.

221
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,366
The hard drive
is completely shot.

222
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,933
You're gonna have to
replace the whole thing

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,266
if you want to fix it.

224
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,500
But she'll get better
if I replace it, right?

225
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,966
Yeah.

226
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,200
But since it's an older model,

227
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,433
there's no way I can guarantee

228
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,000
that the data's gonna
transfer over properly.

229
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,266
What?

230
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,100
When we re-boot, it
might lose everything.

231
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,766
Yes, but she'd lose
her memory then.

232
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,400
Is that what you're telling me?

233
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,466
But that's just too cruel!

234
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,233
You don't have to worry so much.

235
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,766
The Persocom won't feel any
sadness or pain whatsoever.

236
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,133
Because she'll have
completely forgotten

237
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,866
everything she learned.

238
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,266
I just couldn't
handle her losing

239
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,966
everything I'd shared with her.

240
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,933
The thought was
just unbearable to me.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,933
I took her to some
other shops to see

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,333
if anyone could help her,
but it was always the same.

243
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,633
So after that,

244
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,866
I decided to bring her
home without doing anything.

245
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,200
Nice to meet you.

246
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,866
And what would your name be?

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,833
I'm Ueda. Hiroyasu Ueda.

248
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,800
Mr. Ueda. I have
input your name.

249
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,766
Does this mean that
you're my master, Mr. Ueda?

250
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,466
The situation was bad enough,

251
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,466
but her condition
got even worse.

252
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,300
She started to forget things

253
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,800
that had happened just
a few seconds before.

254
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,566
Nice to meet you.

255
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,000
And what would your name be?

256
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:51,966
Nice to meet you.

257
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,533
And what would your name be?

258
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,766
Nice to meet you.

259
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,400
And what would your name be?

260
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:57,733
Nice to meet you.

261
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,166
And what would your name be...?

262
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,166
But even then,

263
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,466
I still couldn't send
her out to be repaired.

264
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,200
Even if it was
only a little bit,

265
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,666
or even just once in a while...

266
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,133
The fact that she
could still remember me

267
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,166
with that broken hard
drive was something

268
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,200
I just couldn't bring
myself to let go of.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
But then, one rainy day

270
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,433
after she'd been
like that for a while,

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,933
we went out shopping together.

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,666
By that time, it was
very hard for her

273
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,866
to live even a
simple everyday life.

274
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,233
I never knew what she might do

275
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,833
if I took my eyes off of her.

276
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,800
I thought about her constantly,

277
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:49,133
and I couldn't sleep,
there was nothing I could do.

278
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,700
I guess I was in a daze.

279
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,866
Nice to meet you.

280
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,166
Nice to meet you.

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm sure she was in such a state

282
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,100
that she didn't understand
the consequences

283
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,433
of being hit by a truck.

284
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,833
But, I somehow felt
that she'd sacrificed

285
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,433
her own life to save me.

286
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,833
Pretty strange, huh?

287
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
She was still able to
do an incredible thing

288
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,833
like that when she
could barely even function.

289
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,333
No, it's not strange!

290
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,133
Not in the least.

291
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,333
I think she saved
your life even though

292
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,500
she knew what would happen.

293
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,400
Thanks for saying that.

294
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,533
Immediately after the accident,

295
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
I took her to the shop
where I bought her.

296
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,566
But they said that
she was so torn up

297
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,466
that they could
never re-boot her.

298
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,266
Her body was shattered.

299
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,500
They said if I wanted,

300
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,400
they'd try to find another
one of the same model.

301
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:02,133
A different one
that looked the same.

302
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,800
But, to me, there could
never be another "her."

303
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:11,500
She was a Persocom,
and not a living creature,

304
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,400
but for me, she had
died there in the rain.

305
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,033
I knew that there
was nothing to repair;

306
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,700
she couldn't feel or
remember anything anymore.

307
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,533
But...

308
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,733
I still remember her.

309
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,866
I remember everything about her.

310
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:35,233
Her face, her voice,
her movements...

311
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,766
The good times
and the bad times.

312
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,566
I'm pretty sure I'll
never forget any of that.

313
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,233
That's just how
you feel, isn't it?

314
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,866
Even if Chi doesn't remember
what the two of you have shared,

315
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,366
you'll always remember,
won't you, Motosuwa?

316
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,633
If something happened to Chi,

317
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,966
you'd still remember
her, wouldn't you?

318
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,766
Yes.

319
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,166
So it wouldn't have been
all for nothing, then.

320
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,200
Even if they were
able to erase it

321
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,000
from the hard drive somehow,

322
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,600
not as long as you
still remember, Motosuwa.

323
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,200
That's why you need to find Chi.

324
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:13,566
Yes.

325
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,333
Even though I don't have
an idea where she could be,

326
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,033
I'm gonna look for her.

327
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,266
I'm sure she'll
be waiting for you.

328
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah.

329
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Motosuwa!

330
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,700
That might be who took Chi!

331
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,566
What's going on?

332
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,500
Chi.

333
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Hey you!

334
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:51,600
Yumi?

335
00:19:58,733 --> 00:19:59,800
Miss Ohmura.

336
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,166
Huh?

337
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,000
Yumi!

338
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,266
You might as well
save your breath.

339
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,466
Huh?

340
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,866
I'm afraid she's not gonna
come back as long as I'm here.

341
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,366
Well, as you can see,

342
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,466
she gets really sad
whenever I'm around her.

343
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you know
something about Yumi?

344
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:20,700
For the moment,
the most important thing

345
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,766
for us to do is to find Chi.

346
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,266
What's this file?

347
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,500
It's an access log from
the custom-made Persocom

348
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,300
website where
I posted that message

349
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,633
about Chi a while back.

350
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,433
I had it sent to me.

351
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,033
I'm surprised that the
webmaster would do this.

352
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,666
They owe me, so I cashed
in the favor this time.

353
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,066
With a list, I can check
them off one by one

354
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,500
and see if any of
them match the person

355
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:42,733
who sent that image.

356
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,633
The reason Miss Chi
disappeared like this might be

357
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,033
because I didn't think through
before I posted on that site.

358
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,400
Sorry to cause you such trouble.

359
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,866
It's all because I had
to open my big mouth.

360
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:02,500
Thank you.

361
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:03,466
What?

362
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,466
If you hadn't brought it up,

363
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,666
it never would have even
occurred to me, Yuzuki.

364
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,366
It was a very good suggestion.

365
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,166
Lord Minoru.

366
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,666
I'm very happy that
you brought it up.

367
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,700
Thank you, Lord Minoru.

368
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,166
I just thought that your sister
would have done the same thing,

369
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,233
so that's why
I mentioned it to you.

370
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,966
Well you're right.

371
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,466
My sister truly was very kind,

372
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,900
and would gently point out
my mistakes and oversights.

373
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,933
Oh, I see.

374
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,533
But, I wasn't happy just

375
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,166
because you did something that
my sister would have done.

376
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,933
New mail has arrived. This is...

377
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,833
What's wrong?

378
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,400
The return address matches

379
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:52,133
the one that sent
the image of Miss Chi!

380
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,300
Yumi and Mr. Ueda, they
know each other somehow,

381
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:05,166
but for some reason,
Yumi never even mentioned it.

382
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,233
I can't think about that now,

383
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,566
I have to look for Chi!

384
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,700
Let's go, Sumomo!

385
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:16,833
Aye!

386
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,000
I begin my search again today
for the one who is only for me.

387
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,566
The person who will love me
because I am who I am.

388
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,133
The person who
will still love me

389
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,100
even if I cannot
grant his dreams.

390
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:16,433
The special one for Chi.

391
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,866
Next episode, Chobits:
"Chi Wants."

392
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:25,366
The one for Chi
and only for Chi.
