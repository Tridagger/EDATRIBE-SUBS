[YAKOV]
Vitya! Don't do this!

00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,416
Can't we talk?

3
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,833
[VICTOR] Yakov, you are
the best coach I ever had.

4
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,333
Nothing will change that.

5
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:54,333
[YAKOV] If you walk away now,
you can never come back!

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,083
<i>Dasvidanya</i> . I'm sorry, but
this time I can't do as you say.

7
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,708
What d'you mean <i>this</i> time?

8
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,791
You've never done what I said
once since I've known you!

9
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,708
If you happen to be in Japan,
drop by and see me!

"Two Yuris? Drama at Yu-topia!"

11
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,416
Where is he?
Why isn't he answering his cell?

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,291
You seem upset, dear,
is something wrong?

13
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,916
[MINAKO]
The world is going insane!

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,083
There's a rumor saying

15
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,833
that Victor is going
to be Yuri's coach.

16
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,166
Well, I guess that explains
what he's doing here, then.

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,125
Huh?

18
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,208
[HIROKO]
Just look at him!

19
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,333
He's sleeping soundly as a baby.

00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,083
[YURI]
Hey there! I'm Yuri Katsuki.

22
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,583
I'm in a bit of
a slump right now,

23
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,541
but I'm actually a
top JSF figure skater.

24
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,250
Back home for the
first time in five years,

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,583
I was trying to think of
a way to revive my career.

26
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,250
When out of nowhere my idol,
Victor, showed up!

27
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,250
Is this happening?
I must be dreaming, right?

28
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,333
[AUDIENCE cheering]

29
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,666
[YURI]
In case you don't already know,

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,916
Victor Nikiforov is a
legend in figure skating.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,250
I never thought for a second

32
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,041
that he would have
any interest in me, but...

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,166
[VICTOR] Starting today, I'm
going to be your new coach.

34
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,125
You're going to get
to the Grand Prix Final.

35
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,208
And you're going to win.

36
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,125
[YURI]
He's naked. So very naked.

37
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,708
[MINAKO]
Yuri!

38
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,458
And why's he passed out on the
floor in one of the inn's robes?

39
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,166
After soaking in the hot
spring and eating dinner,

40
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,416
he just sort of fell asleep.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,208
[MINAKO] It's all over
the news in Russia.

42
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,958
They say he's taking
the next season off

43
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,166
to consider the
future of his career.

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,416
But what's really
interesting is the reason.

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,291
Apparently, he saw the video
of you skating his routine.

46
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,208
He was so inspired
by your performance,

47
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,000
he decided to become your coach.

48
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:30,916
Huh?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
[MINAKO]
That's why he's here.

50
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,958
He chose you to
become his protégé.

51
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,916
Do you know how
incredible that is?

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,625
He came for you!

53
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,125
Hmm...

54
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,250
[PLISETSKY]
What?

55
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,916
He seriously went
all the way to Japan

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,041
to become the
other Yuri's coach?

57
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,291
Yuri Katsuki?

58
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,625
The fat pig?

59
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,416
Did that jerk forget the
promise he made to me?

60
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,666
Geh!

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,458
Yakov!

62
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,500
Where are you?

63
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,291
I want an explanation!

64
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,000
[YAKOV]
Victor is taking some time off

65
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,083
to reassess his career goals.

66
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,041
I believe this
break is ill-advised

67
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,250
and that he will have
a hard time returning.

68
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,625
[MALE REPORTER A]
I hear he's gone to Japan

69
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,000
to coach Yuri Katsu--

70
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,250
Victor doesn't think
of anyone but himself.

71
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,166
He could never
be somebody's coach!

72
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,791
[sneezes]

00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,500
[YURI, MINAKO gasp]

74
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,208
He's awake!

75
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,958
Is there more food
around here?

76
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,916
I'm so hungry.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,291
I thought you said he ate.

78
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,166
Sure, we've got lots of food!
What would you like?

79
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,666
What's your favorite food, Yuri?

80
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,000
If I'm going to be your coach,

81
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,166
that's something I ought
to know, don't you think?

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,166
Oh...

83
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,166
[VICTOR]
Wow! This looks amazing!

84
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,041
This is our specialty,
the pork cutlet bowl!

85
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,458
[VICTOR]
<i>Vkusno</i> !

86
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,541
Really! There are no words!
This must be what God eats!

87
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,125
Glad you like it so much.

88
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,875
The rule was he could only eat
it after winning a competition

89
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,750
since he gains weight so easily.

90
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,541
Oh, really? Tell me, have you
had a pork cutlet bowl recently?

91
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,083
Sure! They're my favorite,
so I eat them all the time.

92
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,916
Oh, yeah? But you haven't
won anything, have you?

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,041
There's not a lot I can
do with you until you lose

94
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
that piggy gut and
work off those love handles.

95
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
You need to get
back to your weight

96
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,875
at last year's Grand
Prix Final, at the least.

97
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,416
Or I can't coach you.

98
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,625
So, why don't you lay off
the pork cutlet bowls?

99
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,375
Okay, little piggy?

100
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,833
Uh-huh! I feel like
I should be insulted.

101
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,000
Hey, Yuri. What's up
with all these boxes?

102
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,833
Think you can take them to
the room where I'll be staying?

103
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,000
Say what now?

104
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:31,000
Ah! What an incredibly
adorable little room!

105
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,375
Is there a sofa?

106
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,708
No, sorry.

107
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,250
I know it's really small,

108
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,583
but it's the only room
that we had available.

109
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,458
I'll make it work,
don't you worry.

110
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh, and we can defer
my coaching fee for now.

111
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,458
I'll bill you once
you've won something.

112
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,833
Okay. Thank you.

113
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,375
[VICTOR]
Now, then.

114
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,916
I want to know
everything about you, Yuri.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,750
Like what kind
of rink you skate at.

116
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,625
And what hobbies do you have.

117
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,291
And if there's a girl you like.

118
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,083
Let's get to know each other.

119
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,416
A relationship like this
should be built on trust,

120
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,958
don't you think?

121
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,166

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,875

[YURI]
Uh. I had a leg cramp.

124
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,833
[YURI] I still can't
handle being close to him.

125
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,666
[VICTOR] Yuri, let's
have a slumber party!

126
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,208
Come on, open up!

127
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,791
It's the perfect way for us to
learn more about each other.

128
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,958
[YURI]
No!

129
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,750
[VICTOR]
Yuri! Yuri! Yuri?

130
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,416
[YURI]
We've barely ever spoken.

131
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,333
He seemed like a glittering god,
beyond my reach.

132
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,375
And now he's right here!

133
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:39,375
I just realized--the reason my
heart's pounding is I'm happy.

135
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,875
Hello there!

00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,833
Hey!

00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,208
[VICTOR]
Hello!

138
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,250
I'll be Yuri's coach
from now on. Victor Nikiforov.

139
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,291
Nice to meet you!

140
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,125
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

141
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,916
Victor's really going
to coach you?!

142
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,083
[YUKO]
Wow! A quadruple flip! Amazing!

143
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,000
I got a great shot!

144
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,333
I've got awesome video.

145
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,750
How soon can
we upload this, Huh?

146
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,833
This isn't for
the public, fangirls!

147
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,250
So this is for real.

148
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,708
Mm-hmm. He says
he'd like to use this

149
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,541
as our primary training
rink for now. That okay?

150
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,958
I'll talk to the higher-ups, but
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

151
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,583
Victor teaching you himself must
be a dream come true, huh?

152
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,458
[YURI]
When I was 12, Victor was 16

153
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,750
and already the top male
singles skater in the world.

154
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,958
I've imitated him for years,
trying to equal his genius.

155
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,375
And now I find out that
watching a video of me

156
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:39,500
somehow inspired <i>him</i> ?
That doesn't even seem possible.

157
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,541
What was it?
What did you see in me?

158
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,583
Remember, you're not
setting foot in this rink

159
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,041
until you drop
some weight, little piggy.

160
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,625
[YURI]
Not exactly awesome

161
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,375
in the pep talk department,
though, is he?

162
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,375
[MINAKO]
Maybe he was just looking

163
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,000
for an excuse to take a break.

164
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,583
Come on, don't say that.

165
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,875
It's what I think too,
but I don't like hearing it.

166
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,625
[MINAKO] Listen. You want
to keep skating, don't you?

167
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,791
Uh.

168
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
Then you need all
the help you can get!

169
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,333
Now, let's trim off
some fat, shall we?

170
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,625
Yeah. Okay.

171
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,166
[YURI] These days,
Minako is a ballet instructor.

172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,541
But when she was younger,

173
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,625
she used to travel all
over the world as a dancer.

174
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,625
When I was younger, I went
to her studio all the time.

175
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,791
I spent more time in
her ballet class than at home.

176
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,916
She's the one who suggested

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
I start skating
in the first place.

178
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,041
She's always
been really supportive.

179
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,708
But she does like to meddle.

180
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,500
So, do you have
feelings for Minako?

181
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,125
Huh? No, no way!

182
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,625
Do you have a lover now?

183
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,500
No.

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,666
What about ex-lovers?

185
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
I'd rather not talk about it.

186
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Then let's talk about me!
Let's see, my first lover--

187
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,458
[YURI]
Stop!

188
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,500
[sighs]

189
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,625
[MAKKACHIN barks]

190
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,875
[VICTOR]
Hmm?

191
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,416
Hey, Yuri. What's that
building up there? 

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
People call it Hasetsu Castle,

193
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,166
but inside it's really
a ninja house!

194
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,458
Huh?! Really? No way!

195
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,291
Hasetsu Castle!

196
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,500
I wanna see!

197
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,041
[MAN A] Now there's
an enthusiastic tourist.

198
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,583
[VICTOR]
Ninja! Yes!

199
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,541
[PLISETSKY]
Hasetsu Castle?

200
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,041
Does he wanna be
a ninja or something?

201
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Okay. Now I know where he is.

202
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,000
Just wait, Victor.
I'll see you soon.

203
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,791
[hums]
Oh?

204
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
[MARI]
Huh?

205
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,625
So Is it true that
Victor's staying at this inn?

206
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,875
[RANDOM WOMAN A]
Can we take a bath with him?

207
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,500
I don't remember the last time
we had this many customers!

208
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,208
[RANDOM MALE REPORTER C]
Is Victor here? Please!

209
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,833
Can we talk to him?

210
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,208
[RANDOM MALE REPORTER D] We'd
like to film a special feature!

211
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,166
What the hell is
going on here?

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
[RANDOM WOMAN D] I can't
believe how beautiful he is!

213
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,958
[WOMAN A]
Excuse me, can I get a photo?

214
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,166
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Victor's at Ice Castle!

215
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Can you freakin' believe it?

216
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,833
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
So hot!

217
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
[PLISETSKY]
Wow. Creepy.

218
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,708
[PLISETSKY]
Oh, crap.

219
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,041
If I post this,

220
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
Yakov'll know I'm here and
come to haul me back.

221
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,333
[PLISETSKY] This is
the city that was tagged

222
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,041
in all the pics
Victor's been uploading.

223
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:13,125
Hey! Victor come out!
Do you hear me?

224
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,416
Whoa!

225
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,791
That shirt. I want it now!

226
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,958
[YAKOV]
Yuri!

227
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,250
Would you like to explain to me

228
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,958
what the hell you're
doing in Japan?

229
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Whoops. You found out?

230
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,125
[YAKOV] You're not in the junior
leagues any more, idiot!

231
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,291
You should be training!

232
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,041
Don't tell me what to do!

233
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,833
I'm not coming back to Russia
until Victor makes good

234
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,333
on his promise to me!

235
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,750
Man. He's such a nag.

236
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,833
I can handle myself without
any help from that geezer.

237
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,583
[PLISETSKY]
I'm supposed to do

238
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,083
a triple Salchow, but...

239
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
Don't even think about it, Yuri.

240
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,541
[PLISETSKY]
I can do it.

241
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,208
[AUDIENCE claps]

242
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,875
A Quadruple Salchow?

243
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,958
[PLISETSKY]
See that, Yakov?

244
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,666
You idiot! How many
times to I have to tell you

245
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,166
quads are strictly
off-limits until you're older?

246
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
If you can't follow orders,
then maybe you should quit!

247
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,166
[laughs]
Go easy.

248
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't be so tough
on him all the time.

249
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,583
This has nothing
to do with you, Victor!

250
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,083
I know how you feel. I got
yelled at for doing that, too.

251
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,666
But you can win,
even without doing quads.

252
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,083
I'd bet money on it.

253
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,791
I think you can win
the Junior Worlds'.

254
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, if I win without
doing any quads,

255
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,583
I want you to choreograph
a program, just for me!

256
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,666
[VICTOR]
It's a deal.

257
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,000
After you win the Junior World
Championship, come see me.

258
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,500
I'll make sure you have
the best senior debut ever.

Huh?! Where am I?
Hey, Victor!

260
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,750
Oh? Are you a fan of Victor's?

261
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,583
He spends a lot
of time practicing

262
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,500
at the skating rink
below the castle.

263
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,125
I would try there.

[RANDOM WOMAN F]
Come on, just let us watch!

265
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,500

for a private practice session.

Yeah, go home already!

see him.

Hey, girls, guess what.

My weight's back to what it was
before the Grand Prix Final.

give me permission to skate!

00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,750
And why's he standing
on my head?

Russian Yuri in the same place.

This is perfect!

what I'm thinking?

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,791
Heee...

290
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,208
[PLISETSKY]
A long time ago Victor promised

291
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,250
he'd choreograph
a program for me.

292
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,333
He promise you, too?

293
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,250
Uh, we haven't
exactly gotten around

294
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,666
to talking about programs.

295
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,166
Huh? If you're not
working on a new program,

296
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,291
then what have you been doing?

297
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,041
Why's he wasting time on you?

298
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
If he knew about
your little sob-fest

299
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,041
in the bathroom
at the Grand Prix,

300
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,708
he'd realize there's no point in
training a big crybaby like you.

301
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,916
[YURI]
The Russian Punk.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,083
Maybe it's time
for you to retire.

303
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,458
Hmph!

304
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,791
[YURI]
He's really underestimating me.

305
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
I don't know what history
you and Victor have.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,166
You should talk to him yourself.

307
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,041
It's not like I made
Victor come to Hasetsu.

308
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,625
He came because
he wanted to be my coach.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,166
[gasps]

310
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,166
[PLISETSKY]
I recognize those moves.

311
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,875
They're for the
short program Victor

312
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,166
was choreographing
for next season.

313
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,458
What?

314
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,791
Before he decided to come here,

315
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,250
he was putting together
routines for next season.

316
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,708
But he was really torn.

317
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,458
Surprising the audience
has always been

318
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,250
what he cared most about.

319
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,666
For years the skating
world has worshipped him.

320
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,250
Now, no matter what he does,
no one's surprised anymore.

321
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,958
He knows that and
it really eats at him.

322
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,250
He doesn't feel inspired,

323
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,333
and without inspiration
you're as good as dead.

324
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
I wonder if he'll
let me use his program.

325
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,500
He doesn't need it if he's
gonna take off this season.

326
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,375
Huh?

327
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,416
If he'll give me a chance,

328
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,208
I know I can
surprise the audience.

329
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,875
I'm going to make
my debut as a senior

330
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,625
and win the Grand Prix Final.

331
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,583
But I need
Victor's help to do it!

332
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,833
[gasps]

333
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,000
Wow. You're confident.

334
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,583
Hey Victor, you got
time for a little chat?

335
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,958
Hey, I didn't know
you were here!

336
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,833
I'm surprised
Yakov let you come.

337
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,333
You need something?

338
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,375
Uh-oh! That's not a happy face!

339
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,083
Let me guess: I forgot to do
something I said I would do?

340
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,666
[laughs]
Yeah, I remember now.

341
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,375
It totally slipped my mind!

342
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,291
I'm sorry, but you know
how I forget stuff sometimes.

343
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,500
[PLISETSKY]
Yeah. I'm painfully aware.

344
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,375
But I'm holding you
to your promise.

345
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
You'll choreograph my
new program like you said.

346
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,875
We're going back to Russia!

347
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,875
[YURI]
Eh... Huh?!

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,291
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

349
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
Okay, I've got it!

350
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,875
I'm going to choreograph
a program for both of you--

351
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,333
to the same music.

352
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,833
Huh?!

353
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,833
--The same music as this guy?
--Choreograph both of us?

354
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,250
Now, don't worry boys,

355
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,041
this piece has two
different arrangements.

356
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,583
I've just been trying
to decide which one to use.

357
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,916
I'll design two programs
using different portions

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,916
of the same song.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,375
The programs will
be revealed in one week.

360
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,291
The two of you will
compete to see which one

361
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
can surprise
the audience more!

362
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,208
Whoa! A competition?
Is that really necessary?

363
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,166
The catch is, Victor has to
do whatever the winner wants.

364
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
What do you say?

365
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,833
Perfect! I love
this sort of thing!

366
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,458
[TRIPLETS]
Wait just a minute!

367
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,875
If you wanna use our rink,

368
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,791
you'd better let us in
on the action, you got me?

369
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,583
An epic face-off
between Russia and Japan.

370
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,583
It's gonna be big!

371
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,666
Let's get ready to rumble!

372
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,000
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER A]
We've got exciting news, folks!

373
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,708
In one week the special
exhibition "Hot Springs on Ice"

374
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,625
will premiere at
Ice Castle Hasetsu.

375
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,583
You don't want to miss a once-
in-a-lifetime event like this!

376
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,250
This place is a real hovel.

377
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,458
So, where's my room, anyway?

378
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,416
Wait a sec! You're staying here?

379
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,458
No way I'm letting you
have Victor to yourself

380
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,000
all the time, fatso.

381
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
So I'm staying here, okay?

382
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,000
If I say no, is there any
chance you'll actually leave?

383
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,625
The hot spring here
is just divine.

384
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not taking a bath with
other people. Now goodnight!

385
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
[stomach grumbling]

386
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,125
I want food and a bath.

387
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,166
[sighs]

388
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,541
So good!

389
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,750
Can't beat the pork cutlet bowl.

390
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,208
Jeez, Yuri, you
have another visitor?

391
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,666
Huh? Huh?!

392
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,125
Aaah!

393
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,875
[MARI] No way! He looks
like my idol, The Blond Takao!

394
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,791
His name is Yuri,
too, isn't that funny?

395
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,000
Huh? That's just
gonna be confusing.

396
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,916
We'll call you Yurio.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,958
Huh?

398
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,708
So, where will
Yurio be sleeping?

399
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,500
[YURI]
Upstairs?

400
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,666
What, in the storage room?

401
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,833
It's gonna need a
major cleaning first.

402
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:43,916
Yuri, come help me.

403
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
[YURI]
Uh?

404
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,958
[VICTOR] Looks like
you have a fan, Yurio.

405
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,958
I'm not gonna
go by that stupid name!

406
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,958
[laughs]

407
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,708
[YURI]
Oh, man. I'm an idiot.

408
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,625
The other Yuri is the
one with all the potential.

409
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,291
He's so confident.

410
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,833
His first year
at the senior level,

411
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,375
and he's sure he'll
win the Grand Prix.

412
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,083
And he doesn't turn
into a blubbering mess

413
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,750
whenever Victor talks to him.

414
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,916
He belongs with Victor. Not me.

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,875
[VICTOR]
Hey, where's Yuri?

416
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,708
He headed out a while ago.

417
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,458
He either ran off
to Minako's place

418
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,625
or else down to Ice Castle.

419
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,708
It's what he does.

420
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,708
[MINAKO]
Huh? Yuri?

421
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
He's not here.

422
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,791
If she said my place,
she meant my ballet studio.

423
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,708
See, when Yuri gets anxious,
practicing chills him out.

424
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,750
So he goes down to the rink,
and I usually go with him.

425
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,458
Ice Castle lets
him skate anytime

426
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,333
if it's not already booked.

427
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,208
Yuri's always been
an anxious guy.

428
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,500
He only came as far as he did
because he had a safe place

429
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,666
where he could
practice on his own.

430
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,583
He's no genius,
but he works hard,

431
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,750
and he truly loves to skate.

432
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,083
[NISHIGORI] He's been
coming here to practice

433
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,500
by himself forever.

434
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,125
It shows you how much
he loves the sport, you know?

435
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,833
As a kid, he didn't even
play with his friends.

436
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,750
To be fair, it's not like
he was ever any good

437
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,500
at making friends to play with.

438
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
He's not great at
putting himself out there,

439
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,833
on or off the ice.

440
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,125
I don't want this
to be the end for him.

441
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,791
No, neither do I, the thing
you should know about Yuri is,

442
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,916
he's actually a
pretty sore loser.

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
I hope you can
bring out a side of him

444
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,166
that we've never seen before.

445
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,166
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

446
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
So all I have
to do is find a way

447
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,041
to turn a piggy into a prince?

448
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,916
[NISHIGORI, YUKO]
Huh?

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
[VICTOR]
Nothing. Never mind.

450
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,916
Thanks. I feel like
I know Yuri a lot better know.

451
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,750
[VICTOR]
Lovely day, isn't it?

452
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,750
Morning, Victor.

453
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,666
[VICTOR]
Be polite, Yurio. Say hi!

454
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,291
I told you I'm not
answering to that name!

455
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,625
[YURI]
Victor's finally going to

456
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,250
start coaching me today!

457
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,000
This'll decide whether
or not it's my last season.

458
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,125
If I wuss out now, I'm done.

459
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,250
[YURI] First, I'm going to be
the Hot Springs on Ice champion.

460
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,166
And then, I'll set my sights
on the Grand Prix Final!

461
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,250
We will start by
listening to the music.

462
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:12,000
[slow song playing]

463
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,791
[VICTOR] This piece
has two arrangements--

464
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,041
each with a different theme.

465
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,333
The title of it is
"On Love: Eros and Agape."

466
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,291
Have you ever spent much
time thinking about love?

467
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,208
<i>Nyet</i> .

468
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,541
[VICTOR]
All right, then.

469
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,125
How does this
song make you feel?

470
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,083
What does it say to you?

471
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,166
It has a very pure,
innocent sound to it,

472
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,333
like someone who hasn't
experienced love yet.

473
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,125
Whatever, I think it sucks.

474
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,500
This "innocence" crap
makes me wanna puke. Blurgh!

475
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,625
[VICTOR]
Okay.

476
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:49,333
[upbeat song plays]

477
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
Wow, this sounds like
a completely different song.

478
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
[PLISETSKY]
I call dibs!

479
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,708
This is the one
I want to skate to.

480
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,250
[VICTOR] The first arrangement
is "On Love: Agape."

481
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,208
The theme is unconditional love.

482
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,541
[YURI gulps]

483
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,291
This is "On Love: Eros."

484
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,500
And the theme of
it is sexual love.

485
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,875
[PLISETSKY]
Hmph!

486
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,583
[VICTOR] I am going to
have the two of you skate

487
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,500
to these opposing themes.

488
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
Here are your assignments.

489
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,416
You get Eros.

490
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
You get Agape.

491
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
We should switch!
That's so not me!

492
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,041
You should always try
to do the exact opposite

493
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
of what people are
expecting from you.

494
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,250
How else can you surprise them?
That's my motto.

495
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
The truth is:

496
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
you're actually both far more
mediocre than you think.

497
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,375
You need to be more self-aware.

498
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm surprised you don't
realize how much work

499
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,375
you both need
to do on your images.

500
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,541
Right now to the audience you're
just a piglet and a kitten.

501
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,833
You had better be up to
my standards by next week.

502
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,875
Or I won't continue
to work with either of you.

503
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,250
But don't worry, as fans of
mine, I'm sure you'll manage.

504
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,125
[PLISETSKY]
Okay, fine.

505
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,875
I'll skate to "Agape." My senior
division debut depends on it.

506
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,083
But you had better give me
a program that I can win with!

507
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,333
Whether you win
or not is up to you.

508
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,291
It would be a winning
program if I skated it.

509
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,333
If I win, you are coming
back to Russia with me. Okay?

510
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,208
And you'll be my coach. Well,
do you accept those terms?

511
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,250
Hmm. I do.

512
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,541
[gasps]

513
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,916
Hmph!

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,333
Well, what do you want from me?

515
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,916
If you win, what is your reward?

516
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,458
To eat with you--pork
cutlet bowls.

517
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,541
Huh?

518
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,708
I want to keep on winning

519
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,666
and keep on eating
pork cutlet bowls!

520
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,666
So I'll skate to "Eros," Victor!

521
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,416
And I'll give it all
the eros I've got in me!

522
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,000
[VICTOR] Good!
That's what I like to hear!

523
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,833
[VICTOR] I wonder which of you
will be able to satisfy me.

524
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,541
[YURI]
I will! I'm sure of it!

525
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,875
[PLISETSKY]
I'll believe it when I see it!

526
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,375
Don't underestimate Russia!

527
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,333
[YURI, PLISETSKY]
Next time, Third Skate.

528
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:31,333
"I am Eros, and Eros is Me?
Face-Off! Hot Springs on Ice!"
