stuck in his throat.

to get back to Japan.

It will just be for tomorrow.

One day only, will you
be Yuri's coach?

just hug him,

into this competition

"Cyberpunk: I've
ceased to be human."

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,041
Just as the theme suggests,
he plans four quads,

I'll reduce the number of jumps

173
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,208
in the first half
from four to two.

174
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,208
So you'll have six
in the second half?

175
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,083
That's right.

176
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,708
That's suicide.

177
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,916
[PLISETSKY] It's the only way
I can win against JJ and Yuri.

178
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,083
[MOROOKA] Although Seung Gil
recovered after a fall


179
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,875
on his early quadruple loop,
he suffered a huge loss


180
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,625
in the standings and has no hope

181
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,375
of advancing to
the Grand Prix Final.

182
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,750
Though, we look
forward to seeing him

183
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,500
at the Four Continents
Championship.

184
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,916
[gasps]

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,666
[MOROOKA] Here on his home turf,
we have Yuri Plisetzky,

186
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,833
age 15, in third place
after the short program.

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,166
--Just listen to those cheers!
--[AUDIENCE] Yuri! Yuri! Yuri!

188
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,958
[PLISETSKY]
I am going to win the first gold

189
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,333
of my senior division
debut season.

190
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,666
["Allegro Appassionato
in B Minor" plays]

191
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,708
[MOROOKA]
He is skating to

192
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,125
"Allegro Appassionato
in B Minor."

193
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,208
The program was choreographed
by Lilia Baranovskaya,

194
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,041
former prima ballerina
of the Bolshoi Ballet.

195
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,291
For his senior debut,
they've chosen a piece

196
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,375
well known for its
difficulty and intensity.

197
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,125
This is the first season
he's been allowed

198
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,625
to attempt quads. Here's the
first of two in this program.

199
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,208
He landed that with
confidence and precision.

200
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:05,166
["Allegro Appassionato
in B Minor" continues]

201
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,333
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel from a spiral.

202
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,666
That was high.

203
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
Is he pushing himself too hard?

204
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,583
Yes. Dance with beauty.

205
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,041
Most people don't realize beauty
is a force of righteousness.

206
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,041
Without beauty,
strength means nothing.

207
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,708
[YURI] A hellish step sequence
without even time for a breath.

208
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,750
How is he so calm?

209
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,250
[YAKOV] This is about
when he starts to tire.

210
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,208
Hold up in the
second half, Yuri.

211
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,750
[PLISETSKY]
Damn. This is tough.

212
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,125
[gasps]

213
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,208
[MIRA] He's putting six jumps
in the second half?

214
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,500
[PLISETSKY]
All right, here we go.

215
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,916
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple Lutz.

216
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,250
[PLISETSKY] Pork cutlet bowl has
three quads and JJ has four.

217
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,458
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple flip.

218
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,666
[PLISETSKY] To beat them,
I can't make any mistakes.

219
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,666
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple toe loop.

220
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,500
And next up, we have
a choreographic sequence.

221
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,041
[PLISETSKY] I don't want
to lose like that again.

222
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,083
[MOROOKA] With all eyes on him,
Yuri Plisetsky of Russia,

223
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,750
age 15, has completed
an excellent free skate.

224
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,041
[PLISETSKY]
Huh?!

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,958
Let's meet again on the podium
at the Rostelecom Cup, Yuri.

226
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,208
See you there.

227
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,583
Shithead!

228
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,791
[ANNOUNCER 8A] Quadruple
Salchow, triple toe loop.

229
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,291
[MOROOKA] That was a beautiful
jump with impressive height.

230
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,333
He's showing no signs of
slowing down in the second half.

231
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,041
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple loop, double toe loop.

232
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,750
[PLISETSKY]
The last jump combination.

233
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,375
He's changed... so much.

234
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,666
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel, single loop,

235
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,875
and a triple Salchow!

236
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,666
[MOROOKA] That's it,
he landed all his jumps!

237
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,875
[MOROOKA]
He refused to give into pressure

238
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,375
here at the Rostelecom Cup,

239
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,500
instead responding
to his local fans

240
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,708
and delivering a sublime
free skate program!

241
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,250
Russia must be proud today!

242
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,750
[AUDIENCE cheers]

243
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,416
[PLISETSKY pants]

244
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,000
[YURI] A performance beyond
his limits. That's what it was.

245
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,291
[MOROOKA] Yuri Plisetsky's
free skate score is 199.87,


246
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:48,541
a personal best.
His total score is 297.96.


247
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,041
He is currently in first place,
and has earned himself

248
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,375
a ticket to the
Grand Prix Final!

249
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
How'd you like my free skate,
pork cutlet bowl?

250
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,750
["Yuri on Ice" plays]

251
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,458
[MOROOKA]
Yuri Katsuki is in second place

252
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,166
after the short program.

253
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,375
He is skating to "Yuri on Ice."

254
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,125
["Yuri on Ice" continues]

255
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,166
[YURI] I don't want people
to think that everything

256
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,041
Victor's taught me so far
has been a waste.

257
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,916
I have to prove
myself by winning.

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,375
If I fail here,
everything is over.

259
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,375
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple toe loop.

260
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,708
[YURI]
I popped it!

261
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,375
What is that idiot doing?

262
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,333
[MOROOKA] His second jump
turned into a single.

263
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,791
[YURI]
Damn it!

264
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,708
Calm down. Calm down.

265
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,750
[YURI]
How do I recover from this?

266
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,125
I've noticed you tend
to flub your jumps

267
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,375
when there's something
on your mind.

268
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,708
Care to share?

269
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,750
Starting today, I'm going
to be your new coach.

270
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,791
And you're going to win.

271
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,291
[YURI] Somehow, he seemed
to know how I felt.

272
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,916
Until Victor came into my life,

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,333
I never went around saying
I was going to win gold.

274
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:05,000
But whether I said it or not,
it's what I was skating for.

275
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,041
[MOROOKA]
That jump had enough rotations.

276
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,250
[PLISETSKY growls]

277
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,791
[YURI]
Honestly, I wanted to win gold

278
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,625
at last year's
Grand Prix Final, too.

279
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,875
You aren't a weak person, Yuri.

280
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,791
Nobody who knows you
would ever think that.

281
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,250
It's changed me.
I'm stronger now.

282
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,458
And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final

283
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,625
with a gold medal!

284
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,583
I made it this far because
Victor believed in me.

285
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,666
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple loop.

286
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,875
[YURI]
What happens if it ends here?

287
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,250
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
He two-footed that landing.

288
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,416
[YURI] If I don't make
it to the Grand Prix Final?

289
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,958
No, stop it.
Don't think right now.

290
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,291
Idiot! Come on--!

291
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,750
[whistles]

292
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,791
Ah...

293
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,833
How nice. All supportive

294
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,125
now that you've clenched
your spot in the final.

295
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,125
Are you going to
cheer for me, too?

296
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:44,791
[PLISETSKY growls]

297
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,958
Yuri. Let's go.

298
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,291
[YURI] Yurio looked like
that last three-jump combo

299
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,041
was going to kill him.

300
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,875
That idiot. He doesn't have
as much stamina as I do!

301
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,250
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel.

302
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,541
[YURI] Whether Victor's
here or I'm alone,

303
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,458
it's still just as difficult.

304
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,958
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple flip.

305
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,166
[YURI]
I just need to keep it simple.

306
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,500
This program is me.

307
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,375
Nobody else can skate it
the way I can.

308
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,541
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel, single loop,

309
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,666
and triple Salchow.

310
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,166
[gasps]

311
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,958
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

312
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,166
[YURI] Victor and I created
this program together

313
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,083
and I love it so much it hurts.

314
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,166
[YURI]
I'm not finished yet.

315
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,208
I won't be done until
I get the gold with Victor.

316
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,791
[MOROOKA] In this step
sequence, you can feel

317
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,833
Yuri Katsuki's love, a love
he can only express on the ice.

318
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,083
[AUDIENCE cheers]

319
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,208
Aw. He had really good
flow up until the end.

320
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,666
Da. You know,

321
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,958
when you think of how it
could've been with Victor here,

322
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,083
you want to see that.

323
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:15,208
[AUDIENCE cheers]

324
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,250
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,791
[YAKOV growls]

326
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,000
[pants]

327
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
[YURI] That's the hardest
I've ever pushed myself

328
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,833
to complete a program.

329
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,500
[YAKOV]
Hey.

330
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,708
Vitya designed that
program for you,

331
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,958
yet you failed to
take advantage of it.

332
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,708
You'd've been better
prepared if you practiced

333
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,791
for the possibility you might...

334
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,041
[YURI]
A lecture at the kiss and cry.

335
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,916
This is where Victor learned it.

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,791
[MOROOKA] Yuri Katsuki's score
for the free skate is 172.87,


337
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,916
bringing his total
score to 282.84.


338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,500
He is currently in third place.

339
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,333
He may yet advance to
the Grand Prix Final,

340
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,833
but we won't know until the end.

341
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,416
Interesting, that's a
higher score than I expected.

342
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,250
[YURI sighs]

343
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,833
[YAKOV]
Hm? What's wrong?

344
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,416
[YURI]
<i>Spasibo</i> .

345
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,291
[YURI] Victor will be going
back to Russia before long.

346
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,500
[MOROOKA] The final skater
is Jean-Jacques Leroy, age 19.

347
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,041
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Finally. I was tired of waiting.

348
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,833
I'm sure the audience was, too.

349
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,500
["Partizan Hope" plays]

350
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,583
[MOROOKA] He will be skating
to "Partizan Hope."

351
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,833
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Yuri Katsuki.

352
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,250
Victor may have chosen you,
but you're no king.

353
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,416
I can tell that much
from your free skate.

354
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,208
I'm the only king here.

355
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,958
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple Salchow.

356
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,208
[MOROOKA] He's planned four
quads for this program.

357
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,791
If he follows through
on all of them,

358
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,208
his free skate program will have
the highest technical difficulty

359
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,250
of all the skaters
competing here today.

360
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,166
Next up, we're looking for
a quad-triple combination.

361
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,791
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Quadruple toe loop,

362
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,916
triple toe loop.

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,208
At Skate Canada,
he held off Russia's star

364
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,791
Yuri Plisetsky to
claim first place.

365
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,333
He came in third at last
year's Grand Prix Final.

366
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,291
With Victor Nikiforov
absent this season,

367
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,458
it seems a new prince in
the figure skating world

368
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,958
has been born.

369
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
[JEAN-JACQUES]
That's where you're wrong.

370
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,083
I'm no prince.
I'm already a king!

371
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,666
[JEAN-JACQUES]
When I designed this program,

372
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,875
I thought to myself, "I'll be
the one who stops Victor

373
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,666
from claiming a
sixth consecutive

374
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,500
world-championship title."

375
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,083
Of course, I didn't
know he'd quit.

376
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,916
I bet he ran because he was
afraid of losing to me.

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,708
I almost pity him.

378
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,500
Poor little Victor.

379
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,916
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel.

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
[JEAN-JACQUES] Mom and Dad,
my precious girlfriend,

381
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,875
the great people
of Canada, my fans,

382
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,916
and everyone in the world
who loves skating.

383
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,583
This is for you!

384
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,000
But it's not enough--

385
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,500
I have more love to give!

386
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,583
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple Lutz!

387
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,208
[MOROOKA]
Nice landing!

388
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,333
[JEAN-JACQUES]
It's not just that

389
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,083
I land all my jumps with ease.

390
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,041
I also make sure they blend
into the overall performance.

391
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,791
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple flip, single loop...

392
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,041
...and triple Salchow!

393
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,708
[MOROOKA] Amazing!
A superb jump combination!

394
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,250
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Hey, judges! This is JJ!

395
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,875
His last jump will be a quad.

396
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,583
Will he stick this one, too?

397
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,458
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Let's go!

398
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,666
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple toe loop!

399
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,625
[MOROOKA] That's it!
He landed all his jumps!

400
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,083
That seals the deal.
He'll take first.

401
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,625
Yuri Plisetsky will take second,

402
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,625
and Michele Crispino
will place third.

403
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,166
[REPORTER 9C]
Fourth is Yuri Katsuki.

404
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,041
[REPORTER 9A] When you total
both competition scores,

405
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,000
Crispino and Katsuki are tied.

406
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,958
[YURI]
We're tied in points,

407
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,875
but I'll squeak into
the Grand Prix Final

408
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,458
since I took second
at the Cup of China.

409
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,375

[YURI]
The Rostelecom Cup is over.

412
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,125
The final six who will advance
to the Grand Prix Final

413
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,291
are the three who had basically
been confirmed already.

414
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,500
JJ, who cemented his win with
another high score, Yurio,

415
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,541
who place second. And...

416
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,833
[sighs] I'm exhausted.

417
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,333
Then you should get some rest.

418
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,375
Don't worry about the
women's free skate tomorrow.

419
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,541
I'll be fine.

420
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,916
What, I can't even
come to cheer you on?

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,708
You would rush straight
to the kiss and cry.

Congrats on qualifying.

make it to the final.

will be my last chance.

Even if I don't
take first place,

444
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,208
I'll have Victor step down
as my coach after the final,

445
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,250
and then--

all that hugging earlier?

451
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,083
Stop creeping me out!

452
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,833
And your free skate
was pathetic!

453
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,833
You get to make the excuse
that you didn't do your best

454
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,833
because Victor wasn't there.

455
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,083
But I was in top form
skating out there today

456
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,458
and earned a new personal best
only to lose to JJ again!
