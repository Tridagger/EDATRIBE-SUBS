1
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,083
[YURI]
Hey, guys! Yuri Katsuki here.

2
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,750
The Russian Punk Yurio showed up

3
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,416
to make a play for
my new coach Victor.

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,166
Now all hell's broken loose!

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,083
Victor is staging
an elaborate face-off

6
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,833
between me and Yurio
called Hot Springs on Ice.

7
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:57,083
If Yurio wins, Victor will go
back to Russia and be his coach.

8
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,500
But if I win,

9
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,500
Victor will stay here in
Japan and continue as my coach.

10
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:05,666
So, I'm gonna give it all
the eros I've got in me!

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,041
"I Am Eros, and Eros Is Me?
Face-Off! Hot Springs on Ice."

12
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,375
[VICTOR]
First, Yurio's program.

13
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,416
This is "On Love: Agape."

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
[VICTOR]
Agape. Unconditional love.

15
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,125
Like god's love or a parent's,

16
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:37,833
infinite, self-sacrificing,
uncalculated.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,750
[YURI]
Aw, man.

18
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,833
This is a tough routine.

19
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,833
Victor can pull
it off beautifully.

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,000
But can Yurio do it?

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,250
Something like that.

22
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,291
Whatcha think?

23
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,875
Yeah. I got it, no problem.

24
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,458
Huh?

25
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,333
[clapping]

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,833
Wow. Really! So beautiful!

27
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,833
Hey. Who said this
chick could watch?

28
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,041
Oh, this is Yuko, one of
the staff here at the ice rink.

29
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,208
I shouldn't have
interrupted your practice,

30
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,541
but it was just so wonderful.

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,416
Sorry.

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
[gasps]

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,625
This one's yours,
Yuri, so pay attention!

34
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,875
Yeah. Right!

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,083
[YURI] A program
choreographed just for me

36
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,250
by Victor himself!

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,666
[VICTOR]
This is "On Love: Eros"

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,291
--[YUKO] Guh!!
--[YURI] Ahh!

39
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,916
[VICTOR]
Eros. Sexual love.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Pleasure layered upon pleasure

41
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,291
until you're
drowning in ecstasy.

42
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,791
[YURI]
He's... like sex on ice.

43
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
There's so much
eros in this routine,

44
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,500
I think it might impregnate me!

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,583
[YURI]
No way!

46
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,750
I can't skate like that!

47
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
[VICTOR]
Well?

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,041
What do you think?

49
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,333
Oh, I... well, uh...
It was very "eros"!

50
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,833
I know, right?

51
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,666
Now, composition--which quads
do you think you can land?

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
[YURI]
Well, I can do the toe loop.

53
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,416
And the Salchow in practice,

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,666
but I've never landed
it in competition.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,625
Uh... Uh!

56
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,375
But maybe I should
still give it a shot?

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,083
What do you think?

58
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,458
Just stick to practicing
your fundamentals for now.

59
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,875
I'll work with Yurio first.

60
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,166
[YURI]
Huh?

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,375
I have no intention
of wasting the day trying

62
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
to teach you
something you can't do.

63
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,291
How many times have you choked
during a competition, Yuri?

64
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,583
You've shown
you have the skill to win.

65
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,083
Why can't you?

66
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,291
Probably... 'cause I don't have
a whole lot of confidence.

67
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,625
That's right.

68
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,666
What I want to do is help
you find that confidence

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,166
and embrace it.

70
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,750
Unleash the eros within you.

71
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,583
Maybe no one's seen it before,
but I know it's there.

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,166
Smoldering deep down inside you,

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,583
waiting for its
chance to come out.

74
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,416
Can you show it to me?

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Can you do that?

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,625
You're supposed
to be teaching me

77
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,166
and not chatting with the piggy!

78
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,375
Yeah.

79
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,208
Well, anyway.

80
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,125
[YURI]
Huh?

81
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,166
[VICTOR]
While you're training,

82
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,625
I also expect
you to be thinking.

83
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,166
I want to know
what eros is to you.

84
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,083
[YURI]
Yeah. Sure. No problem.

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,916
I can do that.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
[AXEL]
Oh...

87
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,083
[LUTZ] I still can't believe we
got a show this big in Hasetsu!

88
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,916
[LOOP] I bet a million
people will show!

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,125
And we know what
they're gonna see, don't we?

90
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,791
Yuri kicking butt!

91
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,375
Go, Yuri, go!

92
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,625
Really?

93
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,875
You were stuck
with basic training

94
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
because you don't get "eros"?

95
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,916
[YURI]
Yeah.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,416
[NISHIGORI sighs] You shoulda
just made something up.

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,916
I bet Victor hasn't thought
about it much either.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,250
Yeah, well, he's a skating god,

99
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,583
so he can get away
with that sort of thing.

100
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,666
You know, thinking
about the program,

101
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,125
I can actually imagine
a story it might be telling.

102
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,291
A handsome, charming
playboy comes to town.

103
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,666
The women fall for
him left and right.

104
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,958
He decides to pursue the most
beautiful one of them all.

105
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,291
But she turns him away.

106
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,583
Undeterred, the man
continues his pursuit

107
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,583
with gifts and
flattery and promises.

108
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
Until finally, she gives in.

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,166
But, having got what he wanted,
the man loses interest

110
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,875
and moves on to the next town.

111
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, how sexy! Take me now!

112
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,666
Sorry. Good story and all, but
it just doesn't sound like you.

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,208
I know!

114
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,541
Anyone who sees it will wish
Victor was the one skating it.

115
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,833
Well, y'know,
you looked kinda sexy

116
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,291
in that video
where you copied him.

117
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,125
[YURI]
I can't just keep copying him!

118
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,666
I mean, I'll never get
better than him that way.

119
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,875
Wait a sec.

120
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,375
You think you can be
better than him someday?

121
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,916
Huh? Oh! No! Of course not!

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,208
Let's get real, here.

123
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,708
How many dates
have you had?

124
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,000
You do know he's the
hottest skater in the world?

125
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
[laughs]

126
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,583
[VICTOR]
Stop, stop!

127
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,750
Hmm.

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,625
Something just doesn't
feel right, here.

129
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,750
But I'm doing
it like you showed me!

130
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,875
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

131
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,208
The way you're
performing it now,

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,625
your hunger for
victory is too obvious.

133
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,666
You aren't projecting

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,541
the essential purity
that is "agape."

135
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,958
It's good to have confidence.

136
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,041
But in this program, it
shouldn't be front and center.

137
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,041
Yeah?

138
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,375
Far as I can tell,
when you skate,

139
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,875
confidence is always
"front and center."

140
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,541
So how about you tell me
what agape means to you?

141
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
It's an emotion,

142
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,208
so why waste time trying to
put it into words, you know?

143
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,458
Right? When you skate,

144
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,541
it's about what
you feel, not what you think.

145
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,083
Haven't you figured
that out yet?

146
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,291
Now, on to the temple!

147
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,791
[PLISETSKY]
The temple?

148
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>Nyet</i> ! Ow! Ow!

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,041
[sighs]

150
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,875
[YURI]
Damn it.

151
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,375
I'm a man. I'm 23.

152
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:36,000
I should be able to project
some semblance of sexuality!

153
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
Quick favor?

154
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,708
I need a photo of myself in the
bath so I can post it online.

155
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,500
Sorry, we don't let people
take pictures in the bath.

156
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,166
[VICTOR]
Really?

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,791
[YURI]
It's no use.

158
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,291
I'm not any closer to
figuring out what eros is.

159
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,500
Eros, eros.

160
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,166
Something that makes
you lose the ability

161
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,208
to make rational decisions.

162
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,625
What does that to me?

163
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,125
What tempts me to act
against my better judgment.

164
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,416
What?

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,541
[gasps]

166
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,875
Pork cutlet bowls!

167
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,583
That's it!
That's what eros is to me!

168
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,458
Wow. I'm an idiot.
I take it back.

169
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,416
It's okay.

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,458
We can go with that.

171
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,916
It's unique, at least.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,083
Seriously?

173
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,916
[YURI]
Really?

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,583
Pork cutlet bowls?

175
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,333
Did I actually say that?

176
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,541
I'm gonna go crawl
under a rock and die!

177
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,291
[VICTOR]
All right!

Thanks, Grandpa.

Do you think you can come
to practice again tomorrow?

was drinking until dawn. Stupid.

To me that means--Grandpa.

Looks like Yurio
finally found his agape.

Maybe he's ready
for the next stage now.

of the pork cutlet bowl?

Except I'm missing something.

The framework of this program
is there, and it's solid,

but I still need
to find its core.

costumes you wearing?

wear all of this crap?

You wore this at the Junior
Championship, didn't you?

Yeah, I had
long hair at the time,

247
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,541
and my costume was designed

248
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,125
to suggest both male
and female genders.

00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,333
If I lose, that means Victor
will go with him back to Russia.

351
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,791
That can't happen.

352
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,958
I have to win.

353
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,291
I have to. I have to.

354
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,458
[VICTOR]
Yuri.

355
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,166
Ready? You're up.

356
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,500
[YURI]
Uh. Yes. I'm ready.

357
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,666
I'm going to skate
with everything

358
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,291
I have out there today.

359
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,958
I'll be the tastiest
pork cutlet bowl ever.

360
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
So watch, won't you?

361
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,166
Of course I will.
I love pork cutlet bowls.

362
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Introducing our next skater.

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,125
Representing Japan.

364
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,208
A late bloomer who's
become a rising star.

365
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,500
Yuri Katsuki!

366
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,000
[RANDOM FEMALE FAN D]
Good luck, Yuri!

367
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,833
[MOROOKA] He will be
skating to "On Love: Eros."

368
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,666
He struggled with
how to express eros,

369
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,125
but found inspiration
thinking of his favorite dish,

370
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,625
a pork cutlet bowl.

371
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,000
[AUDIENCE whispering]

372
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,250
[MINAKO] After all
the work we did last night,

373
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,625
that is no ordinary
pork cutlet bowl.

374
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,666
["On Love: Eros" plays]

375
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,791
[YURI]
At first I didn't know

376
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,166
who I was dancing for.

377
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,666
But now I do.

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,875
[whistles]

379
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,708
[MOROOKA] That step
sequence was pure seduction.

380
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,791
I find it hard to believe he's
imagining a pork cutlet bowl.

381
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,291
[MINAKO]
Good!

382
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,166
Step sequences and spins have
always been your strength.

383
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,500
I want you to teach me
how to move like a woman.

384
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,541
Huh?

385
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,875
[YURI]
I can't be the playboy.

386
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,291
It's not me.

387
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,375
I have to be the beautiful woman
who seduces the playboy.

388
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,000
I won't change any moves.

389
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
I'll just change the <i>way</i> I move.

390
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
I think that will be
a better expression

391
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,500
of what I really feel.

392
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,708
[MINAKO]
At first I didn't get why

393
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,250
he was so intent on that.

394
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,083
But I see it now.

395
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,708
He's never skated
like this before.

396
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,166
[MOROOKA] Now, we have a spread
eagle right into a triple axel.

397
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
[NISHIGORI]
Man, this program is tough.

398
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,458
I wonder if he's
going to regret saving

399
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,791
all the jumps for
the second half.

400
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,291
[MOROOKA]
Whoops!

401
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
He stepped out of
that quadruple Sal.

402
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,750
He did stay on his feet,
but his hand touched the ice.

403
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,375
[PLISETSKY]
Yeah, no surprise there.

404
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,458
[YURI]
Don't panic!

405
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,166
Just stay in control.

406
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,916
One mistake doesn't
mean I've lost.

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm better than any
other woman out there.

408
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
And now it's time
to show him why.

409
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,416
[MOROOKA] A quadruple toe loop
followed by a triple toe loop!

410
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,750
Absolute perfection!

411
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,916
[NISHIGORI] A quad-triple
combo at the very end?

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,625
Is he insane?

413
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,333
He nailed it, though!

414
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:14,583
[AUDIENCE cheers]

415
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,250
[RANDOM FEMALE FAN F]
Good to see you out there again!

416
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,625
[RANDOM FEMALE FAN G]
Welcome back, Yuri!

417
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,375
It's not "welcome back."

418
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,041
That was a Yuri
we've never seen before.

419
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,916
Nobody could look away.

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,125
Something tells me this
will be one hell of a season.

421
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
Yuri!

422
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,875
I don't think
I have ever seen

423
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,458
a tastier or more
inspiring pork cutlet bowl!

424
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
[YURI]
Really? That means a lot.

425
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,625
And now, there's
something I want to ask you.

426
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,916
Okay. Sure.

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,458
What was with that
pathetic triple axel out of

428
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,083
the spread eagle? And I guess
your quad Salchow is better,

429
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,500
but obviously Yurio didn't

430
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,291
teach you well enough in
your secret practice sessions.

431
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,083
Uh, Yuri?

432
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,083
Where are you going? Hey!

433
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,125
[YUKO] You're leaving without
even hearing the results?

434
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,500
I already know
what the results are.

435
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,791
That performance.

436
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,208
I'll keep skating under Yakov.

437
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,166
<i>Dasvidaniya</i> .

438
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,625
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,500
This isn't over, though.

440
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm taking gold at
the Grand Prix Final.

441
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,666
Tell him that.

442
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,541
[MOROOKA]
It's official!

443
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,833
Yuri Katsuki is the winner
of Hot Springs on Ice!

444
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,000
Well done!

445
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,375
Do you have any words
for the audience?

446
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,083
I... Um... Well...

447
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,666
[gasps]

448
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,375
This was the beginning.

449
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,916
With Victor, I hope
to win the Grand Prix Final.

450
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,083
Thank you all for
your continued support!

451
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,541
[MINAKO sobs]

452
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,375
[AUDIENCE cheers]

453
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,791
[YURI]
Here we go.

454
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,958
The battle for my figure
skating career has begun!

455
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,958
[YURI] I really don't think
there's anyone who'd want

456
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,375
to see me naked on the ice.

457
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,875
[VICTOR]
Don't be so sure!

458
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,625
At the very least, I would.

459
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,291
[YURI]
Huh?

460
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,958
[VICTOR]
Fourth Skate: "Like Yourself.

461
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,333
