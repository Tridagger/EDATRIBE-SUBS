00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,458
Crap! I'm not
feeling agape at all.

343
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
I'm just angry!

344
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,125
[MOROOKA] Here comes his
first jump, a triple axel.

345
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,708
[MOROOKA]
Oh! he fell!

00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,041
[PLISETSKY]
Damn it!

347
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,875
I haven't missed that jump
once in the last year!

348
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,750
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A flying sit spin.

349
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,041
His position is quite beautiful.

350
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,791
[PLISETSKY]
It's not fair!

351
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,833
I've been pouring my
blood, sweat, and tears

352
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,458
into this since that
humiliation in Japan.

353
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,708
[PLISETSKY] I just lack
experience, that's all.

354
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,833
[MOROOKA] His first quad is
coming as part of a combination.

355
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,625
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Quadruple Salchow.

Triple toe loop.

357
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,958
[MOROOKA] Fantastic execution!
Great height and flow!

358
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,375
It's hard to believe
he only started doing

359
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,166
that combination this season!

360
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,250
Now here comes his final jump.

A quadruple toe loop.

362
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,791
[MOROOKA]
What a beautiful jump!

363
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,916
He demonstrates truly
remarkable talent

364
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
for a skater of any age.

365
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,541
[YAKOV] Even when he
doesn't skate his best,

366
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,166
he knows how to analyze
his performance mid-program

367
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,666
and make a comeback.

368
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,541
[LILIA] Beautiful.
You are a work of art.

369
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,541

until the very end.

372
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,958
[MOROOKA] His supporters here
in Moscow expected a lot,

373
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,875
and Yuri Plisetsky delivered it

374
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,208

short program!

was someone more annoying

than those other idiots--JJ.

Yeah, I'm feeling pretty--

putting him in second place.

Yuri Katsuki remains in first.

384
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,750
Today's final skater is the one

385
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,333
with the most momentum going
into this competition.

386
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,500
Jean-Jacques Leroy
of Canada, age 19.

387
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,958
Also known as "JJ."

388
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,375
[MOROOKA] He will be skating
to an original song

389
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,041
composed for him:
"Theme of King JJ."

["Theme of King JJ" plays]

391
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,333
[JEAN-JACQUES] Not just anyone
can pull off a collaboration

392
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,458
with a world-famous rock band.

393
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,916
This is the kind of program
that only King JJ can deliver.

394
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Quadruple toe loop.

Triple toe loop.

396

[MOROOKA] Some major jumps
right off the bat.

397
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,208
JJ placed third at last
year's Grand Prix Final

398
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,125
and took first this
year at Skate Canada,

399
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
putting him in a solid position.

00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,500

ready for another big one.

401
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,583
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel.

402
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,875
[MOROOKA]
Incredible height!

403
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,000
He nearly cleared the
fence with that jump.

404
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,458
[JEAN-JACQUES chuckles] A lot of
top skaters load the second half

405
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,000
of their programs with jumps,
but I'm different.

406
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,750
I don't rely on that trick.

407
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,958
To me it's more important
that my skating

408
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:17,791

It's JJ Style!

stuck in his throat.
