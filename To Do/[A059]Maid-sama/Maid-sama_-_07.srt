1
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,632
Welcome back, Master.

2
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,900
Misa's wearing glasses!

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,202
Niiice!

4
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,249
Oh!

5
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,184
[CUSTOMERS]
Huh?

6
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,086
My apologies, Masters.

7
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,556
M‐my apologies.

8
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,991
I'm sorry, Subaru.

9
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,693
Don't worry about it.

10
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,628
Kay...

11
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,129
Do your best, Misa!

12
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,531
We're cheering you on!

13
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,565
Oh, yeah!

14
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,700
This is bad...

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,035
I've gotta concentrate.

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,336
Misa, are you all right?

17
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,304
Oh! Manager,
sorry about that.

18
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,174
If something's bothering you,
I'm here to listen.

19
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,178
You can tell me
anything, okay?
Well, bye!

20
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,747
Sorry again!

21
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,983
It's all right. I know I can
always rely on you, Misa!

22
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,251
What about me?

23
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,386
Of course.
I rely on all of you!

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,658
Honoka, Subaru, Erika,
Gon, and Sayuri, too!

25
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,628
You're awfully trusting,
aren't you Manager?

26
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,197
Honoka, your aura
is oozing evil...

27
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,734
But I will get angry at
people who slack off
too much don't forget it!

28
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,903
Whoops! Guess that's my cue
to get back out there!

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,273
Misa, your shift's over, right?
See you tomorrow.

30
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,441
Thank you very much.

31
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,810
(Sigh)

32
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,911
That was no good...

33
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,212
Looks like fun.

34
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,215
Usui! You've already
been discharged?!

35
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,950
Yeah, I rock. Remember?

36
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,218
What are you thinking?

37
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,953
You're still wrapped up
in bandages!

38
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,855
Oh my, are you
worried about me?

39
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,657
NO! And quit
barging in here!

40
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,828
I couldn't help it‐
I just wanted to see my
Misa as soon as possible.

41
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,263
Ah! Stop it!

42
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,670
(Gasp)

43
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,850
I love you, Ayuzawa.

44
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,969
(Phone rings)

45
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,505
Sakura?

46
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,014
Huh? Misaki! Over here!

47
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,784
(Out of breath)

48
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,418
Who did they fight?

49
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,154
They fought a student
from Miyabigaoka.

50
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,423
It's that super elite
private school that only
rich kids go to!

51
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,961
This is bad‐ that's the kinda
place we don't want to
get in trouble with!

52
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,697
What a mess.

53
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,766
Excuse me.
Please, let me through.

54
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,802
Hey, you two!
What's going on over here?
What happened!

55
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,071
Ah! What the heck
is she doing here?!

56
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,639
How should I know?!

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,240
And who are you?

58
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,277
I'm Misaki Ayuzawa,
student council president of
Seika High School.

59
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,345
Is there some
kind of problem?

60
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,216
One of your so‐called "students"
suddenly lashed out at me
for no reason.

61
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,751
Is this true?!

62
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,119
(Groans)

63
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,522
I had heard that Seika students
were nothing but barbarians.

64
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:53,059
Now I can see that the rumors
are completely true.

65
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,396
I suggest that you consider
how you are going to
apologize for your behavior.

66
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,731
Don't screw with us!

67
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,200
What the hell should we
apologize to YOU for?!

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,768
You idiots...!

69
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,736
Be quiet!

70
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,937
Owww!

71
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,238
What was that for?!

72
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,940
If you hit him,
you have to apologize!

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,041
Huh?!

74
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,543
[ISHIDA]
No way! He deserved it!

75
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,044
[TAKAMIZAWA]
And YOU'RE the one
who's hitting people!

76
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,913
[MISAKI]
Shut up! Think of all
the people out here

77
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,982
who you're inconveniencing!
Only idiots resort to violence!

78
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,984
It appears that they are
incapable of conversing civilly.

79
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,888
I shall await you at
Miyabigaoka at your
earliest convenience.

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,991
If you do not apologize
for your actions...

81
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,395
we will be forced to report this
incident to our student council.

82
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,869
Hey, blow it out your ass!

83
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,803
Let's go.

84
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,572
Hey, wait a second!

85
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,374
Misaki!

86
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,709
What are we
going to do now?

87
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,611
For something
like this to happen

88
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,412
just as Seika was finally
improving its image...

89
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,814
If they don't apologize,

90
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,417
your hard work will go
straight out the window!

91
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,721
Don't worry about it...
I'll think of something.

92
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,659
That's what I said, but...

93
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,929
there's no way those guys
are just gonna agree
to go apologize.

94
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,566
I heard about Miyabigaoka.

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,001
(Misaki falling down)

96
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,135
What's going on?

97
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,170
Miss President,
are you all right?

98
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,372
It's nothing.

99
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,616
What's the matter, Ayuzawa?

100
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,985
This isn't the time to be
thinking about that!

101
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,887
I have to focus...

102
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,926
It's heavy... so heavy!

103
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,530
Excuse me! Could someone
please give me a hand?

104
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,833
Mr. Usui!
Thank you very much.

105
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,003
You're welcome.
As for my reward...

106
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,944
That'll do just fine.

107
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,320
Yukimura!

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,321
Snap out of it!

109
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,923
Yukimura! Yukimuraaaa!

110
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,425
(Hysterical giggle)

111
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,161
I get it now. He's just a...

112
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,230
a sexually harassing idiot!

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,598
Now it makes total sense!

114
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,399
He just harasses whoever
happens to be closest!

115
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,837
(Misaki rants)
Does anyone else have any
idea what's going on...?

116
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,106
No idea‐ in fact, I don't
even think I WANT to know.

117
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,877
[MISAKI]
He really had me going there,
didn't he?! HAHAHA!

118
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,751
Seriously, what the hell
is your problem?

119
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,886
It looked like fun,
so I decided to tag along.

120
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,622
Besides, I haven't been
on a bus in awhile...

121
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,190
Why the heck is Usui coming?

122
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,626
And why do we even hafta go to
apologize in the first place?

123
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,764
If you don't wanna apologize,
then tell me why you were
fighting in the first place!

124
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,464
(Groan)

125
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,466
Fine, we'll tell you.

126
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,769
That day, we...

127
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,271
Chess, huh?

128
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,473
If we could play that,
it'd be so cool...

129
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,841
Whoa, that's expensive!

130
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,177
Dude, you can barely
even play checkers.

131
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,814
[KOGANEI]
My, how unusual.
Are those Seika High students?

132
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,784
This store belongs
to my family.

133
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,954
It's not the place for lowlifes
such as yourselves.

134
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,890
Begone, you insects.

135
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,758
(Grunt)

136
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,897
After that jerk said
somethin' like that...

137
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,800
Why would we apologize to him?!

138
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,910
What? We told you and
we still have to do it anyway?!

139
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,579
Man, I knew tellin' her
was pointless...

140
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,716
Is this place really
Miyabigaoka High School?

141
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,818
It's like a mansion...

142
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,590
[KOGANEI]
So you finally make
your grand appearance,
students of Seika High.

143
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh, my. And it would appear
that you've made an
addition to your party.

144
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,563
Would this be the Student
Council Vice President?

145
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,032
No. I'm just taking
a field trip.

146
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,635
Huh? Is that so?

147
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,969
(Laughter)

148
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,571
What is it?

149
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,039
Really...?!

150
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,575
Well then, gentlemen‐
whenever you're ready.

151
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,945
I look forward to seeing
how you will apologize
for your misconduct.

152
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,547
Hurry up now
I have't got all day.

153
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:07,147
Tch!

154
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:07,981
Ha!

155
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,182
What's the matter?

156
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,052
Refusing to take responsibility
for your actions?

157
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,520
Why am I not surprised?

158
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,021
This is why
I despise commoners...

159
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,824
Very well. Looks like
I have no choice

160
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,727
to but take this discussion
to the student council.

161
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,630
"Foolish commoners," huh?

162
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,998
Now I get it.

163
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,700
Guess your crappy
attitude explains

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,102
why you think it's okay to
call our students "insects."

165
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,772
If you want to take
this "discussion"
to the student council,

166
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,939
then go right ahead.

167
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,608
In fact, take it
wherever you want!

168
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,643
I don't care if the entire
school finds out about it.

169
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,945
However‐
before you do any of that,

170
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,615
I want an apology
from YOU first.

171
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,185
Uh! And why
should I have to?

172
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,353
Because you have to
take responsibility
for your actions‐

173
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,890
if you'd just kept
your mouth shut they
never would've hit you.

174
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,559
To tell you the truth,
I'd like to get in
a few hits, too.

175
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,094
Yeah, count me in.

176
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,129
If you rally think
you can get away with

177
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,232
calling our students
"insects," you're dead wrong!

178
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,902
I demand an apology!

179
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,705
What nonsense is this?

180
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:08,074
Where's the harm in calling
an insect an insect?

181
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,146
Well. Then shall we settle
this with a chess match?

182
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,380
Huh?!
Huh?!

183
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,816
If you can defeat me,

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,884
I shall concede that the
students of Seika High

185
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,753
are not "insects",
and formally apologize.

186
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,589
Yeah right!
We don't even
know how to play!

187
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,125
This guy's really
startin' to piss me off!

188
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,192
Miss President?

189
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,728
I can only do shogi.

190
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,530
Then I guess
I'll give it a shot...

191
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,131
Huh?!

192
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,333
I suppose I could explain the
rules for you, if you want‐

193
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,002
No thanks. I played a bit
when I was younger,
so I think I'll be fine.

194
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,871
Is that so?

195
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,240
Oh, you can go first
if you want.

196
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,110
I can't figure him out...

197
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,514
Oh, I forgot to
mention to you:

198
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:51,985
this year I ranked fourth
place in the national
chess tournament.

199
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,688
So what?

200
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:58,825
<clearing throat>
"So" I guess I'll have to
go a little easy on you.

201
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,127
How thoughtful of you.

202
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,029
But don't worry...

203
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,932
Feel free to come at me
with everything you've got.

204
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,468
And if I win, I want you to
tell our student president

205
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,304
that she's a
beautiful butterfly.

206
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,373
Wh‐what are you saying?!

207
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,975
What about us?

208
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,178
But if I go all out there's no
way you could possibly beat me‐!

209
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,379
Uh!

210
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,888
Hey, doesn't that guy
look a little flustered?

211
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,223
Could it be that
Usui's actually winning?

212
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,191
I don't believe it!

213
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,660
Hmm...

214
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,596
What'll it be?
Do you give up?

215
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,799
Hmph! N‐not a chance!

216
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,070
(Chuckle)
What will you do now?

217
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,478
And checkmate.

218
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,479
AH!

219
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,915
That was so easy!

220
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,083
Another round?

221
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,486
(Laughing)

222
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,755
Hey, keep your voices down!

223
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,023
You're being rude to
the other passengers!

224
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,958
Did you see the
look on his face?!

225
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,060
"A game like this says nothing
about one's character."

226
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,195
Can you believe that guy?!

227
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,866
Insects! The students
of Seika High are
nothing but insects!

228
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,101
I refuse to breathe
the same air
as you heathens!

229
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,403
I bet he went home and
cried to his mommy!

230
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,238
Loser!

231
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,640
(Laughing)

232
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,007
That was awesome!

233
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,143
Usui, Miss President‐
thank you!

234
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,747
You two shouldn't so cocky,
after all, you were
at fault, too.

235
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,349
The next time something
like this happens‐

236
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,085
Then next time...

237
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,220
we'll ask for your advice!

238
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,189
Oh...

239
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,894
Geez, those guys
are such a handful...

240
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,164
You're quite the handful
yourself, Miss President.

241
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:48,168
Do you think that the other
Miyabigaoka students
think like that guy?

242
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,403
I'm sure they're not
ALL that bad.

243
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:55,375
In fact, I bet being rich comes
with its own set of problems
we can't even imagine...

244
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:03,383
Thus, Mr. President, I request
that we demand a formal apology
from Seika High at once!

245
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,987
Its students are as
undisciplined as
they are dangerous.

246
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,355
The very fact that, out of
that school full of men,

247
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,358
they chose a WOMAN
as their president,
clearly shows their‐

248
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,128
Shut up, Koganei.

249
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,565
Huh...

250
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:53,534
<Students chatter>

251
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,903
Those guys're from Miyabigaoka.

252
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,973
What the hell are
THOSE GUYS doing at Seika?

253
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:00,974
Miss President!

254
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,375
What is it?

255
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,545
Miyabigaoka's student
council president!

256
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,146
Huh?

257
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,422
That guy's the heir to the
Igarashi Conglomerate!

258
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,625
I've seen him
in magazines!

259
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,126
What should we do?

260
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,228
Do you think he's come
to complain to Misaki?

261
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,932
Don't worry. I'm sure Misaki
will be able to handle
things just fine.

262
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:41,247
I am Tora Igarashi,
Miyabigaoka's Student
Council President.

263
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,484
And what business does
Miyabigaoka's president
have with us today?

264
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:48,722
It would appear that a student
from our school has greatly
offended you.

265
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,223
My humblest apologies.

266
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,157
Uh...

267
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,659
Oh!

268
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,095
I have taken the liberty of
contacting the school president

269
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,898
to request that he be
expelled immediately.

270
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,834
E‐expelled?
That's way too excessive!

271
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,070
Our students were
the ones who hit him!

272
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,439
Then may I humbly ask for
your forgiveness, ma'am?

273
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,608
My forgiveness?

274
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,610
You didn't have to come
all the way over here

275
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,011
to ask something like that...

276
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,014
Well then, may I request
that he not be expelled?

277
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,248
Yes, of course.

278
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,584
I'm relieved to hear
you say that.

279
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,754
And I'm pleased to see
the rumors about you
have proven to be true.

280
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,322
Rumors?

281
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,125
Yes. I'd heard that you always
think of your students first,

282
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,562
and that you are not only fair,
but considerate as well.

283
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,165
Oh, wow! He's so polite!

284
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,868
And such good manners‐ he's
quite the gentleman isn't he?

285
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,336
(Boys laughing)

286
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,170
You better run!

287
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,438
You're never
gonna catch me!

288
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,106
Those guys are
screwing around again!

289
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,207
Stop right there!

290
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,108
Ah!

291
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,777
(Misaki roars)

292
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,378
Oh!

293
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,548
Stay with me!

294
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,650
I told you, quit running
around like morons

295
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,585
and use that energy to STUDY!

296
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:56,156
Oh crap! I completely forgot
about President Igarashi!

297
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,591
[IGARASHI]
Wonderful!

298
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,493
To think‐ you are as strong
as you are beautiful!

299
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,863
You are truly an amazing
woman, Miss President!

300
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,166
To be honest, I did not simply
come here to apologize,

301
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,602
but to ask you for
a favor as well.

302
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,972
Misaki Ayuzawa, would you
please do me the honor

303
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,207
of joining the Miyabigaoka
Student Council?

304
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,742
Huh?

305
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:17,911
Huh?

306
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:18,812
Huh?

307
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,747
Huuuh...?

308
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,086
Wait a second...
that doesn't make
any sense at all.

309
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,790
I can't be on the student
council of a school that
I don't even go to...

310
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,625
You would transfer,
of course.

311
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,094
We will make the arrangements
for your uniform,

312
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,629
as well as anything else
you might require.

313
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,698
Y‐yeah, but‐! I'm from
a really poor family,

314
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,067
and there's no way we
could afford the tuition
at a fancy place like that!

315
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,669
It's just not possible‐

316
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,170
Then how about this:

317
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,273
I'll prepare a scholarship
exclusively for you.

318
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,375
For someone as talented
and hardworking as yourself,

319
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,645
I'm sure all expenses
would be covered.

320
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,413
I can't ask you to‐

321
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,317
I will personally ensure
that you have everything
you could ever need.

322
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:04,791
Please consider my offer...
Miss Ayuzawa.

323
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,293
[IGARASHI]
Well then, I suppose we
should be on our way.

324
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,163
I'll be eagerly
awaiting your response.

325
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,299
President Igarashi,
I don't think I can...

326
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,036
Miss Misaki Ayuzawa...

327
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,371
Before you graced these
hallways with your presence,

328
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,675
Seika High was a
completely different
school than it is today.

329
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,310
But under your guidance,
the current student council has

330
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,247
come together to make a campus
that is truly impressive.

331
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,584
It is truly a school
to be proud of.

332
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,599
Damn, it was hot in there!

333
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,002
No surprise, I guess.
That broke‐ass school
can't even afford a REAL AC.

334
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,271
Still... HAHA!

335
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,774
Did you see when she
clotheslined that one guy?!

336
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,208
That was friggin' hilarious!

337
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,543
She threw'im
right on the ground!

338
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,845
She's way more interesting
than I thought...

339
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,548
I like her... Misaki Ayuzawa.

340
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,551
I'm lookin' forward to seeing
how things play out. Maki.

341
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,686
Sir.

342
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,020
Keep an eye on that chick

343
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,454
and don't let her outta
your sight, got it?

344
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,756
Sir.

345
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,662
[SHIROKAWA]
Aw, c'mon.

346
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,431
It's girls only today?!
Man, this blows.

347
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,567
[SARASHINA]
We can't even see
through the glass!

348
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,571
Welcome back to Maid Latte.

349
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,009
Swoooooon.

350
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,512
Would you like me to
show you to your seats?

351
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,213
O‐okay!

352
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,782
Oh!

353
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,523
Please watch your step, My Lady.

354
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,360
You're so cool, Mr. Misa!

355
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,395
That's Misa for you!
She's a natural!

356
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,164
It's thanks to her that
we could even pull an event

357
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,066
like this off
in the first place.

358
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,102
She's almost more popular
with the girls than she
is with the boys‐

359
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,270
they're practically melting!

360
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,039
I can't believe it!

361
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,341
This is the first time the shop
has been completely boy‐free!

362
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,009
I'm so happy!

363
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,310
This is going to be fun!

364
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,947
You seem awfully
pleased, Mr. Misaki.

365
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,815
Because I'm so popular.

366
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,216
Yeah, with other girls.

367
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,053
Shut it, you!
I'm a man at heart, anyway!

368
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,521
But still...
Huh?

369
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,390
It sure feels nice to get
so many compliments.

370
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,560
Woo‐hoo! Woo‐hoo!

371
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,528
If guys acted more like this,

372
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,064
I might cut them a little
slack every now and then.

373
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,298
What do you mean?

374
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,733
Like if they were
kinder to women,

375
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,802
and trustworthy,
and more gentlemanly.

376
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,070
So, you mean...

377
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,937
like me?

378
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,372
NO!

379
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,109
Then like Miyabigaoka's
student council president?

380
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,311
W‐what are you talking about?

381
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,080
This doesn't have
anything to do with him!

382
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,717
Quit running your mouth and
just get back to work already!

383
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,394
Do you know what
you'd like to order?

384
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,229
No, I'm having trouble
making up my mind.

385
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,999
Well then, why don't I
help you decide, Miss?

386
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,367
Mr. Misaki,
you're the coolest!

387
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,670
I wish there were more
boys out there like you!

388
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,238
Thank you.

389
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,541
So, which one would Mr. Misaki
be in a relationship?

390
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,376
Duh, it's totally obvious!
That deep voice,
those sultry eyes!

391
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,945
She's the dominant one!

392
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,047
Well, I wouldn't mind seeing
her on the receiving end!

393
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,649
Ooh, I'd totally
like to see that!

394
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,651
What the heck are they
talking about?
I know right!

395
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,821
[GIRL]
This is so awesome. I wish
I could come here every day.

396
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,824
In that case,
I'd recommend this one.

397
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:27,460
You'd like to know
MY favorite dish?

398
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,896
Here.
You'd like to feed me?

399
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,498
Say "Aaah."
Aaah.

400
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,936
[GIRLS]
She's perfect...
a little too perfect!

401
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,303
Girls sure are cute!

402
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,941
They're way more pure and
charming than men are.

403
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,210
Maybe I'll start dressing
as a boy from now...

404
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,112
But what were those
two girls talking about?

405
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,781
Being dominant?
And receiving?

406
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,784
Hey, Usui, do you
know what those mean?

407
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:53,386
You really want
me to tell you?

408
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,321
Wh‐what the heck
are you doing?!

409
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,091
I was all sweaty,
so I wanted to
change my undershirt.

410
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,694
Aren't you going
to change, too?

411
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,096
I'm not going to change
while you're here!

412
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:07,067
Why not? Weren't you
the one who said you
were a man at heart?

413
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,503
B‐but the others could‐

414
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:13,339
What's wrong?
Hurry up and strip.

415
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,644
Or would you prefer
I strip you instead...

416
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,679
Mr. Misaki?

417
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,247
Stop it...

418
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,583
Well, well.

419
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:25,786
Looks like you ARE a girl
after all, Ayuzawa.

420
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,491
Now you know what it means
to be the "dominant" one.

421
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,460
I've had enough of this.

422
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:39,032
How long do you think
you can keep messing
with me like this?

423
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,136
I don't want to see you
ever again, Usui.

424
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:45,038
Just leave me alone.

425
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:59,352
Sir, here's the report
you requested on
Misaki Ayuzawa.

426
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:02,989
Oh!

427
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,358
Haha! No freakin' way!

428
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,893
I don't believe it...

429
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,530
that girl really is
somethin' else, isn't she?

430
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,502
Thanks to this, I've
just thought up a very
special welcome party

431
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,839
for Miss Misaki Ayuzawa.

432
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,766
[MISAKI]
I never thought I'd be
offered the chance to

433
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,801
attend a school
like Miyabigaoka...

434
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,971
But if I transferred,
Seika would just go back
to the way it was before,

435
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,440
and the girls would be
totally defenseless.

436
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,776
[USUI]
You worry too much,
Miss President.

437
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,645
Instead of thinking
about yourself,

438
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,280
you're too concerned with
leaving the girls behind.

439
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,815
And if you went to Miyabigaoka,

440
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,117
you may not able to work at
the Maid Latte anymore...

441
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,521
[MISAKI]
Usui! Didn't I say I never
wanted to see you again!

442
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,023
[USUI]
Oh, that's right.

443
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,025
See you, Miss President.
