1
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,035
(GIRLS in awe)

2
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,070
[GIRL A]
Hey, did you see that guy?

3
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,239
[GIRL B]
Sure did! He was super cute,
wasn't he?

4
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,109
[GIRL C]
That uniform was for Seika
High, right?

5
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,414
[SARASHINA]
Hey, Kurotatsu! Is that a Misa
charm I see on your bag?

6
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,750
[KUROSAKI]
You bet it is‐ handmade
by yours truly!

7
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,186
[SHIROKAWA]
Whoa! I can't tell if I'm
impressed or creeped out! Make
one for me, too.

8
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,322
[KUROSAKI]
Leave it to me! But you've gotta
keep it hidden at school!

9
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,624
[SARASHINA]
Yeah, we know!

10
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,859
[SHIROKAWA]
It would be bad if anyone saw.

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,729
[TRIO]
Yahoo!

12
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,898
[GIRL A] Soooo... my lunch
box looks like it only has
3 trays‐ but it really has 6!

13
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,535
[GIRL B] My repertoire of
impersonations has expanded
dramatically!

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,772
[GIRL C]
CBS acquired the Fender
companies in 1965, didn't they?

15
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,613
[SHINTANI]
Hmm... Hmph.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,623
[MISAKI]
You will clean out your
clubrooms and that's final!

17
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,825
[BOYS] Whoa!

18
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,227
[BOY A]
But Miss President,
you can't suddenly...

19
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,231
[MISAKI]
There's nothing "sudden" about
it! I've been telling you to
clean them for weeks!

20
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:51,505
And yet... what the hell is
this?! The club building smells
so funky that it's starting to
give off an evil aura!

21
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,174
(BOYS complaining)
[BOY A] What are
you talking about!?
[BOY B] We don't see anything!

22
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,377
[MISAKI]
That's because you pigs roll
around in this stench day in
and day out!

23
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,682
[BOYS] Huh? (back
to complaining)
[BOY B] Who cares about some
stupid smelly aura?

24
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,786
[MISAKI]
Ungh! Enough arguing‐ everyone
will come in tomorrow to clean.

25
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,988
[BOY C]
There's no way we can
finish in one day!

26
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,657
[BOY A]
We're probably gonna have to
stay super late to get all
of it done.

27
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,594
[BOY B]
You won't even give us any
time to eat, will you? Slave
driver...

28
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,529
[YUKIMURA] Excuse me, everyone?
[ALL] Huh?

29
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,231
[YUKIMURA]
I'll make sure to prepare enough
snacks for everyone.

30
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,967
So won't you please take
care of the cleaning?

31
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,468
[YUKIMURA]
I can make rice balls...

32
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,841
[MISAKI]
Yukimura! Where did YOU come
from?

33
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,144
[YUKIMURA]
They surrounded you, and I just
panicked... I'm sorry!

34
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,414
[MISAKI]
Well, thanks to you, it looks
like this cleaning will actually
happen.

35
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,918
[YUKIMURA]
But now that I think about it,
how am I going to make enough
snacks for all of those people?!

36
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,086
[KANOU]
In such a short amount of
time, it's impossible.

37
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,023
[YUKIMURA]
Don't say that, Kanou, what am I
going to do?! (sobbing)

38
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,825
[KANOU]
Well, don't cry about it.

39
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,460
Everyone on the student council
will pitch in and make it work
somehow.

40
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,931
After all, it was the council
that requested the buildings be
cleaned in the first place.

41
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,867
[YUKIMURA]
I will put my heart and soul
into making these rice balls!

42
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,070
[MISAKI]
I wonder if those guys will be
okay with one per person...?

43
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,741
[KANOU]
They definitely will not.

44
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:07,080
[YUKIMURA]
Mr. Usui! Aha... It's been so
long! You've been absent for a
while now, haven't you?

45
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,882
[USUI]
Yeah. I got a little hurt.

46
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,717
[YUKIMURA] Wha!

47
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,725
[USUI]
It's been awhile...
Miss President.

48
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,495
[MISAKI]
Are you all better now?

49
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,698
[USUI] Thanks to you I am.
[KANOU] Uh?

50
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,568
[MISAKI]
I'm sure you're glad to be back.
Let's go, Yukimura.

51
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,670
[YUKIMURA]
Uh, um... Wait,
Miss President!

52
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,638
[YUKIMURA]
Oh, by the way, Mr. Usui.

53
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,107
If you had to pick your
favorite food to snack on,
what would it be?

54
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,108
Rice soup.

55
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,610
[MISAKI] Ulp!
[KANOU] Huh?

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,444
[YUKIMURA]
No, um, I mean more like

57
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,247
the kind of snack you'd enjoy
after doing a lot of hard work.

58
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:45,118
[USUI] What's wrong
with rice soup?
[YUKIMURA] Huh?!
But why rice soup?!

59
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,289
[MAN]
Well, if you need anything
you just let me know.

60
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,927
[MISAKI]
Excuse me, sir.

61
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,095
[MAN]
Ah...

62
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,329
[MISAKI]
Yes?

63
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,231
[MAN]
Let's just wait till Monday.

64
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,134
[MISAKI]
Actually, I have something to
ask about tomorrow's campus
cleanup.

65
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,470
[MAN] Ugh...
[MISAKI] I'd like to provide
some snacks for the club
members.

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,377
[YUKIMURA]
Kanou! I'll be running late
tonight, so would you go on
ahead?

67
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,779
[KANOU]
Understood, sir.

68
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,515
[BOY]
Mr. Vice President, a moment!

69
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,082
[YUKIMURA]
See you later, Kanou!

70
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,351
[MISAKI]
You two have become great
friends, haven't you?

71
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,820
[KANOU]
And you, President...

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,756
You two have become a great
couple, haven't you?

73
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,726
[MISAKI]
Huh? What are you talking about?

74
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,461
[KANOU]
I don't really understand what
you're trying to hide it for.

75
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,631
[MISAKI]
Seriously, what are
you talking about?

76
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,399
[KANOU]
You and Usui‐ you're dating
aren't you? ARGH!

77
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,401
[MISAKI] Are you an idiot?!
[KANOU] (struggling)

78
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,104
[MISAKI]
You've gotta be kidding me! Who
would date a perverted weirdo
like him?!

79
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:42,242
[KANOU]
But why did you look after him
and make him rice soup if you're
not his girlfriend?!

80
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,944
(MISAKI gasps)

81
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,813
[MISAKI]
How‐ How did you know...?

82
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,150
[KANOU]
I'm sorry. I could
just tell somehow.

83
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,956
[MISAKI]
(breath) That was because...
I owed him a lot of favors and
I had to pay him back somehow.

84
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:59,325
[MISAKI]
I couldn't help it. So don't go
getting the wrong idea!

85
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,628
[KANOU]
I... I'm sorry I asked.

86
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,166
[KANOU]
So, you have another one...
a love letter, I mean...

87
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,503
[USUI] Aah, what a headache.
Will you go for me?
[KANOU] Huh?

88
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,538
She said she's waiting in the
second‐years' classroom.

89
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,073
[KANOU]
I can't go in your place!

90
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,776
[USUI]
What, you're saying you're
still scared of girls?

91
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,878
[KANOU]
That's not the problem
here and you know it!

92
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,946
[USUI]
You're kinda useless,
aren't you, Kanou?

93
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,115
[KANOU] Wha?!
[USUI] Fine, then throw this
garbage away.

94
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,717
[KANOU] Huh?

95
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,554
[USUI]
Calm down‐ I was just kidding.

96
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,259
[KANOU]
Then why don't you just
go out with someone?

97
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,730
[KANOU]
If it's such a "headache,"
why not properly date someone?

98
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,001
[KANOU]
There'd probably be fewer of
these confessions. And also...

99
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,905
[KANOU]
It looks like President Ayuzawa
hasn't noticed how much you... I
mean...

100
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,741
[USUI]
You sure are awfully talkative
today, aren't you, Kanou?

101
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,209
[KANOU] Huh?

102
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,512
[USUI]
Does seeing this make you
annoyed? Frustrated?

103
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,347
[KANOU]
Uh, no, that's not what I am
saying, I just‐

104
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,282
[USUI]
Look, I'm not angry
about it, you know.

105
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,418
[KANOU]
Eh? I see...

106
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,022
[USUI] I'm just sick of it...
all of that stuff.
(KANOU groaning)

107
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,659
[USUI]
Trying to date someone
"properly" is an even...
bigger headache.

108
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,061
[KANOU]
A "headache"... huh...

109
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,834
[MAIDS]
Thank you for coming, Master!

110
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,238
[SATSUKI]
What are you doing here, Aoi?
And why are you wearing one of
our uniforms again?

111
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,140
[AOI] What's the big deal‐ the
shop's already closed...

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,208
[HONOKA] I told you, I was
supposed to be the one in the
middle!

113
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,310
[SATSUKI] Hurry up and
go home, middle‐schooler!
[AOI] Hey! Let go of me!

114
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,780
[ERIKA]
Well, guess it's time for us to
head home, too.

115
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,715
[SUBARU]
Should we go get something to
eat?

116
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,250
[HONOKA]
Can I come with you guys, too?

117
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,418
[SUBARU] Of course!
[ERIKA] Do you know
anywhere good?

118
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,220
[BOTH]
We're the kitchen sisters!

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,623
[SEN‐CHAN]
We didn't have as many orders
for rice dishes today

120
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,725
as we thought we would, so
we have a lot of extra rice.

121
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:43,229
[MOCCHI]
We made rice balls with the
leftovers‐ why don't we all eat
them together?

122
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,166
[SUBARU]
Well, it looks like we'll be
dining at Maid Latte tonight.

123
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,701
[ERIKA]
It certainly is cheaper.

124
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,402
[HONOKA]
Yeah, that's for sure.

125
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,271
[SATSUKI]
Too bad Misa's not here‐

126
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,973
I could've given her
some to take home.

127
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,240
[AOI]
Mmm, Tasty.

128
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:00,514
[MISAKI]
(strained) Come on! Just
turn into a triangle already!

129
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,483
[USUI]
Rice Soup.

130
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,054
[MISAKI]
No, no! I can't get
distracted! (determined)

131
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,659
[MISAKI]
If I... just squeeze it
tighter... it should work!

132
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,195
[SUZUNA]
Hey Sis. What are
you doing in here?

133
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:19,399
[MISAKI]
Oh nothing... just practicing
how to make rice balls.

134
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,635
[MISAKI]
What the‐?!

135
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,538
[MISAKI]
I can't waste any more rice...

136
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,507
[MISAKI] Guuuuhhhh...

137
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,108
[SUZUNA]
Hey... I know...

138
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,544
[MISAKI] Huh?
[SUZUNA] Then why
don't you try this?

139
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,313
Mix tiny balls of tissue in
with the rest of the rice.

140
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,883
[MISAKI]
Whoa! Great idea, Suzuna! Being
poor sure makes you creative.

141
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,086
[MISAKI]
All right! Now I can go on a
rice ball‐making rampage!

142
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,556
[SUZUNA]
Please don't burn
the house down.

143
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,594
[MISAKI]
Okay! Now to begin making them
for real!

144
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,164
[YUKIMURA]
Miss President, you're not
looking too well. Did you sleep
okay?

145
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,767
[MISAKI]
I‐it's nothing at all!
I'm fine‐ really!

146
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,304
[MISAKI, thinking]
I've got this. I finally got
the shape down this morning.
I can definitely make these!

147
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,074
[MISAKI]
All right, everyone! We've got
some rice balls to make!

148
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,210
[YUKIMURA]
Oh! Miss President, it looks
like we have another helper!

149
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,246
[KANOU]
Yes... I'm available...

150
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,750
[MISAKI]
O‐oh great. Thank you...

151
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,587
[KANOU]
I haven't seen Usui at all
today, is he here?

152
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,823
[YUKIMURA]
Um... Now that you mention it,
he hasn't shown up today.

153
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,027
[KANOU]
Tell me, Yukimura... what do you
think about Usui and President
Ayuzawa.

154
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,696
[YUKIMURA]
I think they're great people.

155
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,230
[KANOU]
That's not exactly what I meant.

156
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,201
[YUKIMURA]
Ouch! What do you mean then,
about them?

157
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,737
[KANOU]
I mean... what do you think
about their relationship?

158
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,439
[YUKIMURA] Oh...
[USUI] Bwsh!
[MISAKI] Flash!

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,608
[YUKIMURA]
They're a golden combination!

160
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,209
[KANOU]
A what now?!

161
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,845
[YUKIMURA]
They're both incredible.

162
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,847
[YUKIMURA]
They're good at
everything they do.

163
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,417
Sometimes, it seems like
they're on a totally different
level than everyone else.

164
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,021
[YUKIMURA]
It's like they're part of a
world someone like me could
never enter.

165
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:52,425
[YUKIMURA]
Miss President... is always
having to come to my rescue.

166
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,362
[YUKIMURA]
If I could just be a little more
like Mr. Usui, I could be more
helpful to her.

167
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:01,535
[KANOU]
Huh? Yukimura... do you like
President Ayuzawa?

168
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,004
Yup. I like her very much.

169
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,872
[KANOU]
(sigh) That's quite the
confession...

170
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,774
[YUKIMURA]
No! Wait a minute! I didn't mean
it like THAT!

171
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,309
I don't "LIKE her" like her!

172
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,244
[MISAKI]
Dammit, Yukimura! What are you
blabbering about?

173
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,378
Less talking, more rice‐balling!

174
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,880
[YUKIMURA]
Y‐yes, ma'am!

175
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,427
[BOY]
I'm tired of waiting all day...
This is too much work.

176
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,163
[BOY] We're outta here!

177
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:35,569
[SHINTANI]
(sniff) (chomp) I ain't been
eating enough vegetables lately.

178
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,203
[USUI] Huh?

179
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,054
[MISAKI]
And... Finished!

180
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,793
[MISAKI]
Good job, everyone! You all made
some great rice balls!

181
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,828
[KANOU]
Huh? What's with these deformed
ones over here?

182
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,664
[ALL]
(freaking out)
Wait! Those are...!

183
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,199
[MISAKI] They're OBVIOUSLY rice
balls, Kanou.
[KANOU] (scared) HUH!

184
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,334
[MISAKI]
Can't you tell just by looking
at them?!

185
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,538
[KANOU] Eh? B‐But they
don't look like‐
[MISAKI] Then try eating one!

186
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,775
[MISAKI] See, it's a rice ball!
It's just a little salty!

187
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,578
[KANOU] But, they're
making a disturbing sound!
[MISAKI] You're hearing things.

188
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,013
[BOYS]
WHERE THE SNACKS AT?!

189
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,515
[MISAKI]
Hey, you guys‐! AHHH!

190
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,883
[BOY A]
They're ready!

191
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,985
[BOYS]
(frantic eating)

192
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,188
[MISAKI]
(struggling) Hey, hey! What are
you...? Have you even done any
cleaning yet?

193
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,757
[BOY B] What are these things?
[BOY A] There are some weird
balls mixed in here.

194
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,392
[BOY C]
Let's toss 'em.

195
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,261
[SHINTANI]
Gwah!

196
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,430
[KANAGAWA]
Hey, this is bad.

197
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,600
[YUKIMURA]
It's getting completely
out of control!

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,902
[MISAKI]
I hope you morons are
prepared...

199
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,404
[MISAKI]
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO BRING THE PAIN!

200
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,678
(BOYS screaming)
[BOY B] Somebody save us!

201
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,980
[MISAKI]
Gleam!

202
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,816
[MISAKI]
Stomp. Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.

203
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,884
[KANAGAWA]
Well, I guess it was...
nice knowing them...

204
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,187
[YUKIMURA]
There's nothing we can do for
them now‐ let's finish cleaning
things up.

205
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,723
[SHINTANI]
Ow...

206
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,991
[SHINTANI] FOOD!

207
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,364
[SHIROKAWA]
We got Misa's rice balls!

208
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,567
[SARASHINA] Such treasures!
[KUROSAKI] They're incredible!

209
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,302
[SHIROKAWA] Such treasures.
[SARASHINA] I'll cherish this
for the rest of my life!

210
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,338
[KUROSAKI]
What do you think
they're made of?

211
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,843
[MISAKI]
Hm? Those guys...

212
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,479
[MISAKI]
They cleaned up everything
before they went home.

213
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:33,954
[MISAKI]
If they were going to clean,
couldn't they have at least
thrown these away, too?

214
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:38,525
Ugh! These are pretty terrible.
So much for staying up
all night to make them...

215
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,328
Even that rice soup I
made before is better
than these things.

216
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,967
(sigh) There's no way that he
would ever want to eat something
like this monstrosity.

217
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,971
(yawn) I'm so tired...

218
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,483
[USUI]
(snorting) How did she even
make these? (chuckles)

219
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,957
[USUI]
Well... at least you gave it
your all, right Ayuzawa?

220
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,000
[USUI]
Good work today.

221
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,235
[YUKIMURA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I brought our bags, too!

222
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,871
[KANOU] I really don't
understand them at all.
[YUKIMURA] Huh?

223
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:30,143
[KANOU]
How can they care so much for
each other and yet never tell
each other how they feel?

224
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,278
[KANOU]
Why do they avoid it...

225
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,281
instead of trying
to move forward?

226
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,584
[YUKIMURA]
What are you grumbling about?

227
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,668
[MISAKI, thinking]
When I woke up yesterday, all of
those rice ball rejects were
gone...I wonder where they went?

228
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,671
[MISAKI, thinking]
Talk about strange...
[USUI] Miss President.

229
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,173
[MISAKI]
Gah! Wh‐Why are you always
popping up out of thin
air like that?!

230
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:04,077
[USUI] Huh? Really? I thought I
appeared pretty normally.
[MISAKI] The hell you did!

231
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,647
[USUI]
Come on, it's not like I fell
out of the sky or something.

232
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,081
[MISAKI] Duh, stupid!
[SHINTANI] (chomp)

233
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,383
[MISAKI]
People don't just fall
out of the sky‐!

234
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:18,058
[SHINTANI]
(munching) Aah, thank goodness.
I can't believe I almost dropped
my precious food like that!

235
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,595
(MISAKI stunned)
[SHINTANI] Yeah, that sure was
clumsy of me.

236
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,333
[HOMEROOM TEACHER] Class, this
is Hinata Shintani, a transfer
student.
[MISAKI] Uh?

237
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,838
[HOMEROOM TEACHER]
He was born here, but moved to
Kyushu for about 10... Eh?
What's the matter?

238
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,874
[BOY D]
Uh? What's your problem, man?

239
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,009
[SHINTANI]
(sniff) I smell honey and lemon.

240
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,378
[BOY D]
Ah? You mean...

241
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,445
[BOY D]
this?

242
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,715
[SHINTANI] Ahhhhh!

243
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,884
[BOY I] He looks
like he wants it.
[BOY J] He REALLY looks
like he wants it.

244
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,521
[BOY D]
Here, take it dude. Just quit
staring at me like that, ya
weirdo.

245
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,424
Huh? You really mean it?! You're
a stand‐up guy, you know that!
Don't mind if I do‐

246
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,895
[HOMEROOM TEACHER]
Hey, Shintani! You can't eat
in homeroom... you... know...

247
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,868
[BOYS] He looks sad.
[BOY J] He looks REALLY sad.

248
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,403
[SHINTANI]
I can't?

249
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:07,107
[HOMEROOM TEACHER]
Um, well, maybe... just this
once...

250
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,942
[MISAKI]
Of course you can't keep it!

251
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,277
Sir, you can't baby him right
off that like this!

252
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,780
[MISAKI]
He has to be held to the same
standard as everyone else.

253
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,382
[HOMEROOM TEACHER]
Yes, ah, you're right.

254
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,887
[MISAKI]
It was "Shintani"... wasn't it?
Please put that candy away now.

255
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,923
[SHINTANI]
You big meanie! Wahhh!

256
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:28,895
[MISAKI] Hey now! What're you
getting so worked up for? And
you guys, keep it down!

257
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,764
[MISAKI]
And, over here is the gym.

258
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,198
(SHINTANI munching)

259
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,267
[MISAKI]
Hey! How many times do
I have to tell you?

260
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,637
Quit eating while you're
walking, it's rude!

261
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,105
[SHINTANI]
I can't help it. I'm
hungry so I gotta eat.

262
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,908
[MISAKI] Confiscated!
[SHINTANI] Huh? No!
[MISAKI] Don't "no" me, mister!

263
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,044
[SHINTANI] But those are
mine! (sobbing)
[KOSUGI] Miss President, sorry
to bother you.

264
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,580
[KOSUGI]
Could you please take a look
at the handouts for today's
meeting?

265
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,114
[MISAKI]
Oh, sure thing.

266
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,651
[MISAKI]
These bread crusts are coming
with me!

267
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,020
[SHINTANI]
Idiot! Meanie! (wailing)

268
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,723
[MISAKI]
Is that guy really
a high‐school student?

269
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,968
[SHINTANI]
(sigh)

270
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,302
[BOY D]
Hey, new guy!

271
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,907
[BOY I]
Allow us to introduce
ourselves...

272
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,578
[MISAKI]
Just fix this part right here
and add what I mentioned earlier
and it'll be perfect.

273
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:21,114
[MISAKI]
And please make enough copies
for everyone, okay?

274
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,150
[USUI]
You sure have been spending a
lot of time with that transfer
student, Miss President.

275
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,421
[USUI]
You're not paying any attention
to me at all. That makes me feel
lonely.

276
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,391
[MISAKI]
You liar! You don't look
"lonely" at all.

277
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,294
[MISAKI]
You haven't even been showing
yourself all day.

278
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,430
[USUI]
Oh? But I've been watching you
this whole time, Misa.

279
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,132
[MISAKI]
No surprise there, after all
you're a pervert stalker‐

280
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,301
[USUI]
You saw, didn't you, Ayuzawa?

281
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,404
[USUI]
You saw me.

282
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,273
[USUI]
You saw me, didn't you?

283
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,475
[SAKURA]
There you are, Misaki!

284
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,277
[SAKURA]
That transfer student's
in trouble!

285
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,946
A bunch of guys have
him surrounded!

286
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,347
[MISAKI]
What?!

287
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,982
[SHIZUKO]
It looked like a dangerous
situation,

288
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,818
so we thought we should
inform you right away.

289
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,220
[MISAKI] Where?
[SAKURA] This way!

290
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,225
[MISAKI]
Over there, huh?

291
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,060
[MISAKI]
Hey, what are you guys‐?!

292
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,500
[MISAKI]
THIS is a "dangerous situation"?

293
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,503
[SHIZUKO]
No‐ earlier it seemed as if

294
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,438
they were going to break
into a fight at any moment!

295
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,507
[SHINTANI] ahhh....
(BOYS chuckling)

296
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,209
[BOY J]
Hey, it's my turn next‐ try and
guess what I'VE got!

297
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,378
[BOY J]
If you get it right,
I'll give you a reward!

298
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,449
[SHINTANI]
(sniff) (grin) Cheese‐flavored
potato chips!

299
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,917
[BOYS] Whoa!
[BOY J] That's right!

300
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,653
[BOY F]
You're awesome, Shintani!

301
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,522
[SHINTANI]
Reward, reward...!

302
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,457
[BOY G]
How'd you know even though the
bag's not open?

303
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,326
[BOY E]
Dude, I can't believe you eat so
much and don't get fat.

304
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,395
[SHINTANI]
Well, back in the day, I was
SUPER fat!

305
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,966
[SHINTANI]
But when I was in elementary
school, both my parents died in
a car wreck,

306
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,101
and I went to live with
my Grampaw in Kyushu.

307
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,037
[SHINTANI]
It was way out in the country,
with no candy shops around,

308
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,741
so since the only things to eat
were veggies I ended up droppin'
some weight.

309
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,010
[SHINTANI]
But then Gramps said, "All the
fields in the world

310
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,480
ain't enough to feed ya‐
yer gonna eat us straight
out of house an' home!"

311
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:05,251
[SHINTANI] So I came back here,
where I used to live.
[BOY J] Oh wow, that was an
unexpectedly tragic back story.

312
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,653
[BOY J]
So, you live all by yourself?

313
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,388
[SHINTANI] Yeah.
[BOY I] What about tuition?

314
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,257
[SHINTANI]
I get by on what my folks left
behind for me.

315
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,359
[BOYS]
You've been through so
much, haven't you!

316
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,261
[SHINTANI] Huh? Really?
[BOYS sobbing)

317
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,497
[BOY J]
I thought he was just some idiot
who ate like a pig.

318
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,766
[BOY I]
He's smiling on the outside,
but he's hurting on the inside!

319
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,135
[SHINTANI]
"Hurting"? How come?

320
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:27,140
It's no biggie. I just came back
to this town so I could find my
first love, that's all, ya see.

321
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,642
[ALL]
Huh?

322
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,243
[SHINTANI]
When I thought about
seeing her again,

323
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,745
I just couldn't control myself!

324
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,347
[BOY I]
But, wait, didn't your grandpa
kick you out?

325
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,650
[SHINTANI]
Well, the thing about Gramps
is...

326
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,020
[SHINTANI]
He said, "I was just pullin'
your leg! Don't leave!" but I
was all,

327
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,123
[SHINTANI]
"Don't worry, Gramps‐ I'll come
back when it looks like you're
gonna die."

328
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,759
[GRANDPA]
I'm more worried
'bout you than me!

329
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,995
[BOY E]
So then you came back just to
see that girl again?

330
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:54,167
[SHINTANI]
Yup! From here on out I'll be
searching for her high an'low,
day‐in an' day‐out!

331
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,270
[SHINTANI]
She was so kind and happy, and
she looked after me tenderly...

332
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,108
[SHINTANI]
Yeah! She's like a single,
lovely flower bloomin' in the
fields...

333
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,647
[SHINTANI]
Aah, how I long for you to feed
me sweet cake once again...!

334
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,314
[SHINTANI] Just wait, My
Darling! I'll find you!
[MISAKI] Hold it, Shintani!

335
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,617
[MISAKI]
Does that girl even go to this
school?

336
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:13,887
[SHINTANI]
Dunno.

337
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,188
[MISAKI]
Ack! You don't know?!

338
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,790
Then how exactly do you plan to
find her?!

339
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,927
No idea. But that girl...
I made her a promise...

340
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,498
I promised to stay by
Misaki's side no matter what.

341
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,742
[SAKURA]
Did he... just say "Misaki"?

342
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,979
[BOY J]
(chuckling) Dude, it's supposed
to be the other way around!

343
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,517
[BOY I]
Any guy promising to stick by a
girl? You sure are one hopeless
guy aren't you?

344
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,652
[SHINTANI]
But that's the promise I made.

345
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:49,523
[BOY H]
Hang on... I think I've heard
the name "Misaki" somewhere
before...

346
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,196
(YOUNG SHINTANI straining)

347
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,364
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Hey, that's dangerous!

348
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,734
[YOUNG SHINTANI] Ahhhh!
[YOUNG MISAKI] Oh?

349
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,070
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Geez, I told you not to climb up
that far, Yoh.

350
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,006
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Here. Say "Aah," 'kay?

351
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,742
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Don't go running off climbing
trees anymore.

352
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:12,212
You have to promise to stay
by side from now on, okay?

353
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,447
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
Okay, Misaki. I promise.

354
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,585
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
I'll stay by you forever and
ever no matter what.

355
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,987
[MISAKI] (horrific realization)
[SAKURA] Say, Misaki...

356
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,824
[SAKURA]
Are you the same "Misaki" that
boy's been talking about?

357
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,892
[SHIZUKO]
Surely he would've
noticed by now?

358
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,894
[SHIZUKO] After all the time
they've spent talking

359
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,130
you would think he would
have recognized her at
least to some degree...

360
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,432
[MISAKI] Hinata... Yohkoh...
[BOTH] Huh?

361
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:37,538
[MISAKI]
When I was in elementary school,
there was a boy in my class with
the nickname "Yohkoh"...

362
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:40,206
[MISAKI]
...because his name could be
read that way, too.

363
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,109
[MISAKI]
That kid was always eating, and
he was also a little on the
chunky side.

364
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,780
[SAKURA] Huh?! Then...
[SHIZUKO] Then that means
that boy's first love was...!

365
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,549
[MISAKI]
Probably me.

366
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,885
[SAKURA] Does that mean you and
Hinata used to date?!
[MISAKI] Huh?!

367
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,187
[SAKURA]
(squeal) What an
exciting turn of events!

368
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,922
[MISAKI]
What makes you say that?!

369
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,625
[BOY H] Awesome!
[BOY J] You all right, Hinata?
[MISAKI] That idiot!

370
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,697
[SHINTANI]
Whoa... I can see the entire
campus from up here.

371
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,065
[SHINTANI]
Okay...

372
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:08,201
[SHINTANI]
Oh, Misa! Come out come out
wherever you are!

373
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:11,037
[BOY I, chuckling] Oh boy,
there he goes.
[BOY H] That's hilarious.

374
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,306
[BOY J] He's the best!
[SHINTANI] Hey Misaki!
[MISAKI] This is no time
for laughing!

375
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,408
[MISAKI]
Hurry up and get down
from there, Shintani!

376
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,311
Up here I won't be bothered
by a certain MEANIE!

377
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,014
[SHINTANI]
Hey! Misakiiiii! Where are you!

378
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,749
[MISAKI]
Don't come cryin' to me
if you fall again!

379
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,686
[MISAKI] Dammit!
He's ignoring me?!
[SHINTANI] Misaki!

380
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,788
[MISAKI] Hey, Shintani, If you
don't get down here right now

381
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm taking your candy, your
snacks, AND your bread crusts!
[SHINTANI] Heeeey!

382
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,927
[SHINTANI] Wah!
(MISAKI gasps)
(SHINTANI yelling)

383
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,696
[MISAKI]
Yoh...

384
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,531
[MISAKI]
Yoh!

385
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,314
[SHINTANI]
You there... What's your name?

386
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,817
[MISAKI]
Misaki... Ayuzawa.

387
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:00,687
[MISAKI]
Sorry, but I'm a lot different
from how I used to‐ uh?

388
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,556
[SHINTANI] Misa!

389
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,828
[SHINTANI]
I missed you so much!

390
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,730
[BOYS]
HUH?

391
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:54,601
[MISAKI] I never thought that
Shintani the transfer student
would end up being Yoh!
[USUI] Hrm...

392
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,971
[MISAKI] What is it, Usui? Is
there something you want to say?
[USUI] Hrm...

393
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,140
[SHINTANI]
Misa! Bread crusts are good when
they're fried

394
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,676
[SHINTANI]
and dusted with sugar, but
they're even better plain!

395
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,179
[MISAKI] Where did you get those
bread crusts from?! Confiscated!
[SHINTANI] Misaki, you're so
cruel!

396
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,915
[MISAKI]
Why do I get the feeling he was
trying to get those confiscated
on purpose?

397
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:12,719
[SAKURA] Maybe he just wanted to
get your attention!
[SHIZUKO] Mhm...
[MISAKI] Sakura and Shizuko!

398
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,589
[SAKURA]
So, next time we're gonna go
into the forest with the new
transfer student!

399
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,991
[SHIZUKO]
Apparently, we're going
to a mountain temple.

400
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,626
[USUI]
Hrm...?
