1
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,830
Isn't last month's accounting
report done yet?

2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,299
[MISAKI]
Also, are the locations of the
regular cleanings‐?

3
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,501
[SHINTANI]
Misaki!

4
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,902
[MISAKI]
What do you want, Shintani?

5
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,169
Let's go play!

6
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,871
[MISAKI]
This isn't kindergarten,
get out!

7
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,542
[SHINTANI]
Aw... Why does Takumi get to
stay in here?! (growl)

8
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,511
[USUI]
Skrak. Skrak pop. Crackle.

9
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,813
[MISAKI]
Good point, what do you think
you're doing in here?

10
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,315
[USUI]
Huh, but this the only place
I can relax.

11
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,884
[MISAKI]
If you want to read, go to the
library!

12
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,988
[MISAKI]
The Student Council Room
isn't a playground!

13
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,058
[KANOU]
I've seen that guy hanging
around Madame President
a lot recently.

14
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,693
You know anything about him?

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,831
Oh, you mean Shintani?
He's an old school friend
of hers.

16
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,967
Apparently, she looked after him
a lot when they were younger.

17
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,504
I could've sworn that when he
was glaring at Usui earlier,

18
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,473
there was definitely a giant
dog growling behind him the
whole time...

19
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,579
No way! You know pets aren't
allowed in here, Kanou! Aren't
you just imagining things?

20
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,081
No, that's not what I was
talking about, Yukimura...

21
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,719
Sure enough, our President's
been an incredible person since
childhood!

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,296
[BOY A]
Man, I'm hungry. Hinata, you got
any bread crusts left? I want
'em.

23
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,900
[BOY B] Bread crusts are a lot
better than you'd think, huh?
[BOY C] I want some, too!

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,036
[SHINTANI]
Oh! So you guys've finally
realized how good these are,
huh?

25
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,974
You there! How many times do
I have to tell you not to eat
those things in class?!

26
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,476
[SHINTANI] Misaki, d'you
want some, too?
[MISAKI] Of course not.

27
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,079
Hey, Hinata, did you talk to
the President about that thing?

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,781
Yeah, y'know, about that job.

29
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,915
Job?!

30
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,984
[SHINTANI]
Misaki, you're "Misa"?!

31
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,953
So THIS is where
you work?! HERE?!

32
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,022
[MISAKI]
Wh‐What do you mean?

33
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,459
[BOY A]
Huh? It's nothin' special, this
guy just went and got a job at a
gas station.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,629
[MISAKI]
Oh, is that all it is?

35
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,733
[SHINTANI]
It's all right. I won't tell
anyone about YOUR job‐ your
secret's safe with me.

36
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,002
[BOY C]
What's this? A private
conversation?

37
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,906
[SHINTANI] Nothin' at
all! Well, I better run‐
I gotta get to work!
[BOY A] Goodbye!

38
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,674
[SAKURA] Well? How are things
going with you two?
[MISAKI] Gah!

39
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,110
Don't "Gah!" me. You have to
tell us all about Hinata!

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,914
In the chaos of our field trip
we didn't have the chance to
discuss things thoroughly.

41
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,583
Is it just me or does it look
like you two've gotten closer
since then?!

42
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,685
Could there have been some
sort of DEVELOPMENT?

43
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,621
There hasn't been
a "development"!

44
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,689
[MISAKI]
He's just an old
friend, that's all!

45
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,357
[SAKURA]
Ohhhh?

46
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,494
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
Tee hee hee, it's night time!

47
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,668
[SHINTANI]
I'm home!

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,806
[SHINTANI]
Oh man, I'm starving! Huh?

49
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,876
[SHINTANI]
Whoops. I forgot to call 'im.

50
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,414
[SHINTANI]
Hello, Grandpa? It's me‐!

51
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,683
[GRANDPA]
HEEEY!!!

52
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,518
[GRANDPA]
Whatchoo been doin', Hinata?!

53
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,386
You ain't called or nothin'!

54
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,556
[SHINTANI]
You don't hafta get so angry...

55
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,624
Yer Grandma's been worried sick!

56
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,394
[SHINTANI] I'm fine! There's
nothin' to get worried about.
(GRANDPA taking heavy breath)

57
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,697
[SHINTANI] But sure enough,
I'm glad I came back here!

58
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:27,033
You find that Misaki girl
you was lookin' for?

59
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,368
[SHINTANI]
Sure did.

60
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,804
[SHINTANI]
I found her right away.

61
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,240
At the same school,
in the same class as me!

62
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,512
Somethin' like that...
it's gotta be fate, right?

63
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,284
[MISAKI]
An anime cosplay event?

64
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,353
[SATSUKI]
That's right! The show creators
looked at everyone's photos

65
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,823
and gave us special permission
to hold this event!

66
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,292
Especially YOU, Misa‐ you'll
make the perfect Rose!

67
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,127
Magical Girls "MEI‐DO"?

68
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,062
[AOI]
Duh, It's a Sunday
morning cartoon.

69
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,598
Have you been living
under a rock?

70
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,800
I'M the only one cute
enough to play Mimoza!

71
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,935
[SATSUKI] That's
enough out of you!
[AOI] Hmph!

72
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,604
Anyway‐ here you go, Misa!

73
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,706
[SATSUKI]
I'll lend you these DVDs.
Make sure you watch them all

74
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,208
so you can get a
feel for the show!

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,409
[MISAKI]
All of these?!

76
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,311
[AOI]
They're on Season 4 this year.

77
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,179
There are almost 40 DVDs
on sale right now‐

78
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,881
that bag's not even half of'em.

79
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,449
[ERIKA]
But does she really
have to watch them all?

80
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,685
Just episode 1
should be enough...

81
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,787
[SUBARU]
And don't forget
episodes 12 and 13.

82
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,423
[AOI]
Things really start heating up
around this volume, so watch it!

83
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,926
[SATSUKI] (gasp) By
the way, Misa...
[MISAKI] Hmm?

84
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,861
Speaking of "heating up"‐
How have things been since

85
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,063
that "Hinata" guy figured
out you worked here?

86
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,497
What do you mean exactly?

87
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,600
[SATSUKI]
I'm talking about Usui‐ Isn't he
jealous?

88
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,502
Say, he hasn't come here today,
has he?

89
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,437
Now that I think about it,
neither has Usui...

90
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,372
[MISAKI]
What are we even talking
about this for?!

91
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,475
[MISAKI]
Usui's just a perverted weirdo!

92
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,579
[SHINTANI]
Thank you very much!

93
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,916
[BOY A] Shintani, you can go
home now!
[SHINTANI] Yessir!

94
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,086
[BOY A]
Shintani, lemme know what shifts
you wanta work for next month.

95
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,623
[SHINTANI]
Uh. Oh, sorry. I've got
tutoring next month, so... Huh?

96
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,059
[BOY B]
What?! You're not studying
properly?

97
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,161
[BOY C]
I'll teach you if you rub my
shoulders.

98
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,297
[SHINTANI] Hehe, I
can't trust you guys.
[BOY C] Yeah, right, you monkey!

99
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,501
[BOY B]
Want me to take you to your
apartment? I've got a spare
helmet!

100
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,104
[SHINTANI]
Nah, I've got somethin'
to do on my way back...

101
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,578
[SHINTANI]
That's weird...

102
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,780
It should...

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,549
be around here somewhere... Oh?

104
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,119
[SHINTANI]
OH! This persimmon looks
delicious! (Biting down)

105
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,556
[MINAKO]
Oh no, wait!

106
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,057
[MINAKO]
Come on, don't run away from me!

107
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,392
[SHINTANI]
Agh!

108
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,895
[MINAKO]
Oh my!

109
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,934
[MASTER]
O‐wee o‐wee. Summer
makes me want to dance!

110
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,438
Oh, no! The evil magic,
Mode‐De‐Trend, is forcing the
Master to dance terribly!

111
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,873
Let's go, Lilly!

112
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,575
Gotcha!

113
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,080
[ROSE]
Go‐ Mop Missile!

114
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,050
[THING]
(laughter) Blammo!

115
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,952
[THING]
Wa‐hey! Wa‐hey!

116
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,787
[MISAKI]
Whoa...

117
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,124
[SUZUNA] Kids' shows these days
sure don't make a lot of sense,
do they?

118
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:08,028
[SUZUNA]
Oh, looks like Mom's home.
And... who's that...

119
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,098
[SUZUNA]
There's someone I don't
recognize. Could he be our
future step‐father?

120
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,166
[MISAKI]
Huh‐

121
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,235
Ah? Oh, hey there, Suzuna!

122
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,170
You sure have grown up,
haven'tcha?

123
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,706
You used to be so small, I
didn't even recognize you there!

124
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,575
[SUZUNA]
Here goes, Mr. Hamburger!

125
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,711
I been waitin' for ya,
Miss Cheese!

126
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,048
[SUZUNA]
Coming uuup: One Melty Cheese
Hamburger!

127
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,683
[SHINTANI]
(sizzling noises)

128
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,317
What the heck is that about?

129
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,154
[SUZUNA]
Oh, well... We're playing
"Welcome to Our Restaurant,"

130
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,089
it's a cartoon we used to watch.

131
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,490
[MISAKI]
I know that, but...

132
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,825
That's no good, Yoh.

133
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,827
You don't look like a
delicious burger at all.

134
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,763
You used to be much
rounder and juicier.

135
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,931
Huh? Well, what do you
think should I do, then?

136
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,868
At this rate, you're gonna
lose to Egg‐Burger Lad.
Right, Big Sis?

137
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,236
[SHINTANI] What should
I do, Misaki?!
[MISAKI] What are you
asking me for?

138
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,805
And what are you doing here?!

139
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,874
[MINAKO]
We just happened to bump into
each other as I was

140
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,543
walking home. He helped me pick
up some persimmons I dropped.

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,344
[SHINTANI]
Here, this too!

142
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,580
[MINAKO]
Oh, thank you so much.

143
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,414
[SHINTANI] Oh...
[MINAKO] Oh dear...

144
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,985
[MISAKI]
I feel like I've heard this
story somewhere before...

145
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,055
Thank you for the food!

146
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,659
[MINAKO]
You certainly have become
handsome young man haven't
you, Hinata!

147
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,394
[SHINTANI]
Have I gotten manlier too?!

148
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,897
You have, I almost
didn't recognize you!

149
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,735
Still, eating that persimmon
right off the ground was just
like how you used to be when you
were a little boy...

150
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,538
[SHINTANI]
I never thought that you were
the one who dropped it, Mrs.
Ayuzawa!

151
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,841
[MISAKI]
And what were you doing
wandering around my house
at night?

152
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,043
[SHINTANI]
Well, I was tryin' to look for
something...

153
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,246
Hey Yoh, do you still have a
huge crush on my big sister?

154
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,949
[SHINTANI] (embarrassed) Uh...
[MISAKI] Suzuna, where did that
come from?!

155
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,751
[SHINTANI]
Wh‐What do you mean, "still"?

156
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,185
[SUZUNA]
You haven't changed at all, Yoh,

157
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,521
you're as easy
to read as always.

158
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,455
[SHINTANI]
What's that supposed to mean?!

159
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:45,659
No way! I used to be way more
shy and stuff, so I thought I
hid it perfectly!

160
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,898
[MINAKO] That's right. You used
to stare at Misaki all the time.
[SHINTANI] Mrs. Ayuzawa,
you knew, too?!

161
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,968
So, Yoh, you were really walking
around looking for our house...

162
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,037
Being a stalker
is bad, you know.

163
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,642
That's not it at all... I was
looking for somethin'‐ that old
cherry tree.

164
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,376
I thought it might still be
around here somewhere...

165
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,948
Cherry tree? You mean,
the one you fell out of
when we were little?

166
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,584
Misaki, you mean
you remember that?

167
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,055
(YOUNG SHINTANI straining)

168
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,023
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Hey, that's dangerous!

169
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,126
(YOUNG SHINTANI screaming)
[YOUNG MISAKI] Yoh! Are you
okay, Yoh?

170
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,363
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
Yeah. I'm tough so I'm okay.

171
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,132
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Geez, what am I gonna do with
you, Yoh?

172
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,202
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Don't go running off climbing
trees anymore.

173
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,072
You have to promise to stay
by my side from now on, okay?

174
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:38,579
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
I'll stay by you forever and
ever no matter what. It'll be
you and me together forever...

175
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,113
Thanks, Yoh...

176
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,517
Wait a minute! That's not
how it happened at all!

177
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,586
[MISAKI]
You got hurt and had to go to
the clinic, didn't you?

178
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,821
[SHINTANI]
I was hoping you would've
forgotten about that part...

179
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,791
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
Nom nom nom... (chewing)

180
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,897
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
Okay, Misaki... I promise.

181
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,166
I'll stay by you... forever
and ever no matter what.

182
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,504
[MISAKI]
Also, when I said to "stay by
me" that's not exactly what I
meant.

183
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:08,074
[SUZUNA] Hot tea sure is
delicious.
[SHINTANI] Whether it's under a
cherry blossom tree or in a

184
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,813
I wonder if that tree... is
still out there, somewhere...

185
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,629
[TRIO]
Yay!

186
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,163
[KUROSAKI]
Sunday, how we've waited for
you!

187
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,265
[SHIROKAWA]
Today is none other than Maid
Latte day!

188
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,668
[SARASHINA]
And we've been especially
looking forward to today's
event!

189
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,303
[KUROSAKI]
I made sure to do plenty of
research in order to prepare
myself!

190
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,273
[SHIROKAWA]
Me, too! I got to watch a
morning girls' anime...!

191
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,944
[MISAKI]
Hello and welcome back...

192
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,512
[TRIO] Whoaaaa!
[MISAKI] Masters.

193
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,314
[MISAKI]
May you be lovey‐dovey through
Maid Latte magic!

194
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,951
[SUBARU]
Oh, no! Our masters have been
struck with the evil spell‐

195
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,219
Stress‐DE Shoulderitis‐ we have
to save them!

196
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,389
[ERIKA]
This calls for Misa... I mean,
Rose, to save the day!

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,291
[MISAKI]
Okay! Let's go, Lilly!

198
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,492
[HONOKA]
Gotcha!

199
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,628
[HONOKA & MISAKI]
Carlon! Papolon!

200
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,764
[HONOKA] [MISAKI]
Be healed!

201
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,833
[MISAKI]
Through the power of our magic
you've been cured!

202
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,469
[HONOKA]
Please feel free to rest here a
while!

203
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,474
They're perfect! Magical Girls
MEI‐DO! Their replication of the
characters is so flawless I
can't hold back my tears!

204
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,977
[SHIROKAWA]
I've only seen the show once,
but they're just like it!

205
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,080
[KUROSAKI]
They're the perfect fit for the
main characters‐ I feel like I'm
actually IN the show!

206
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,816
[SARASHINA]
But I never thought Misa would
go THIS far for us! (sobbing)

207
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,619
[SHIROKAWA]
Yeah, I kinda figured she'd just
completely ignore us again...

208
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,854
[KUROSAKI]
I think that's the best part of
the whole thing...

209
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,691
[AOI]
Messing up the names is totally
unforgivable!

210
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,058
[AOI]
Do you understand me,
Amalilith?!

211
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,660
[ERIKA]
Yeah, yeah, I've got it.

212
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,862
[AOI]
Today's event has to
be perfect‐ got it?

213
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:40,266
[AOI]
Say, Satsuki, lookie, lookie,
don't you think I'd make the
perfect Mimoza I sure do!

214
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,605
[SATSUKI]
No way! You're still in middle
school, AND you're a boy.
Right, Aoi?

215
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,607
There's no way I can put
you out on the floor.

216
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,909
Even though I look
this good?! Boo!

217
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,611
[MISAKI]
Another order: one Witch
Parfait, please.

218
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,878
[AOI]
Monama Sharte!

219
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,279
[MISAKI]
(foley) Stomachus Fullus!

220
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,549
[MISAKI]
What are you casting a diet
spell for?

221
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,383
I responded on accident...

222
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm surprised you remembered
one of the less popular spells
that well.

223
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,156
Especially since you've never
watched the show before...

224
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,592
That's because I watched
all the DVDs I borrowed.

225
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,460
[AOI]
You watched them all?

226
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,164
[MISAKI]
It took a long time, but I
finished watching them late last
night.

227
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,834
[AOI, thinking]
She stayed up late to watch it?

228
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,541
[AOI]
Huh? He's just visiting today?

229
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,744
[AOI]
For a second, I thought he was a
regular customer...

230
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:28,982
[AOI]
What will you do? You gonna show
him your special act like
before? Hee hee hee! Ah?

231
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,425
[MISAKI]
Welcome back... Master.

232
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,302
[MISAKI]
Please... be lovey‐dovey with
Maid Latte magic!

233
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,172
[AOI]
Somehow... he seems kinda
different today...

234
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,376
[AOI]
Usually, he'd have a witty
retort or something sarcastic
to say...

235
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,345
[SATSUKI]
Maybe he's worried about Hinata
putting the moves on Misa...

236
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,816
[AOI]
I don't know what's going
on, but this is a job for
Mimoza to‐ Ah!

237
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,718
[SATSUKI]
I don't think so, Miss Mimoza.

238
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,020
[ERIKA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,290
[SUBARU]
My apologies for the wait, My
Lady.

240
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,628
[SATSUKI]
How was it? Did you enjoy
today's special treat,

241
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,930
the Magical Miracle
MEI‐DO parfait?

242
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,499
[USUI]
It was fun. And very magical.
Good job.

243
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,602
[SATSUKI]
Is that what you really think,
Usui?

244
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,070
[SATSUKI]
The kitchen staff wanted
me to ask you for them.

245
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,240
They want to hear some honest
feedback about it from you.

246
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,410
[USUI]
When laying down the
quenelle, try using
something with a long tip

247
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,613
rather than a rounded spoon
to give it some shape.

248
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,415
[USUI]
If they practice a little more,
it'll be perfect in no time.

249
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:38,484
[SATSUKI]
K‐Ken... Wait... You mean like a
long spoon, right?

250
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,554
[USUI]
It could also use some gold
flakes on top,

251
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,757
or something fancy like that
just to make the presentation
more elegant.

252
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,226
[USUI]
And the sponge cake could stand
to be a little denser.

253
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,862
[SATSUKI]
Looks like there's a lot more to
this than I thought...

254
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,197
[USUI]
Would you like me
to write it down?

255
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,334
[SATSUKI]
Just who are you, Usui? I know
you're not exactly normal...

256
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,370
[SATSUKI]
But this is on a completely
different level!

257
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,406
[USUI]
I suppose I should take that as
a compliment, shouldn't I?

258
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,808
[SATSUKI]
Oh...?

259
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,910
[USUI]
No, it's just that
a certain someone

260
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,879
is always telling me
the same thing.

261
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:10,984
Just think of me as a perverted
weirdo if that's what you think
you need to do.

262
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,187
[SHINTANI]
(giggling) Misaki!
Let's have some fun!

263
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,322
[SARASHINA] Shintani!
[SHIROKAWA] What're you
doing here again?!

264
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,992
[KUROSAKI]
Wait, if you knew Misa was
working here all along?

265
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,162
[SHINTANI]
Oh! You guys came to visit
Misaki again, did ya?

266
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,965
[KUROSAKI] No!
[SARASHINA] It's not "Misaki,"
it's "Misa"!

267
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,600
[SHIROKAWA]
That's the law of Maid Latte!

268
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,604
[SHINTANI]
(chuckling) Huh? Oh,
You're here too, are you?

269
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,807
[USUI]
This isn't a buffet‐ are you
sure you're in the right place?

270
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,041
[SATSUKI & TRIO]
Oh!

271
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,743
[AOI]
So that guy's Hinata, huh?

272
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,145
[HONOKA]
Looks like things've gotten
pretty interesting.

273
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,616
This is what happens when people
act like total idiots.

274
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,052
[SATSUKI]
Come on, you two, don't make
such scary faces.

275
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,289
Oh I know! This calls for some
special friend‐making magic!

276
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,292
Ukin pawa‐kun, friendimus
become‐us!

277
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,629
[SATSUKI]
Huh?

278
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,230
[AOI]
Like that'd work!

279
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,066
Look like this situation calls
for Mimoza's boys'‐love magic!

280
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,536
[MISAKI]
Didn't the manager tell you to
stay off the floor?

281
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,637
(AOI pouting)

282
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,071
My apologies for the wait!

283
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,473
Here's the Magical Girls'
Russian Roulette Game!

284
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,175
[SHIROKAWA]
Whoa! I've been waiting for
this!

285
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,812
[SARASHINA] [KUROSAKI]
This is today's special menu!

286
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,715
[TRIO]
(excited cheers)

287
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:18,552
[MISAKI]
Alright, one of these glasses
contains the mystical wizard
potion.

288
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:24,124
The point of this game is to
guess who drank the magic
potion. So make sure not to give
anything away, okay?

289
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:28,028
[MISAKI]
If you win, you can get your
choice of a special coaster
or a commemorative photo‐

290
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,163
[TRIO]
The photo! Definitely the photo!

291
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:35,902
[MISAKI]
Yes‐ as you wish! Then I, Rose,
shall cast a magic spell on you
all!

292
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,204
Prepare yourselves for
magic Masters...

293
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,106
[SARASHINA]
Uh, wait! What kind
of spell is it?

294
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,809
[MISAKI]
A spell that prevents
you from lying!

295
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,446
[MISAKI]
Dream‐pa, droom‐pa,
no more lies!

296
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,752
[SHIROKAWA]
What's wrong, Kurotatsu?

297
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,654
[SARASHINA]
Hang in there, Kurotatsu!

298
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,657
[KUROSAKI]
I‐I think... this is
it for me, boys...

299
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,726
[MISAKI]
So, it was Master Kurotatsu who
drank the magic Wizard's potion!

300
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,995
[KUROSAKI]
Need... water!

301
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,964
[SHIROKAWA]
Kurotatsu!

302
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,932
[HONOKA]
See you again, Masters‐ come
back soon!

303
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,169
[SARASHINA] I guess we'll go
ahead and call it a day...
[KUROSAKI] W‐w‐water...!

304
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,639
[SHIROKAWA] [SARASHINA]
Kurotatsu! Whoa!
[KUROSAKI] W‐...Water!

305
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,110
[SHINTANI]
Oh? This looks like fun!
Do one for me, too!

306
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,147
[MISAKI]
Very well then, Master‐ what
sort of spell would you like me
to cast?

307
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,551
Uh well... How about some
magic to beat my rival?

308
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,220
If you need magic to win,
there's not really a point,
is there?
(sigh)

309
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,925
[SATSUKI]
That's exactly right, Usui!
There are some things that can
only be done without magic!

310
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,395
[SATSUKI]
Also, love spells are
a double‐edged sword;
even if they succeed,

311
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,698
there's no telling what
dire consequences they
can bring about‐

312
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,567
[HONOKA]
Oh no, Lilly! Don't say scary
things like that!

313
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,971
[HONOKA] If you use the wrong
kind of magic it could bring
scary spirits to your bedside at
night!

314
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,040
[HONOKA] Just thinking about it
makes me shiver!

315
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,811
[SATSUKI]
Honoka, I think we're talking
about two different things...

316
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,113
[USUI]
Thank you for the food.

317
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,717
[USUI]
Is something the matter?

318
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,019
Not really.

319
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,524
[MISAKI]
See you next time... Master.

320
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,459
[HONOKA] [SATSUKI]
See you next time, Master!

321
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,130
[SHINTANI]
Hey, Misa!

322
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,533
[SHINTANI]
I thought of a spell I want you
to cast on me!

323
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,801
One to help me find what I'm
looking for?

324
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,969
What would that be?

325
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,838
You know ‐ that
cherry blossom tree!

326
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,005
[MISAKI]
Oh. Yeah...

327
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,406
[SHINTANI]
Hurry up and cast it!

328
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,775
[MISAKI]
Uh...

329
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,645
Okay, here it goes.

330
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:28,815
[MISAKI]
Droom‐pa, drom‐pa,
discoverus soon‐us!

331
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,955
[AOI]
Sulk...

332
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,091
[ERIKA]
Doesn't it seem like Aoi's in an
even worse mood than usual?

333
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,228
[SATSUKI]
He's just mad because I wouldn't
let him be Mimoza. Let him pout,
he'll get over it.

334
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,964
[AOI]
Even though my costume was
perfect and I helped, too!

335
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,399
[SATSUKI] Yeah, yeah.
[AOI] AND I gave you
all acting tips!

336
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,335
[SATSUKI] Yeah, yeah.
[AOI] I would've made
the cutest Mimoza ever!

337
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,038
[SATSUKI]
The only reason you bothered to
help out was because you wanted
to dress up.

338
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,174
[AOI]
It's not fair‐ I wanna be a
maid, too!

339
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,343
[SATSUKI]
That's enough already! Why are
you even hanging around here on
your days off?

340
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,012
Don't you have
anything else to do?!

341
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,481
Go out and make some friends
like a normal kid!
(AOI pouting)

342
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,650
[AOI]
What're you lecturing
me for, huh?!

343
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,186
[SATSUKI]
This isn't a place for you to
play around, Aoi.

344
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,388
[AOI]
Aah, shut up! Who cares if I
have friends or not?!

345
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:12,392
[AOI]
Besides I'm not the only one on
his own! That idiot Usui is
always alone, too!

346
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,795
[MISAKI] Ugh...
[SATSUKI] Aoi! Don't go
calling people idiots!

347
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,463
[AOI]
Hmph! That guy definitely
doesn't have any friends.

348
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,633
[SATSUKI]
That's not true at all,
is it, Misa?

349
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,336
[MISAKI]
Huh? Uh, you wanna know about
his friends? Does he have any?

350
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,039
Uh... Let's see... Maybe
Yukimura is his friend.

351
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:31,077
[MISAKI]
No, he's more like a pet. Kanou
is... a friend... Maybe.

352
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,046
[AOI] And what about you?
[MISAKI] Uh?

353
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,681
[AOI]
What are YOU to him?

354
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,551
[SATSUKI]
Oh my, Aoi, you can't just ask
outright like that!

355
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:38,752
[AOI]
A friend?

356
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,420
I don't... think so.

357
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,255
At least, I don't
get that feeling.

358
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,724
[AOI]
His rival?

359
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,326
[MISAKI]
Huh? That's what I thought
at first, but...

360
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,962
I'm not really
sure what he thinks.

361
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,565
[AOI]
You "thought"? As in past tense?

362
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:56,570
[AOI]
Then... here's a different
question: What is he to you
NOW? Hmmm?

363
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:12,619
[MISAKI, thinking]
What is he to me now...? How am
I supposed to answer that?

364
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,989
[MISAKI]
Uh? Wh‐What are you doing here?

365
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,158
[USUI]
Should I not be here?

366
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,327
[MISAKI]
Uh... No you shouldn't! It's
suspicious, hanging around back
at this time of night!

367
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:25,632
Someone might think you're a
pervert! What are you doing here
anyway, idiot?!
(USUI laughing)

368
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,367
[MISAKI]
What are you laughing for...?

369
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,603
Even Magical Girls take
out the trash, huh?

370
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,605
Don't you have some sort of
trash‐taking magic?

371
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,608
Why don't you try using one of
your magic spells from earlier?

372
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,709
[MISAKI] Uh.

373
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,881
[USUI]
Your face is all red,
Ayuzawa. Ooh.

374
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,383
[MISAKI]
Just shut up you weirdo!

375
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,495
[MISAKI]
It's pretty cold tonight, huh?

376
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:58,131
[MISAKI]
Aren't you cold
without a jacket?

377
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,667
[MISAKI]
If you're going to be out late,
at least wear something warm.

378
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,169
[USUI]
(laughing foley) Always watching
out for others, aren't you Misa?

379
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,538
[MISAKI]
I‐Is that bad?!

380
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,339
[USUI]
I'd planned on going
straight home,

381
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,742
but I wanted to see your
face one more time.

382
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,945
[MISAKI]
Don't you have any friends
you can go bother?

383
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,514
[USUI]
Do I look like I don't?

384
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:16,550
[MISAKI]
Hey, wait, did you hear us
talking earlier‐?

385
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,720
[USUI] Actually, something has
been bothering me...
[MISAKI] uh...

386
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,591
[USUI]
That question you got asked at
the end. I'd like to know the
answer.

387
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,029
[USUI]
Tell me what am I
to you... Ayuzawa?

388
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,831
[MISAKI]
Shut up!

389
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,900
[USUI] I see. So this is the
only way you know

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,437
how to express yourself
when confronted with your
true feelings.

391
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,606
[USUI]
Why don't you... just be honest
for once?

392
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,343
I said shut up! Everything you
say is so embarrassing I can't
stand it!

393
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,678
[USUI]
Aah, how cruel...

394
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,613
[MISAKI]
Look, just shut up already!

395
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:50,717
[USUI]
In that case... I'll express
myself through action, too.

396
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,170
[MISAKI]
What are you doing?! Let go!

397
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,709
[MISAKI]
Stop it, you perverted alien
freak! What if someone sees us?
Cut it out!

398
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,979
[USUI] Dream‐pa, droom‐pa.
(MISAKI gasps)

399
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,615
[USUI]
Now you can't lie...

400
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,990
[USUI]
Do you want me to let go?

401
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,360
You're not really a witch...

402
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,633
[MISAKI]
You can't use magic...

403
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,443
[SHINTANI]
Sure enough, Misaki is...

404
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,780
[SHINTANI, thinking]
No! That guy's got
nothing to do with it!
[SHINTANI] Oh?

405
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,156
[SHINTANI]
That's it...!

406
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,458
[SHINTANI]
This is it! I found it!

407
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,029
I'm so glad. I can't
believe it's still here.

408
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,532
You sure have gotten big.

409
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,706
[SHINTANI]
I knew it... It's gotta be fate.

410
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,066
[SHIROKAWA]
Maid Latte's event was a super
big hit, huh?!

411
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,470
[KUROSAKI]
But that magic juice knocked
me clear outta the ring‐ talk
about a KO!

412
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,608
[SHIRASHINA]
That event sure got us Masters
right in the heart, didn't it?
Talk about a heart attack!

413
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:05,178
[MISAKI]
I have no idea what you Three
Idiots are talking about. But
whatever.

414
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,346
[SHINTANI]
Misaki!

415
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,447
[SAKURA]
Misaki‐Misaki!

416
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,115
[SHIZUKO] Misaki!
[USUI] Misa.

417
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,652
[MISAKI]
What's going on? Why are all
of you shouting my name?!

418
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:12,986
[SHINTANI]
We just wanna be around ya!

419
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,521
[SAKURA]
Yumemishi has another concert!

420
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,789
[SHIZUKO]
You don't learn, do you?

421
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,090
[USUI]
I just called your name.

422
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,225
[MISAKI]
What should I do?!
