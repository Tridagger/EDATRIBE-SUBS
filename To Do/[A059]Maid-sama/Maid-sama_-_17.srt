1
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,567
(SUZUNA eating)

2
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,609
Oh, that's right, I almost
forgot‐ I also won a trip
overseas.

3
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,314
But getting a passport is a
pain, and I still have to come
up with the money for the hotel
and stuff,

4
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,350
so I'll just give it to
someone else in the club.

5
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:06,259
Maybe I should try rice... with
watermelon cooked into it.

6
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,530
No, I'd better not.

7
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:29,082
[MISAKI]
Manager's younger sister has a
beach house that we're visiting
for our summer vacation.

8
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:34,655
Our first day was long and
stressful, and now we're facing
the morning of the second.

9
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:41,795
Still, everyone was up late
enjoying themselves last night,
so instead of "morning," it's
more like "before noon."

10
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,198
[USUI]
Ah...

11
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,702
Good morning to you, Miss Misa.

12
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,370
(embarrassed)

13
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,843
[MISAKI, mumbled]
G‐good morning... Usui.

14
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,550
(USUI yawns)

15
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,286
[MISAKI, thinking]
Is he not a morning person?

16
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,601
(big roar)

17
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,770
[USUI]
What are you doing, Misa?

18
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,606
Just waking myself up!
Don't mind me! (breaths)

19
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,674
That's seems less like
a way of waking up

20
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,876
and more like a way of putting
yourself to sleep forever.

21
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,814
What would give you that
idea, Usui? See, look at
how awake I am.

22
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,717
[NAGISA]
I've taken you in, so try to put
yourself in my shoes!

23
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,785
Why do you always have
to dress like that?

24
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,923
What's the big deal?!
Dressing this way is
natural for me!

25
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,493
Yeah, yeah. I've heard
it all from you before.

26
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,963
Hmph.

27
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,265
(sigh)
Fine‐ I'll let you wear
whatever you want, okay.

28
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,967
Huh? You really mean it?!

29
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,303
If you win today's beach
volleyball tournament,
that is. See!

30
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,906
(MISAKI and USUI intrigued)

31
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:05,111
I can really wear whatever I
want? You won't complain or nag
anymore? Or take my wig away?

32
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,815
That's right. If you'd
prefer, I'll even consider
letting you go home.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,885
You want to get away from
all this sun, right?
Mhmmm!

34
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,689
I can make that happen for ya.
If you can win this tournament
like a man, my brother,

35
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,660
your father will probably
accept you a little more.

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,127
Auntie Nagisa!

37
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,464
Thank you, Aunt Nagisa! Let's do
our best, okay? I'm gonna win!

38
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,533
Huh? What are you
talking about, Aoi?

39
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,402
The tournament. Each pair
has to be boy‐girl, right?

40
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,804
Yes, that's right.

41
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,139
Aunt Nagisa, you'll be my
partner, won't you?

42
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,242
After all, you were
last year's champion!

43
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,145
Wow, so Nagisa won the
tournament last year?

44
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,614
[AOI]
That's not fair!

45
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,616
This year the tournament
has an age limit,

46
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,885
so too bad for you
I can't compete!

47
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,021
If you want to enter you'll have
to find somebody else to be your
partner!
(AOI scared)

48
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,826
Th‐that's impossible! Come on!
I don't even have any friends
here, I'll never find anyone!

49
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,628
"Impossible"?

50
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,331
So you're gonna give up
just like that, huh, Aoi?
(AOI irritated)

51
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:04,070
[NAGISA]
Well, fine by me. Guess I'll
just have you work here for the
rest of summer as a MAN.

52
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,208
[AOI]
I won't give up!

53
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,745
I won't give up that easily.
Not after everything that I've
gone through.

54
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:17,283
I don't care if people think
I'm weird or gross, or if they
laugh... because this is who I
am!

55
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,721
And I'm not going to change
myself for anyone!

56
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,692
I'm going to find a partner.

57
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:33,634
[NAGISA]
Heh. No matter what he says,
he's a boy at heart.

58
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,336
Poor Aoi...

59
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,650
[AOI, thinking]
Finding a girl who can play
beach volleyball well isn't
going to be easy...

60
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,253
Uh...

61
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,622
(MISAKI humming)

62
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,825
Oh, hey Aoi, perfect timing!

63
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,529
I was just thinking that
while I was here it'd be
nice to play some volleyball.

64
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:07,000
Do you know where I could get
in on some volleyball action?
Uh?

65
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,402
Misa, you're going to enter the
beach volleyball competition?

66
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:13,406
I want you to win and become
the Beach Princess! Make sure
to kick their butts, okay?

67
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,908
(MISAKI slurping)

68
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,643
What's the Beach Princess?

69
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,514
[SATSUKI] You don't know?
[MISAKI] Uh, no...

70
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:25,185
[SATSUKI]
The boy‐girl pair that wins will
be crowned this year's prince
and princess at the festival!

71
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:30,256
A big celebration is held for
the winners, and they even have
a commemorative photoshoot!

72
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,160
Plus they give you bunch of cute
bikinis for you to take pictures
in!

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,531
[MISAKI]
Oh, yeah? I'm not really
interested in that...

74
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:44,370
But my motto is, "Win no matter
what." And we're definitely
gonna win! (slurping)

75
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, Aoi and I have
some practicing to do.

76
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,410
[ALL]
You and Aoi are on
a team together?

77
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,419
[USUI]
Misa...

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,022
Hm? Oh, it's you, Usui.

79
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,959
[USUI] Have you ever
played beach volleyball?
[MISAKI] Nope.

80
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,361
It's not like indoor volleyball.
It's completely different.

81
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,866
That's true. It's a lot
harder to run in the sand,
but we should be fine.

82
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,537
You seem to be pretty
confident about that.
Do I?

83
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,740
No, I think I'm more
determined than anything.

84
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,708
I'm not confident at all.

85
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,345
Yeah. I'm simply
determined that I WILL win.

86
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:33,286
In Aoi's eyes... there was this
look of serious determination...
when I saw that I knew I had to
do my best to help him.

87
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,191
Still, since I don't have any
experience, I don't know how
helpful I'll actually be.

88
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,862
In that case, why doesn't he
get someone else to help him?

89
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,263
Huh?

90
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,566
Don't do it, Ayuzawa.

91
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:55,842
Wh‐What are you talking about?
I don't understand you at all!
I have to go now.

92
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,887
Huh?

93
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,590
[MISAKI]
I'm sorry!

94
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,658
[AOI]
You're late!

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,095
[MAN]
Excuse me...

96
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,965
Oh, yes! Welcome!

97
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,969
[ANNOUNCER]
It's here again, folks,
the event you've all been
waiting for!

98
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,772
The Viva Royale Beach
Volleyball Tournament!

99
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,875
But the players will be up
against more than each other!

100
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,546
They'll have to take on the
scorching hot sun, the
hard‐to‐move‐in sand,

101
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,148
and the wildly blowing wind
if they want to win!

102
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:41,154
Who will be the ones to use
teamwork to win the tournament
and be crowned prince and
princess at tonight's festival?

103
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,824
Okay everyone, let's get
this party started!
(CROWD cheering)

104
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:47,060
[SATSUKI] It's just about time.
[HONOKA] But where are Misa and
Aoi?

105
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,196
They've been gone this
whole time practicing...

106
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,737
[BOTH]
We will win, no matter WHAT!

107
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,572
(CROWD freaking out)

108
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,943
Is that Misa and Aoi over
there? They look like hell,
huh? And then some.

109
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,913
[SATSUKI]
What's happened to them in
such a short amount of time?

110
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,983
Just what kind of
training did they do...?

111
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,753
(uneasy)

112
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,198
Dammit! That wasn't enough
practice time at all!

113
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,867
Don't worry‐ we've got this!

114
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,737
We'll definitely win. I've
seen just how serious you are!

115
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,440
Let's go, Misakichi!

116
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,976
"Misakichi"?

117
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,078
[ERIKA]
Oh, there you
are. What's up?

118
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,014
You guys look like you're
ready to go all out.

119
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,649
Huh? Erika?

120
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,586
Uh! And Usui, too?!

121
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,253
What are you two doing here?

122
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,822
When I heard you were
entering the tournament,

123
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,323
I felt like joining
in the fun!

124
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,859
So I asked Usui here,
and he agreed to be my teammate!

125
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,029
Beach volleyball sure is
a lot of fun, isn't it?
I just love it!

126
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,132
"Okay"? Usui, do you even care
about this?

127
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,803
What are you competing for,
it's not like you're really
interested, right?

128
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,272
Victory will be MINE.

129
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,609
GAHHHHH!

130
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,778
[MISAKI]
FINE! THEN BRING IT ON!

131
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:34,134
(MISAKI & AOI chanting "Gonna
win, gonna win" over and over)

132
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,036
[MISAKI]
Eat this!

133
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,203
[BOY] Ahhh!

134
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,439
[ANNOUNCER]
The Ayuzawa‐Hyoudou pair wins!

135
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,174
[BOTH]
Yeah!

136
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,145
(MISAKI & AOI chanting "Gonna
win, gonna win" over and over)

137
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,780
[MISAKI]
Read the direction of the wind!

138
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,649
[AOI]
Conquer the sand!

139
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,551
[AOI]
Eat thiiis!

140
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,085
[MISAKI]
Hyaaa!

141
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,420
(BOTH scared)

142
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,923
[ANNOUNCER] The Ayuzawa‐Hyoudou
pair wins!
[BOTH] Ah‐ha!

143
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,160
(MISAKI & AOI chanting "Gonna
win, gonna win" over and over)

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,797
[MISAKI]
Come at us with everything
you got! BRING IT ONNNN!

145
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,299
(BOY & GIRL scared)

146
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,601
[MISAKI]
Eat this!

147
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,770
[BOTH]
EEEEEK!

148
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,239
(MISAKI & AOI powering up)

149
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,142
[ANNOUNCER]
The Ayuzawa‐Hyoudou pair
moves to the playoffs!

150
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,512
(growling) HA!

151
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,181
[HONOKA]
Those two are so strong...
it's actually kinda scary.

152
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,385
[SUBARU]
With every match they win, they
make the other teams lose their
will to fight even more.

153
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,654
[Aoi] No mercy!
[Misaki] Destroy the
competition!
[Nagisa] They're great.

154
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:33,059
[GIRLS]
(squealing) He's so cool!

155
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,967
I was hoping it'd
turn out like this.

156
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,103
If we win this, I'm FREE!

157
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,473
(laughing) Looks like we better
get serious about this, then...

158
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,079
[AOI]
Go! Final battle!

159
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,116
Get ready, Usui! I won't
be going easy on you!

160
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:05,191
[MISAKI, thinking]
What's with him? What did he
even enter this tournament
for in the first place?!

161
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,363
He knows how important this
is to Aoi, so why's he
playing against us?

162
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,534
[BOY A]
Which one of those girls
do you think'll be this
year's princess?

163
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:16,670
[BOY B]
Dunno but I hope it's the
sexier one, she's a real babe.

164
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,372
[BOY A]
Nah, that guy she's playing with
is obviously her boyfriend.

165
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,576
That other chick is who you
should have your eye on!

166
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,780
[BOY B]
Is her partner her younger
brother? They don't look like
they're together.

167
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,218
[MISAKI, thinking]
Maybe... Usui defeated
the other, strong teams

168
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,589
so Aoi could get to the
finals without any problems.

169
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,191
Could that be it...?

170
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,162
Yeah, maybe he's
trying to help us...

171
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,165
[MISAKI, thinking]
Because when it counts,
he always does...

172
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,500
[ANNOUNCER]
Let the final game start!

173
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,969
Dah!

174
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,037
Dohhh

175
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,075
(determined)

176
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,877
Hwah!

177
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,812
(grunting)

178
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,447
Dah!

179
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,283
There!

180
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,519
(gasping)

181
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,057
[ANNOUNCER]
The Usui‐Erika pair
take the first set!

182
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,160
(heavy breathing)
[AOI] They're good.

183
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,564
Looks like I underestimated
him... that damn Usui is
serious...

184
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,233
[ERIKA] Yay! High five!
[MISAKI] After all that, he
didn't even break a sweat!
[USUI] Yeah!

185
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,068
(concerned)

186
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,540
That guy really knows what
he's doing. Looks like he'll
be a tough opponent to beat.

187
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,143
[ANNOUNCER]
The second set will now begin!

188
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,311
(panting)

189
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,547
Dammit‐ what kind
of monster is he?

190
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,349
[MISAKI]
He's not even out of
breath... but he's STILL
kicking our butts!

191
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,252
[AOI]
Cuz he's aiming the ball to
where we can barely reach it.

192
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,889
But this isn't over yet,
I won't be defeated!

193
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:44,858
Let's do this, Aoi.

194
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,993
(agreeing)

195
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,032
(MISAKI gasps)

196
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,400
[AOI]
(gasp) This one's not
getting away from me!

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,538
Nagisa's been drilling
volleyball into me for years!

198
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,305
Hyaaaa!

199
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,908
Careful, Aoi!

200
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,948
Wow, That was some
nice control.

201
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,887
Dammit!

202
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,963
[MISAKI, thinking]
Aoi... is trying so hard!

203
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,343
[MISAKI, thinking]
He's taking this so seriously...
and Usui's just toying with us!

204
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:47,521
[MISAKI, thinking]
That guy is constantly pissing
me off, but... he's always come
through for me when it counts!

205
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:55,028
[MISAKI, thinking]
I actually believed...
that he was a good guy!

206
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,333
[MISAKI, thinking]
I've never been this angry
before in my life!

207
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:04,638
Usui, why did you
become my enemy?!

208
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:18,251
(awkward laughing) Uh, whoopsy.
Did I... just say that out loud?

209
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,554
[USUI]
You sure are a
selfish one, Misa.

210
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,989
[USUI]
You don't want me
to be your enemy?

211
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,493
Are you saying you want me?

212
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,598
[MISAKI]
(stammering) Y‐you idiot! Who
said anything like that‐?!

213
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,167
[USUI]
I see. Well, here goes.

214
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,372
[AOI]
Whoa, where are you aiming?!

215
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,408
[MAN]
Forget it. The wind's blown it.

216
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,712
I won't lose! Hyaa!

217
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,180
He got it?!

218
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,652
[MAN]
It's no good. This
time, it's impossible.

219
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,954
(ALL gasp) Huh?

220
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,388
[MISAKI]
I WILL make it!

221
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,723
Don't, Misa!

222
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,491
(gasping)

223
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,163
YES! Uh?

224
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,599
(gasp)

225
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,867
Look out!

226
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,169
(bracing herself)

227
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,204
(grunting)

228
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,543
[SATSUKI]
Huh?

229
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,444
(USUI groans)

230
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:19,980
(MISAKI gasps)

231
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,049
[JUDGE]
Whooooaaa!

232
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,150
[USUI] Hmph.

233
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,053
(CROWD murmuring)

234
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,859
[in unison]
Are you okay?

235
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,761
I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,096
There's no way you're fine!

237
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,463
Look at that huge bruise!

238
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,232
That hit you right on
the shoulder!

239
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,135
[SATSUKI]
You have to get that
looked at right away!

240
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,416
Well... That got blown
way out of proportion.

241
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,985
Hey, Usui! You shouldn't
be moving around yet!

242
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,021
And you shouldn't
worry so much.

243
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,689
But I... I mean, it's my fault

244
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,858
it happened in the first place,
so of course I'm going to worry.

245
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,529
So, now you're following
me around because you feel
guilty about it?

246
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:11,297
Shouldn't you be at
the festival celebrating
your victory?

247
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,199
There's nothing to
celebrate about,

248
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,769
the only reason we won
was because our opponent
got injured.

249
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,671
Who would be
happy about that?

250
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:22,075
With the way I feel right
now, I'd just ruin any fun
they're trying to have.

251
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,279
Guess it's a good thing
the others are there to
celebrate for us then.

252
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,482
Then I, Erika, shall be
the acting princess!
Just leave it to me!

253
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,018
Hey! What do you think
you're doing‐ the only
princess is me!

254
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,354
Jeez, I wanna be
a princess, too!

255
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,427
You know, Aoi.

256
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,498
You've shown me... just how
much of a man you really are.

257
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,069
Congratulations on your win.

258
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,573
Aunt Nagisa...

259
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,580
[USUI]
But Misa, you really are
reckless, aren't you?

260
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:05,318
But I guess, I've come to
expect that from you by now.

261
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,592
Usui... I'm sorry.

262
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,798
[USUI] I don't forgive you.
(MISAKI gasps)

263
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,538
What would you do...
if I said that?

264
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,306
(MISAKI gasps)

265
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,475
(USUI chuckling)

266
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,311
You're making fun of me again?!

267
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,279
Anyway, this is all because you
entered the stupid tournament!

268
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,783
[MISAKI] And you knew how Aoi
felt and you still‐!
[USUI] I‐I didn't like it.

269
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:41,287
You being the Beach Princess,
putting on clothes that would
make guys stare at you,

270
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,825
having your picture taken with
them while they thought dirty
thoughts about you...

271
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:48,194
I just didn't want to see you
like that, Ayuzawa, that's all.

272
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,366
[MISAKI]
That's... all?

273
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,968
[USUI]
What do you mean?

274
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:58,839
My dignity was your only reason
for trying so hard to win?

275
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,406
Yes.

276
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,243
THAT'S all it was?

277
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:07,413
Aoi's situation is way more
important than something that.

278
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,250
[USUI]
To me, THIS is more important.

279
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,720
You still don't get it?

280
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,989
G‐get what? You're always
playing around,

281
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,357
so how could I "get" any‐

282
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,359
[USUI]
Fine. Then look at me.

283
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:26,166
Right now... I'm not
playing around.

284
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,502
Usui...

285
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,245
Fireworks!

286
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,022
Oh yeah. They're supposed
close the festival with a
fireworks display.

287
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,624
(pouting)

288
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,971
[USUI]
You're hot.

289
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,611
Th‐that's just because
I got sunburned!

290
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,345
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,583
[MISAKI]
Grr, enough! Let's
hurry and go back!

292
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,352
[USUI]
(chuckling) Yeah, I get it.

293
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,798
Oh, look, the couple's
finally back.

294
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,933
[ALL]
Welcome back!

295
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,835
Aoi! What's all this?

296
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:39,239
Sure enough, no one could
possibly make a better
princess than ME! Hello!

297
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,907
I see that...

298
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,175
By the end of the night,

299
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,910
it was more like
the Aoi Festival.

300
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,513
Get this! Gon‐chan and Sayu
entered the tournament, too‐

301
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,981
they were here
the whole time!

302
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,250
Well, I was invited here
by some visiting relatives,

303
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,852
and then we ran
into you guys...

304
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,320
Yeah, I'm actually here on a
trip with my family, as well.

305
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,791
[GON‐CHAN]
My elementary‐school nephew kept
saying, "I wanna enter!"
[SAYU] Yeah! Mine did too!

306
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,994
We lost before we could play
Misa and everyone else, though.
(giggling)

307
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,396
You guys should have told
us you were gonna be here!

308
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:08,034
Anyway, now that everyone's back
together again... time for the
real fun to start.

309
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:13,740
[MISAKI] What kind of fun?
[SATSUKI]Tomorrow's the last day
of our vacation, so we should
all take a photo together!

310
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,543
Everyone, scooch closer
together, more toward the
center.

311
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,512
Is this good enough, Manager?

312
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,515
Jeez, I got tired of waiting for
the idiot couple to get back.

313
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,150
I‐I'm sorry. Hey, wait,
quit calling us a couple!

314
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,986
(click)
Okay, the timer's set!

315
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,688
I'm sure you were continuing
where you left off when

316
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,489
I found you on the trail
the other night.

317
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,024
No! W‐We weren't!

318
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,893
Hmph! There was a bit of
hesitation in that denial!

319
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:35,461
No, there wasn't‐ and
don't encourage him!

320
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,034
[MISAKI, voiceover]
Slowly, new feelings were
starting to blossom...

321
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,736
(click, flash)

322
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,777
[MISAKI]
And just like that,
summer had come and gone.

323
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:54,347
(dog howling)

324
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,322
Misa STILL isn't back?!

325
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,190
No it's not true,
it can't be!

326
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,061
To think, our bittersweet summer
has already come to an end!

327
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,732
[TRIO]
Misa! Come back!

328
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,901
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
Shouldn't you go home and
do your summer homework?

329
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,806
This story of summer is
finished. Skip, skip. Ah‐haha...

330
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:51,364
[MISAKI]
I'm home!

331
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:52,999
[SUZUNA]
Welcome back, Sis.
Hurry and eat this.

332
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,068
[MISAKI]
Whoa! What's with all
this watermelon?!

333
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,037
[SUZUNA]
I won them, of course.

334
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,405
[MISAKI]
We've had watermelons and the
beach and other summer‐like
things, huh?

335
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,744
[USUI]
The story of summer is now over!
Next time, DANGER shall approach
Maid Latte.

336
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:06,079
[MISAKI]
Uh! Miyabigaoka's student vice
president is‐!

337
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,117
[SHIROKAWA]
Oh‐ho! I've overheard! Next time
I, Shiroyan, will be making an
appearance!

338
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,819
Let's go, Kurotatsu and Ikkun!

339
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,821
[KUROSAKI]
Aren't you treating us a bit too
much like your henchmen?

340
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,557
[SARASHINA]
Which of us Henchman
is Number 1?

341
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,660
[MISAKI]
Just be whichever
one you want...
