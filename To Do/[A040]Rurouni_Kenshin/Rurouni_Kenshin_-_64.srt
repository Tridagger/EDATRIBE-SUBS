Is that right, Sanosuke?

8
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,280
Kenshin and Kaoru
went to the theater

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,050
this afternoon together?

10
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,140
Yeah, Tae from
over at Lenny's

11
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,260
had two extra tickets
and gave them to them.

12
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,010
It's really good
that they got to

13
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,110
go out and see
a show together,

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,030
after everything they've
gone through recently,

15
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,020
they deserve
a good time out.

What are you saying?

Ever since Kenshin
and Kaoru left,

19

I have to do all
of his work, too,

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,160
and I have no time to
practice my sword work!

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,200
Hey, you shouldn't
be complaining--

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,230
you should just
think of it as

23
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,290
a different
kind of training.

24
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,160
Right, Yoshi?

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,090
Training?!

26
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,140
If you ask me,
this is nothing more

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,150
than slave labor!

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,200
Sanosuke,
could you please

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,020
play with us?

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,000
Eh, sorry, girls,
I'm really busy

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,412
right now.

32
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,140
Aww, that's
really too bad.

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,200
I wish that
Kenshin were here.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,060
Hey, wait
just a minute,

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,150
I have a great idea.

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,130
What?

37
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,090
How would you
like something

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,040
good to eat?

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,110
Yeah!

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,150
Hey, Yoshi?

41
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,120
Huh?

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,190
We're hungry,
we want a snack.

43
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,290
Why don't you make some
sweet potatoes for us?

44
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,210
What?

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,190
I'm busy!

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,210
We want sweet potatoes!

47
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,150
See that?

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,010
The children
are very hungry.

49
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,160
I haven't finished
the laundry yet,

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,060
and I still have
other work to do!

51
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,120
I have to
clean the dojo!

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,210
Oh, come on,
just knock it off,

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,010
quit being
such a whiner.

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,020
Can't you see
they're hungry?

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,270
(coughing)

56
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,270
That darn Sanosuke!

57
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,270
Who does he
think he is?

58
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,260
I'll get even
with him if it's

59
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,110
the last
thing I do!

60
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,230
One day, Sano!

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,180
That was a
wonderful show,

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,200
did you enjoy it?

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh yes, but it's
very late now.

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
I think we should
get back to the dojo.

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,290
Oh, I can't even
remember the last time

66
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,280
I had so much
fun, Kenshin.

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,060
I had a real nice
time, too, Kaoru.

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,160
You sound as though
you didn't have

69
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
that great of a time.

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,150
Is there something else
that's bothering you?

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,220
Well, to tell
you the truth,

72
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,130
I couldn't completely
relax because I was

73
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,010
thinking about dinner,
and all the chores

74
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,385
I have to do.

75
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,180
What?

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,230
Let me get
this straight.

77
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,290
You weren't having
a good time because

78
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,070
you were thinking
about all of your chores?

79
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,110
So, you're saying
you weren't thinking

80
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,120
about me at all!

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,050
That wasn't what I--

82
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,280
Huh, oh...

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,090
Kaoru, look there,
isn't that a really

84
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,100
nice carriage?

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,180
It's very nice.

86
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,190
Hey, Kenshin,
are you trying

87
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,260
to change
the subject?

88
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,250
Well,
actually, I was...

89
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,180
Hmm?

90
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,100
Huh?

91
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,060
What's that noise?

92
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,010
Hey, where
are you going?

93
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,010
You thieves won't
get my carriage!

94
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,080
Come on,
let's get him!

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,395
Oh!

96
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,000
He'll get killed!

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
We should stay
out of this.

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,190
He's good.

99
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,000
He's very skilled
with his sword.

100
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,000
Uh-oh...

101
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,080
He's outnumbered
by all those thugs!

102
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,290
(commotion)

103
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,280
And just
who are you?

104
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,190
I'm someone who
doesn't like the odds

105
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,260
three to one.

106
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,150
You should back off
and leave this man alone.

107
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,200
Sticking your nose
in other people's

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,050
business will
get you killed!

109
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,447
Get him!

110
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,250
Ahh!

111
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,040
Who is this guy?

112
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,020
Let's get
out of here!

113
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,090
And don't come back!

114
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,020
Are you all right,
my old friend?

115
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,130
I don't know
you, young man,

116
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,120
but I appreciate
your helping me.

117
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,020
There's someone
in the carriage.

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh no,
the Prince...

119
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Oh, Your
Highness...

120
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
(groans)

121
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,280
Huh?

122
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Yoshi, what are
you doing in those

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,070
strange clothes?

124
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,100
What are you trying
to pull this time?

125
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,150
Oh...

126
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,290
You'd better
answer me right now!

127
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,020
Stop it!

128
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,110
What's the matter
with you, girl?

129
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,120
It's all right, sir,
I know this young man.

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,020
Get away from him!

131
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,240
What do you think
you're doing, anyway?

132
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,290
Do you have
any idea who

133
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,100
this young man is?

134
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,250
He is Prince Shin
from the Kingdom

135
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
of Jagarata.

136
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
Huh?

137
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,170
Just what is he
talking about, Kenshin?

138
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,040
I don't know, Kaoru.

139
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,190
This kid isn't Yoshi,
he just looks amazingly

140
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,170
like him.

141
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,190
Hmm?

142
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
Oh...

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,120
He looks exactly
like Yoshi.

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,170
How could they
possibly blame you

145
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,030
at all for
thinking it was him?

146
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,180
I feel really terrible.

147
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,020
I went up to
a complete stranger

148
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,100
and started
slapping him.

149
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,180
How could I do that?

150
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,000
Sorry, please,
forgive me.

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,210
We come from the
Jagarata Kingdom.

152
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a very
tiny kingdom.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,190
Prince Shin here
is our ruler.

154
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,170
He came to Japan to
improve the relationship

155
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,230
between our
two countries.

156
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,190
Dr. Gensai, tell us,
is Prince Shin doing

157
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,050
any better?

158
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,140
Well, actually, his
injury's not that bad,

159
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,190
but he is very weak
and dehydrated from

160
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,260
his journey.

161
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,110
He needs lots of fluids
and plenty of rest.

162
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,050
We would be happy
to let you stay here

163
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,020
while he recovers.

164
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,170
That's very
kind of you,

165
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,210
thank you
very much.

166
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,230
It's nothing.

167
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,080
Recently,
Prince Shin's father,

168
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,160
the King,
passed away.

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,170
Since then, the
Prince has been

170
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,280
carrying the
entire country

171
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,060
on his young
shoulders.

172
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,190
He is so young for
such a responsibility.

173
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,060
I don't know what will
become of our kingdom.

174
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,090
Why did this
have to happen?

175
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,100
Are you the Prince's
grandfather or something

176
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,150
like that?

177
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,070
I apologize, I forgot
to introduce myself.

178
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,270
I'm Marcus Murakami,
and I've served

179
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,170
the Prince
since his birth.

180
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,290
My ancestor was
a very great samurai

181
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,260
who built a Japanese
town in Jagarata.

182
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,060
Oh, your ancestor
was a samurai?

183
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,130
So that's why you
carry a sword with you.

184
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,240
That's right, I am
the Prince's protector.

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,250
I realized that I am
old and that I needed

186
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,020
your help earlier.

187
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,280
But when it comes to
the safety of our Prince,

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,200
I will give my
life to protect him.

189
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,160
If anyone dares harm him,
he will have to deal with me

190
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,100
and the sword
of a samurai.

191
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll give him
this and this!

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,130
Watch it--put
that thing away!

193
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,280
Are you sure that
it's entirely safe

194
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,220
to keep this old
guy around here?

195
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,280
Huh?

196
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,150
Sorry about that.

197
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,070
By the way,
Mr. Murakami,

198
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,290
do you have any
idea just who those

199
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,150
thugs were that attacked
your carriage today?

200
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,020
I have no idea
who they were.

201
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,170
Who'd want to
hurt the Prince?

202
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,290
Times are very
tough right now,

203
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,040
and a lot of
the old samurai

204
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,050
have become
criminals in order

205
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,090
to get money to eat.

206
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,180
It's sad, but
true, I'm afraid.

207
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,280
I wonder if that's who
those guys were today.

208
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,070
I have no idea.

209
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh, what am I
gonna do now?

210
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,080
Why, what's
the matter now?

211
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,230
We are here because
Prince Shin has been

212
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,170
invited by your
country as a guest

213
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,180
of honor to a very
prestigious dinner.

214
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,200
It would be
a great sign

215
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,090
of disrespect for
him not to attend.

216
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,100
He's not well
enough to go!

217
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,200
I was afraid of that.

218
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,030
Gee, this guy's
really upset about this,

219
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,150
isn't he?

220
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,090
Hmm?

221
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,050
Hi guys,
I'm glad to see

222
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,010
you finally made
it home tonight.

223
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,260
Ahh!

224
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,080
It's impossible!

225
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,060
This kid looks
like the Prince!

226
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,170
That's right,
this is our friend,

227
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,130
Yoshi.

228
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,060
Who is this
guy, anyway?

229
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,210
Hmm, his resemblance
to Prince Shin

230
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,220
is truly astounding.

231
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,190
Wait a second!

232
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,140
I think I know what
you're thinking, Kaoru.

233
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,210
We have an idea!

234
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,140
Hold on a second,
I just had a great idea!

235
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,210
♪

236
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,130
Your Highness,
I respectfully request

237
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,240
to borrow
your clothes.

238
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,070
What's going
on in here?

239
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,130
Hold it right there.

240
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,160
-What's that?
-Easy.

241
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,170
Yow, what in the
world are you doing?

242
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,270
Get off me,
crazy old man!

243
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,010
Just relax, Yoshi.

244
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,050
Let go of me,
you big baboon!

245
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,050
Ugh!

246
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,080
What are you
gonna do with that?

247
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,180
Ahhh!

248
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,110
I can't believe it,
it's as though

249
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,260
they're identical twins!

250
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,210
These are real
goofy clothes.

251
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,190
(laughter)

252
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,210
Haven't you heard
that expression,

253
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,280
"The clothes
make the man"?

254
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,250
You look very nice
in that, Yoshi.

255
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,100
You look
like royalty!

256
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,240
Well, I hate
these clothes.

257
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,090
Why do I have
to dress like this?

258
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,150
I feel like a clown!

259
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,250
Mr. Yoshi, I beg
you to help us out.

260
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,160
Huh?

261
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,100
I've never asked
a favor of any man,

262
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,280
but I'm asking
a favor of you.

263
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,120
You're the only one
who can help Jagarata.

264
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
It's a matter of
national consequence!

265
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
Jagarata?

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,190
I don't know what
you're talking about.

267
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,270
Kenshin,
what's he saying?

268
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,070
What's going on here?

269
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,110
Would somebody
please answer me?

270
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,060
That man was darn
good with a sword!

271
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,190
He ruined our
assassination attempt

272
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,240
with the Prince.

273
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Yeah, I don't know
when we'll have another

274
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
chance like
we had tonight.

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,010
That sure was
a weird sword he used.

276
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,040
Hmm?

277
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,170
I thought for sure he
had sliced my hand off,

278
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,120
but look,
it's still here.

279
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,100
He could have
sliced it off

280
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,030
if he wanted to.

281
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,160
Don't worry, sir,
the Prince won't

282
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,230
get away
from us again.

283
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,280
We'll make
sure of that!

284
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,130
See that you do
and be certain

285
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,290
that you don't
screw up again!

286
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,160
Uh...uh...

287
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,220
Now take a
look at this.

288
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,090
The Prince
will be here

289
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,050
at a dinner
party tonight.

290
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,240
Now, the dinner
party is tonight,

291
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,030
that doesn't leave
us very much time

292
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,090
to transform you
into a royal person.

293
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,110
I still don't
see why I have

294
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,120
to go through
with this.

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,230
I feel completely ridiculous

296
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,100
in this stupid outfit!

297
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
I've explained it.

298
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,180
We have been all
through this already.

299
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,290
If the Prince
doesn't attend,

300
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,110
Jagarata will lose
face in Japan's eyes,

301
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,220
and we could be
devoured by other

302
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,110
powerful countries.

303
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,070
The very existence
of our country rests

304
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,090
on the Prince going
to this party tonight.

305
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,270
Do you understand?

306
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,070
All right, already,
I'm sorry that I asked.

307
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,060
I'll go
through with this,

308
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,220
just tell me
what I have to do.

309
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,000
The first thing
you have to do

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,070
is to learn
some manners

311
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,170
so you behave
like a Prince.

312
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,190
Manners?

313
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,270
What is that?

314
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,080
Does that mean
I have to put on

315
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
some other
stuff or what?

316
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,220
Stop that!

317
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,120
Ow, hey, what's
the big idea?

318
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,150
Now, listen,
if you behave

319
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,030
inappropriately
at the party tonight,

320
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,070
it'll be an
embarrassment

321
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,010
to our country
and I won't have it.

322
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,130
Do you understand?

323
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,020
Yeah, I understand that.

324
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,060
Good.

325
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,100
What is it with
this old guy?

326
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,130
I try and
do him a favor

327
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,090
and this is how he
decides to repay me?

328
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,090
Now pay attention, Mr. Yoshi.

329
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,140
We've a lot to do
and little time

330
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
to do it in.

331
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,180
I've asked your
friends to help.

332
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,030
All of my friends
are gonna help us out?

333
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,110
Yes, and as a
matter of fact,

334
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,260
they're coming now.

335
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,150
Oh, well
dressed, too.

336
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,240
What do you
think, Yoshi?

337
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,250
Hey, Kaoru,
why in the world

338
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,160
do we have to be
dragged into this

339
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,210
thing anyway?

340
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,050
We have to go
as his entourage

341
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,180
and make sure nothing
bad happens to Yoshi.

342
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,140
You look great.

343
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,130
Yeah?

344
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,070
Thanks, I'm...
I'm not used

345
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,110
to wearing nice
clothes like these.

346
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,200
For royalty, I mean.

347
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,060
Well, I think you
look very handsome

348
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,020
dressed like
that, Kenshin.

349
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,070
In fact,
in these outfits,

350
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,210
I think we make
a beautiful couple,

351
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,260
don't you?

352
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,270
Kaoru, this isn't
the time or place

353
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,230
for this!

354
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,060
Ooh, you do make
a lovely couple.

355
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,190
Knock it off, Sano!

356
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,090
Why do I always
have to wait forever

357
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,150
when there's
a woman involved?

358
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,210
Keep quiet!

359
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,230
All right,
now pay attention.

360
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,160
We will now work on our
proper dining etiquette.

361
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,250
Good, 'cause
I'm starving!

362
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,140
Let's eat!

363
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,010
Thank you,
we shall now eat.

364
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,210
(slurp)

365
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,290
This soup sure
tastes different

366
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,160
than the one
at the dojo.

367
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,250
That isn't soup,
it's puree you're eating.

368
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,100
And always remember
to use the proper

369
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,200
spoon when eating it.

370
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,260
I'd say the proper
spoon is this one.

371
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,000
It's tasty.

372
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mmm, it's too thick.

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,050
Mmm, and it could
use some more salt!

374
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,000
Mmm, it tastes good,
but the texture's

375
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,100
a little
soft for me.

376
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,230
(groans)

377
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,100
Next course.

378
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,000
Now that's a steak!

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,230
Wow, that looks nothing
like the steak we get

380
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,120
at Lenny's.

381
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,190
You can say
that again,

382
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,190
but where are
the chopsticks

383
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,250
to eat it with?

384
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,020
I don't see
them anywhere.

385
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,080
Where did
you put them?

386
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,170
They don't
use chopsticks.

387
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,200
You should be
using your knife

388
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,050
and fork to
eat a steak!

389
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,270
Sanosuke,
he means these.

390
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,220
Oh, yeah,
here they are.

391
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,190
Oh, this
thing is tough!

392
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,140
I can't get
a bite out of it!

393
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,160
You knucklehead!

394
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
Put it back
on your plate

395
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,010
and cut it
into pieces.

396
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,170
I just can't get it!

397
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,521
Huh?

398
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,230
Hmm?

399
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,100
Just what does
Kenshin think

400
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,050

401
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know.

402
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,180
Very nice.

403
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,000
Way to go, Kenshin.

Hiten Mitsurugi
style of eating.

405
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,240
Just a flick of
the wrist, really.

406
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,240
I hope this works.

407
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,240
Go here and
here and there.

408
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,000
Go here and

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,230
That's right,
Susie, very good.

Ayame, it's
your turn now,

411
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,290

412

Go here and

413
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,160
That's very
good, Ayame.

You are doing it right.

Great!

416
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,100
What is the
Prince teaching you?

417
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,260
He's teaching us
how to say "hello"

418
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,210
in his native Jagarata.

419
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,290
He also knows
how to speak

420
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,180
very good English.

421
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,240
I learned how
to speak English

422
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,120
from my protector,
Mr. Murakami.

423
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,220
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

424
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,120
My back itches
from sitting in

425
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,030
that chair
all day long!

426
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,040
Himura.

427
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,404
Huh?

428
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,280
Mr. Yamagata.

429
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,110
If anyone
talks to you,

430
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,170
don't say anything.

431
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,070
It's acceptable
to bow politely

432
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,150
and listen silently.

433
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,080
Smile but don't
speak, or everyone

434
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,030
will find you out.

435
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,040
Huh?

436
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,020
It looks like
Kenshin disappeared

437
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,040
and took off
on his own.

438
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,240
The most important
thing for you to

439
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,130

maintain your dignity

440
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,190

that tonight I should

act important?

443
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,180
In a manner of speaking,
you are correct, sir.

According to our
army reconnaissance,

483
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,220
some assassins have
been hired to try

484
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,120

the country would have

internal turmoil,
and the Europeans

494
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,220

their nation.

there to assassinate
