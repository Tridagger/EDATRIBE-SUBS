00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,280
I wanted you to know.

368
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,270
My medallion,
where was it?

369
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,240
It's at the house
of Master Kaiou.

370
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,140
Are you really
sure about this?

371
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,040
So how many times
am I gonna have

372
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,260
to repeat myself, pinhead?

373
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,080
Read my lips,
your angel medallion

374
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,110
was taken by the
blonde guy, get it?

375
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,010
If your information
is accurate,

376
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,100
the medallion might
be at Sir Kaiou's.

377
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,120
How perceptive of you.

378
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,180
That's why
I've been asking

379
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,220
if this is the right
way to Kaiou's place.

380
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,160
If you expected a
pleasant response,

381
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,210
you should've asked
in a pleasant way.

382
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,240
(grunting)

383
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,180
Fine, don't
come with me.

384
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,030
-You are such a...
-What the hell?

385
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,140
Now that's strange.

386
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,130
Why is there light
coming from down there?

387
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,160
This is your kingdom,

388
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,030
don't you know
what goes on here?

389
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,120
Not always, we just
arrived last year.

390
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,250
Kaiou has been
using this area

391

five years.

392
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,220

to the people

Then I will become the
Archbishop of this church

gospel far and wide.

Behold the Book of
Prophecy by Shogo Amakusa.

425
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,140
Once the savior is gone,

426
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,180
his followers will read
the material in this book

427
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,010

prophecies come to pass.

never written such a book.

Ha-ha, of course not.

I wrote it,
you stupid fool.

You'll never get
away with this.

434
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,100
Oh, the plan is
foolproof, I assure you.

435
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,160
People will be willing to
kill in your brother's name.

436
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,050
He'll be a
god to them.

437

Thousands of people will
mobilize to carry his word

And everywhere they go,

440
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,290
their fanaticism will
lead to chaos and riots.

441
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,290
They'll turn this
country upside-down

442
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,130
and political power will
move into Dutch hands.

443
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,100
I will then step
forward and become king.

444

from the face of the Earth.
