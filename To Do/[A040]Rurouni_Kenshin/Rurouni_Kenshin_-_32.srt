My shoulder doesn't hurt.

189
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,150
What really hurts is
that Kenshin thought

190
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,190
that I'd get in his way.

191
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,250

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,010
I promised him that I'll
get Koaru to Ito and I will,

370
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,170
even if I have
to drag her there.

371
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,060
Yoshi.

372
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,170
Hm?
Megumi.

373
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,230
Oh, you're still here?

374
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,270
I thought I heard that
you were going to Ito.

375
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,010
So are you going to stay here

376
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,040
and watch the dojo?

377
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,210
Oh, I guess that
you haven't heard,

378
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,190
but Kaoru's still at the dojo.

379
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,000
Huh?

380
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,070
It's not very good,

381
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,040
but you have to eat
something, Kaoru.

382
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,180
Try a bite.

383
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't want it.

384
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,220
Don't say that, Koaru,

385
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,000
Tsubame went to a lot of
trouble to make it for you.

386
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Just try some.

387
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,020
No thank you.

388
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,100
You've really gotta
snap out of it.

389
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,170
It's not healthy for
you to act like this.

390
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,220
Just try some, will you?

391
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,270
Please?

392
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,210
Come on, Kaoru.

393
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,260
I just told you.

394
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,150
I don't want it.

395
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,270
Please try some.

396
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,020
I just told you
that I'm not hungry!

397
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,140
Just leave me alone!

398
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,130
Leave me alone.

399
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,170
I can't believe it.

400
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,210
Yoshi told me you
were still at the dojo.

401
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,180
Just what do you want, Megumi?

402
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,140
Well, actually I
just wanted to drop by

403
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
and see how you were doing

404
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,642
after Kenshin dumped you.

405
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,682
(laughing)

406
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,060
Please, Megumi.

407
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,000
You don't know what it
feels like to be hurt.

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,100
Yes, I do.

409
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,120
But you don't see me
laying around all day crying

410
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,070
and feeling sorry for myself.

411
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,070
I don't feel like
doing much of anything.

412
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,020
I just want you
to leave me alone.

413
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,160
So you don't wanna do
much of anything, huh?

414
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,290
If you could have
anything right now

415
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,200
what would you wish for?

416
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,290
I'd wish for Kenshin.

417
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,020
Then you should go to him.

418
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,120
I can't do that.

419
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,190
Maybe you're afraid that Kenshin

420
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,270
doesn't want you hanging
around, is that it?

421
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,120
I made some secret
medicine for Kenshin.

422
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,150
He told me last time I gave him
some that it worked very well.

423
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,260
Considering what's been going on

424
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,180
he could really use
some of this right now.

425
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,120
But I guess I can't ask a
crybaby like you to deliver it.

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,050
So I'll ask Yoshi.

427
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,240
And I'm sure that when
Kenshin gets this medicine

428
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,060
he'll remember me.

429
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,240
Even if he forgets
all about you.

430
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,230
Then tell me, why don't
you go all the way to Ito

431
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,190
and deliver it to him in person.

432
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,200
Do it yourself!

433
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm afraid I can't.

434
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,290
I'm not lazy like you

435
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,160
and I have patients
to attend to.

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,070
I can't just leave
whenever I want to.

437
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,100
I have responsibilities.

438
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,140
Oh, your patients are more
important than Kenshin.

439
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,210
I guess that proves
that your feelings

440
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,090
don't really amount
to much, do they?

441
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,130
Oh!

442
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,250
Kaoru, you really should
be careful what you say.

443
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,050
I'm still the master of
the Kamiya Kasshin School.

444
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,070
Don't underestimate my ability.

445
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,200
Could we go home, right now?

446
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,050
Don't you dare
underestimate me, either.

447
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,180
I want you to look at me.

448
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,090
I became a doctor
to help others,

449
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,180
do you understand?

450
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,100
And as a way to make
up for my past crimes.

451
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,180
This is the path that
I've chosen to take

452
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,140
and it was Kenshin
who was responsible

453
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,110
for leading me to
this path I'm on.

454
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,090
I have him to
thank for everything.

455
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,120
Dying will not bring
those people back to life.

456
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,010
I can do better by using
my sword to help others.

457
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,220
I try to help as many as I can,

458
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,080
that's how I try to make amends.

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,220
You have a knowledge
of medicine,

460
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,250
it's a gift that could
save many people's lives.

461
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,120
You could help a lot of people.

462
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,250
Even more than the
sword of Battosai.

463
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,070
Become a doctor, Megumi.

464
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,150
Aid all the people that
are suffering, Megumi.

465
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,100
They all need your help.

466
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Not just the ones
who suffer from opium,

467
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,080
but the wounded

468
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,280
and the ones with diseases.

469
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,140
Please, Megumi.

470
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,060
Kenshin.

471
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,110
That's the reason that
even if Kenshin isn't around

472
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,130
I still have to take
care of the sick.

473

You're hopeless.

I really thought you were
a lot stronger than this.

482
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,200
You really don't
understand, do you, Megumi?

483
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Kenshin told me to my
face he was going to leave,

he said goodbye to me.
