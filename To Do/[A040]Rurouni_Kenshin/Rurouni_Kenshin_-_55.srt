I cried my eyes out.

186
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,606
One day, they were
all yelling at me

187
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,486

looked so stupid

188
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,376
I couldn't help smiling.

189
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,436
And they were so surprised
they stopped yelling.

190
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,626
So I just kept smiling.

191
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,596
Pretending I'm enjoying
whatever terrible things

192
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,516

make it hurt less.

It's as if, somehow, if I
can keep smiling, I've won.
