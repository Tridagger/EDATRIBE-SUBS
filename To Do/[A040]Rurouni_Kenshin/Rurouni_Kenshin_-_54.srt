Well, I've gotta say,
I'm very impressed.

143
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,466
Shishio told me
about this method.

144
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,266
Before then,
I'd never even heard of it.

145

146
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,436
That sounds very interesting.

147
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,336
Evidently, that's Sojiro's
third element of power.

148
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,426
The first two being
his Heavenly Sword

149
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,536
and, of course,
his complete lack of emotion.

150
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,346
Yes, that's right.

151
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,356
The Shukuchi technique
requires powerful footwork.

152
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,416
Sojiro is able
to reach maximum speed

153
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,386
from the very first step,
similar to how a magician

154
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,406
goes about creating an illusion.

155
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:39,426
Each time he steps,
he disappears into thin air.

156
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,486
He can jump from one point
to the other without ever

157
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,486
being seen.

158
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,536
So, what you're saying is

159
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:46,296
Shukuchi means speed
that cannot be detected

160
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,466
with the naked eye,
is that right?

161
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,516
Not exactly.

162
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,336
What you're thinking of

163
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,476
resembles Battousai's
Shinsoku technique.

164
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:56,306
Sojiro's ultra-fast movement
cannot be detected period.

165
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:00,436
That's what makes
a far more superior method.

166
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,516
It's quite simple:

167
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:04,416
Battousai fights
by reading emotions

168
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,336
and when those
emotions don't exist

169
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:07,546
or don't manifest themselves,

170
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,486
it's impossible to detect them.

171
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:12,556
So, there's just about nothing
Battousai can do about it,

172
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:15,556
no matter how much he tries,
because Sojiro will always have

173
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,416
a big advantage.

174
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,276
Sojiro may be a kid,
but his lightning-fast speed

175
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,416
will win out, you'll see.

176
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,456
That means Battousai's chances

177
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,416
of surviving
this competition are--

178
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,346
Absolutely zero.

179
