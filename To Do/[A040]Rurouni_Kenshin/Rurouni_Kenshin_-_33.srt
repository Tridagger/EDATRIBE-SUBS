on a mountain road

369
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,260
but I find myself in this field.

370
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,120
Now what's going on?

371
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,200
Now wait a second,

372
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,060
if I can find out
where north is...

373
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,070
Aha.

374
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,140
Which means that
west is that way.

375
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,240
Then Edo is that way, too.

376
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,070
Sick five, I'm going to Edo!

377
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,190
I wonder if Kenshin is okay.

378
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,250
Huh?

379
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,220
The Shishio Group was
enough to deal with,

380
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,230
but now we have Aoshi
to deal with as well.

381
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,220
Ah!

382
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,210
What'll we do?

383
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,230
My hair!

384
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,030
Check her out!

385
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,020
Sure would like to
get to know her better.

386
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,050
Hi, guys.

387
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,040
Whoa, yeah!

390

well as you ever have,

I promise you that!

Sorry, I'm in a hurry,

393

You won't be able
to find your way.

Shishio's men might find me.
