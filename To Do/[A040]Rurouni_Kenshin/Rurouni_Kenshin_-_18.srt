at Lenny's Restaurant?

55

Yeah, we heard.

56
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,140
They said some
crazy guy with

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,190
a knife tried
to rob them,

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,190
and you stopped him.

Is that right?

Hmm, yeah, this
guy was huge!

He was about
seven foot tall,

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,050
he was coming at
me with a dagger,

63
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,230
but I stopped him
with a parry thrust

64
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,260
and knocked him out!

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,010
He had a dagger?

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,010

had taken a knife

67
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,040
from the kitchen.

68

the guy was

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,290
not much taller
than Kaoru.

whatever height he was,

is to know about

the Kamiya Kasshin style.

81
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,270
Oh, and be sure you
put that bamboo sword

82
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,200
away before it
gets all moldy.

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200

to take that.

I'm the first one to admit
you've gotten stronger,

101

is a very dangerous thing

use a real sword

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,050

Exactly.

146

Once I was the
premier swordsman,

Battousai the Slasher,

148
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,010
busted my fingers,

But I've always
held him responsible

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,090

the one thing

154
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,140
