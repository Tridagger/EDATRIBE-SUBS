How'd you get out?

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,220
I made a deal with the
government of course.

that sort of thing.

make a living, believe me,

I don't feel great about it,
but I didn't have much choice.

It's the only way I could get
them to drop the charges,

you know how it is.

192

guys stop watching me,

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,130

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,150
were supposed to do
in case we lost.

Huh?

248
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,120
When we first formed
the Juppongatana,

249
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,110
Shishio told us that there
weren't any guarantees

250
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,210
in a struggle like this,
that we had to have a plan

251

in case things
didn't go our way.

252
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,060
If Shishio failed
to take over Japan,

253
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,200
the Meiji government
would rewrite history.

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,050
They'd say that
everyone supported them,

255
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,230
that Shishio never existed.

256
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,280
It would be our job to tell the
public our side of the story.

Liar!

I'm from Kansai, we may joke
a lot, but we never tell a lie.

259

As a matter of fact, when
Shishio told us about this

260
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,170
he mentioned you specifically.

261
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,250
I gotta admit he knew
who was right for the job.

262
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,020
I can't think of
anybody from the group

263
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,280
who'd make a better
public speaker than you.

264

I've always had a way of
making people listen to me,

267
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,240
and it would be an honor to
tell them about Mr. Shishio.

268
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,150
So now she has a goal in life.

269
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,150
I find it hard to
believe that Shishio

270
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,200
would have said such a thing.

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,260
Yeah, why would he plan
anything in case he lost

272
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,020

so sure he would win?

She wasn't just in love
with him, she idolized him.

278

If she thought she was
following his instructions

279
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,220
it would give her
something to live for.

I think he'd rather
go to prison.

286

in even though he expected

287

to get the death penalty for all
the terrible things he'd done.

288
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,290
But because he showed so much
remorse for what he'd done,

289
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,040
and because of the good
word you put in for him,

290
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,080
they sentenced him to 25 years

291

He gave himself up to
the police like Anji did,

306
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,220
expecting to be put on trial
which is why he wanted

307
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,060
to be arrested, but
there was no trial.

308
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,220
A trial would've given
him a public forum

309
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,050
to speak on Mr. Shishio's
behalf, to tell everyone

310
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,290
that Shishio's goal was
to strengthen our country.

311
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,030
So, when the government
realized that Hoji wouldn't cut

312
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,240
any kind of deal with them,

313
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,070
they locked him in jail where
he couldn't talk to anyone,

314
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,190
and threw away the key, right?

315
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,230
And what's ironic is that of all
the guys they made deals with,

316
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,040
he was the one that
could've done the most

317
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,270
productive work
for the government.

318
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,020
He had tremendous
administrative ability,

319
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,280
and knew how to
plan for the future,

320
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,210
but they knew he was
fanatically loyal to Shishio,

321
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,270

solitary confinement,

there the rest of his life.

Finally, having completely
lost his faith in his government

without hope of ever seeing

love was returned.

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,120
The other one is Iwanbo,
that big tub of lard

353
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,260
you took care of in
the battle of Aoiya.

354
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,190
Without someone telling him
what to do he's fairly harmless.

355
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,160
(laughing)

356
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,280
-Cho.
-Yeah?

357
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,180
Shishio's right hand man,
the one who killed himself,

358
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
I'd really like
to know his name,

359
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,250
and you never told
me what it was.

360
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,020
Hoji, Hoji Sadojima.

361
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,260
Shishio Makoto
and Yumi Komagata,

362
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,280
and the Juppongatana group.

363
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,180
Although their names won't
appear in any history books

364
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,130
please tell the spirit of
Hoji Sadojima that those names

365
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,050
along with his will be
remembered in my heart.

366
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,100
Sure, I'll deliver the message
for ya, though I don't know

367
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,260
how happy his ghost is gonna
be to hear it coming from me.

Sayonara.

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,150
We won, right?

370
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,100
I mean, what they did
was wrong, wasn't it?

371
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,260
We did win, so we
must have been right.

372
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,130
If you're saying we
were right because we won,

373
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,190
then you're thinking the
same way Shishio Makoto did.

374
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,070
We fought and defeated
Shishio and the Juppongatana

375
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,200
because we believe that stopping
him was the right thing to do,

376
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,010
but everyone on their
side thought that fighting

377
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,040
for Shishio and his cause
was the right thing to do,

378
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,020
because they believed
in his philosophy,

379
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,200
and felt that Japan
needed him as a leader.

380
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,050
In that sense, we're the same.

381
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,040
We both fought for what
we thought was right.

382
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,090
Just because we beat them
doesn't mean their point of view

383
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,280
was any less valid than ours.

384
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,050
It only means they lost.

385
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,180
None of us can know who was
right and who was wrong,

387

History will have
to be the judge of that.

However, there is
one thing I know

389
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,100
that Shishio was wrong about.

390
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,160
His so-called law of nature,
the survival of the fittest.

391
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,130
There can be no
such law among humans

392

You're my chief
advisor, aren't you?
