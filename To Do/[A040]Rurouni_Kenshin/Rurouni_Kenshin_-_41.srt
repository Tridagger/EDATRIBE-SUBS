without my permission

192

I can see that
this training

193
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,313
is very important
to you, Himura.

194
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:56,373
This guy's
Kenshin's master?

195
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,153
I can't believe
there's such a person.

196
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,373
Yeah, Seijuro
Hiko is his name.

197
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,243
I understand that
he is the master

198
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:03,153
of the Hiten
Mitsurugi style.

199
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,263
He has studied this
technique for 20 years.

200
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,233
So are you saying
Kenshin doesn't know

201
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,393
certain techniques of
the Hiten Mitsurugi style?

202
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,273
Maybe there are certain
aspects of the technique

203
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,393
he doesn't know, that's why
he went to see the master.

204
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,403
So, if he would master
those techniques--

205
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,373
Then he would be even more
powerful than he was before.

206
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,263
Wow, that's incredible!

207
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,173
As it is, he's
not even human!

208
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,163
This will make
him a monster.

209
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:26,223
(laughing)

210
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:30,313
I can't believe I'm going
to see Kenshin again.

211
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,373
I can't wait.

212
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,173
Every second seems
like an eternity.

213
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:38,303
I see, so Mr. Shishio
is back in town

214
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,403
and you have to go back to
being Battousai the Slasher

215
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,133
in order to
defeat him,

216
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,403
but you don't want to
kill him, is that it?

217
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,383
And in order to defeat
him without killing him,

218
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,313
you have to become
more powerful.

219
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,313
You want to develop
more strength and power,

220
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,283
and that's why
you've come to me.

221
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,383
But that's impossible.

222
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,193
Why is that?

223
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,213
Remember when you
were my student?

224
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,133
Remember what
I taught you?

225
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,293
A sword is
a murder weapon.

226
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,293
Swordsmanship is
a murder technique

227
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,373
no matter how you try
to look at it, Himura.

228
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,283
And no matter how you try to
make it clean and beautiful,

229
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:10,183
those are the real facts.

230
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:12,383
It's impractical to maintain
your optimistic ideas

231
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:15,223
in the face of death.

232
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:18,383
This mistake began
15 years ago.

233
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:22,203

234
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,353
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

235
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:25,343
-Yes.
-You fool.

236
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,243
You should concentrate
on your training

237
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,383
and not pay attention to
what's going on outside.

238
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,263
But how I can
ignore it, Master?

239
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:33,253
More and more people have
been dragged into the mess.

240
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,313
They're being killed
even as we speak.

241
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:38,133
Isn't the motto of the
Hiten Mitsurugi technique

242
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,243
to protect people
from the pain of life?

243

you're going to do that?

244
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,233
You're pompous.

245
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,233
Oh, yeah?

246
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,273
Go ahead if you
want to leave.

brings victory for the
person who masters it

254

efficiently, understand?
