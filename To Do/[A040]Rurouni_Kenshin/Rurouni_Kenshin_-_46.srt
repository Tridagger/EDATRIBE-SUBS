♪

192
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:52,263
We could destroy
all of those life boats

193
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,333
and the people in them,
including Shishio,

194
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,483
but if we did that,
we'd be guilty

195
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,443
of spilling the blood
of innocent victims.

196
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,373
Because most of them
are just followers

197

how evil Shishio really is.

If you really believe that
about the Juppongatana group,

199

then you're even more
naïve than I thought,

200
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:09,523
which I didn't think
was possible.

201
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:13,313
Saito, all those people
had a choice which side to be on

202
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:14,443
and they all chose
the wrong one,

203
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,413

deserves the opportunity

Brave, but dumb.

Maybe, but you
gotta admit, Saito,

214
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,473
without his help, we couldn't
have beaten Shishio today.

Come back here, you wimp!

216

that he's
aggravating and stupid,

he's also a loyal friend

00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,072

You here, Misao?

286
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,092
How...

287
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:14,172
could...

288
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,002
I?

289
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,962
How could I have allowed them
to treat me like that,

290
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,002
to treat me like
a stupid little girl?

291
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:22,062
I'm an idiot,

292
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:25,022
a good-for-nothing girl who
doesn't even know how to fight!

293
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,162
Oh, it's my fault, oh!

294
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,062
What happened to her?

295
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,132
We really don't know for sure,
but she's been this way

296
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:33,112
ever since she fought
that guy yesterday.

297
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,102
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

298
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,062
That's who she's talking about.

299
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:39,942
Two men who work for Shishio
came through yesterday,

300
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,022
and she got into a big fight
with the one that they call

301
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,082
the Blind Sword.

302
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,942
His name is Usui,
and he's the most

303
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,142
bloodthirsty killer
of them all.

304
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,182
With his animal cunning,
his skill as a fighter,

305
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,222
and his love of killing,
I'm impressed that Misao

306
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:54,022
even managed to survive
a fight with this guy.

307
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,122
She did, though.

308
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,982
Oh!

309
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:00,982
Huh?

310
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:02,172
What are you doing here, Anji?

311
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,202
You know I don't like
to be interrupted.

312
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:07,182
Killing innocent civilians
serves no purpose, Usui.

313
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,212
Let her go.

314
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:11,012
Shishio's plan has failed,
it's time to regroup.

315
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:11,962
So what?

316
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:13,032
I will kill her
because killing

317
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,942
is what brings me pleasure.

318
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,072
Then I promise you,
as your blade does to her,

319
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,942
mine will do to you.

320
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,022
Come back and kill her
some other time if you must,

321
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:26,062
but you will not dishonor me
by doing so in my presence.

322
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,132
After that, they didn't say
anything, anything at all,

323
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,982
They just stood there
for a long time

324
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,032
staring at each other.

325
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:35,102
And then they left.

326
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,132
The other one,
the one called Anji,

327
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,962
there's something about
him that's different

328
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,162
than the other guys
in Shishio's group.

329
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,032
And he must be
one heck of a fighter

330
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,082
or Usui wouldn't have
backed down like that.

331
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,062
Sounds like this Anji
is the one responsible

332
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,202
for saving Misao's life.

333
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:52,092
But Usui would've
killed her just for fun.

334
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:56,942
The day we meet, Usui,
will be your last.

335
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:57,952
Kenshin!

336
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,202
Hmm, what is it, Yoshi?

337
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:01,082
Well, there's something
that's really important

338
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,182
that we have to talk about.

339
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,062
Aoshi is in Edo.

340
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,112
What?

341
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,072
Yes, and I've got
other news as well.

342
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:09,112
Yeah, go on.

343
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,102
No, let me tell him.

344
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,942
After all, I'm still
the leader of the Oni gang,

345
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:17,172
so I consider it my duty
to give Kenshin a full report.

346
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:20,982
(water dribbling)

347
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:22,982

348
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:27,202
(panting)

349
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,942
Huh?

350
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:29,972
-Come with me!
-Ow!

351
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:31,142
Now, you got that?

352
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:33,102
There's no time to lose!

353
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,172
Okina has regained
consciousness!

354
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:38,172
I wish I knew what
was going on around here.

355
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:40,122
He's awake, he's awake!

356
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:42,162
Okina's awake!

357
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:44,082
I just can't believe it!

358
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,182
Who'd have thought it?

359
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,182
It looks like he's recovered!

360
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:50,022
Okina, Okina, are you all right?

361
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,972

I apologize to you all

365

Kenshin, I have a favor to ask,
but first, there are things

366
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,222
I must tell you.

367
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:13,162
Kenshin, how much do you know
about Aoshi Shinomori?

368
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,092
Does this favor have
something to do with him?

369
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:18,012
Indeed, it does,
but please,

370
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:20,132
before you ask me what it is,
allow me to tell you

371
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,142
what has gone before.

372
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:25,042
I raised Aoshi as if
he were my own son,

373
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,192
and he grew into a good
and honorable man.

374
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,162
He in turn raised Misao
as if she were his daughter,

375
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,052
but when she was
about ten years old,

376
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,022
he suddenly changed into a man

377
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,222
obsessed with one thing
and one thing only,

378
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,172
the need to become
what he calls

379
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,972
the most powerful,
but what I call

380
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,122

Ama Kakeru Ryu no Hirameki,

470

and what makes it so dangerous
is that if you're not careful

471
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,942
it'll end up controlling you,

So that's why you were crying
so much this afternoon,
