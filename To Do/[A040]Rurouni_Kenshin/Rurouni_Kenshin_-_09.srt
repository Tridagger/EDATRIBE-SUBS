I came to Kyoto from
Aizu five years ago

194
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,110

assistant to a local doctor.

195
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,280
I found out later
that the doctor

196
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,020
was tied in to the Oni gang.

197
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,230
He was making opium
for Takeda to distribute.

198
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,090

199
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,280
He started selling
opium on the side

200

to take his place.

202
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,020

Instead of helping people,

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,000
I made something that
took over their souls

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120

finally made you run away?

a new kind of opium

215

produced inexpensively.
