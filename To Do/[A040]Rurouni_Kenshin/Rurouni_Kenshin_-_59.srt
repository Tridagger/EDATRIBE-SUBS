186
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,230
It's impossible to beat me!

187
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,220
Ha ha!

188
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,170
Ugh!

189
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,190
(whooshing)

190
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,220
(thud)

191
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,080
It's really a tragedy,
you had so much

192
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,250
going for you, Aoshi.

193
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,040
But apparently,
you've allowed yourself

194
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,140
to be corrupted
by your own

195
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,190
worthless demons.

196
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,240
You're completely defeated,

197
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,270
now there's no
use in you moving.

198
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,240
Unless Battousai decides
to get up and save you!

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,140
What?

200
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,270
That's a ridiculous notion.

201
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,150
Why, Battousai will never
be able to get up again.

202
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,150
(laughs)

203
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,180
If that's what you're expecting,

204
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,060
Aoshi, then you've gone crazy.

205
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,040
Battousai's practically

206
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,422
a corpse.

207
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:41,190
He's never going
to get up again!

208
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,040
All he's good for now
is food for the worms.

209
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,250
There's no sense in
continuing the struggle,

210
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,000
it's useless!

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,220
Face it, Aoshi,
Battousai is never

212
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,200
going to come back to life,
so why don't you just forget it?

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,170
I hope that he listens,
Shishio won't be able

214
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,210
to fight any longer.

215
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,270
Ugh...

216
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,080
Can Battousai really be dead?

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,150
(clang)

218
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,230
My master once told me
the will to live

219
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,190
is stronger than anything else.

220
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,170
His enlightened words
have given me the power

221
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,070
and strength to continue on,
even when I was hovering

222
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,200
between the void
of life and death.

223
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,020
All I can tell you
is that my mastery

224
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,170
of the secret principle
is based on this belief.

225
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,150
The crimes I committed

226
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,180
as Battousai

227
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,110
can never be forgiven,
and so I've made up my mind

228
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,100
that it doesn't matter
if I live or die.

229
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
That's not important, right?

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,408
No.

231
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,030
I realize that
I deserve to be

232
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,080
punished for
the heinous sins

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,250
of my past.

234
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,060
But no matter
how much guilt I feel,

235
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,280
or how much pain
I've caused other people

236
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,070
by committing these
terrible offenses,

237
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,250
there's still
a powerful feeling

238
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,190
deep inside of me
that makes it possible

239
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,260
to survive!

240
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,270
It's the will,
the desire

241
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,110
to go on living.

242
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,080
And never, ever giving up.

243
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,240
That will is
my greatest secret,

244
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,090
Aoshi.

245
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,040
(panting)

246
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,070
Look, the man isn't
going to give up!

247
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,100
Why does he keep fighting?

248
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,270
His efforts will be futile!

249
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm beginning to believe
he's possessed!

250
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,220
Don't be so hasty, Shishio.

251
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm still willing
to take you on.

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,230
I'll finish you yet!

253
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,280
What a pity!

254
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,090
You remind me of Battousai,

255
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,050
I'd have to say that
you're more intolerant

256
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,240
than he is, but
you're just like him

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,030
when it comes to taking up
the sword for others.

258
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,070
Don't like hearing the truth?

259
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,130
Personally, I believe

260
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,080
you have the guts or the will
to become the most powerful!

261
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,030
And just like that
pathetic Battousai,

262
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,000
your desire to live
was already gone

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,260
when you came here
to fight me!

264
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,250
(whoosh)

265
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,140
It doesn't make a whole
lot of difference to me

266
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,100
whether you compare me
to Battousai or not,

267
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,210
but there is one thing
I have to say.

268
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,080
Listen to me, Shishio,
because I really believe this.

269
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm more powerful than you are.

270
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
(wind rushing)

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
Hmph, you're desperate, Aoshi.

272
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,110
It sounds like the
howling of a dying dog.

273
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,130
Hmm?

274
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,120
There's no way, it can't be,

275
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,100
I killed him!

276
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,260
(grunting)

277
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,260

278
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,000
Battousai is alive!

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Oh, no, that's impossible!

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,260
He'd have to be immortal.

281
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,070
But just the same,
Shishio, he appears

282
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,260
to be unconscious,
now's your chance

283
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,110
to get rid of him for good!

284
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,250
Go ahead and give him
the final blow

285
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,120
while you still can,
then you will own

All right, now is the
time for us to pull out

290

our fighting spirit

Is Battousai superhuman?

301

He can't be,
but he's sustained

302
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,100
a burn injury

How can any normal human being
survive that kind of onslaught,

and still stand up?

306
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,270
One advantage is
that he's half-dead,

307
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,070
and even in his best condition,
he's not as skilled as Shishio.
