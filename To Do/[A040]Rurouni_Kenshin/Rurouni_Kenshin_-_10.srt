must be fighting.

Han'nya uses his arm
stretching spell so well,

373
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,180
if Battousai
doesn't see through it

374

to compensate,

375
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,120

no chance of surviving.

376

So, it's a spell, huh?

377
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,180
The first step
to defeating him

378
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,040
must be breaking the spell,

379
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,160
then I'll have a chance
to control the outcome.

380
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,290
I wonder why he has
chosen that posture.

381
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,020
I don't get it.

382
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,050
It looks like a posture

383
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,140

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,020
No, Yoshi.

385
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,250
It's shinken technique.

386
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,070
"Shin" is for believing,

387
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,240
and "ken" is for sword.

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,000
This is a truly
classic defense posture

389
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,230
that can usually
handle any change

390
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,080

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,190
Battousai,
the shinken posture.

392
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,260
That's strictly
a defensive move

393
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,180

impossible to switch

394
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,220

The horizontal
stripe on his arm

418
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,030
acts as an optical illusion

wasn't just to defend
against my attack.
