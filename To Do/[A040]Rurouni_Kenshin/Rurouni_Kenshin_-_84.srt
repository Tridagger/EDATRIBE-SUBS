00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,200
Unfortunately,
all the documents

180
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,020
that pertain
to the medicine

181
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,220
were scattered during
the chaos of the war.

182
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,280
Some were even destroyed.

183
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,100
Now even we are unable
to solve the mystery.

184
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,140
That is why
we want to work

185
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,180
with The Black
Knights' organization.

186
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,040
You will enable us
to communicate

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,010
through a global network.

188
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,050
It's not such
a bad deal, either.

189
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,260
You'll come closer
to achieving your goal,

190
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,190
and we'll get
what we want as well.

191
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,150
What do you mean,
achieve our goal?

192
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,130
I don't know what
you're talking about.

193
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,120
Don't play coy
with me, Meldars.

194
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
If you feel that
you can't trust us,

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,100
then it may be a bad idea
in the first place.

196
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,050
In that case,
the deal is off.

197
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,070
Why, you little tramp!

198
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,120
Quiet, Lentz.

199
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,150
Please forgive us.

200
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,000
We don't want
you to leave, miss,

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,260
and we didn't mean
to be offensive.

202
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,290
We understand your
position perfectly,

203
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,260
and from now on, we intend
to be straight with you.

204
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,180
We have been searching
for this miracle medicine

205
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,270
for many years.

206
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,230
When we learned that you
could provide us with it,

207
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,040
we were elated.

208
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,210
Now, we will finally be able
to create our ideal world.

209
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,230
At first we thought it would
take at least ten years,

210
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,010
but our dream will
now become a reality

211
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,290
much sooner than
we had planned.

212
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,050
But I must be assured
of something first.

213
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,080
The medicine has been
in your family for centuries.

214
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,170
It's obviously
very important to you.

215
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,140
So there's a question
that needs to be answered

216
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,050
before we can go any further.

217
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,220
Why would you risk
all that you have

218
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,220
and give the formula
away to strangers?

219
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,020
Why?

220
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,190
I don't have a problem
giving the formula away.

221
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,160
You must want
something in return.

222
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,220
That's right.

223
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
I thought so.

224
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,190
We didn't expect
anything less of you.

225
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,050
What is it that you want?

226
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,270
Control of Japan.

227
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,190
Suwa is the Sea
of Suwa, of course.

228
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,140
You're right!

229
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,070
Hey, how come
I never thought of that?

230
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,220
And tenryu is another
word for Heaven.

231
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,260
That must mean
the Tenryu River.

232

It would be a good assumption
that we would need to go

or pillars as dragon gods.

357
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,050
It's part of their religion.

358
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,100
In this particular case,

359
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,170
the four pillars that
remain at the shrine

360
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,060
could represent
the four dragons

361
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,050
that Dr. Hans wrote about.

362
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,170
Hey, I'm sorry to
burst your bubble,

363
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,130
but they look like a bunch
of oversized logs to me.

364
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,100
What, you come here!

365
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,110
Well, they do.

366
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,170
Yoshi!

367
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,180

368
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,060
Don't mind him, he's a
little sick in the head.

369
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,040
How are we supposed to
solve the rest of the puzzle?

370
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,070
The dragons fly to the moon

371
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,260
and then some god
crosses by in heaven.

372
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,280
That's simple enough.

373
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,240
It's the tale of Omiwatari.

374
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,110
-Ah.
-Grrr.

375
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,220
One dark cold night,

376
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,030
a male god from the upper
shrine, Takimikiaka,

377
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,230
went to visit his lover
like he did every night.

378
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,270
She was a goddess
from the lower shrine.

379
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,010
Her name was Sosaketumi.

380
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,080
The two of them were
very much in love.

381
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,150
But that particular
evening, it was freezing.

382
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,270
It had been
snowing all evening

383
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,220
and the lake
was frozen solid.

384
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,260
The god crossed over on
the way to his sweetheart,

385
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,220
but all of a sudden,
the ice began to crack.

386
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,270
Crack, crack!

387
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,140
(splashing)

388
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,280
He fell into the icy waters.

389
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,080
And that is the
legend of Omiwatari.

390
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,070
It means a god
has crossed the sea.

391
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,120
See?

392
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,100
That makes good sense.

393
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,170
Lake Suwa must
be where all of

394
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,090
the medicine's
been packed away.

395
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,200
But the lake's humungous.

396
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,040
How are we ever
gonna find it?

397
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,020
Let's wait for
Omiwatari to happen again.

398
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,170
Then we can narrow it down.

399
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,050
Hey, yeah!

400
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,280
That's a good idea, Kori

401
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,100
Let's do it!

402
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,280
(grumble)

403
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,240
I--whoa, wait!

404
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,120
Omiwatari happens in winter.

405
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh, yeah?

406

Yutaro, quit moping and have
something to eat with us.

the little twerp feels.

run into a roadblock.

to the drawing board.
