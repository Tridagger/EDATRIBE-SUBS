72

anger out once in a while

I wrote it down.

Especially at times like this
when your parents are away.

will answer our prayers.

get here sooner?

the goal they

for was peace.

164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,070
They did nothing for
you to be ashamed of

165
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,070

nothing dishonorable.
