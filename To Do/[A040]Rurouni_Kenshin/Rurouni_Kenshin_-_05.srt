free taxes and other things.

fault that they lied.

were truly righteous.

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,170
Let's see you stop a bullet
from this close range.

368
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,220
Hiten Mitsurugi style,
the Dragon Dodge!

369
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,240
(sonorous explosion)

370
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,080
(screaming)

371
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,030
Sanosuke Sagara.

372
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,030
I had no idea you were

373
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,080
the survivor
of the Sekiho Force.

374
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,230
Let's have one last round.

375
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,060
What do you say,
Mr. Legendary Swordsman?

376
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,070
Why don't you just give up?

377
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,230
Can't you leave
the past behind you

378
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,060
and quit blaming Kenshin?

379
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,180
You think Kenshin's
responsible for that decision?

380
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,230
He had nothing to do with
what you were talking about.

381
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,100
You people think the royalists
of the restoration were saints?

382
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,060
You have no idea
what they did to people.

383
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,150
They used us like chess pieces

384
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,250
on a game board.

385
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,170
I guess we were
human sacrifices.

386
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,220
What's he talking about?

387
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,130
I'm afraid he's right.

388
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,110
(together)
Huh?

389
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,290
The Sekiho Force was
used to recruit people

390
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,250
for the Imperial Army
who gunned them down.

391
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,030
So, I understand why
Sanosuke wants revenge

392
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,220
against the royalists.

393
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,070
But tell me one thing.

394
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,260
Don't say it.

395
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,080
Captain Sagara trusted
the restoration.

396
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,140
He was a good man.

397
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,110
They never told him

398
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,240
to betray the others
or lie to anyone.

399
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,020
Never.

400
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,010
For that I will never trust
you or any other royalist.

401
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,120
I understand.

402
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,230
Let's have our final match.

403
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,250
He knows what
Kenshin's gonna do!

404
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,220

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
I have been training,

408
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,010
and now I will destroy

409
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,130
the best fighter
of the royalists.

410
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,090
Battousai!

411
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm afraid your
revenge towards me

412
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,090
will work against you.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,270
What did you learn
from the Sekiho Force?

438
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,290
That the restoration
was worth fighting for?

439
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,190
Or how to hold a grudge
for the rest of your life?

440
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,160
Shut up!

441
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,290
You and the rest
of the royalists

442
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,220
are phony liars who
deceived the people

443
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,070
and crushed anyone you felt like

444
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,010
in the name of
the restoration.

445
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,000
Just a second!

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,100
If there are any royalists
that lie and cheat people,

447
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm sure there
aren't many of them.

448
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,180
And I can guarantee that
Kenshin is not one of them.

449
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,110
Can you get that
through your head?

450
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,280
So, don't you dare
compare Kenshin

451
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,250
with a few bad
apples in government.

452
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,230
He just turned down

453
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,020
a high ranking position
in the Imperial Army,

454
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,250
and now he's using
his sword to protect people.

455
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,140
That's right.

456
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,280
You got Kenshin all wrong.

457
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,220
You've heard too many fables
about Battousai, the legend.

458
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,040
And if you can't
get it straight,

459
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm gonna have
to fight you myself

460
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,170
and teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

461
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,180
Sanosuke, the restoration

462
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,020
is not over yet.

463
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,030
Huh?

464
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,090
Old habits die hard.

465
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,040
Unfortunately, there
are still many people

466
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,160
who are still being oppressed.

467
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,280
The people are the ones who
must carry out the changes

468
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,070
and make sure there's
peace throughout the land.

469
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,270
That is why I choose
to live my life as a wanderer.

470
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,170
Whenever possible, I uphold
the principles of the new era

471
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,210
and use my sword
to protect people.

472
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,040
Battousai the Slasher's
protecting people?

473
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,130
It's my way of giving something
back to those who have suffered.

474
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,160
It's not a bad life.

475
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,699
You might wanna think
about doing the same.

476
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:41,657
Come on, you guys.

477
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,160
Let's go get Dr. Gensai.

478
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,130
He reminds me of Captain Sagara

479
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,120
who fought for what
he believed in,

480
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,000
his faith that there
will be peace someday.

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,030
And Kenshin continues
to fight for the new era

482
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,170
by standing up
against oppression.

483
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,120
I, on the other hand,
had given up.

484
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,240
I became bitter,

485
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,070
and the only thing
I wanted was revenge.

486
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,150
I totally lost sight
of what I was fighting for.

487
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,200
Oh, Captain Sagara,

488
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
how did I get
so far off track?

489
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240

You sure gave Sanosuke
one heck of a beating.

497

I'm sure it's
going to take a while

498
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
for him to heal from all
those cuts and bruises.

499
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,290
Dr. Gensai said
it was a miracle

500
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,270
that Sanosuke didn't die.

501
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,060
I tried not
to hurt him too bad,

502
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,070
but he's a good fighter

503
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,250
so I had to give
him my best stuff,

504
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,110
and then he kept
asking for more.

505
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,090
I couldn't believe it.

506
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,240
He wouldn't quit.

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,090
Well, I'm glad this
thing is finally over.

508
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,010

I have never seen anybody
talk so much about being tough

516
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,260
and then trying
to pick a fight

517
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,100

how to defend themselves.

518

All right, that's enough.

Why don't you take
the Sekiho Force symbol

531

off the back of your coat?

532
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,080
Because they will
always be a part of me.

They're much easier
to say than do,

Besides, you were right.

540

Our work isn't finished,

542
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,190
would want me to do
the same as you.

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,220
Huh?

544
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,130
So, if it's all right with you,
I'd like to hang around

545
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,170

I'm a new man.

547
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,060
Thanks to you, my friend.

548
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,120
I don't look it,

549
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,110
but I feel better
than I have in years.

This way you won't be wanderin'
around by yourself anymore.

I'm hopin' you'll show me
some of those cool moves.

553
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,180
Oh, well.

554

It looks like
we can add one more nut

555
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,280
to this crazy group.

556
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,090
What do you mean
by one more nut?

557
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,020
Watch who you're calling
a nut around here, wise guy.

Sanosuke, oh, I hope
he comes back soon.

things a lot easier

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,090
now that he's fighting with us

562
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,020
instead of against us.

563
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
