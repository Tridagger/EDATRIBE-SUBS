00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:52,103
♪

3
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:56,043
Mr. Shishio, we've received word
that Saito, Kenshin Himura,

4
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,253
and Sanosuke Sagara are
on their way here now.

5
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,093
Good, summon the Juppongatana.

6
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,063
Finally.

7
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:04,163
We should've dealt
with those troublemakers

8
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:05,213
a long time ago.

9
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,033
Pardon me, sir, I'd like
to suggest a strategy

10
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,123
which would ensure
our total victory.

11
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:12,073
Strategy.

12
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,253
Of course, why not?

13
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,303
Exactly what is this
strategy you'd like to suggest?

14
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,063
Tell us, Hoji.

15
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,283
What I have in mind
is not just getting rid

16
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:24,173
of those three men,

17
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,053
but an absolute complete
and total victory.

18
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,163
Sounds interesting so far.

19
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:31,053
-Go on.
-Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,273
In the upcoming battle,
those three men

21
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,273
will have to fight
our entire group.

22
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,153
Ten opponents in all!

23
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,293
So the odds are
greatly in our favor.

24
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,293
I would say that's
putting it mildly.

25
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,073
What are you getting at,
Hoji, what is your point?

26
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,113
My point is that no
matter how much the odds

27
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,143
are in our favor,

28
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:49,103
we must eliminate even the
slightest chance of defeat

29
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:53,043
by demoralizing our enemies
before the battle begins!

30
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,153
I suggest we keep only
the three strongest fighters

31
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:56,313
of the Juppongatana here

32
00:02:56,313 --> 00:03:00,113
while the rest of the
group obliterates Aoiya.

33
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,263
The only ones left alive

34
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,223
will be the ones we
choose as messengers

35
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:05,243
to bring the news to
Himura and the others

36
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:07,103
that their friends
and supporters

37
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,053
have been destroyed.

38
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,163
Good idea.

39
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:11,283
This strategy would also serve

40
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,103
to get rid of the
troublesome Oni gang members

41
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:16,083
and those who are loyal to them.

42
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,083
For years, they supported
Himura in any way they could,

43
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,183
such as spying on a group and
giving him vital information.

44
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:25,213
It was a mistake not to have
taken care of them sooner.

45
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,123
That's right, but a
sneak attack's not right!

46
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,293
Only one thing matters now,

47
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,303
and that's for Mr. Shishio

48
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,243
to gain control of
the entire country

49
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:35,103
and nothing less will do.

50
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,323
When you're playing
for stakes this high,

51
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:38,103
there's no right or wrong.

52
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,203
We have to make the best
of this opportunity!

53
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,263
Results are all that matter,

54
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,123
and if a sneak attack on Aoiya

55
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,243
will increase our
chance of winning,

56
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,053
that's what we should do!

57
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,083
I see.

58
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,043
Just one question.

59
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,123
How can I trust anyone

60
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,083
who suggests a strategy
so dishonorable?

61
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,233
Huh?

62
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,183
I told Himura that I was
challenging him to a duel,

63
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,263
an honorable battle
between two worthy opponents,

64
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:02,173
and I will not break my word!

65
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:04,243
And it will be a
fight to the death!

66
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,233
Those are the
conditions we agreed upon,

67
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,063
and being a man of my word,

68
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,123
that's how it's going to be!

69
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:11,313
Understood?

70
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,213
The three men who
are on their way here

71
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,223
are three of the finest
fighters Japan has ever seen.

72
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,093
So even against ten to one odds,

73
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,263
they're bound to kill
a few of our men.

74
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,183
Now that the Rengoku
has been destroyed,

75
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:24,053
the only asset we
have is Juppongatana.

76
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,263
So we must do
everything in our power

77
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,103
to protect it.

78
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,253
I swore an oath that I
would do anything I could

79
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,243
to lead you to your
goal of total victory!

80
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,163
To help you become
the most powerful leader

81
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:37,173
since Ieyasu Tokugawa.

82
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,193
We can no longer worry
about what is right!

83
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:41,253
Victory is the only thing
that matters right now!

84
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,083
Failure is unthinkable!

85
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,313
The stakes are too high.

86
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,203
You know I'm right!

87
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,143
We have to do whatever's
necessary to gain control!

88
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,213
You understand?

89
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,033
By foul means or fair,

90
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,113
any act is justified
as long as we win!

91
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:56,193
You may hate me for saying it,

92
00:04:56,193 --> 00:05:01,053
but that's the way
it has to be, sir.

93
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,243
You've convinced me that
you want me to win, Hoji,

94
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,073
I appreciate that.

95
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,053
Sojiro, summon the Juppongatana!

96
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,103
Yes, sir.

97
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,233
I want the entire group
assembled in ten minutes!

98
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,283
The three swordsmen
are on their way

99
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,103
and will be here shortly,

100
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,293
but before the duel begins,

101
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:21,293
I want to explain what
happened to the Rengoku.

102
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,133
We were wondering about
that and another thing.

103
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,203
We were supposed
to set fire to Edo,

104
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,313
but they were ready,
and we weren't able

105
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:29,133
to carry out the job.

106
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,253
Yes!

107
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,253
You know it was almost like
they knew what our plan was!

108
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,273
Why is that?

109
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,203
Unavoidable, I'm afraid.

110
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,183
Edo is going to be
burned the same way

111
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:41,293
the Tokugawans burned
Yeido over 250 years ago

112
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,133
with the guns of the Rengoku
causing most of the destruction.

113
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,213
Unfortunately the plan
failed due to the negligence

114
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:51,083
of one of my top advisors!

Oh, great!

I thought we were gonna have
to waste a whole lot of time

123
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,033
figuring out who set us up!

124
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,313
But now we don't have to
worry about it anymore!

We can just kill Hoji!

126

But was it him alone,

127
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:16,283
or was he following
someone's orders?

128

Hmm.

All right, Hoji, you

Together we'll

163
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,193
Sir.

164
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:59,063
This is it, we're here.

165
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:03,183
This is the Rukutsurane
shrine, Shishio's hideout.

166

Let's show Shishio and his
gang they're not so tough.

Welcome, Yumi
Komagata is my name.

170

Mr. Shishio asked
me to greet you

171
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,053
and to take you to him.

172
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:26,303

know the way through,

174
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:30,253
so I will be your guide.

175
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,043
Probably sent a woman so
we'd let our guard down.

176
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,313
Does he really think
that we're that stupid?

177
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,033
Not quite, he only thinks
that you're that stupid,

178
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,243
and he's absolutely right.

179
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,313
Stick to fighting, Sano.

180
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,273
We'll do the

181
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,173
Follow me, please.

182
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,223
Whoa, this isn't just a maze,

183
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,293
it's a huge
underground labyrinth!

184
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:54,213
One wrong turn and you'd
never find your way out!

185
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,143
I've got to admit,
Shishio certainly does know

186
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,093
how to protect himself.

187
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,093
(water tinkling)

188
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,163
Allow me to explain the rules.

189
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,193
Each of you will fight

190
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:09,313
one member of the
Juppongatana in single combat.

191
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:12,243
While that duel is going on,
the other two may watch,

192
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,233
but are not allowed
to interfere.

193
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,163
Do you accept these conditions?

194
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,143
Yeah, we accept.

195
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,113
Whatever you say, lady.

196
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:19,303
Now, come on, can
we get on with it?

197
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,263
I'd just as soon beat
all of them at once,

198
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,243
but if Shishio
prefers it this way,

199
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,173
I'll go along with it.

200
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,173
Battousai, you agree?

201
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,143
I agree, but there's
one more condition

202
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,323
that I will have to insist on.

203
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:32,223
That these duels
are not to the death.

204
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,133
When one fighter is
clearly the winner,

205
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,293
the other is allowed to concede.

206
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,143
I'll meet any
opponent in combat,

207
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,303
but I won't stand
for any killing.

208
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,073
Is that understood?

209
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,093
Yes, of course!

210
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,263
I understand.

211
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:47,203
Shishio, I don't mean to meddle,

212
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:51,053
but isn't it somewhat dangerous
allowing Sanosuke Sagara

213
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,243
to fight against Anji?

214
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,093
Anji was his teacher!

215
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,113
He taught him the
extreme fist technique,

216
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,103
and you know how
strong the bond can be

217
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,293
between teacher and student.

218
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,153
Anji may feel sympathy
for his former pupil,

219
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,193
and he won't be
able to kill him.

220
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,223
Anji may be called
"The Depraved Monk,"

221
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,073
but he's a monk nonetheless
and has more compassion

222
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,153
than the rest of the
Juppongatana put together!

223
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,313

surpasses his compassion!

Together we'd be unstoppable.

Mind your own business!

359
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,193
Sano, focus!

360
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:58,203
What'd you say?

361
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,233
Even with an attention
span as short as yours,

362
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,163
you can come up with a way
to win if you just think!

363
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,093
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Kenshin.

364
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,033
Listen, a guy who
fights with one sword

365
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,213
has just as good
a chance of winning

366
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,283
as a guy who fights with two

367
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:13,283
as long as he knows
exactly how to use it!

368
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,273
I told you what the rules were.

369
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,223
No interference, remember?

370
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,213
You are forbidden
to help him fight.

371
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,233
I know, that's why
I put it into words.

372
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,293
You never said I
couldn't talk to him.

373
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,113
I know I can beat
you, Anji, yup.

374
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,033
If you think that,
you're a fool.

375
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,053
You don't have a chance, Sano.

376
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,073
Is that so?

377
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,153
We'll see!

378
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,273
(grunting)

379
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,113
Just as I thought.

380
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,093
He's trained so hard,
he's become muscle-bound.

381
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,153
His muscles have lost
some of their flexibility.

382
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,033
His fists are still
incredibly fast,

383
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:51,103
but the rest of his body can't
keep up with his hand speed.

384
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:53,083
He'll have to beat him
with a single blow.

385
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,323
It's the only way.

386
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:58,273
One hand is all I need!

387
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:00,263
(grunting)

388
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,213
See ya later!

389
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:05,283
Got him!

390
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,173
It can't be!

391
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:12,073
Amazing, Anji used
the reverse force

392
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,163
of a blow to his own body

393
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:16,073
to absorb the power
of Sano's punch.

394
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,133
As I told you before,

395
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,063
you've perfected nothing!

396
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,143
That was a close one.

397
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:30,083
I was lucky to avoid the
full force of his strike.

398
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,233
Sano!

399
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,083
Even though he
barely touched me,

400
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,163
the impact caused
a lot of damage.

401
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:37,033
His strength is incredible.

402
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,253
Sano.

403
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,053
I don't want to kill you.

404
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,243
Surrender, and
I'll let you live.

405
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,323
Let him live?

406
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:45,153
He can't mean that!

407
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:48,083
Of course he meant it, and
if Sano has any brains at all,

408
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,223
he'd know he has no choice
but to accept the offer,

409
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:54,043
but of course he
won't, the fool.

410
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,093
Anji, what do you
think you're doing?

411
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,093
Shishio gave
everyone instructions

412
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,273
to kill whoever they fought!

413
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:01,313
No, Shishio agreed
that it's up to me

414
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,213
to decide which of my
opponents live or die.

415
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,253
So that's it!

416
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:08,063
Now I understand!

417
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,153
Having the power to choose
who lives and who dies--

418
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,183
that's what it's all
about, isn't it, Anji?

419
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,053
That's what you're hooked on!

420
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,323
And Shishio's the one
who gave you that power,

421
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,223
so naturally you
worship him like a god!

422
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,293
How sad that you gave
up what you believed in

423
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,153
to worship a maniac.

424
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,113
You're wrong.

425
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,143
It's not like that at all.

426
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,293
I told Shishio at the very first

427
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,233
that I would join the
Juppongatana on one condition.

428
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,233
That I would decide which of
my opponents would live or die.

429
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,083
I joined him because he knows

430
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,313
the government
must be destroyed.

431
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,113
Shishio will create
a new government,

432
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:41,203
and if Shishio proves
unworthy, I'll destroy him, too.

433
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,273
(gasping)

434
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:46,043
So, the destruction doesn't
end until you're satisfied!

435
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,113
Is that it?

436
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,103
What if you're
never satisfied, Anji?

437
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,083
What then?

438
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,273
Do you just keep on
destroying everything

439
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,073
for the rest of your life,

440
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:54,233
tearing down what
the rest of society

441
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,193
has spent years trying to build?

442
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:58,273
You think that you know what
the real world is all about,

443
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,113
but you don't have a clue!

444
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,213
The real world is
made up of people!

445
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,143
People who care
about each other,

446
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,263
who work hard because
they believe in the future,

447
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:09,093
and believe that the future
is worth fighting for!

448
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,143
Believe me, Anji,

449
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,243
I don't like the Meiji
government any more than you do,

450
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:15,113
but I'll be damned if I'm
gonna let you or Shishio

451
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,103
or the Juppongatana
decide what's best

452
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,093
for the people of Japan!

453
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,283
I'm gonna win!

454
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,123
No problem!

455
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,183
If he really believes that,

456
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,193
I'd say he's a bit out
of touch with reality.

457

What do you think?

458

I remember the very first
time I ever fought Sano.

459
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,183
He used exactly the same words.

460
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,323
"I'm gonna win," he told me.

461
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,263
I hope he means it this time.

462
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,033
(yelling)

463
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:48,033
Seems to me that
Sano doesn't realize

464
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,233
that Anji can't be defeated
by a multi-strike attack.

465
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:55,223
One blow correctly
placed would finish him.

466
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:57,263
It's clear that Anji is
defending his left side,

467
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,073
so that Sano can't strike
with his right hand.
