our first student,
Yoshi Myojin.

8

Well then, this is our
third day of practice,

9
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,230
so let's start
with deep breathing,

10
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,280
as usual.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,050

I'm sick of the Kasshin style
and all this breathing stuff,

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,040
I want to know how to
really beat up an opponent,

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,210
not all this boring junk!

22
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,000
That's the wrong
way of thinking!

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,220
The Kasshin style
is to protect people,

24
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,080
it takes discipline!

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,090
Protect people?

Kenshin, I came here
because I want to learn

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,120
to be good with swords,
not to protect other people!

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,030
I really want to learn how
to beat an opponent from you!

Besides, Yoshi,
Ms. Kori is your teacher,

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,010
not me.

Wait, hey!

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,170
Ugh!

00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,260

Kenshin, what a great cook!

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,220
Outrageous!

43
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Really!

44
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,020
He's the one who told me
to be good at swords!

45
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,080
He's the one
that forced me

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,020

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,160
Because the rice balls
that Kenshin made

51

You're just like me,

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,210
I feel like I have
a bratty little brother

...renegade bandit!

78
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,050

I still don't know

Kenshin walked out
on his life

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,150
as a legendary samurai,
and to this day,

89
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,160
it still remains
a mystery why he left.

90
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,090
There were many rumors.

91
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,240
Some say that
he killed someone

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,030
he shouldn't have.

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,000
Or that he knew too much.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,150
Others say
the Meiji government

95
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,080
is still after him.

Why don't you ask him
about his life?

109
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,010
I'm too concerned not to know!

110
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,240
I just can't stand it,

I know it's not
a good thing to snoop

113
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,040
into the past of other people,

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,260

115
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,140
(hooves clomping)

116
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,210
(clears throat)

117
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,140
Maybe I,
maybe I shouldn't

118
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,120
really be asking you this,
but I'm very curious.

119
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,230
So, would you mind telling me--

120
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,150
Kori, what is it?

121
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,210
Ah!

122
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,250
Where is Kenshin?

123
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,000
He just went out to get tofu.

We're going to have
a feast tonight.

125
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,180

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,010

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,120
Hello, who are you?

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,130
Huh?

130
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,010
I need to talk to
the representative

131
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,160
of this dojo.

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,130
Why don't you tell me what
this is all about first?

133
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,130
You there!

134
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,020
I am the owner
and swordmaster,

135
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,110
Kori Kamiya.

136
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,250
What is it exactly
that you want from us?

137
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,170
Lady, we're the police!

138
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,150
Gee, really?

139
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,070
I almost couldn't tell
by those uniforms

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,210
that you're wearing.

141
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,250
Sir!

142
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,270
I know Kenshin Himura,
known as Battousai

143
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,180
is here.

144
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,240
Huh?

145
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,130
Battousai the killer?

146
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,160
Are they talking about Kenshin?

147
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,250
Huh?

148
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,000
Many people who are
impersonating Battousai

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,020
have confessed
the real one

150
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,010
is in this dojo,
and may I say

151
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,030
that if you don't
tell us the honest truth,

152
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,050
you will be prosecuted
for resisting the government.

153
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,100
Kenshin?

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,080
Just what do you mean?

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,220
What did Kenshin do?

156
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,070
That's classified top-secret
and the only one who knows

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,210
is waiting for him out front.

158
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,160
Huh?

159
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,010
I need to search your house.

160
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,200
Wait!

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Battousai's helper,
do you want

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,140
the death penalty?

163
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,050
Huh?

164
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,090
Oof!

165
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,050
Yoshi, tell Kenshin
that if he comes back here

166
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,080
he'll be caught!

167
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,140
Right, okay!

168
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,120
-Hurry!
-You got it!

169
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,210
-Get him!
-Come back!

170
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
Oh, Kenshin.

171
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,250
(horse neighing)

172
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,210
I'm very close now.

173
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,010
I finally found him,
and this time,

174
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,080
Battousai is mine.

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,030
(marching)

176
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,210
Come on, hurry up!

177
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,150
Yeah, hurry!

178
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,090
If I run, I might
spill the tofu,

179
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,250
you silly kids!

180
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,000
Lookit, that
guy's got a sword!

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Huh?

182
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,170
Oh...

183
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,000
You seem to be pretty brave
totally ignoring the decree

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,210
abolishing the wearing
of swords in daylight!

185
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,000
And right in front
of the police, too.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,230
Why don't we have
a little fight?

187
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,030
I'll tell you what,
I'll let you go if you win!

188

a reversed edge.

191
