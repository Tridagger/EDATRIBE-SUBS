foreign involvement

200

204

When I first looked into
Lady Magdalia's eyes,

370

I saw a place of
serenity of love.

371
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,220
She has compassion
for all God's people.

372
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,260
It took three months
of her tender care

373

before I could
walk again.

374
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,160
I never had anyone show me
so much love and respect.

375
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
They rescued me
from certain death,

376

is too optimistic.

He actually believes
we can overthrow

383
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,110
an entire government without
foreign weapons and men?

384
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,280
Granted his

up this operation

390
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,280

391
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,250
Now listen carefully.

392
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,230
Shogo Amakusa,
this child of God

393
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,220
has a charisma no
one else on Earth has.

394

He's almost God-like.

395

But to tell you
the truth Santo,

396
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,210
I've always found
that I gravitate

397
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,020
more to the dark side.

398
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm attracted to
evil more than God.

Santo, you look as
though you're surprised.

400
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,020
When I met
Shogo a year ago,

401
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,130
I sensed this feeling
of destiny around him.

402
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,070
I knew I'd
found the way.

403

for my plan to come true.

the lightning rod

power to rule Japan.

The people see this rod

407
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,000
and they clamber
around Shogo like ants,

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,150
ants that will do
whatever it takes

409
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,050

foreign friend's help
