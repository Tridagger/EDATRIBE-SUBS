This isn't a joke!

363
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,190
I worked two jobs for
five years to buy that ring,

364
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,110
and she was really looking
forward to me giving it to her!

365
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,120
Not only did I throw away
the ring, I mistrusted her.

366
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you going to do?

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
I don't know.

368
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,120
I've looked all
over the river for it.

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,220
I wasn't able to find
the ring anywhere!

370
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,020
I feel so bad that I thought
if I would just end my life,

371
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,040
maybe she'd forgive me.

372
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,020
She'll find somebody else.

373
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,060
(grunting)

374
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,220
Stop that!

375
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,060
Tell me something,
that engagement ring

376
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
that you threw in the river,

377
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,230
does it have a blue stone in it?

378
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,250
Yes, it does!

379
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,140
Her birthstone
is a blue sapphire.

380
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,120
That's why I had
it made like that!

381
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,020
Hey, why are you
asking me that?

382
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,090
Oh, there's no reason, really.

383
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,050
Now listen!

384
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,270
I want you to wait here,
do you understand?

385
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,170
I might be able to help
you with your problem,

386
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,030
but if you kill yourself,
you'll break your girl's heart!

387
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,190
All right, I'll stay!

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,110
Kenshin, we've
got a big problem!

390
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,060
So, you're saying that
the ring Kenshin found

391
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,090
in the catfish the other day

392
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,270
actually belongs to this guy?

393
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,050
Yes, that's right.

394
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,270
Then I'll have to
explain this to Kaoru

395
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,010
and get the ring back
from her right away!

396
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,070
Hold on, compadre, it's
not gonna be that easy.

397
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,050
Why not?

398
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,260
Kaoru will never
give back that ring!

399
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,090
I don't think Kenshin knew
what he was getting into before,

400
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,050
but Wadi can explain.

401
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,010
Tell them what the
ring really means.

402
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,020
Let's get this straight.

403
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,100
A boy gives a girl a ring,

404
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,110
and that means that
he wants to get married?

405
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, that's right!

406
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,250
So, what you're saying is

407
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,130
that when Kenshin
gave Kaoru that ring,

408
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,060
he was really asking
her to marry him!

409
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,020
That is correct.

410
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,080
But that's just not fair!

411
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,050
Kenshin doesn't know about all
of those western traditions!

412
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,030
The worst part about all this
is it happened on Tanabata!

413
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,260
I thought that I was
only giving her the ring

414
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,150
as a gift for her birthday!

415
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,050
The whole situation
is entirely my fault.

416
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,080
I just wanted
Kaoru to be happy!

417
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,050
Kaoru's birthday is actually
in the month of June.

418
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,110
I see, that's why Kaoru's
been so happy lately!

419
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,050
So I guess she thinks she and
Kenshin are getting hitched!

420
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,130
The major problem here is

421
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,200
how are we ever gonna get
that darn engagement ring

422
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,220
back to its rightful owner

423
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,020
without hurting
Kaoru's feelings?

424
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,200
Right, Kenshin?

425
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,070
He's fainted!

426
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,100
We gotta do something!

427
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,120
That's for sure.

428

in the catfish?

542
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,010
Huh, Kenshin?

543
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm sorry, Kaoru, I'm gonna
tell you the whole truth.

544
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,120
What?!

545
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,270
That's the whole story.

546
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Sorry, Kaoru.

547
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,230
We need to get him back his
ring before he hurts himself.

548
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,020
Kaoru, just give him
back the ring already!

549
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,270
If the guy kills himself,
we'll be partially responsible.

550
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,220
None of us wants that, do we?

551
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,020
I'm really very sorry.

552
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,060
Sano, Yoshi!

553
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,170
Let's do it.

554
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,230
All right, all right,
stretch your finger out.

555
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,150
(groaning)

556
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,150
(indistinct talking)

557
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,090
All right, all right,
somebody get some pliers!

558
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,220
-There you go.
-How 'bout some oil?

559
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,030
No, I got it, how
'bout some lard?

560
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,170
None of this stuff is working.

561
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,290
Why won't that thing come off?

562
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,110
The only way we're
gonna get this off

563
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,200
is to saw it off.

564
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,040
Maybe Kaoru's fingers are thick

565
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,230
from all of her
physical training.

566
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,240
Perhaps that's the reason

567
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,000
that we can't get
the ring off of there.

568
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm sorry!

569
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,240
(sobbing)

570
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,090
I don't want
your stupid ring!

571
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,210
I'm sorry!

572
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,010
You're thoughtless!

573
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,010
(yelling)

574
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Hey, Kenshin's jaw
knocked it loose!

575
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,030
Yeah, now that
was a lucky punch!

576
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,270
I can't thank you enough.

577
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,280
Shiori and I are now engaged.

578
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,100
Thank you, Hikojiro.

579
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,280
It's beautiful.

580
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,260
Congratulations and
don't ever do that again!

581
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,240
For all our sakes.

582
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,000
Well, they're happy,
but Kaoru sure isn't.

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,170
When your heart's been broken,

584
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,100
there's nothing
to do but eat

585
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,050
and eat and eat

586
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,270

Man, Kaoru's really gonna be
impossible to live with now.

I'm responsible
for this mess.

589

I brought you
a peace offering.

590
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,120
Here, give this to Kaoru,
and she'll feel better.

591
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,100

Huh?

It's not a ring,

596
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,000
but I hope you'll
accept my sincere apology.

597
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,060
You're right, it's not a ring,

598

I'll ever forgive you!

Don't be too hard on
him, it was all my fault.

Don't try and fix
it for them, Wadi,

601
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,110
they'll iron it
out for themselves.
