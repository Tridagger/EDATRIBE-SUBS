SHIZUKA: My dear, Zero.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,366
I hope you grow up quickly
by feeding off your hatred.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,866
You do want to
kill me, don't you?

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,333
I hope to always
keep you in my sight.

6
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:26,800
Your eyes-- so filled with
hate-- are mine and mine alone.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,266
You see, Zero, you and
I are now bound together

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,566
by an unbreakable bond.

00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,300
KANAME: That woman.

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,300
Seems she's still alive.

GIRL: Yeah?

15
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:26,678
Well, Aido is my choice.

16
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,678
GIRL: If I could dance with
Aido, I'd be in Heaven.

17
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,739
GIRL: Don't you think
Takuma would be nice, too?

18
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:35,058
He seems like he
would lead so gently.

19
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,141
YUKI: Zero hunts vampires.

20
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:45,100
YUKI: He said that he could
never forgive himself.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,260
So how did Zero feel when
he pulled the trigger?

22
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,060
-Hey.

23
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:54,960
Snap out of it, will ya?

24
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:55,793
-Sorry.

-Everyone get back!

27
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,227
Is it me, or are they more
excitable than usual today?

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,693
-It's that stupid event
that's got them like this.

29
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,193
When that gate opens,
make sure you're ready.

30
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,160
YUKI: Huh?

00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:13,993

32
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,960

00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,493
Please!

34
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't push!

35
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:20,527
-Just a little closer.

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,527
ZERO: One more step,
and I'll make you cry.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,093
Got it?

38
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,560
[screaming]

39
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:28,060
-Don't worry about him.

40
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,560
Just go for it!

41
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,293
-Yeah, Zero isn't
as scary nowadays.

42
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,293
-She's right, it's true.

43
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:32,793
-Hey!

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,460

-Huh?

48
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:53,227

50
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,960

00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,393
-(LAUGHING) They're
really jealous of you.

53
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:03,893
It's so-- cute.

00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,527
-Um, would you let
go of me, please?

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,393
I need to get back.

56
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:10,460
-That's how you
show your gratitude?

57
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,727
After I came to rescue just now?

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,860
KANAME: You're bothering
the disciplinary committee,

59
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:15,293
Hanabusa.

60
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,493
-Yuki, don't take
these duties of yours

61
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,860
so seriously that you only
end up getting yourself hurt.

62
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:29,393
-OK, sure.

63
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:30,727
I'll be more careful.

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,393
ZERO: Don't let
yourself be carried out.

65
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,393
Come on.

66
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:33,893
-Hey!

67
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,893
Zero!

-It's awfully noisy today.

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,627
-Well, you know the
ball is coming up soon.

[groaning]

73
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,527
-I, myself, cannot
wait for the ball.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,260
-Sounds exhausting.

[horses running]

76
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,127
KAIEN: Yuki, are
you upset that I

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,327
let Zero go on that
assignment the other day?

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,893
Zero was born a hunter, Yuki,
which means sooner or later,

79
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,593
a job was bound to come to him.

80
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,093
-You're saying
that it's his duty?

81
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,627
-In order for Zero to
live as a human, yes.

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,093
Regardless, I have a request.

83
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,460
We have a transfer student.

84
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:47,293
I'd like you to show her around.

85
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,493
-A transfer student?

86
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,560
-Yes.

87
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,293
She was scheduled to
start much earlier,

88
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:54,593
but she has a weak
constitution, so she's

89
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:56,427
been recuperating at
her villa somewhere

90
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,527
deep in the mountains.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,293
[knocking]

92
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,660
KAIEN: Oh, well, I
guess she's here now.

93
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,827
Come in.

94
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,127
-Um, good evening.

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,927
YUKI: Huh?

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,593
She's a night class student?

97
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:12,027
-Please meet Maria Kurenai.

98
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,093
Good evening, Maria.

99
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,493
I would like you to
meet my daughter, Yuki.

100
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,560
YUKI: Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:23,560
-She looks so tasty
and so healthy.

102
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:24,427
-You listen here!

103
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,260
That's taboo at this Academy!

104
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,527
-Aw.

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:32,427
Nice to meet you, Yuki.

107
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,927
-Uh.

108
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,827
-So the library is this way.

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,460
And just up there is
the room the night

110
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,860
class will be using today.

111
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:50,193
Do you want to take a look?

112
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,293
What's wrong?

113
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:56,493
-You see, Yuki, transferring to
this Academy scares me a bit.

114
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,260
I know that's hard
to believe, but I'm

115
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,860
afraid the other
vampires aren't going

116
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:04,460
to accept someone
as frail as I am.

117
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:05,293
See!

118
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,893
I knew you wouldn't believe me!

119
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,560
-No.

120
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,560
I was just surprised.

121
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,427
Listen, I really
don't think there's

122
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,227
anything to worry about.

123
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,293
Both the Dorm President and
Vice President are really nice.

124
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:20,727
And also-- you've got me, and
the Headmaster on your side

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
as well.

126
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:23,560
We'll be glad to help.

127
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,293
So you see, Maria,
you're gonna be fine!

128
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:32,193
-Thank you, Yuki.

129
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,293
-Yuki.

130
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:43,927
I really do love being
with girls like you.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,560
HANABUSA: A late arrival?

132
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,860
A transfer student.

133
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,227
It's quite mysterious.

134
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,760
Something's
definitely wrong here.

135
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,127
-Is this about that book
you were reading yesterday?

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,293
-No, what he's saying is true.

137
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,860
We've got a new student.

138
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,160
-Hey!

139
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:03,760
Those are my Choco Biscuits!

140
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,860
I was going to share
them with Lord Kaname!

141
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:11,993
(SIGHING) Jeez, today really
isn't going well at all.

142
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,960
[giggling]

143
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:18,827
MARIA: This class
looks like fun.

144
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,293
Say, shouldn't have this
class started already?

145
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:26,027
-Who the hell are you?

146
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,827
-The hell?

147
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,927
-Excuse me, boy.

148
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,727
You think you-- can
talk that way to me?

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,360
[gasping]

150
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,260
-I believe it's the
new student's duty

151
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,460
to introduce one's
self to the class.

152
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,793
Right, Marie Kurenai?

153
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:51,293
-Oh.

154
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,193
-If I've upset you,
please forgive me.

155
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,627
I'm sorry, Lord Kaname.

156
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:06,093
-I can't believe I finally
get to meet a Purebred.

157
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,960
This makes me so happy!

158
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,860
[gasping]

159
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,993
-A pleasure to meet you.

160
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,427
-Oh.

161
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,627
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,593
I think I've made everyone
a little uncomfortable.

163
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:25,927
(GIGGLING) Perhaps it's best
if I come back another time.

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,693
[door slamming]

165
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,593
-What's with her?

166
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:32,227
-Just relax, will ya?

167
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,727
Frowning like that will
only give you wrinkles.

168
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,360
-You know what, mind
your own business!

169
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,693
[foot steps]

170
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,293
-Hey-- Hanabusa.

171
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:46,260
[door slamming]

172
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:51,560
-Zero.

173
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,160
-Stop standing around!

174
00:09:58,193 --> 00:09:59,527
You're still on duty!

175
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,793
-Hey, what is your--

176
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:04,393
YUKI: By the way, the Headmaster
gave me some good news.

177
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,027
Remember that girl
you saved yesterday?

178
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,127
Well, they were able to erase
the whole event from memory,

179
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,860
and she's doing just fine now.

180
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,160
Isn't that a huge relief?

181
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,827
-Not really.

182
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,793
I didn't agree to go out
and hunt down that Level

183
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,260
E just so that I could
save somebody else.

184
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:23,027
What I wanted had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

185
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,327
It was just work.

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,527
-A duty of a hunter.

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,793
-Well, if that's the
way you feel, Zero,

188
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,727
than I guess that's how it is.

189
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,527
But it seems to me you're only
interested in doing whatever it

190
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,927
is you want to do. .

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,593
I mean, that's how you
act toward your studies.

192
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:42,960
And that's why you went to do
that job by yourself, isn't it?

193
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:45,893
Hunting a vampire is
a pretty big deal.

194
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,427
So when you suddenly
leave campus

195
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,260
to do something like that
without telling anyone,

196
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,493
who do you think
worries the most?

197
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,960
For a second there, I
thought you'd run away.

198
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,160
It's just that--
I'm afraid someday

199
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,727
you'll decide to take your
revenge on that vampire who

200
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,460
killed your family and not
tell me anything when you do.

201
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,493
-If I wanted to do that,
I have no obligation

202
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,560
to tell you about it.

203
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,660
YUKI: Yes, you do.

204
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:16,927
If you lose control, it's my
job to kill you, isn't it?

205
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,593
You gave me a gun for
that very purpose.

206
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:23,027
It's in my desk drawer right
now, ready and waiting,

207
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,993
to remind me of the
promise I made to you.

208
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,260
-That's true.

209
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,560
I guess you'll have trouble
keeping your promise if I

210
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,660
go and disappear
without telling you.

211
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,493
But this means you're assuming
I'll be beaten at my own game,

212
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,760
doesn't it?

213
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,993
That's kind of rude.

214
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:42,060
-Don't you accuse
me of being rude!

215
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,593
But I do believe in you, K?

216
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:45,827
-That hurt.

217
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,827
(COUGHING) Huh?

218
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,660
-Oh, hey Maria.

219
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,393
Something wrong?

220
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:06,893
-I think I may have taken
my little prank too far.

221
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,660
Everyone hates me now.

222
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:10,827
-Zero?

223
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,227
What are you--

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,060
[chain rattling]

225
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:26,128
YUKI: No!

226
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,241
-You pulled that gun
on her for no reason.

227
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,641
Why would you do that?

228
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:33,141
-No!

229
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,008
ZERO: Who-- are you?

230
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,908
-How do you do?

231
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,375
I'm Maria Kurenai.

232
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,941
-I' sorry if he
scared you, Maria.

233
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,408
He's a guardian here at
the Academy like I am.

234
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,708
His name is Zero.

235
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:52,808
He's my partner.

236
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:56,508
But he generally doesn't
take things this far.

237
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,108
Well, not usually.

238
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:02,008
-Yes, but I shouldn't be
wandering the grounds so late

239
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,575
at night.

240
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,808
I apologize.

241
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:08,475
And-- thank you so much
for protecting me, Yuki.

242
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:09,708
You're nice.

243
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,541
I like girls like you.

244
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,908
You see, good girls
like you happens

245
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:17,375
to taste especially
delicious, Yuki.

246
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,875
(LAUGHING) Now, don't fight!

247
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,475
[girls talking loudly]

248
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,075
YUKI: It's time for
the day class students

249
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,275
to return to their dorms!

250
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,341
-Oh no.

251
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,875
This is worse than
Saint Chocolatal's Day.

252
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,441
-What's this?

253
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,475
"Will you please ask me
to be your dance partner?

254
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:39,541
Thank you."

255
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,875
-Well, I'll pass.

256
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,908
You can have it, Rima.

257
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,208
-Huh?

258
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,841
-I heard from that others
that you're a model, Senri.

259
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,941
(GIGGLING) You're quite popular.

260
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,908
-Hey.

261
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,108
-Oh, sorry.

262
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,075
[giggling]

263
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,008
[door opening and closing]

264
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,875
TEACHER: Why aren't
you all in your seats?

265
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,775
Class has already begun.

266
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,808
This isn't a day care, you know.

267
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,275
-Now, let's begin.

268
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:17,775
[music playing]

269
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,641
[knocking]

270
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:30,808
TAKUMA: Kaname?

271
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,575
-Come in.

272
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,941
-Sorry.

273
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:36,608
But Maria here says that she
can't sleep well in our dorms

274
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,675
because she's too nervous.

275
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,408
MARIA: If I could, I'd like
to leave the dorm for a while.

276
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,275
To keep things peaceful
in the night class.

277
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,941
I heard there was
a building used

278
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,541
as a temporary dorm for the

279
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:48,741
night class in the beginning.

280
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:52,575
If possible, I'd
like to stay there.

281
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,641
-Very well.

282
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,975
I will speak to the
Headmaster about it.

283
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:56,741
-Huh?

284
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,108
You're allowing it?

285
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,575
-I'm so happy!

286
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,575
Thank you so much!

287
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,341
-It seems Maria Kurenai
transferred here officially

288
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,241
and took the same vows we did.

289
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,975
Other than that, it says she was
born with a weak constitution,

290
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,641
and she's never
attended a soiree.

291
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,308
That's about it.

292
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:19,175
There's nothing particularly
strange about her.

293
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,841
Well, other than the
fact that she's fearless.

294
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:27,975
-Hey, Akatsuki-- did you happen
to meet that woman before?

295
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,708
-What woman?

296
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,841
-The Pureblood
vampire whose lineage

297
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,975
is on par with the Kuran family.

298
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,308
She disappeared
after going crazy.

299
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,841
Her name is Shizuka Hio.

300
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,975
-She went missing after the
incident involving the Kiryus.

301
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,408
Some say she died after that.

302
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,108
But, no, I've never met her.

303
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,475
Is there a reason you're asking?

304
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:51,341
-No.

305
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,308
It's nothing.

306
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,141
All right, let's stop.

307
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,841
Talking about that
woman is unlucky.

308
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,241
[wind blowing]

309
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,708
GIRL: You seem tired, Yuki.

310
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,975
YUKI: Well, it's getting
harder to control the fan

311
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,575
girls outside.

312
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,475
Right, Zero?

313
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:07,908
-Huh?

314
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,641
Yeah.

315
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:12,541
-That's because it's
almost time for the ball.

316
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:15,275
YUKI: Yes, but I'm more worried
about the upcoming school

317
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,675
exams than the ball.

318
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,408
BOY: And you're the
problem, Yuki Cross!

319
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,908
The ball is a Cross
Academy tradition.

320
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,408
And the class which scores
the lowest on the exams

321
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,908
is the class who has to
work the ball that year!

322
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:30,908
YUKI: Huh?

323
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,608
-I am very worried, Yuki.

324
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,041
You alone are the one
responsible for bringing down

325
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,408
our class average
every single year.

326
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:40,975
-You realize that's a rather
mean way to put it, class rep.

327
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:43,341
-The ball is a
precious official event

328
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,375
in which both the day class
and the night class attend.

329
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,775
And if I don't get a chance
to dance with Ruka this year--

330
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,975
(GROANING) I'll hold a
grudge against you for life!

331
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,341
-Oh no!

332
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,008
It looks like I'll have to study
as if my life depends on it.

333
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,341
If not, then I'm going
to fail for sure!

334
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,441
-Yuki, you can always
ask your father

335
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:05,241
to get a good tutor for you.

336
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,175
Hey, what's wrong?

337
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,841
TAKUMA: You can't go that way!

338
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,141
The day class is
still in session!

339
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,075
Oh no.

340
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,175
This could get dangerous.

341
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,375
Maria!

342
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:16,608
-Don't worry!

343
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,275
I just want to look
at the cafe terrace.

344
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:22,008
(GIGGLING) This is fun.

345
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:26,775
-Hey!

346
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:29,041
That's far enough!

347
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,275
-What are night class
students doing out here?

348
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,241
-Stay away from that
transfer student.

349
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:40,008
The Vice Dorm President can
handle her on his own, K?

350
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,775
-Zero?

351
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,041
OK.

352
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:43,508
-Yuki.

353
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,741
Good afternoon.

354
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,741
This is the second time
we've met during the day.

355
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,041
GIRL: Aido is here!

356
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:53,708
-Aido!

357
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:54,841
What are you doing?

358
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,675
[girls screaming]

359
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,375
GIRL: No!

360
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,075
Now he's hugging her!

361
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,175
-The jealous girls
will go mad with envy,

362
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,408
and bully you from
now on, Yuki Cross.

363
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,608
-Huh?

364
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,808
ZERO: Hanabusa.

365
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,841
If you have a moment, I'd
like to have a word with you.

366
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,308
-Oh, all right.

367
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,008
I actually wanted
to talk to you, too.

368
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,475
-Huh?

369
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,375
Hey, Zero?

370
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:22,541
-Yuki, be careful
around Maria Kurenai.

371
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:25,175
-And don't you two go
getting into a fight either!

372
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,441
-I'm worried.

373
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,575
-Oh, he'll be OK.

374
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,675
I think.

375
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:34,975
-No, I'm worried about you.

376
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,675
[girls yelling]

377
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,375
-GIRL: All right,
disciplinary committee,

378
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,608
you need to explain yourself.

379
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,741
[girls running and yelling]

380
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,841
-It looks like you're having
a hard time being chased, too.

381
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,875
-Ichijo.

382
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:54,975
Where's Maria?

383
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,508
Did you ever catch her?

384
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,941
-Well, it seems that while the
day class girls were chasing

385
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,808
me, she managed to slip away.

386
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,675
And I haven't seen her since.

387
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,341
-You have a hard job being
the Vice Dorm President,

388
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,608
having to deal with
things like this.

389
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:13,341
-(LAUGHING) Well,
I, uh-- you see,

390
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,941
I think if Kaname were to ask
everyone in the night class

391
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,275
to bear the same
responsibilities as me,

392
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:20,575
then they would
probably do it, too.

393
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,708
A Pureblood vampire
has countless powers.

394
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:26,208
One of those abilities is
to make other vampires who

395
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,475
aren't pureblood obey them.

396
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,041
But even though Kaname
may seem a little pompous,

397
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,975
he refuses to use his
power in that way.

398
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,641
So that's why when
it's needed, I

399
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,708
offer to take on
tasks of this nature.

400
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,075
-That's so nice of you.

401
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:44,908
-Hm.

402
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,275
It seems that when
you're with me,

403
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:49,508
the girls are all too scared
to come any closer than this.

404
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,075
That's rather convenient.

405
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,508
But a bit lonely.

406
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,575
So?

407
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,241
-I want to know something.

408
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:01,441
Is Maria Kurenai somehow
related to that woman?

409
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,608
-That woman?

410
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,175
-Shizuka Hio.

411
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,141
-Such insolence.

412
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,041
You do realize you just
referred to a Pureblood

413
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,841
without using the
proper honorific.

414
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,241
But I understand.

415
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:22,375
After all, she is the one
who butchered your family.

416
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:23,941
All right.

417
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:27,375
The Kurenai and Hio lines
had a shared ancestry a long,

418
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:28,541
long time ago.

419
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,908
But that's it.

420
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,141
-One more question .

421
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:35,041
No one has been able to track
that woman down for four years.

422
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,941
And that's because her
appearance has changed,

423
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,941
hasn't it?

424
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,575
-I don't know
anything about that.

425
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:47,241
Only Purebloods themselves know
all the powers they possess.

426
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:51,875
But what's more important
is what you sense about her.

427
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,908
And I want to hear
that from you.

428
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:56,475
-Why is that?

429
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:59,708
-So as to keep peace
in the night class?

430
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,508
-Don't joke.

431
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,208
-You are the only
one who would know.

432
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:08,808
Because you have a
blood bond with her.

433
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,575
TAKUMA: Kaname, what's to
be done with that transfer

434
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,541
student?

435
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,441
-Well, I suppose you can
take care of her, Takuma.

436
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:28,808
-Huh?

437
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:32,408
-It'd be a problem if I
were to do anything openly.

438
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:37,208
This Academy has all the pieces
that she desires in one place.

439
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,641
-Pieces?

440
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,741
Well, I suppose that is
a good way of putting it.

441
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:46,675
But, is it a coincidence
they are all here?

442
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,475
-No.

443
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:51,908
I arranged things this way.

444
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,708
MARIA: Looking at me
with those sad eyes.

445
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,675
Zero is so cute.

446
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,908
-You realize jealousy
doesn't suit you at all.

447
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:21,708
-(LAUGHING) This is so much fun.

448
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,351
