1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,133
HEADMASTER: Here's
my own Tuna Carpaccio

2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,233
with marinated tomatoes
and a pinch of parsley.

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,800
I've also made my Beef
Fillet and vegetables

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,733
in a lovely cream sauce.

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,566
These are all dishes
of my own creation.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,933
My very own!

7
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,166
-Are you telling me he called
us here at the crack of dawn

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,933
for this?

9
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,033
-Hm-mm.

10
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah, calling it his
very own is a bit much.

11
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,900
-That isn't what I
was talking about.

12
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:29,533
-Huh?

13
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,433
What do you mean?

14
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,400
HEADMASTER: Say cheese!

15
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,966
-Hm?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
-What's with you today?

17
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,933
-Commemorative photo.

18
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,266
Today is special.

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,733
You'll perform your
duties not as Guardians

20
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,766
but as full-fledged members
of the Disciplinary Committee,

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,566
making it a day to commemorate.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,366
YUKI AND ZERO: Huh?

23
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:53,233
[theme music]

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,471
AIDO: Surprise dorm inspection?

25
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,538
-Very well, then.

26
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,838
Thank you so much, Seiren.

27
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,238
-What a pain!

28
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,071
There's no predicting what the
headmaster is going to do next.

29
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,071
-I don't mind.

30
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,471
It's not like I've
got something here

31
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:42,805
that I don't want them to see.

32
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:43,738
-True.

33
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,305
But when it's spur
of the moment,

34
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,671
you can see what the norm
for a place is really like.

35
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,071
-Do you mean like the pair of
briefs you haven't picked up

36
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,071
and are still lying
on the floor, Takuma?

37
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:52,871
-[chuckles]

38
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,205
Those are fine.

39
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:56,271
They're made from the finest
silk you can buy and sewn

40
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,238
by the best tailor around.

41
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,738
Those briefs could
be left anywhere,

42
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,571
and I still wouldn't
be embarrassed.

43
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,738
-That's not the point.

44
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:05,671
-Hey, Hanabusa.

45
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:08,505
-Hm?

46
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:09,938
What is it Akatsuki?

47
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,838
I'm really tired and
over this already.

48
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,471
-Hanabusa, I won't tell
anyone, but they go.

49
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,138
-What goes?

50
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,205
AKATSUKI: Even junk
can look menacing

51
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,671
when it's all
lined up like this.

52
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,438
-Hey!

53
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,638
What are you calling junk?

54
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,538
Those are my most
precious collection

55
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,138
of items that were sacrificed
when our brilliant dorm

56
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,305
president reveals
his amazing powers!

57
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,771
-You even got a
fork that he used.

58
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,505
Hanabusa, if the dorm
president finds these things--

59
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:41,871
-Humph!

60
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,205
My collection only mirrors the
respect that I have for him.

61
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,505
Wait, you want it for
yourself, don't you?

62
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:47,038
Forget it!

63
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:47,871
Uh!

64
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,171
-I don't want your crap. [gasps]

65
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,471
-Dorm President Kuran.

66
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,405
-Aido, I'd like to speak
to you now about our dorm's

67
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,905
regulations.

68
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:59,338
It seems that you need
to be reminded of them.

69
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,471
-No!

70
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,671
It's not what it looks
like, Dorm President.

71
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,671
These are just--

72
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:06,571
[glass shatters]

73
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:09,005
I can add these to
my collection, too.

74
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:09,971
-[sighs]

75
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,638
-Uhh, uh, ow!

76
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,971
-These are confiscated.

77
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,271
GIRL: Haah?

78
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,705
What's wrong with those?

79
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:24,905
They're just photos!

80
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,871
-I'm guessing they're
taken without permission.

81
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,171
And that's not allowed!

82
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,538
-You don't understand, Yuki!

83
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,705
BOY: She's right, Yuki.

84
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,971
It's you who needs
to understand.

85
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,038
-Uh, what-- the class rep?

86
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,638
-You're abusing your position
as a Disciplinary Committee

87
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:39,905
member!

88
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:40,871
Walking around these halls
with your nose in the air,

89
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,471
acting all cozy with
the Night Class!

90
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,771
-Uhh.

91
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,338
-Do you have any idea how
that makes us feel, do you?

92
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,771
-Uh!

93
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,571
-Confiscated.

94
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,505
-Ugh!

95
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,471
Huh.

96
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,338
-Have a nice day.

97
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:56,338
-(SHOUTS) Why are you so mean?

98
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:57,305
YUKI: Confiscated.

99
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,771
GIRL: No!

100
00:04:58,805 --> 00:04:59,771
YUKI: Not allowed.

101
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:00,738
GIRL: Why?

102
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:02,205
YUKI: And confiscated.

103
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:05,038
GIRL: What's that?

104
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,671
-What a haul!

105
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,271
I understand why they would
want to snap secret photos

106
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,905
of the Night Class
whenever they can.

107
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,271
It's obvious.

108
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,105
They're beautiful.

109
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:19,138
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
All the vampires are.

110
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:27,971
Uh, back to work!

111
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,305
[sighs]

112
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,971
Jeez, Zero is
skipping duties again.

113
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,205
-[breathes heavily]

114
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:52,071
YUKI: Zero!

115
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,305
Are you skipping
out on work again?

116
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,671
[gasps]

117
00:05:56,705 --> 00:06:00,538
-I'm already finished with it.

118
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:01,038
-Uhh.

119
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,438
We've never been inside
the Moon Dorm before.

120
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,871
I'm a little nervous.

121
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,371
Are you?

122
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:18,638
-Hm?

123
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,938
-Um, hi there.

124
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:20,938
We just--

125
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,671
-You're from the
Disciplinary Committee.

126
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:23,205
Go ahead.

127
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:35,105
-Get rid of it all.

128
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:41,571
-If I develop muscles from this,
my agency will be very upset.

129
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,905
-Modeling is hard
work, isn't it?

130
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,071
-[sobs] Oh, my poor collection.

131
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,505
-Don't hold this
against me, Hanabusa.

132
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,271
-Oh, hold on.

133
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,071
-Huh?

134
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,738
-Before we go
inside, I want to see

135
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,771
what it is you shoved
in your pocket earlier.

136
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,705
-[gasps]

137
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,138
[sighs]

138
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,938
-You're hiding
something, aren't you?

139
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,505
As part of the
Disciplinary Committee,

140
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,371
there's a moral code that, uh!

141
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:05,871
Aah!

142
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,638
-[gasps]

143
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:09,138
-Ugh.

144
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,271
[giggles]

145
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,905
Guess I have got it now.

146
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:20,905
What is this?

147
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,405
Medicine?

148
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,738
-It's none of your business, OK?

149
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,238
-Zero!

150
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,071
Hold on!

151
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,438
Don't leave!

152
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,471
Hey!

153
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,771
Are you sick or something?

154
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:38,805
-Looks like the Disciplinary
Committee is leaving.

155
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,671
The surprise inspection
must be canceled.

156
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:42,705
-What?

157
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,538
You mean, my little
slice of happiness

158
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,471
was destroyed for nothing?

159
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:47,438
Huh.

160
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:49,405
[sighs]

161
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:49,905
-Hm.

162
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:59,105
-Wait, Zero!

163
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:04,538
Come on, you can't just leave
here without telling anybody!

164
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,805
[gasps]

165
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,405
YUKI (VOICEOVER): What do I do?

166
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:08,971
Do I tell the headmaster?

167
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:09,871
[sighs]

168
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:13,371
Hm.

169
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,805
Zero.

170
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,238
I've lost sight of him.

171
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,971
-[gasps]

172
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,971

00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:52,938
[gasps]

174
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:53,938
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:54,938
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,971
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Why am I so hopeless?

177
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,905
I thought I had
grown past all this.

178
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:20,405
But now, that I'm
alone-- [gasps]

179
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:27,838
--I remember that fang.

180
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:30,805

[sighs]

184
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,105
-Here.

185
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,505
Uh?

186
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:09,038
It's OK.

187
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,105
Little boy!

188
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:13,271
MAN: Here you go.

189
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:13,838
-Hm.

190
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,638
-You look a little down and out.

191
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:21,605
So I threw in a boiled egg.

192
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:22,738
On the house.

193
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,238
-Hm.

194
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,571
-Uh?

195
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:36,005
Huh?

196
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:36,505
Hey!

197
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,171
Hold on!

198
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,438
Why are you running?

199
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,671
Little boy?

There you are.

203
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,171
Hey, look.

204
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,271
You left this.

205
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,405
It's your red balloon.

206
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,957
Here, this is yours, isn't it?

207
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,856
Take it.

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,290

Hey!

00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:00,123

YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What was that thing?

225
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:34,490
Was it a vampire?

A vampire.

229
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,190
It can't be.

230
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:55,423
All the vampires I know are
so beautiful that everyone

231
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,390
admires them.

232
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:58,523

I admire them, too.

ending up like this.

-Haah.

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,856
Uhh.

00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:38,823
---the person you've chosen
to hurt is someone very dear

273
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,323
to me.

00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,290

-It's over now.

278
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:59,756
-That boy, he was--

279
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,023
-Level E.

280
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:02,323
-Level E?

281
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,923
So does that mean he
wasn't a vampire then?

282
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:06,390
-No.

283
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,290
They are vampires as well.

284
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:09,990
-Yeah, but he--

285
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:12,523
-You're a bad girl.

286
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,390
What were you thinking coming
to a dangerous place like this

287
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,123
all by yourself?

-[gasps]

289
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,890
I came here because I
was trying to find Zero.

290
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:25,823
-Well, I'm afraid he isn't here.

291
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,523
He's back at the dorm.

292
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,356
I'll walk you back.

293
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,523
With the scent of your
blood, it's too risky for you

294
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:33,190
to be out alone.

295
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,890
YUKI: All right,
preparations complete!

296
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:43,423
I, Yuki Cross, am
going out on patrol.

00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:46,323
-It's late at night, yet
you're bright and cheery, Yuki,

298
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,823
You were even injured
earlier today, too.

299
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:51,123
-Hm, it's just a scratch.

300
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,923
It happens all the time to me.

301
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:53,890
See you!

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,056
-She seems a little bit
too cheerful tonight.

305
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,423
HEADMASTER: I couldn't
hide it from you, Kaname.

306
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,356
But after all, you really
are in a class of your own.

307
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,456
Without a drop of
human blood coursing

308
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,856
through you or your
ancestors veins,

309
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,890
your lineage is rare
among vampires now.

310
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:21,090
You're the vampire of
vampires-- a Pureblood vampire.

311
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,223
The powers of your ancestors
have been passed on to you.

312
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:27,723
And it is for that reason
your existence strikes fear

313
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,223
in the heart of other vampires.

314
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:34,090
-Headmaster Cross, it
is because I trust you

315
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:37,190
that I have avoided bringing
up this issue in the past.

316
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,856
Regardless, the steps you have
taken are only minimal at best.

317
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,490
Why do you continue to treat
Zero like an ordinary student?

318
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,490
Stay this course, and Zero will
destroy the pacifist ideology

319
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:51,456
you've worked so hard for.

320

00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:56,790
-Hey, Zero.

322
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,223
I'm going to come in, OK?

323
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:03,156
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I wonder if
he started patrols without me.

324
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,690
-Kiryu's parents were
killed by a vampire.

325
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:14,290
And somehow, in that bloodbath,
only he miraculously survived.

326
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,356
How can I be more cruel to him?

327
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,056
-But I must tell you,
no ordinary vampire

328
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,656
killed his family.

329
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,490
It was a Pureblood
vampire, like me.

-You, of all
people, should know.

341
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,090
In your day, you saw
many a human life end

342
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:36,690
in a miserable wretched way
back when you, Kaien Cross,

343
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,090
were a vampire hunter.

YUKI: You know, I
think I'm finally

346
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,790
beginning to
understand what you've

347
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:45,756
been telling me all along.

348
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,956
There definitely are some
bad vampires out there.

349
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,056
I mean, that thing
wasn't even a vampire.

350
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,656
It was like-- it was like
a beast in human form.

351
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,923
-It will happen.

352
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,256
Zero's fate is truly horrible.

353
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,823
But it's something
he can't avoid.

354
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:06,723
-Get back!

355
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,556

356
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,456
But-- but why?

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,423
Zero?

358
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,323
I want to keep talking to you.

359
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,490
I want you to open up and
share your thoughts with me.

360
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,556
After all, we are both
exactly the same--

361
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,956
-No!

362
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,890
We aren't.

363
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,256
-I'm sorry.

364
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,923
Maybe I've been a bit
self-absorbed lately,

365
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,456
thinking you and
I were struggling

366
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,156
with the same pain and
the same fears, too.

367
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,323
I guess I was only
seeing myself.

368
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,190
-No!

369
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:42,690

by a Pureblood's fangs

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,090
and survives--

372
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,123
-[gasping]

373
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:54,623
Zero!

374
00:20:58,956 --> 00:20:59,923
---becomes a vampire.

375
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:05,856
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What's happening?

376
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:15,256
-Zero, stop.

377
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,223
Stop!

378
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,223
No!

379
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,956
Uh!

380
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,923
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Eyes with
a blood-colored luster.

381
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:29,056
Fangs protruding
obscenely from his lips.

382
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,090
A beast in human form.

383
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,023
This his true self.

384
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,456
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
A human who is

385
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,256
bitten by a Pureblood will
suffer one of two fates--

386
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,590
die from the loss of blood
or unfavorably surviving

387
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:46,723
and suffering the pain, slowly
transforming into a vampire.

388
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,256
Other vampires don't
possess this dark power

389
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,623
that Purebloods have.

390
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,156
He was only a human, yet he
resisted the powerful vampire

391
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,890
instincts for four years.

392
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:59,390
I respect the strength of will.

393
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,090
However--

394
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,590
-Why did you--

395
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:10,056
-[gasps]

396
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,828
Yuki, I-- I'm sorry.

397
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,490
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

398
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,923
Zero is a vampire!

399
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:33,397
