YUKI: Not too many
people here today.

6
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,233
-That's because the
exams are tomorrow.

00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:47,800
-Oh!

up having to work

15
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:58,666
Not really.

BOY: If I don't get to
dance with Ruka this year,

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,633
I'll hold a grudge
against you for life!

19
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,966
-And the class rep will be
so fussy about everything,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,441
so I was just trying to figure
out the best thing for me

21
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:04,966

this all the time.

HANABUSA: You are
the only one who

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:45,066
would know-- because-- you
have-- a blood bond with her.

Stay away from that

-It doesn't matter.

Just whatever you do, don't
get involved with her.

00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:19,571
I'm so sorry.

the value for x over there,

and then--

51
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:23,745
YUKI: What?

52
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:24,471

00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,071
Would you tutor Yuki for me?

56
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,537
The exams are tomorrow, and
I'm afraid that she still

57
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,537
doesn't get it.

58
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,737
Perhaps you could help.

00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,504
-Sure, no problem.

60
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:42,604

leave it to you.

It's my duty to go on
patrol during exam time.

62

By the way, Zero, did you want
to see me about something?

63
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,571
Is that why you
came here tonight?

64
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:52,204
-No.

65
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,137
It's no big deal.

00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:54,637

sort of mistake last time?

You have to be more careful.

OK.

74
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:16,537
Then this number goes here,
and then use these numbers here

75
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,104
to get the total value.

00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:19,571

at how to respond.

-I was only trying
to not embarrass you.

-Well, it was offensive.

just playing around with us.

This is interesting.

Tell me, when did you
decide to grow up and start

104
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,904

so conscientiously?

on because you were beside me.

-OK.

00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:27,971
I won't.

-Something is on
Zero's mind today.

00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,971
-But is it just today?

121
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:48,904
No.

-That's right.

131
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:31,237
You have the ability
to sense my presence.

132
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:35,504
Because there is
a bond between us.

133
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,604
It feels the
emptiness in my heart.

134
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,771
-Finally, you've
come to kill me.

00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:52,071
Go ahead, and punish
me for my sins, Zero.

actually pull the trigger.

That you can't do it?

-Don't touch me!

140

-You are incapable
of killing me.

I am your master.

142

You are my faithful servant.

00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:20,471
You can't kill me.

hasn't yielded to me.

Such a good boy.

148
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:31,504
You make me so incredibly happy.

149
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:37,704
You figured out who I am, Zero,
even if I look different now.

150
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:41,737
You knew I was the one who
took your life as a human.

151
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,171
-That's right.

152
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:45,204
I can't forget.

00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:47,004

154
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:51,904
That day, your true face
was covered with our blood.

YUKI: I don't believe it.

156
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,671
Maria is the vampire who
pushed Zero into the darkness?

157
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,771
MARIA: As you know,
this body isn't mine,

158
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:04,271
so I want you to treat
it as gently as you can.

161
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,404
Look away!

[gun shot]

163
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:26,537
MARIA: A borrowed body can
be a little difficult to use.

164
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:29,904
Once our wounds heal, we're back
where we started, aren't we?

165
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:34,171

[groaning]

167
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:41,304
-As you can see, a large loss of
blood can cause intense hunger.

168
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:42,771
Be careful.

169
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:47,771
A vampire's true self is
extremely savage and cruel.

170
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:52,037
However, vampire hunters
are very similar.

171
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:55,371
If you ask me.

172
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,037
Now, take him out of here.

173
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:00,204
-So you're going
to let him live?

[foot steps]

175
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:06,404

kills him, he is of no use

176
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,204
at all.

177
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:13,237
However, you are the one that
I just cannot bear to lose.

178
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,137
-What was I doing?

183
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,571
You have to score
high in every subject!

184
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:39,671
Is that understood?

00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:58,437
[ticking]

187
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,205
-Why is Lord Kaname
visiting that girl?

188
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,084
-Just calm down.

189
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,984
I'm sure he's meeting
about the ball.

190
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:37,184
He's only going to talk to
the disciplinary committee.

191
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:40,684
-I know, but I
can tell that he--

192
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,684
[bells ringing]

193
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:44,984
YUKI: It's over at last!

194
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,118
GIRL: How'd you do?

195
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,284
-Aced it!

196
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:49,018
-Finally, it's all over.

197
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,118
Hey!

198
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:53,018
How about we go into
town to that tea room?

199
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,351
Huh, Yuki?

200
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:55,851
-Huh?

201
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,284
Oh, sure.

202
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,751
[people talking]

203
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,684
GIRL: Yuki.

204
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:13,384
Yuki.

205
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,218
Are you all right?

206
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,084
You don't look that well.

207
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:19,718
Maybe you should go
home and rest instead.

208
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,751
-Yeah, you're right.

209
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:21,718
Good idea.

210
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,318
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,751
I wonder what is wrong with me.

212
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:28,751
[girls gasping and screaming]

213
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,718
KANAME: Good afternoon, Yuki.

214
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,218
YUKI: Kaname.

215
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,218
[girls talking]

216
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:34,784
GIRL: Hey!

217
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:37,184
Don't push me!

218
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,484
-Hi!

219
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,251
[girls screaming]

220
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,218
YUKI: Is something wrong?

221
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,951
I mean, now is--

222
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,551
KANAME: I wanted to
discuss the ball with you.

223
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,318
-Oh, OK.

224
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:48,018
-I'll see you there, won't I?

225
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,284
-That's right.

226
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:51,351
I've been asked to
patrol the ballroom.

227
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,484
-That's not what I mean.

228
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,484
-But, I really don't have
anything to wear to something

229
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:05,618
like that, and I also have
my duties to attend to, so--

230
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:09,851
-When we were kids, we used to
dance together all the time.

231
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:10,351
-Huh?

232
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:10,918
Yeah.

233
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,251
That's right.

234
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:17,751
I was always so bad at it,
and you would try to guide me.

235
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:20,951
-You would charge
blindly ahead back then.

236
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:25,451
I wanted to be near you at
all times to protect you.

237
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:28,784
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

238
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,284
-Kaname.

239
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,451
[feet shuffling]

240
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:35,384
KANAME: Don't worry.

241
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,618
I will always be with you.

242
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,184
-Um, Kaname!

243
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,018
We should really get going now.

244
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,218
-Right.

245
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,484
Well then, I will
see you at the ball.

246
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,218
-Um, right.

247
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:51,918
-See you later, Yuki.

248
00:14:56,351 --> 00:15:00,184
-Looks like she doesn't
remember anything.

249
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:03,451
-Some things are
better forgotten.

250
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,951
[foot steps]

251
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,051
-I can smell it.

252
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,584
Smells like trouble.

253
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:16,251
Just what do you
think you're doing?

254
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,084
KAIEN: You think so, huh?

255
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,384
I happen to have an
affinity for this smell.

256
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:24,084
It's delicious.

257
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:27,151
YAGARI: Why would you allow
her to come here at all?

258
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:29,351
-It was Kaname's recommendation.

259
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:31,384
The vampire world
has its own rules

260
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:32,984
and ways of dealing with things.

261
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,018
We just have to
let them handle it.

262
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:41,518
-Are you treating Zero like
he's a vampire just like them?

263
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,018
Hey!

264
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,484
[sighing]

[cat mewing]

268
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,018
-What's wrong?

269
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:04,884
Did you get lost somehow?

270
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,318
-You're so cold.

271
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,251
-Huh?

272
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,584
-Aren't you, Yuki?

273
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,784
-Maria.

274
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,084
-How could you have
forgotten that boy

275
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:17,584
when he clearly thinks
so much about you?

276
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,418
YUKI: That boy?

277
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:22,518
-Wherever you go, he's
always by your side.

278
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:24,084
-Who do you mean?

279
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:26,551
You mean Zero?

280
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,484
[cat growling]

[gasping]

282
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:42,918
-I remember.

283
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,451
Why had I forgotten?

284
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,618
[giggling]

285
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:51,884
-(GASPING) Hold on!

286
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,351
Maria, wait!

287
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:55,918
What did you do to Zero?

288
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,018
-He's going to be all
right for the time being.

289
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,451
But sooner or later, he
will become a Level E.

290
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:07,084
And when that happens, he
won't listen to you anymore.

291
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:11,651
However, if you're interested,
there is a way to save him.

292
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:14,818
Let's make a deal.

293
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:19,518
I want you to do something
that only you can do.

294
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:26,851
[bell ringing]

295
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,784
[groaning]

296
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,951
-Zero!

297
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,218
-Ichiru.

298
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:39,884
You've got a fever.

299
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,051
You should be in bed.

300
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,051
-I lied about being sick, Zero.

301
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:46,651
But you knew that.

302
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,018
-You didn't want to be
here to see off the master?

303
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,551
Why not, Ichiru?

304
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,884
-I'm a drop out anyway, so I'm
of no use to a guy like him.

305
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,651
It's a waste of
time for us both.

306
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,984
He doesn't take me
seriously to begin with.

307
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,851
But I'm fine with it.

308
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:02,484
I only need your love, Zero.

309
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:06,484
[chimes]

310
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,351
-Is that snow?

311
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,484
-No.

312
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:10,284
The cherry blossoms are
blooming out of season.

313
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,618
[music playing]

314
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:21,351
-She's so beautiful.

315
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,018
-Zero?

316
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,518
-Ichiru, it's time
we head back home.

317
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,051
Father and Mother are
probably looking for us.

318
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:30,884
-What's wrong, Zero?

319
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,718
-That woman there is a vampire.

320
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:39,284
-(GROANING) You could sense
it, but I couldn't tell.

321
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:39,784
-Ichiru?

322
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:45,884
-Zero, you're really amazing.

323
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,618
You make up for
the things I lack.

324
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:51,684
-Ichiru.

325
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:01,418
-Ichiru, you-- you have a fever.

326
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,184
Probably from being
out in the cold.

327
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:05,851
-Look at this.

328
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:06,984
I knew it.

329
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,884
He snuck into your bed
again, Zero, didn't he?

330
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:10,651
So tell me, how is
he feeling tonight?

331
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,618
-Mother, he has a fever.

332
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,084
I'll go run and get an ice
pack if you'll just stay here

333
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,284
with Ichiru until
I get back, OK?

334
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,851
ICHIRU: Don't go, Zero.

335
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,784
-I'll go get it for him.

336
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,351
Zero, you look after Ichiru.

337
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:24,618
He really loves you, Zero.

338
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,718
ICHIRU: Being so
frail like this,

339
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:35,118
I'll never become a hunter.

340
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,618
Hey, Zero, that
vampire we saw today.

341
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,551
Will Father or Mother or
perhaps even some other hunter

342
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,184
go after her and kill her?

343
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:44,884
-Who knows?

344
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,251
But if it's on the list,
someone will hunt it.

345
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,051
-Zero, I know you
and I are both being

346
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,751
trained to hunt
vampires some day,

347
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:55,418
but will you be able to kill?

348
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,751
You're such a kind person.

349
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:00,551
-Listen, don't worry
about me, Ichiru.

350
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:04,684
That's why the Master's
teachings are so important.

351
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,484
-You sound as if you think
it's your duty, Zero,

352
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:10,918
but I realize that what you're
really trying to do is make up

353
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:13,251
for me to--

354
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,418
-No, I'm not, Ichiru.

355
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,918
[wind blowing]

356
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,218
MOTHER: Where's Ichiru?

357
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,684
ZERO: He should be back soon.

358
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:31,384
[gasping]

359
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:34,784
-Hey, Zero, what is it?

360
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,051
[bell ringing]

361
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,818
-A vampire is burying
its fangs right now.

362
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,951
Ichiru!

363
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:43,884
-Zero!

364
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:47,584
[door opening]

365
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:48,884
-Clever boy.

366
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:52,751
You knew I was here even
before your parents noticed.

367
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,284
The twin children
of the hunters.

368
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,818
It all comes down to
your sinful blood.

369
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,184
-What are you talking about?

370
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,451
[bell ringing]

371
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:09,084
-I will further curse your
fate, child of the hunters.

372
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,051
FATHER: Zero!

373
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:11,551
Zero!

374
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,151
Shizuka, heel.

375
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,551
-Heel?

376
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:22,918
FATHER: What does a Pureblood
vampire want from us?

377
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,618
SHIZUKA: You killed him.

378
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:28,918
So now, I will punish you.

379
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,518
FATHER: No!

380
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:31,018
-Zero!

381
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:31,518
No!

382
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,651
[groaning]

383
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,584
ZERO: Ichiru!

384
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:43,718
Run away!

385
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:48,084
If you do anything to
Ichiru, I will kill you!

386
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:08,218
-That's a really terrible mask.

387
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,618
Is that her doing?

388
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:12,418
Will you take it off?

389
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:15,051
Don't wear it in front of me.

390
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,284
I thought you were dead.

391
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,484
[laughs]

392
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:21,018
ZERO: Ichiru.

393
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:35,304
