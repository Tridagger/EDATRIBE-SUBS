White snow.

LITTLE GIRL: What is "white"?

4
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:17,975
What's "snow"?

5
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,489
TEEN GIRL (VOICEOVER): It's
something that is not red.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,502
LITTLE GIRL: So
then, what is "red"?

7
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:27,113
-Are you lost, little girl?

8
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,418
TEEN GIRL (VOICEOVER): That's--

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,095
-I want your blood.

10
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,903
TEEN GIRL (VOICEOVER):
Beasts in human form

11
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,313

of living humans.

They are--

[little girl shrieks]

17
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:51,179
-A disgrace to all vampires.

TEEN GIRL (VOICEOVER):
--vampires.

19
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:58,007
You must never get
close to a vampire.

TEEN GIRL (VOICEOVER):
If you do,

23
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:10,794

YUKI (VOICEOVER):
This is Cross Academy,

00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:49,535
a famous private school
where all the students live

27
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,941

-Hey!

31
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:04,932
-All right, everyone, step back.

32
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:07,442
It's way past curfew for
all you Day Class students.

33
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,651
So just turn around and
go back to your dorms.

34
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,459
-We can see what you're
trying to do, Yuki.

35
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,865
It's so obvious.

36
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:14,873
You just want to keep the Night
Class students all to yourself!

37
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,547
-Yeah, you're taking
advantage of the fact

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,119
that you're the
headmaster's daughter.

39
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:18,689
-Ugh!

40
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,027
That's not true!

41
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:22,070
I'm on the
Disciplinary Committee.

-Good morning, girls.

53
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,622
I could hear you loud
and clear from the dorm.

54
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,730
You're all looking
quite cute today.

55
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,634
-Oh, look, it's Idol.

56
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,973
I mean, Aidou.

00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:55,876
-Hi!

-Oh, relax.

60
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,124
You're so stiff, Akatsuki.

-Wild!

62
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:00,094
Over here!

-Hello, Akatsuki!

00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:13,650
-Yuki.

78
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:14,387
-Hm?

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,099
-Is everything all right?

80
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:24,663
YUKI (VOICEOVER): My first
memory is of that snowy day.

81
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:27,575
-[gasps] I'm fine, Kaname.

82
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:29,215
-Thank you for all your help.

83
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,491
-Yeah, sure.

84
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,604
That's what the
Disciplinary Committee does.

85
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:38,990
-When you act reserved like
this, I feel a bit lonely.

86
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,094
-Um, I'm sorry.

87
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:41,902
But I guess it's because
you're the one who

88
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:45,617
came and saved my
life that day, Kaname.

89
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,060
-Don't worry about that anymore.

90
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,901
That was so long ago.

91
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:50,403
Huh!

92
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,747
Zero!

93
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,755
-Your class has begun, Kaname.

94
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:57,533
You should go now.

95
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,872
-Uhh, hm.

96
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:05,365
-You're so scary, Mr.
Disciplinary Committee.

97
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,369
Humph.

98
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:06,906
-Uh.

99
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,880
-Um, Kaname?

100
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:12,294
Would you please accept this?

101
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,634
-Thank you.

102
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:20,327
-You all need to get back
to your dorms, right now!

103
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,600
[girls shriek]

104
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,977
-Every day, they're out
here screaming and throwing

105
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,047
themselves at--

106
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,889
-Why are you acting
cocky, stupid jerk.

107
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,260
You're late!

108
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,934
It's our job as the Disciplinary
Committee to set an example!

109
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,072
-Oh, yeah?

110
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:33,080
Well, I could say the
same thing about you!

111
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,324
You're so obvious,
it's pathetic.

112
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:36,328
-Huh?

113
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,867
-Listen, it's really
none of my business

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,310
whether you like
that guy or not.

115
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,052
But you do know, right?

116
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,189
-Oh, shut up!

117
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,198
Of course, I know.

118
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:48,009
I know that they're--

119
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,888
-Hello there, Seiren.

120
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:53,867
-I will take that, Lord Kaname.

121
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:54,871
-Thank you.

122
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,211
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
--that they are

123
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,219
completely different from us.

124
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm well aware of that.

125
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:08,528
TEACHER: This tablet,
developed by the Night Class,

126
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:12,612
is very effective and has
been accepted worldwide.

127
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:15,423
You are all not just the
pride of this school,

128
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:18,202
but also, the entire
vampire realm.

129
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,411
-Hm.

130
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,586
-It's not that a big of a deal.

131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,297
-All we did was take
part in some group study.

132
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:26,838
-I really hate that guy!

133
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,214
Who does Zero Kiryu
think he is anyway?

134
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,457
Grabbing dorm president,
Kuran, like that!

135
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,562
-What's this?

136
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:35,306
Well, now, this looks to
me like someone in love.

137
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,578
-Ugh, what?

138
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,753
I'd destroy that Disciplinary
Committee in a second

139
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:39,858
if they just let me!

140
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:43,005
-Yes, but, they
do have that girl.

141
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,946
And she looks quite yummy.

142
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,264
-Shiki?

143
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:50,034
-Hm?

144
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:50,603
-Time to feed.

145
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,632
-Lord Kuran, I've noticed that
you seem awfully interested

146
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,904
in that girl.

147
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:02,519
-Yes, you're right.

148
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,490
-Ugh!

149
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,460
That hurts.

150
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,431
That hurts.

151
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,402
That hurts.

152
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,171
That hurts!

153
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,678
Ruka, do you wish to die!

154
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:09,749
-Humph.

155
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,825
-The clouds will soon
obscure the moon.

156
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,733
SHIKI: Yes, it will be our time.

157
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,457
-The night is made for vampires.

158
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,033
YUKI (VOICEOVER): They are the
beings who hide in the shadows

159
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,477
and are the source of legends.

160
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:29,800
And the secret we must protect
is their very existence.

161
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,707
-Why are we doing this?

162
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:33,113
Come on, Headmaster.

163
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:36,561
Our job is to work security, not
be bodyguards for celebrities!

164
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:39,038
-I know doing this every
night is hard on you.

165
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,176
But--

166
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,581
-And if you're aware of
that, then why don't you

167
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:44,694
increase the number of people
in the Disciplinary Committee?

168
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:45,899
All I got is this girl.

169
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,004
And she's useless!

170
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,945
-Oh, I don't have to
take lip from someone

171
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,351
who's late all the time!

172
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:53,129
-That won't happen.

173
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:56,075
It's our job to keep their
identities a complete secret.

174
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,619
I mean, that's why the Academy
is set up the way it is,

175
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,628
so we can keep the Day
Class and the Night Class

176
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,866
separate from each other.

177
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,741
For the two to
coexist, Day Class

178
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,682
mustn't know the truth
about Night Class.

179
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:09,096
And that's why your work as
Guardians is so critical.

180
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,707
You are the only two I
can trust with this duty.

181
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,079
-Hm.

182
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,586
HEADMASTER: I know you work
all night and people hate you

183
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,527
and that it's a thankless task.

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,773
But by giving this job to my
dear son and loving daughter,

185
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:22,418
I alleviate any sense of guilt!

186
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,661
-I admit, I do have
certain obligations to you.

187
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:28,007
But I do not remember
agreeing to become your son.

188
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,987
-You're such a stickler
for details, Zero.

189
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,526
-You are actually
his daughter, Yuki.

190
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,204
Why don't you be the one to try
to talk some sense into him?

191
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,443
-Uh?

192
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:38,551
Hm, well, it seems to me
the Night Class is actually

193
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,225
doing a pretty good
job of getting along

194
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,330
with the Day Class.

195
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,744
And I really don't mind
having to help out.

196
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:46,518
-You're such a good girl.

197
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:49,999
You make me so proud of you!

198
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,103
-Headmaster?

199
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:53,915
-Call me "father."

200
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,426
-Um, OK, Father.

201
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,706
-Yuki, you are the only one who
truly understands my pacifist

202
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,778
ideology!

203
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,690
You see, it has
long been my dream

204
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,999
to finally reach a day when
we can, once and for all,

205
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,279
bring an end to the dark
shared history between vampires

206
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:10,384
and humans.

207
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,957
With their open minds
and keen intellect,

208
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,037
today's youth can bridge the
gap and bring harmony between us

209
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,447
species for the first
time in centuries.

210
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,761
That's why I do what I do,
why I created the Night Class!

211
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,137
-I'm out of here.

212
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,275
-Zero!

213
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,245
Again.

214
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,685
[door closes]

215
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:30,735
-Well, I understand
what Zero is saying.

216
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,680
There are vampires
that attack humans.

217
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,723
If people knew the
truth about Night Class,

218
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,564
it would cause an uproar.

219
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:40,375
-Hm.

220
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,718
Well, Kaname is different!

221
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,827
He, too, believes in
pacifism and other vampires

222
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,304
have followed, proving
your ideology can work!

223
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,609
-Yuki!

224
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:50,651
Uh, huh, again?

225
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:51,756
-It's all going to work.

226
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,032
You just leave it to us,
Guardians, Headmaster.

227
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,873
I'll be on patrol.

228
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,446
-It's father.

229
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,856
-[gasps]

230
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,362
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I have no memories

231
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,237
of my life prior to age 5.

232
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,492
When Kaname saved me on
that fateful snowy night,

233
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,367
he brought me to the
house of an acquaintance

234
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,747
of his, Headmaster Cross.

235
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,262
And without any questions or
having any idea who I was,

236
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,204
he took me in.

237
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:23,019
If it weren't for Kaname,
I wouldn't be here today.

238
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:27,404
That night, 10 years ago,
turned out to be my beginning.

239
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:37,948
To be honest, it's Kaname
who was truly my beginning.

240
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:39,454
-Oh, hello.

241
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:42,065
Thank you for all
your hard work.

242
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,944
-Oh!

243
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,023
-Uh, Yuki is very interesting.

244
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:50,266
There's not a single
girl in the Night Class

245
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,337
who's anything like her.

246
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,743
-No.

247
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,487
And for someone so
used to the dark,

248
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,994
she's a rather blinding sight.

249
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,596
-You know, everyone
likes living here.

250
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,751
But don't forget, because of a
request we received from you,

251
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:14,232
a Pureblood, we're abiding
the rules of the humans,

252
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:18,516
but just barely.

253
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,989
-I know that, Ichijo.

254
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:25,278
-[sighs]

255
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,148
-[gasps]

256
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:38,132
He and I, we're so different.

257
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:42,616
The world that he lives in,
the things he sees-- ungh!

258
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,655
All right!

259
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,659
Much better!

260
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:56,642
-[gasps]

261
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,520
MAN: Yuki!

262
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,767
Yuki!

263
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,914
-Yuki, they're serving
Ginger Pork Stir-Fry today.

264
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,822
-It's time to chow down!

265
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,659
He-he!

266
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:24,495
Uh?

267
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:25,399
-Another nap?

268
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,173
You know, between you and Zero--

269
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:27,675
-Huh?

270
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,048
Uhh.

271
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,391
-The Disciplinary Committee
must be quite taxing for you.

272
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:33,031
-[chuckles] No, it's all right.

273
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,039
I can handle it.

274
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,512
TEACHER: Stay after class!

275
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,023
YUKI: [groans]

276
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,964
[bell rings]

277
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:42,369
-Aw, again.

278
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:43,609
-You have it rough, Yuki.

279
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:46,521
Working all night, only
getting sleep during class.

280
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:48,060
You're like a vampire.

281
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:48,863
-Huh?

282
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,001
What are you talking about?

283
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,876
You don't think vampires
really exist, do you?

284
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,550
-No, of course not.

285
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,022
-Yeah, me neither.

286
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,629
-Well, hang in there.

287
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:57,299
-Uh?

288
00:12:57,332 --> 00:12:58,504
Are you leaving now?

289
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,445
If you have time, can you
stay and study with me?

290
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,416
-Why?

291
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,889
-Because I hate
studying with Zero.

292
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:03,859
It's so boring!

293
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:04,963
-Well, why is that?

294
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,871
-I thought you two were
pretty good friends.

295
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:07,809
-Uh?

296
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:10,486
-Oh, by the way,
Zero left already.

297
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,988
-Haah?

298
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,231
-[grunts]

299
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:24,010
What is it Lily?

300
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:24,913
Uhh.

301
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:25,817
-Aha!

302
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,327
I found you at last!

303
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:32,010
Guardians should set an
example and not skip out early!

304
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,449
[whinnies]

305
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:34,386
-Waah!

306
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,758
-Easy there, Lily.

307
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:36,830
Calm down.

308
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,340
She's a very simple,
uncomplicated girl.

309
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:42,888
She is by no means a threat to
you, even if she tried to be.

310
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,528
-What did you just say?

311
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,269
ZERO: You came to
bring me back to class?

312
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,407
-No, it's over.

313
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,884
You can't skip out when
we have to stay late.

314
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,766
Now, it's time for us to go
and patrol the switch-over.

315
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,444
-I know that.

316
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,486
YUKI (VOICEOVER): There
are places in Zero's mind

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,105
that are totally off-limits
to everyone else.

318
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,080
-Friends, huh.

319
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:08,595
You know, for whatever reason,
when Zero sleeps next to you,

320
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:09,666
he sleeps like a baby.

321
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:12,980
Waah!

322
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,649
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Ever
since that snowy night,

323
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:26,536
there's been one simple wish
that I'd been holding on to.

324
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,009
BOY: How's Kaname Kuran tonight?

325
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,080
-[gasps]

326
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,285
-I know he's your hero.

327
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:31,925
-I wasn't just
looking at Kaname!

328
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,540
Stop acting like
you know everything!

329
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,879
So far, so good.

330
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,122
Seems to me like the Night
Class is behaving just fine

331
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,226
this evening.

332
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,665
And it doesn't look
like anyone from the Day

333
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,109
Class is wandering
around either. [giggles]

334
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:45,548
All in all, it's
a peaceful night.

335
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,624
Safe and sound at the Academy!

336
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:50,100
-Come on, you don't
really believe that.

337
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,172
-Uh?

338
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,778
ZERO: You honestly think
things are going well

339
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:55,657
between the Day Class
and Night Class.

340
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,766
-Of course, I do.

341
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,678
It's my hope that vampires
and humans can all

342
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,150
get along someday.

343
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,590
That's what we're
working towards.

344
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:07,239
-I know the headmaster thinks
the Night Class is on his side,

345
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,113
that they believe in
his pacifist views,

346
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:11,624
and they are good vampires.

347
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,569
But I don't believe
it, not for a second.

348
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:17,280
-Yeah, but-- [sighs]

349
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:20,795
-I agreed to be a Guardian
for just one reason.

350
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:25,481
No matter what, someday, I will
find the most effective way

351
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:28,795
to destroy every one of
those beasts in human form.

352
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,406
I'm going inside.

353
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,280
YUKI (VOICEOVER): He's
always been like this.

354
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,640
-I'd like you to
meet Zero Kiryu.

355
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:43,522
Starting from today, I'll
be taking care of him.

356
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:45,264
Be nice to him, Yuki.

357
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:49,849
His family was killed
by a bad vampire.

358
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,527
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
could see his hatred.

359
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,777
It's taken four years, and
he's opened up a little bit.

360
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,054
We can joke, and I feel closer.

361
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,702
But still, I get it.

362
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:07,489
I know not every vampire is
as calm and nice as Kaname.

363
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:10,368
I mean, even my parents,
who I've no memory of,

364
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,678
could have easily been
attacked by vampire.

365
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:15,991
But still--

366
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:21,547
-Uh, oh, jeez, Day Class
students are on the prowl

367
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,050
again.

368
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,020
I want your name and
class, right now!

369
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,765
I think you two know very well
that school rules strictly

370
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,639
forbid you from wandering
around at night.

371
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:36,442
It's dangerous.

372
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:37,782
Go back to your dorm!

373
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,158
-We just came out here to take
a picture of the Night Class

374
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:40,861
students.

375
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,033
-What's the big deal?

376
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,807
It's harmless. [gasps]

377
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,543
-Are you OK?

378
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,514
Can you walk?

379
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,652
-Did you get hurt?

380
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,790
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

381
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,396
Go back to your dorm, now!

382
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,234
-Wait.

383
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:50,736
-Hurry up!

384
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,091
Who's there?

385
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:58,434
-So scary.

386
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,112
The headmaster has
trained you well.

387
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:01,647
-Huh!

388
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:02,518
Oh my gosh!

389
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:03,890
Look!

390
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,367
It's Akatsuki Kain and Hanabusa
Aidou from the Night Class.

391
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,204
No way!

392
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:08,844
-No need for all this fuss.

393
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:11,254
We just came out here
because we smell blood.

394
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,564
You're so mean, Yuki.

395
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,844
You know the real reason
we came out here tonight.

396
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:23,572
Aah, you smell so nice.

397
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:24,710
-I don't believe it!

398
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,614
What do we do?

399
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:26,484
-He likes our smell!

400
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,325
-Listen here, Aidou.

401
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,567
If you so much as lay a
finger on one of these girls,

402
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,274
I will-- uh.

403
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,279
-Did you fall?

404
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:34,584
-Uhh.

405
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:40,207
-What smells good, Yuki,
is the smell of your blood.

406
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,513
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

407
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:44,559
That must have happened when
I dropped from that tree.

408
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:47,572
-Uh, Aidou!

409
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:52,191
-Really, it is so tempting.

410
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:52,760
-Huh!

411
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:53,597
Are those fangs?

412
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,501
-He's a vampire?

413
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,442
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

414
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,751
-Aidou, let go!

415
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,530
I said, let go!

416
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,635
-Oh, but I want more.

417
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,358
May I partake from your neck?

418
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,128
-No!

419
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,199
You can't have any at all!

420
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,504
Now, let go of me!

421
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:18,065
-Hanabu-- drinking blood on
school grounds is strictly

422
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,408
forbidden.

423
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:23,755
Has the smell of blood made
you lose control, vampire?

424
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,663
-Zero, hold on!

425
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:29,311
-But I already
tasted her. [slurps]

426
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,153
[gunshot]

427
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,659
-[gasps]

428
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:36,576
-You can't shoot him, idiot!

429
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,885
KANAME: Ahh, that Bloody Rose.

430
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,956
-Uhh.

431
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,099
KANAME: Would you
please put that away?

432
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,278
I'm afraid that weapon you have
is rather threatening to us.

433
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:47,722
-Kaname, uh, I--

434
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,730
-I'll escort these
fools to the headmaster

435
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,604
myself to receive
their punishment.

436
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,680
-Dorm president, Kuran.

437
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:56,090
-Zero, is that all right?

438
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:57,897
-Zero?

439
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,877
-Just get them out
of here, Kaname.

440
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,492
-Akatsuki, because you
did nothing to stop Aidou,

441
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,529
you are guilty, too.

442
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,902
-[groans]

443
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:10,918
-Now then, for the
two who have fainted,

444
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:12,659
I'll have their memory
of tonight erased.

445
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,638
And I will take them to
the headmaster's as well.

446
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:16,608
Is that OK?

447
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:17,546
-Uh, yes.

448
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,851
Thank you.

449
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,625
-I'm sorry he scared you.

450
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,567
That was wrong of him, Yuki.

451
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,504
-No, it's OK.

452
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,842
It was just a little bite.

453
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:27,119
More like a nibble, really.

454
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:27,822
-Let's go.

455
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,194
-Uh, ah, hold on, Zero.

456
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:30,164
What are you doing?

457
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,189
Zero, you were so
rude to Kaname!

458
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:37,629
-This place reeks of blood.

459
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:39,337
And it's making me sick.

460
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:39,839
-Uhh.

461
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:43,654
Zero?

462
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,248
-The smell is disgusting,
and they like it.

463
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,190
Further proof they are beasts.

464
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:57,377
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero has
been nursing that blackness

465
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,851
in his heart for four years.

466
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,804
Is it possible for
me to erase that?

467
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:11,034
Just when it feels like we're
beginning to get closer,

468
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:15,587
that's when he inevitably
pulls back again.

469
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,729
Isn't there anything
at all that I can do?

470
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,621
-Hey!

471
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,193
You can't just
barge in like that!

472
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,775
-It isn't my fault the bath
in my dorm closes at dusk.

473
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:30,582
The headmaster's bath
is all I can use.

474
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:31,620
-Uh!

475
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:33,361
Don't strip naked
in front of a girl!

476
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:33,863
Ngh!

477
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:34,632
-[sighs]

478
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,871
-Wait a sec.

479
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:37,579
You just thought it doesn't
matter because she's not

480
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,151
a real girl, didn't you?

481
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,892
All right, fine, then.

482
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:41,762
What are you doing?

483
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,235
-The smell of blood is gone.

484
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,277
-[sighs] Just shut up!

485
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,223
My hand did finally
stop bleeding now.

486
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,834
You know, according
to all the legends,

487
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,775
I might just turn
into a vampire myself.

488
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,235
I was attacked by a
vampire 10 years ago, too.

489
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:02,783
I guess my blood must
be really tasty to them.

490
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,089
-[gasps]

491
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:06,866
-Just means I need to be
a little more careful.

492
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,645
It's my duty as a Guardian
to protect Cross Academy,

493
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:10,649
day and night!

494
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:12,524
Those guys can bite
me all they want,

495
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:15,436
but I'm going to heal up anyway.

496
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:16,440
Huh?

497
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:19,887
-[gasping]

498
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:24,775
(WHISPERS) Don't, Yuki.

499
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,732
Don't come any closer.

500
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,126
AIDOU: Suspended for 10 days.

501
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,741
For a taste of Yuki's blood,
it was totally worth it.

502
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,217
-I would let dorm president,
Kuran, hear you say that.

503
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:44,623
He'll get angry.

504
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:46,264
-That's what I want.

505
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,473
I'm sorry, but surviving
on just tablets

506
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,648
alone isn't enough for me.

507
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,556
Her blood was so irresistible.

508
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,628
I just--

509
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:54,531
-Hey.

510
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,507
-Uh.

511
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,581
-You just?

512
00:21:58,615 --> 00:21:59,485
-I am so sorry.

513
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:05,944
-Well, that's what
you wanted, wasn't it?

514
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:06,511
-Shut up!

515
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:06,978
Shut up!

516
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:07,478
Shut up!

517
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:10,678
Shut up!

518
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:13,111
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Vampires.

519
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:17,311
Beasts in human form who drink
the blood of living humans.

520
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,478
I must never get
close to a vampire.

521
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,644
If I do--

522
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:27,444
KANAME: Yuki.

523
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:33,944
