That night, 10 years
ago, was my beginning.

Kaname is my-- but why?

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,133
Why was he there that night?

7
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,500
Who took away my memories?

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,633
And if I uncover the
truth, what will happen?

It doesn't matter.

I have to find out.

everything today.

So have a good night.

00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:44,802
See you.

He's going to eat me!

look what I've done!

The rose tea was a present.

00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,241
I'll make some more, Zero.

Would you like some?

30
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:23,708
It's from Kaname.

31
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,074
-No, thank you.

32
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,674
I just came to report every
Night Class student except two

you my report, goodbye.

-Owie!

36
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,174
I cut my finger.

37
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,874
Want a lick so it doesn't
go to waste, Zero?

38
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,374
--[sigh] Please don't
act the same as Yuki.

What are you trying
to say, Zero?

41
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,341
When did you lick Yuki's finger?

42
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:50,774
-You do know.

43
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:51,774
-Huh?

44
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:55,041
-That I'm still
drinking Yuki's blood.

-Hm.

46
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:57,641
Of course.

47
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:01,108
I've watched over the two of
you for quite some time now.

48
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,274
But even despite
the obvious pain,

49
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,741
you both chose that path anyway.

50
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:11,641
So I won't do anything for now,
even if it is a forbidden act.

51
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,308
Is that wrong?

52
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,074
While you still
have your sanity,

53
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,741
I plan to turn a blind eye.

I'm so sorry, Kaname.

-It's all right, Yuki.

KANAME: Yuki, what did you
want to talk to me about?

-There's something
I want to ask you.

Kaname, what were you
doing on that snowy day?

Are you the one who
took my memories away?

-Please, don't worry.

89
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,174
No matter what you
ask, Yuki, my feelings

90
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,308
for you will never
change, no matter what.

I've never actually
said it aloud to you,

but you do know, Yuki-- I
love you, more than anyone.

93

If it were at all possible,
I would take them away,

-It's something I had to do.

97
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:52,174
I had to face
Kaname and ask him.

98
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,208
But then I-- I couldn't
find the words to do it

99
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,474
when I had the chance.

100
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:57,974
-Yuki.

101
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,374
You don't have to rush things.

102

You can always ask him
those questions eventually.

103
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:11,774
So just take your time.

something horribly unpleasant.

memories or not?

Answer me.

117
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:47,574
Did you have something to do
with Yuki's past or didn't you?

118
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:52,541
Have you no desire to
alleviate her fears?

-So, shall I destroy one
of Yuki's fears right now?

I can probably get a shot
off at the same time.

-Look at you.

125
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,174
You're quite the anomaly.

Vampires should fear and
respect Purebloods by instinct,

but still you bare your
fangs without reserve.

-You have no intention
of killing me.

-And if I kill you needlessly,
it will only cause Yuki grief.

133

And I want no part of that.

the blood it sees.

lost all that blood,

-You must be joking.

Do you really think I want
any more of your blood?

145
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,208
-I can't have you die now.

146
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:17,941
I've allowed you
to live this long

147
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,008
so that you can serve Yuki.

148
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:24,741
Because I know that
you won't betray her.

149
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,341
-You're assuming
things, as usual.

150

-Oh, but I know.

151
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:32,008
Because it's my belief
that our feelings for Yuki

152
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,841
are probably the same.

153
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,274
-I just-- all I want
is for Yuki to be

154
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:41,208
happy-- I mean truly happy.

-Me too.

-I don't want for her
to sacrifice herself.

I want her to be safe.

KANAME (VOICEOVER): It would be
wise not to delve any further.

165
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:35,274
-But you might be able to
delve further into the place

hides his darkness.

caught on to the scent.

They know it's Lord
Kaname's blood.

Kuran hides his darkness.

I couldn't think.

182
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:43,222
I couldn't answer.

183
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:44,522
KANAME (VOICEOVER): I love you.

184
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:49,755
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The
innocent times are over.

185
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:59,622
Before, I tried not to
think about Kaname and me.

186
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,188
I felt that I shouldn't
think about it.

187
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,888
KANAME (VOICEOVER): I've never
actually said it aloud to you,

188
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,322
but you do know.

189
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:12,255
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm afraid
of what the answer will mean.

00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:19,322
Please introduce yourself.

00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:21,755
I'll be your new classmate.

195
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,688
-Uh?

196
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,188
Zero's not here.

197
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,555
-Yuki!

198
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,955
Is your headache better?

199
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:39,722
-I'm fine.

200
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:41,122
Thanks, Yori.

201
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:42,955
Hey, what's going on?

202
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:44,188
-That is.

203
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,188
-Uh?

204
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,055
-You see, due to
various circumstances,

205
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,755
we've been living separately.

206
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:51,888
I'm Zero's twin, Ichiru Kiryu.

207
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:52,655
Nice to meet you.

208
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,222

YUKI: If you're going to
take a seat, do it now.

212
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,955
-Uh.

213
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,988
Class rep, please look after
Ichiru for the time being.

YUKI (VOICEOVER): He came
back to avenge Shizuka.

216
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:09,055
He thinks Zero killed her.

217
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,455
Why?

218
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,788
Why would the headmaster--

[tiny bell rings]

220
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,855
ICHIRU: Zero used
to have good taste.

221
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:16,955
-Mm?

222
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,755
-I can't believe he
actually cares for you.

223
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:20,955
-Huh?

224
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,722
-So then you know him?

225
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:24,822
-Uh, well, sort of.

226
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:28,422
he Seems even more warped
than Kiryu Number One does.

227
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,988
-Exactly.

228
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:34,022
-And I guess Number One holds
you a bit dear, doesn't he?

229
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:40,588

230
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,455
-I am.

231
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,355
Thanks for everything.

232
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,755
-Please don't go!

233
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:48,988
I'll be lonely if you leave.

234
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:51,488
-Why did you allow
Ichiru to transfer here?

235
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:57,788
-Listen, I still don't know
what the Hunters Association is

236
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:00,388
up to, and it seems
whether inside or outside

237
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,688
of school grounds,
Zero and Ichiru

238
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,588
are going to cross paths.

239
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,622
We won't be able to avoid that.

240
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,488
So if we can't stop
them from meeting,

241
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:09,922
we can at least
give them a chance

242
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,222
to understand each other.

243
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,222
-Very well.

244
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,088
I see your point now.

245
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,022
-Then stay!

246
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,322
We can be together forever!

247
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:21,555
-Get off!

248
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,722
I'll have my own look at
the Hunters Association

249
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:25,622
and see what they're up to.

250
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,788
But no, I'm not abandoning you.

251
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:29,022

-See you later, young lady.

00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,655
-Uh, well, a little bit.

263
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:48,188
-Zero allowed Ichiru's transfer.

264
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,488
He had final say.

265
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,988
-He did?

266
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,322
CROSS: Mm.

267
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:55,022
I know Zero has a quick temper
and can seem rather scary,

268
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:58,422
but he's becoming
quite an adult.

twins, right?

270
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,755
But you don't exactly match.

You don't have the
same hairstyle.

272
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:06,488
-No, but if everyone
prefers it that way,

273
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,855
then maybe I will cut it.

Ichiru, you're friendly.

278

You're not like
your brother at all.

of the Day Class.

completely hopeless.

-Yes, that's me.

-Well, I don't know
anything about this place,

287
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,655
so can I depend on you?

questions whatsoever,

please do not
hesitate to ask me.

What I meant to say was--

298

-Please excuse me.

299
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:48,022
What is it?

300
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,188
And stop looking so menacing.

00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:51,855
You're frightening everyone.

why don't you take it now?

-What's this?

304
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,955
I thought you let
me transfer here

305
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,422
so you could try and comfort
your poor little brother.

306
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:01,888
But perhaps I was wrong.

307
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,955
-You talked before
about the Cursed Twins.

308
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:05,488
What does that mean?

309
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:06,822
-Don't know.

310
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:09,022
I just know that when twins
are born to a Vampire Hunter

00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:12,022
family, that's what
they're called.

312
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,355
Kind of perfect, huh?

313
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:17,488
A name like the Cursed
Twins, it-- it fits us.

314
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,422
I'm eager to see what it's

00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,222
-OK.

319
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:40,188
Zero, you were talking
to Ichiru earlier.

320
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,422
-You saw us?

321
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:42,422
-I did.

322
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:45,388
I was impressed by it, really.

323
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,922
It seems like you're trying your
best to meet Ichiru halfway.

324
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:49,922
You're facing your past.

325
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,888
Zero, you're amazing.

326
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:58,522
-I told you, you shouldn't
try to rush things too much.

KANAME (VOICEOVER):
And Zero, I don't

328
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:04,022
want you to ever forget for
whom this blood was offered.

329
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:04,688
ZERO: OK?

330
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,022
-Mm.

331
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:09,488
I've decided that I'm going
to confront Kaname tonight.

332
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:12,788
For 10 years now, Kaname
has been a consistent part

333
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,088
of my life in one
form or another,

334
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:16,888
and I've always
felt that I wouldn't

335
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:20,322
mind if one day he betrayed me.

336
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:23,088
But I was also afraid
to ask him about it,

337
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:26,255
and it took a long time
to gather my courage.

338
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:27,888
I know I've taken
the moral high ground

339
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,322
and lectured you a lot, Zero.

340
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:32,422
But I really like Kaname.

341
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,855
I've liked him for 10 years now.

342
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,222
-What brought all this on?

343
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,022
-I already know.

344
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,055
I know that Kaname is
hiding something from me.

345
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:45,888
But still, I don't care.

346
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,755
I need to go.

347
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,455
-Forget it.

348
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,755
You should just go.

349
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,155
YUKI (VOICEOVER): When
I first opened my eyes,

350
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:17,188
both the world and my
memories were pure white.

351
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,622
But your mere existence
instantly colored my world.

352
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,122
KANAME: Yuki.

353
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:26,922
I've been waiting.

354
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:34,055
-Please, tell me the truth.

355
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,855
I don't want to remain
like a child who's

356
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:40,122
forgiven for not
knowing anything.

357
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,422
-What is it?

358
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,322
-I want you to
tell me the truth,

359
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,188
and don't evade me this time.

360
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,588
-Evade you?

361
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:49,888
Ah, like you did when
I said I love you?

362
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,788
-Uh!

363
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,155
-Hm?

364
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:54,788
-Um, yes.

365
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,522
-That's how I truly feel.

366
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:57,988
You find my love repulsive?

367
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,755
-[gasp] Of course not!

368
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,022
I've never felt
that way about you.

369
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,555
I've always loved you.

370
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,588
I love you now!

371
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:09,388
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The times
you came to see me each year.

372
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:10,822
-Yuki!

373
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,522
-Kaname!

374
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,455
[giggles]

375
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,888
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
The arms I could

376
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,922
jump into and feel safe in.

377
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,922
That beautiful man who
looked at me tenderly.

378
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:25,488
Those things saved me.

379
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,155
-After everything
you've done for me,

380
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:30,822
I have absolutely no reason
to try and avoid you,

381
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:33,122
even if you were
the same vampire

382
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:36,088
who tried to devour
me back then.

383
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:37,388
Because you were there, Kaname.

384
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:39,222
I-- [gasp]

385
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,255
-Yuki--

386
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:46,188
-Why does it have to be me?

387
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,522
I see the situation clearly now.

388
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:52,222
No matter how hard I try, even
if I reach beyond my station,

389
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,388
I'm just not suitable for you.

390
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:58,422
Kaname, you have something
to do with my forgotten past,

391
00:19:58,455 --> 00:19:59,355
don't you?

392
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,955
-Mm.

393
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,322
-[gasp] So it is true!

394
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,022
Then why won't you
tell me what happened?

395
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:10,988
Please!

396
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:12,855
I have to know what
really happened!

397
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,622
I can't stay in the
dark like this anymore!

398
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:15,688
Mean

399
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,188
I don't want you to use
this bond between us

400
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,422
to avoid the issue.

401
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,422
I want to know everything
and grow strong.

402
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,355
Please!

403
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,122
-Don't be silly.

404
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,922
Let things remain
just as they are.

405
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:33,322
Be happy in this
academy a while longer.

406
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:34,755
OK?

407
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:37,755
Because the truth you seek
might be covered with blood.

408
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,322
Even then, would you
still want to know?

409
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,688
-Yes, Kaname.

410
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,988
-To be honest, I've
been afraid, wondering

411
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:50,388
if the only person
who gives me warmth

412
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:53,288
will change, afraid
that when she finally

413
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:58,722
learns the truth about
everything, she will hate me.

414
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,222
-I wouldn't do that.

415
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,055
I will never hate you.

416
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:03,555
-All right.

417
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,822
Then prove it to me, Yuki.

418
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,888
Be my lover.

419
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:09,788

ZERO (VOICEOVER):
Her arm was so thin

421
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,822
that I thought it would break.

422
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:19,655
Don't go, Yuki.

423
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:24,055
You don't need to know.

424
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:26,422
If you know, then you--

425
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:33,222
YUKI: No!

426
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:35,188
Let me go!

427
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:36,988
You think I'll back
down if you say that?

428
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,455
Let me go!

429
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,388
Stop dodging the issue!

430
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:43,055
-Yuki, if you prove
it to me, then I

431
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,488
promise I will tell
you everything.

432
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,455
That's all that I
am asking of you.

433
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,522
-You're lying.

434
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,522
-I'm not.

435
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:52,888
If you want to know the
truth, hear what I'm saying.

436
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:56,755
YUKI: Why?

437
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:02,222
-That's a good girl.

438
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,155
-Why?

439
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:04,655
Kaname.

440
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:13,622
-You needn't look at us with
such worried eyes, Zero.

441
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,788
From now on, this is my domain.

442
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:21,922
I will watch over and protect
Yuki as my lover, all right?
