[piano music playing]

00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:10,733
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Sorry.

4
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,666
It's nothing.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm not myself.

6
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,066
Just woke up from a nightmare.

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:22,533
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'm sure that's it.

8
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,266
I mean, Zero's been
through so much lately.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,733
YUKI (VOICEOVER): So much.

10
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,733
YUKI: Until you see
Zero is innocent,

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,800
then I-- I won't ever
speak to you again!

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,433
(GROANING)

13
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,966
-What's going on with you, Yuki?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,533
-Oh!

15
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,766
It's nothing!

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,766
We better hurry before
they lock the gate!

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,166
Huh?

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,566
-(CRYING) Mommy!

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,066
YUKI: You lost?

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,333
Did you lose your mommy?

21
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,366
-(CRYING) Take me to my mommy!

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,666
-Hey, Yori, I'm going to help
this boy find his mother.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,366
Can you head back to
the dorm without me?

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,100
-Will you be OK by yourself?

25
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,100
-I'll be perfectly fine.

26
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,133
So, shall we go?

27
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,466
KAIEN: Here.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,300
It's a written order
from the Association.

29
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,900
You are to monitor
tonight's Vampire Soiree.

30
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,766
It's being held nearby.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,433
I don't foresee any problems.

32
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,100
It's a gathering of
moderates, so there

33
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,433
shouldn't be any trouble.

34
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:25,233
-Got it.

35
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:25,900
I understand.

36
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,900
[door opening and closing]

37
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,866
[theme music playing]

38
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:11,093
YUKI: We're a long
way from the market.

39
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,093
Are you sure we're
going the right way?

40
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:13,793
CHILD: M'hm.

41
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:18,526
[bell ringing]

42
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,793
RIMA: Senri, aren't
you ready yet?

43
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,593
-This is so annoying.

44
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:26,026
I hate gatherings that
are filled with grownups.

45
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,659
-Well, it can't be avoided.

46
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:31,093
Just put up with it
for a little while.

47
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:31,593
-Oh.

48
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:40,793
-Hanabusa, the Aido family is
the one putting on this event

49
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:41,793
tonight.

50
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,293
MOTHER: And your
father is coming, too,

51
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:46,426
so try to cheer up a little bit.

52
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,993
-That is why I'm not keen on it.

53
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,293
ICHIJOU: I've
decided that we shall

54
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:55,493
overlook yesterday's
disturbance.

55
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,426
Zero Kiryu will not to
be dealt with as long

56
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,859
as you are at Cross
Academy, Lord Kaname.

57
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,626
-I do appreciate that, Ichijou.

58
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,893
ICHIJOU: I must admit, I find
the fair and impartial way

59
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,693
you vouch and defend
your schoolmate

60
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,559
to be quite admirable.

61
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,093
Fitting behavior for the
head of the Kuran family

62
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,226
who paved the way for the
pacifism we practice today.

63
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,426
-Actually, Ichijou, I
would like for the Senate

64
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,426
to grant me a specific request.

65
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,726
Going forward, I ask
you not to interfere

66
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,426
with the affairs
at Cross Academy.

67
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,326
Like my late
parents before me, I

68
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,759
have no desire to be a
part of anymore bloodshed.

69
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,726
-Huh?

70
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,359
Is this really the place?

71
00:04:46,393 --> 00:04:48,193
CHILD: Hm.

72
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,693
Thank you so much, miss.

73
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,893
I was afraid all by myself.

74
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,326
-Well, I really don't
want to leave you alone,

75
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,993
so I'll stay until
your mom comes.

76
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,259
-Thanks a lot.

77
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,959
you're very kind, miss.

78
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:02,459
-Huh?

79
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:11,326
-What?

80
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,693
-This--

81
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:16,659
-Thank you.

82
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,026
-Hanbusa.

83
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,193
-What is it, Akatsuki?

84
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:33,059
-For some reason, Yuki Cross
is lying here unconscious.

85
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:33,626
-Huh?

86
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:40,459
-Troublesome girl.

87
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,426
[gasping]

88
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:52,426
-Where am I?

89
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,026
-Huh?

90
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,126
-What a relief.

91
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,926
You managed to come
to rather quickly.

92
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:06,593
-Kaname!

93
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,959
I'm really not-- I'm not
sure how this happened!

94
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:12,726
-Yuki.

95
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,759
-Thank you.

96
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,859
KANAME: I thought that you
weren't speaking to me.

97
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:27,326
-Um-- I, I just meant that if
you would stop suspecting Zero,

98
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,259
then I--

99
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,193
KANAME: I've already told you.

100
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,593
I have no intention of
turning Zero into a criminal.

101
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:40,759
However, until we know for
sure who the real murderer is,

102
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:44,159
Zero is someone
I can't rule out.

103
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,593
YUKI: Well, I
understand that, but--

104
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,159
-One more thing, Yuki.

105
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,526
When I heard you say
that to me, did you

106
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,193
think it wouldn't anger me?

107
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,559
-Yes, but you have to
remember it was your fault

108
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,126
I said that, Kaname.

109
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,259
-Don't you know you
made me act that way?

110
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,093
KANAME: I sensed your
heart skip a beat,

111
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,959
so clearly you do
understand a little.

112
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:14,326
[knocking]

113
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,393
KANAME: All right.

114
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:15,893
Come in.

115
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,693
-You're here, too, Takuma?

116
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,826
-Yuki, you're awake.

117
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,393
Thank goodness.

118
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,193
You gave me quite
a scary, seeing

119
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,359
you lying there in the entryway.

120
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,359
What happened to you?

121
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:31,593
-I'm not sure.

122
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,926
I took a lost child to what
looked like an abandoned

123
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,026
building.

124
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,359
He kissed my cheek to
thank me, and then--

125
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,659
-Well, he was most likely a
child of one of the guests.

126
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:47,326
You see, a vampire child can
suck in your life energy.

127
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,126
You're in an
underground mansion that

128
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,426
was built beneath an
abandoned building.

129
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,226
This place belongs
to the Aido family.

130
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,193
And tonight, there's
a soiree for vampires

131
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,293
who live in this vicinity.

132
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,526
[music playing]

133
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,693
TAKUMA: There are many
aristocrats here right now.

134
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:08,326
-I must admit.

135
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,226
I didn't expect to see
Ichijou at this event.

136
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,059
-Yeah, I know.

137
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,526
That is a bit of a rare sight.

138
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,593
Hanabusa, I wouldn't
let him bother you.

139
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,726
-And look, a soiree like this
is being observed by a hunter.

140
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,659
It's an agreement so
the two sides get along.

141
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,726
HANABUSA: But why did they
send him of all people?

142
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,393
ZERO: Cut it out, Master.

143
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,693
-Hello, dumb pupil.

144
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,526
-Why did you come here tonight?

145
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,493
-Because I got an order, too.

146
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,126
-I don't need your
help, you know.

147
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,226
I can handle this on my own.

148
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,926
Will you quit touching me?

149
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,759
-Huh.

150
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,259
I have such a heartless pupil.

151
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,959
KAIEN: You didn't get an order.

152
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,093
Don't worry.

153
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,059
The vampires who are
gathering at this event

154
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:56,259
are empathetic as they wish
to coexist with humans.

155
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:59,793
-Your instincts are
completely out of touch.

156
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,493
Do you honestly mean to
just sit here in that chair,

157
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,693
and watch from the sidelines?

158
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,526
Huh, Kaien Cross?

159
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,526
MAN: Ichijou's here.

160
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,359
Why would an old Senate member
come to something like this?

161
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:16,259
WOMAN: It must be
because of that incident.

162
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,259
-Empathetic vampires, huh?

163
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,593
KANAME: Listen.

164
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,693
Under no circumstances
are you to leave this room

165
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:25,826
until I return.

166
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,793
I will go and notify
the Headmaster.

167
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:30,993
Do not leave this room, Yuki.

168
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,226
-A room without widows.

169
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,693
It's strange.

170
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,859
I feel like I've been in
a room like this before.

171
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:40,793
-Huh?

172
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:41,959
What was--

173
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:45,326
[door opening]

174
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:49,959
-I'm sorry for what I did
to you earlier, Miss Human.

175
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,793
-So it turns out that
you're a vampire, huh?

176
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,026
Did you find your mother?

177
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:55,493
Hey!

178
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:55,993
Hold on!

179
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,326
Is this--

180
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:05,759
[music playing]

181
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:06,259
-A light?

182
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:09,859
-I knew it.

183
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,326
I really shouldn't have come.

184
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,093
-Senri.

185
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,059
I haven't seen you
in a long time.

186
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,626
My, how you've grown.

187
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,026
You're a fine young man now.

188
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:23,259
-It's so nice to see
you, Great Uncle.

189
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:26,959
-But, you do seem a
little on the thin side.

190
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,993
It's important
that you eat well.

191
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,359
Keep in mind that this
body is not yours alone.

192
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,493
When you get a chance,
you should go and visit

193
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:37,659
your mother.

194
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:38,193
Bye Senri.

-A ballroom full of vampires.

Actors and musicians
who won famous awards.

199
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,926
The president of a
software company?

200
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,659
They're all vampires?

[gasping]

202
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:29,193
-Why?

203
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:31,159
Why is he--

204
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,959
-Why is Zero--

[people laughing and talking]

206
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:53,631
-Why is Zero here?

207
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:56,064
He couldn't have been invited.

208
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:59,364
He must be working.

209
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:02,231
He must be here to
monitor this gathering.

210
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:07,097
Zero is acting like he
usually does, unlike me.

211
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:07,831
I see.

212
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,664
-Why do I keep
thinking about that?

213
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:13,164
Stop it!

[organ music playing]

215
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,697
-Excuse me.

216
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,531
I didn't mean to
interrupt everyone.

217
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,164
Please enjoy yourselves.

218
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,631
-Lord Kaname.

219
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,964
Is what we heard true?

220
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:41,897
Did you stand up against the
Senate to defend a human?

221
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,397
-I did.

222
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,897
-I respectable Lord Kaname.

223
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,764
WOMAN: You must
believe it's time

224
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:47,897
we meet the human half way.

225
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,864
For both our futures.

226
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:52,264
MAN: What a noble cause.

227
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,631
-Lord Kaname.

228
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,464
Thank you for putting
up with my son.

229
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:03,864
-Thank you for inviting
me tonight, Lord Aido.

230
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,664
I'm not comfortable
at soirees, so it

231
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,531
seems that I hardly
ever attend them.

232
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,197
-Please.

233
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,797
Don't worry about it.

234
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,597
If I could impose on you,
we have a special favor

235
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,031
to ask you tonight.

236
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:16,131
Tsukiko.

237
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,464
-Father, no!

238
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,864
-I would like to introduce
you to my daughter, Tsukiko.

239
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,131
She's a lovely girl.

240
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:22,897
It's the hope of our
entire clan that you

241
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,031
take a fancy to
her, Lord Kaname.

242
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:26,731
-Father, please.

243
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,064
I'm sorry, Lord Kaname!

244
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:29,331
That's not my wish.

245
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,297
KANAME: I don't know what
will happen in the future,

246
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:33,731
but I will remember her.

247
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,697
MAN: Lord Kaname, please
come meet my daughter.

meet my daughter, too.

WOMAN: And my daughter.

250
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,297
Lord Kaname.

251
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,564
My daughter is so fond of you.

252
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:43,031
She'll do anything you ask.

253
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,497
WOMAN: Lord Kaname has changed.

254
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,431
In the past, he used to
ignore this topic completely.

255
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:48,397
WOMAN: Indeed.

256
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,597
He has matured.

257
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,331
He now understands his
role as a rare Pureblood.

[organ music playing]

259
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:06,664
-Ichiru?

260
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,231
-It seems that everybody
is very surprised.

261
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:15,631
They all can't
believe that you're

262
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,997
attending this
soiree, Grandfather.

263
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:20,764
Is something the matter?

264
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:21,864
-Not at all.

265
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,864
I was just thinking
of something trivial.

00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,031
Death will come calling
to the person who

267
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,564
sees their other self.

(LAUGHS) A silly myth
passed on by the humans.

269
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,464
-Hello, Zero.

270
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,964
-Why would you want to come
to something like this?

271
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,764
-You're looking well.

272
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:46,097
I have to say, I
thought by now you

273
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,831
would've fallen to a Level E.

274
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,431
-Ichiru.

275
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:51,997
We're leaving.

276
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,531
Make sure you see Ichijou home.

277
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:55,131
-Of course.

278
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,197
-Ichiru, what are you--

279
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,297
-I'm employed by the Senate now.

280
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:13,097
So chances are the two of us
will meet again somewhere.

281
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:18,397
Oh, and Zero, have you heard
of the curse of the twins?

282
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,831
-What are you saying?

283
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:21,364
-(LAUGHING) I guess you haven't.

284
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:22,331
Never mind the.

285
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,364
-I knew he was way
beyond my reach.

286
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:41,464
But still, I wish
I hadn't seen that.

-Sure

290
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,764
-I told you not to leave
this room, didn't I?

291
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,231
-Um, I'm sorry.

292
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,397
-No.

293
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:12,131
This time, Yuki, an
apology is not enough.

295
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,431

-That child.

297
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:27,931
I just wanted to see if
he had found his mom.

298
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,297
MOM: Let's go home.

299
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:32,931
-OK!

300
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:33,697
I'm coming, mommy!

301
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:38,464
-So, Ichiru.

302
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,531
Just don't do anything stupid.

303
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:46,097
You don't want to make that
little disciplinary committee

-She is not little.

306
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:56,864
Her very existence
means the world to me.

00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,864
-Until I forgive
you, stay with me

310
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,931
a little longer just like this.

311
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,397
I'm so tired.

312
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:21,297
-Yes, of course.

313
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,431
I'll do anything for
you, Lord Kaname.

314
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:41,264
YUKI: I love you, Lord Kaname.

315
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:44,031
My world began with you.

316
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:48,131
So even if my past is
empty, I'm not afraid.

317
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,131
-Yuki.

318
00:17:57,164 --> 00:18:00,264
-I had told myself that I
would no longer call you

319
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:04,031
Lord Kaname like I used to.

320
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:08,831
But I'm not silly little
girl anymore, though.

321
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,264
I know you're way
out of my reach.

322
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,731
That's what I told myself.

323
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:15,497
And I tried.

324
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:18,197
I thought if I didn't
forget all you'd

325
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,431
done for me, that
it would be enough.

326
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:25,397

-Kaname, what are you--

329
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,631
KANAME: Humans are
fleeting beings.

330
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:51,831
Their lives rushing through what
is only a moment for vampires.

331
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,164
Will you become a vampire?

332
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:04,964
Will you become a monster
that devours blood?

333
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:08,764
And live the long flow
of time with me, Yuki?

334
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,197
-I will.

335
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,631
-Sorry.

336
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,364
I took this too far.

337
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,497
I won't do anything.

338
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,697
-I apologize for
frightening you.

thought that you--

-Come now.

00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,297
What's with that face?

342
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,964
I hope you've
learned your lesson.

343
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:55,264
Don't get yourself into
dangerous situations anymore.

344
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:58,164
All right?

345
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,464
Your ride home should
be here by now.

his bloodstained hand to me,

as Lord Kaname is with me,

there's nothing
that I'm afraid of.

I can do anything for him.

of time with me, Yuki.

Somewhere in my heart,

I had been longing
to hear those words.

00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,664
I never thought I
would hear them.

362
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:03,564
So I got all confused, and
my feelings turned to tears.

363
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,264
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What you asked of me,

364
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:14,464
Kaname, even if you weren't
serious-- did my reaction let

365
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:15,397
you down?

366
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,864
[students talking loudly]

367
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,864
GIRL: The holiday
starts tomorrow!

368
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,331
We won't be able to
see Aido for so long!

369
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:34,364
I'm going to miss you so much!

370
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:35,697
-Ruka!

371
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:38,431
There is a fire in my heart
that I absolutely must--

372
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,231
ZERO: Shut up!

373
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,564
-Zero!

374
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:46,531
-Why don't you quit daydreaming
and actually do your job?

375
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,031
-Sorry.

376
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,797
[students screaming]

377
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,797
-All right, everyone!

378
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,264
Get back!

379
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:58,764
-Ruka!

380
00:21:58,797 --> 00:21:59,264
Ruka!

381
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,997
-I hope you do realize, Yuki.

382
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:08,697
I know what you told
me was the truth.

383
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,164
So please, stop worrying.

384
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:12,664
BOY: Ruka!

385
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,529
