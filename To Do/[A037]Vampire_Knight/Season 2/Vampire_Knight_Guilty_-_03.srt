1
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,066
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,700
-That's quite all right.

3
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,200
-Well, shall we go?

4
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,400
RIMA: It feels sort of
strange that we're all

5
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:25,200
going to the Aido Villa but
Hanabusa isn't coming with us.

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:29,133
-As long as I'm with Lord
Kaname, I really don't care.

7
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:33,333
-Senri, you're not coming too?

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,566
-My mother keeps
harassing me to go home,

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,233
so this time I'll go see her.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,233
-Here.

11
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:45,333
Good luck with that.

12
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:02,166
MALE SPEAKER: Someone has
committed the greatest taboo.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,700
They have dared to
kill a pureblood.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,166
-Why?

15
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,833
AKATSUKI: We have no
idea what Dorm President

16
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,800
Kuran is planning right now.

17
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,833
So until we do, there's nothing.

18
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,700
[theme music]

19
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,195
KANAME (VOICEOVER): I hope
you do realize, Yuki, I

20
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:25,695
know what you told
me was the truth.

21
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:32,795
Will you become a vampire?

22
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,461
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I can do anything

23
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,695
if it's for Lord Kaname.

24
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,828
That's what I thought.

25
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,928
I'm scared.

26
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,728
Scared?

27
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:44,795
Scared of what?

28
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:55,961
I'm scared.

29
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:56,928
What is it?

30
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:58,561
What is this feeling?

31
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,661
I'm scared.

32
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,561
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
truth cannot be changed.

33
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:05,061
YUKI (VOICEOVER): What is truth?

34
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,861
I'm scared.

35
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,561
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
can avert your eyes--

36
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:09,561
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

37
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:10,528
FEMALE SPEAKER:
--but it won't work.

38
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,728
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

39
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,828
-Where are you going, Yuki?

40
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,195
-Dorm president--

41
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,795
-I'll remind you, even though
we're on break, we have rules.

42
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,861
And it's almost curfew.

43
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,761
Please remember, even if you're
on the disciplinary committee,

44
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:27,561
you shouldn't visit the
boys' dorm so casually.

45
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:28,895
-Listen, I--

46
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:31,528
-Look, either way, I just know
that this can't be proper.

47
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:32,495
[gasp]

48
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:33,928
-Huh?

49
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,295
Hanabusa?

50
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,128
-You can try to sneak
in during the break,

51
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:38,828
but there's hardly anyone here.

52
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,595
Besides, this is the boys' dorm.

53
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:41,795
What do you want?

54
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,395
-I don't care what you
say or how this may look,

55
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,028
I'm not here to see Zero--

56
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,995
[gasping]

57
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,361
-Hanabusa, what
are you doing here?

58
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,361
-Dorm President--

59
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,828
-The Sun and Moon
dorms are set up so

60
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,295
that students can't
go between them.

61
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,128
-I'm sorry.

62
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,195
I ran away from my dorm.

63
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,595
-You what?

64
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,461
-Just pretend that
you didn't see me.

65
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,128
-Oh, all right, then.

66
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,961
But if I were on the
disciplinary committee,

67
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,761
I would punish you.

68
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:02,828
-Thank you.

69
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,795
-Hanabusa, in case
you've forgotten,

70
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,495
the knight class is
not supposed to enter

71
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,395
the grounds of the
Sun dormitories.

72
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:10,895
-He's right, Hanabusa.

73
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,928
Please go back to your dorm.

74
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:15,861
-Yes, but I don't
want to be there.

75
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:18,095
So I am not going to go back.

76
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,628
-Yuki, go get a rope.

77
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,328
We'll drag him back.

78
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,661
-You'll have to catch me first.

79
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,995
-Don't waste my time
with your stupid games.

80
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,528
-You realize this could have
all been avoided if you had just

81
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:32,961
helped me out from the start.

82
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,361
-All right, then.

83
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:37,895
I hope the headmaster's private
quarters will be OK with you.

84
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:40,561
Or maybe you'd prefer
Zero's room in the Sun dorm.

85
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,828
BOTH: Never.

86
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:46,828
-Hanabusa, did something happen
to make you want to run away?

87
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,061
-You know, I'm hungry.

88
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:51,961
Oh come now, what
are you afraid of?

89
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,161
Just cook me something.

90
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:54,895
Anything will be fine.

91
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,828
Oh, I'm going to need a soft
bed to sleep in during the day.

92
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,461
And the linens must have
a nice lavender scent.

93
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,795
And as for a toothbrush--

94
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,628
-Now, now.

95
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,361
--I prefer a small, soft head.

96
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,895
YAGARI: I don't like this.

97
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,728
I'm sure Zero and Ichiru
didn't meet at that soiree

98
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,161
by coincidence.

99
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,761
Zero being a suspect
in Shizuka Hio's murder

100
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:15,628
wasn't questioned by the Senate
to protect Kaname Kuran's

101
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:17,261
dignity.

102
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,728
Ichiru deeply despises
Zero and attacks him

103
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:24,328
in order to gain revenge for
the death of Shizuka Hio.

104
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:27,761
And since that stems from a
personal grudge from the past,

105
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,095
they don't let Kaname
file a complaint.

106
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,061
That about sum it up?

107
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,795
KAIEN (VOICEOVER):
If this is all true,

108
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,761
does that mean the Senate
approached the Hunter

109
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,761
Association with a deal?

110
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,861
Or maybe--

111
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,061
YUKI (VOICEOVER): He
ate our portion too.

112
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,595
-I was able to eat it.

113
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:48,061
It was all right, but
there wasn't enough.

114
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:50,761
-You sure are pretty
picky for a runaway.

115
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,228
-Is there a problem?

116
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:54,028
-Yes, but don't worry about it.

117
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,228
I'll just make sure to
tell Kaname on you later.

118
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,695
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I've got him now.

119
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,428
-What?

120
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,728
I cooked enough for
three and he wants more?

121
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,528
-Yeah.

122
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:07,128
He looks a little depressed.

123
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,895
-Is he stressed out?

124
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,595
He doesn't seem like
the sensitive type.

125
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:14,628
Here, give him blood
tablets for now.

126
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,461
I'll cook up more food.

127
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:23,595
It's fine.

128
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:26,161
I don't hate cooking.

129
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,828
YUKI (VOICEOVER): An
unnatural silent moment.

130
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,861
-If you want something
particular, just tell me.

131
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:35,395
-I guess some salt ramen.

132
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,961
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I can only
assume that his uncertainty

133
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:41,261
and loneliness
has to be growing.

134
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,561
So Zero, what is it that
you're thinking about?

135
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,728
-Where's my food?

136
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,528
-There's more coming.

137
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,628
Zero said to give you these
blood tablets for now.

138
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,661
-These are Zero's, right?

139
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,428
-No, you're wrong.

140
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:02,228
-Oh, don't panic.

141
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,095
I mean, after all,
I am a genius,

142
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:05,728
so of course I
would figure it out.

143
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,095
-Um yeah, of course
you are, but--

144
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:11,028
-And besides, Zero knows
that I know as well.

145
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,395
Although he doesn't mention
it, Lord Kaname knows too.

146
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,028
Unfortunately I have
no idea exactly what

147
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:20,461
Lord Kaname is thinking.

148
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,928
-Hanabusa--

149
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,895
-I have never understood why he
gives an ordinary girl like you

150
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,295
special treatment and dares
sour relations with the senate.

151
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,595
It makes no sense.

152
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,761
-He doesn't give me
special treatment.

153
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:36,395
-If you had really meant what
you just said, I'd kill you.

154
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:45,261
-In what I can remember
from my earliest memory,

155
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:49,428
there are two vampires--
the frightening vampire who

156
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:55,195
tried to devour me and a
frightening but kind vampire

157
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:58,161
who killed the other to save me.

158
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:05,728
I adore the kind
vampire, Lord Kaname.

159
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,161
I owe my life to him.

160
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:11,195
But I think our relationship
is a simple one, not

161
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,661
a special one.

162
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:14,528
-Simple, huh?

163
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:17,461
Do you trust him no
matter what happens?

164
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:18,861
-It's true.

165
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,328
Sometimes I do have my
doubts, but in the end,

166
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,795
I really do trust him.

167
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:26,995
Even if he betrays me,
I-- I'd be OK with it.

168
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,528
-I like rose tea.

169
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,995
-Yes, the fragrance is lovely.

170
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:44,728
-If I mix in the rose jam, will
the flavor become more intense?

171
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:48,861
-Personally, I like jam on my
biscuits and not on my tea.

172
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,428
-I brought you biscuits, miss.

173
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,895
I hope you enjoy them.

174
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,628
-There's only use for them now.

175
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,528
-Yes, I see.

176
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,628
-I don't understand.

177
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,195
Why didn't Hanabusa
come along with us too?

178
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,595
-I don't know.

179
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:03,961
And for some reason, Akatsuki
has shut himself in his room.

180
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:07,528
I don't know what's
going on with them.

181
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,328
AKATSUKI: I need
to ask you a favor.

182
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,961
The villa you're going to
houses record of the soirees

183
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:16,028
and family trees
of certain clans.

184
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:19,228
So while you're there, I
want you to go through them

185
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,461
and see who might hold a grudge
against the Kuran family.

186
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:25,328
-What you're asking
sounds intrusive.

187
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,961
-I have a very bad feeling.

188
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,861
And that's why I
need to figure out

189
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,761
what Lord Kaname's secret is.

190
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,661
-So why don't you
just go yourself?

191
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,628
-Please, for me.

192
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:46,795
AKATSUKI (VOICEOVER): Is
dorm president Kuran's secret

193
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:49,195
somehow connected to
Shizuka Hio's death?

194
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:09,619
-I'm home now.

195
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:18,859
-Senri-- Senri, Senri.

196
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,759
-I'm home, mother.

197
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,525
Please brush your hair.

198
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,259
The fans you had when
you were an actress

199
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,925
would cry seeing you like this.

200
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:38,025
-You look more like that
savage brute every day.

201
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,259
-Really?

202
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:43,159
I have no idea what my
father actually looked like.

203
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,725
-Yesterday, my uncle
told me to make

204
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,159
sure to send you
over for a visit.

205
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,659
You can't refuse his request.

206
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:54,959
After all, he's from the Senate.

207
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:58,792
But hurry back, and feed
your poor, hungry mother

208
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,325
some of your blood.

209
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,992
I will be waiting.

210
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,425
-You're still greedy,
but all right.

211
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:16,892
-Kaname, why?

212
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,359
-Wow, look at that, Hana.

213
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,825
You're so smart.

214
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,992
That's a hard book
you're reading.

215
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,092
-Hum.

216
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,492
-Ladies, I'm afraid
the break is over now.

217
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,225
ALL: All right.

218
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,625
-Well, you're preparing
for your lesson.

219
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,325
I heard the master say
he's very pleased he's

220
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,525
been blessed with
such a wonderful son.

221
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,425
-Um, I sensed a child
here, so I couldn't

222
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,459
resist coming up to see you.

223
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,425
Are you a child of this family.

224
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,125
I just--

225
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,092
-Who are you?

226
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,792
You've got no manners
barging in here.

227
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:01,759
-Lord Kaname, if you'd waited,
I'd have given you a tour.

228
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,292
-I'm sorry I barged in.

229
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:03,992
-No, no.

230
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:04,659
It's quite all right.

231
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:05,725
Don't worry.

232
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,292
I hope our Hanabusa
wasn't rude to you.

233
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,059
-Huh?

234
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,292
Father, he's the rude one.

235
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,559
-He's right.

236
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,892
It's my fault.

237
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:17,359
I haven't been around
children my age that much.

238
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:20,492
My name is Kaname Kuran.

239
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:21,959
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
He's a Kuran,

240
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:23,092
one of the pureblood lines.

241
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,525
-Will you be my friend?

242
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,659
-No.

243
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,225
-How can you be so reckless?

244
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,459
Master Hanabusa!

245
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:36,925
-So what if he is a pureblood?

246
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,992
-Hanabusa, I believe
today's lesson

247
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,792
will be on how our race
came into existence.

248
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:45,292
In ancient times, human
civilization almost perished.

249
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,992
The progenitor of the vampires
appeared around that time.

250
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,759
The pureblood lineage hasn't
mixed with the human race

251
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,892
at all since then.

252
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:57,292
So as the vampire
race increased,

253
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:59,092
the need for some sort
of sovereign entity

254
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,625
became apparent.

255
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,659
And the Kurans became
the royal family.

256
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,192
-So then he really
is of noble blood.

257
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,159
He didn't act that way at all.

258
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,759
He didn't.

259
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,525
-Two generations back, the
king of the Kuran family

260
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,425
abolished the monarchy to
avoid authoritarianism,

261
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,459
allowing the Senate
to govern us.

262
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:19,759
-I see.

263
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,725
Yes, that means purebloods
aren't a big deal after all.

264
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,325
-It would be very easy for
them to take control and create

265
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,192
an army.

266
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:28,925
Do you understand?

267
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,792
That is within their powers.

268
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,825
-So Hanabusa, did
you really refuse

269
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:41,025
to become friends
with Lord Kaname?

270
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,059
-Huh?

271
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,559
-Akatsuki told me
you met Lord Kaname.

272
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,925
What was he like?

273
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,025
I've heard he's really handsome,
smart, kind, and admirable.

274
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:47,525
-Not really.

275
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,225
-Good evening.

276
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,759
-Good evening.

277
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,725
-Hanabusa, may I
have a word with you?

278
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,959
-I'm doing an experiment to test
the strength of sand materials

279
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:03,759
right now.

280
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,092
I don't want you interfering.

281
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:14,992
-It just appears to me I've done
something to make you angry.

282
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:20,825
All I wanted was to apologize,
so I asked to come back here.

283
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,492
I'm truly sorry.

284
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,925
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
Is he stupid?

285
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,092
He didn't do anything wrong.

286
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:29,725
-Huh?

287
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,559
Oh him, no need to
worry about him.

288
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,259
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
A bodyguard.

289
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,425
No, a watchdog.

290
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,925
-You don't need to apologize.

291
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,492
I just hate you, that's all.

292
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:46,825
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER): Even
though he terrifies everyone,

293
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,425
they still expect
a lot from him.

294
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,025
But he cares for others.

295
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,759
--much more than I do.

296
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,192
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, Lord Kaname.

297
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,625
FEMALE SPEAKER: How terrible.

298
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,892
He lost both his
parents at once.

299
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:03,192
MALE SPEAKER: A double suicide.

300
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,625
-I-- I just--

301
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,392
-So you're old enough to
attend the soirees now.

302
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,659
-My deepest condolences.

303
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,992
-Thank you.

304
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,759
Yes, you had met my parents.

305
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,592
-I did.

306
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,525
I'm so sorry.

307
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,259
They seemed quite affectionate.

308
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,892
-Yes, they were.

309
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,792
If that's all, Hanabusa--

310
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:30,692
-Huh?

311
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,459
--goodbye.

312
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,959
-Wait.

313
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:40,692
I was just wondering, did
something else happen?

314
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:43,559
-And just why do you ask?

315
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:44,425
-Nothing.

316
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,659
It was no real reason.

317
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:48,759
-I expect an answer.

318
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:56,059
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER): Did he
used to be so frightening?

319
00:16:56,092 --> 00:17:00,525
-You seem different now.

320
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,992
-Oh, that was all.

321
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,459
If you had actually
known something,

322
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,092
I might have had to kill you.

323
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,092
It was a joke.

324
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,725
But a bad joke, huh?

325
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,892
ICHIJO: Lord Kaname,
if you don't mind,

326
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,392
there are people
here who would like

327
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:22,792
to offer you their sympathies.

328
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:23,859
-Of course.

329
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,792
I will be right there, Ichijo.

330
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:27,292
-Sympathy?

331
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,425
Lord Kaname, if you don't
want to do something,

332
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,625
you can say so.

333
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,625
Just tell them--

334
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,825
-Tell me, why do you care?

335
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,492
-Because-- because I'm
your friend, that's why.

336
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,592
-Really?

337
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,225
Because I thought you
told me you hated me.

338
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,325
-I lied.

339
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,425
I hated myself for not
being able to admit

340
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,992
that I-- that I really like you.

341
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,592
Lord Kaname-- please, I--
I love you, Lord Kaname.

342
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:11,292
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
And then my heart

343
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:16,559
decided I would become someone
who could really protect him.

344
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:25,159
But Lord Kaname changed
after his parents' deaths.

345
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,959
The aristocrats avoided
talking about it,

346
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,325
as if they were
afraid of something.

347
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,192
Lord Kaname's parents loved
him and cherished him so much.

348
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,292
So why?

349
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,625
Why did they have
to commit suicide?

350
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,725
[crashing]

351
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,325
-What's wrong with you?

352
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,059
-Sorry.

353
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,059
-Don't touch the pieces.

354
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:44,725
I'll--

355
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,359
-Hold on.

356
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,692
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm
not afraid of Zero.

357
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:56,792
I-- I have to be--

358
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,792
-Here, lick it.

359
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:01,992
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

360
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,959
I can feel Zero's fangs.

361
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,725
-No, don't resist it.

362
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,159
I understand.

363
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,725
I know how much you
hunger for this.

364
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,392
It's OK.

365
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,559
-Yuki--

366
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:29,659
YUKI (VOICEOVER): This is
Zero's way of telling me

367
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:34,925
he's still here, even if he
doesn't know for sure just

368
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:38,859
what he is right now.

369
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,225
A dull pain.

370
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,459
Blood.

371
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,892
-Just what am I to you, Yuki?

372
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,792
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What am I to Zero?

373
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,992
His eyes have a
blood-colored luster.

374
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,859
They're the eyes of a vampire.

375
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,559
I'm scared, but I
can't look away.

376
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,259
Why?

377
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:13,759
-What the hell?

378
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:17,225
I didn't need to see that.

379
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,125
Zero was possessed by blood.

380
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,525
What is wrong with me?

381
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,259
Why am I worrying about him?

382
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,125
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER): I'm
worried about Lord Kaname.

383
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,225
-Even if he betrays me,
I'd-- I'd be OK with it.

384
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,325
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
I feel the same way.

385
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,092
It's true.

386
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,092
Lord Kaname is
planning something.

387
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,459
What I felt back then was--

388
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,525
-That's strange.

389
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,925
What happened to Hanabusa?

390
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,192
He's not here either.

391
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,992
-Maybe he finally
changed his mind

392
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,792
and headed back
to the Moon dorm.

393
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:14,625
-What?

394
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,025
After making such a big fuss?

395
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,559
He told us he was running away,
but all he really wanted to do

396
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,792
was eat all our food.

397
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,492
-Tell me, what
happened with you?

398
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,392
-Huh?

399
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,292
What do you mean?

400
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:28,092
Nothing happened at all.

401
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,625
-Quit pretending.

402
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,725
I can tell.

403
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,192
Look, you're uneasy right now.

404
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,892
Stop forcing it.

405
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,492
You don't have to
smile around me.

406
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,959
-I've got so much.

407
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:48,159
I've got the headmaster,
Kaname, you and Yori.

408
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,492
I've been so lucky.

409
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:56,892
Yet I still wonder, do you think
my heart will grow stronger

410
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:00,292
if I become a vampire?

411
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:04,159
Kaname asked me if I
wanted to become a vampire.

412
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,292
And I--

413
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,125
-You thought that somehow
becoming a vampire

414
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,392
was a good idea.

415
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:11,492
-Yeah, but Kaname
was just joking.

416
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,892
He wasn't serious about it.

417
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:16,059
-I will never let
that happen to you.

418
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:20,592
I don't care if it means
making Kaname my enemy of even

419
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,092
if you hate me for it.

420
