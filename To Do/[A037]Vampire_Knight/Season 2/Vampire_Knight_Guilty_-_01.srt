1
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,333
-All right, get back.

2
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,833
GIRL IN CROWD 1:
Why all of a sudden

3
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:17,033
is Senri looking
so manly lately?

4
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:18,866
GIRL IN CROWD 2:
Hey, Senri is mine.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,366
-OK, everyone, don't push. it;s
past curfew for the day class

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,333
students.

7
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,700
-Move it, disciplinary
committee.

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,566
-Senri.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,533
-I guess I really can't
handle them all by myself.

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,633
All by myself.

11
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,800
-Good evening, ladies.

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,200
Did any of you dream
about me last night?

13
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,633
[screams]

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,600
-Yikes.

15
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,033
-Wonderful.

16
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,933
So then tonight I shall
make a little detour

17
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,566
and invade Yuki Cross's dreams.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,066
You're it.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,066
GIRL IN CROWD: Hey,
why'd you pick Yuki?

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,533
-Wait a minute, Hanabusa--
I'm so sorry, Kana--

21
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:23,466
-Exactly what are
you doing, Yuki?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
GIRL IN CROWD: Oh
no, Zero's back.

23
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,300
Things were more peaceful
when he was away.

24
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,233
YUKI (VOICEOVER): There are
so many things I want to say.

25
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:33,733
-Uh.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,466
um.

27
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:46,133
-So many things I
want to talk about.

28
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:50,066
How is your wound?

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,033
All that time I didn't see
you, what was going on?

30
00:01:55,066 --> 00:02:00,266
And have you found a way to
satisfy your thirst for blood?

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
-All right, enough.

32
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,066
Now go back to your dorms.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,700
YUKI (VOICEOVER): There's
so much I want to ask.

34
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,500
The words are almost
spilling out of me.

35
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,500
But--

36
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,066
[crowd complaining]

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,400
-Zero, welcome back.

38
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,066
-Yeah, thank you.

39
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,266
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Kaname Kuran.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,033
[theme music]

41
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:17,071
-Ah, what's with this
invade your dreams?

42
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,531
Ridiculous.

43
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:21,711
-Well, if you appeared,
it would be a nightmare.

44
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:22,633
-What was that?

45
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,366
-You know, I admire that
about you, Hanabusa.

46
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,433
-And just what does that mean?

47
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,266
-You always manage to
play your role perfectly,

48
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,921
and I'm sure that's
no easy task.

49
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:52,381
-Listen, everyone, will
you all do me a favor?

50
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,414
ALL: With pleasure, Lord Kaname.

51
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,514
-Lord Kaname, are you sure?

52
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,714
-Snip, snip.

53
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,148
Hm, beautiful.

54
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,848
Oh, why, hello.

55
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:29,414
You only had the day
class to teach today?

56
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,014
-Ya.

57
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:36,081
I see Zero is back now.

58
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,148
-I guess you would notice that.

59
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:44,848
Zero was in a terrible
state when he left.

60
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:48,081
I still don't know how he was
able to regain his sanity.

61
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:52,381
-Well, I'm not the renowned
hunter that you are.

62
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:55,514
There's lots of
things I tend to miss.

63
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:59,181
However, I'd able to spot
an apron as ugly as that

64
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:00,648
from a mile away.

65
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,581
-Huh?

66
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:02,548
This is cute.

67
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,081
-I'm so sorry, Kana--

68
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:18,048
ZERO (VOICEOVER): That guy's
blood is coursing through me.

69
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:19,614
Can Yuki sense it?

70
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,514
Kaname Kuran.

71
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:32,514
Ever since I drank his
blood, this vision I

72
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:36,314
have of that-- that monster.

73
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:40,781
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

74
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:47,081
Shizuka Hio was
here at the Academy.

75
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:51,748
In order for Zero to stop his
inevitable fall into a level E,

76
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,548
he had to drink the
blood of that woman who

77
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,948
dealt him such a cruel fate.

78
00:06:55,981 --> 00:07:04,281
And yet, I doubt that Zero
was able to drink her blood.

79
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:09,281
I wonder how much time
Zero has left now?

80
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:13,214
If drinking my blood would
slow his fall to a level E,

81
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:18,014
I'd let him have as
much as he wanted.

82
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:20,248
-Why do you insist
on doing this?

83
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:22,648
You don't need to
care for me so much.

84
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,614
-Zero.

85
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,548
-I only wanted to protect you.

86
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,281
-Kaname, I--

87
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,248
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Don't
tell me that in the end

88
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,714
I can't do anything without
Zero and Kaname protecting me.

89
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,381
Zero.

90
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:04,014
There's one thing I can do.

91
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,548
-Zero!

92
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:09,181
For a whole week, I
had to work really hard

93
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:11,448
and do this job all
by myself, you know.

94
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,648
You had better work
twice as hard tonight.

95
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,581
-You can be so--

96
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:20,848
-Come on, now, aren't
you craving it?

97
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,848
I mean, I'm sure
they didn't give you

98
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,948
any at the medical
clinic, right?

99
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:29,314
So just for tonight, I'm willing
to give you an extra helping.

100
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:29,981
-Don't be stupid.

101
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:33,248
-Zero.

102
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,314
Zero.

103
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,448
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:53,614
Listen, I've said this before,
but I-- I am on your side.

105
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,781
I may not be much help.

106
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:59,514
Actually, I'm pretty
useless, and I really

107
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:03,148
hate that about myself.

108
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,048
I wanted you to drink
her blood so badly,

109
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:08,114
I'd have forced you to drink it.

110
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,948
YUKI (VOICEOVER): It was
the only way to save Zero,

111
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,948
and all I've done is
cause him more suffering.

112
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:16,914
-I'm so sorry.

113
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,214
-Just what am I to you, Yuki?

114
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,581
-What are you to me?

115
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:31,948
-Stop.

116
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,281
No more reckless acts
on my behalf, OK?

117
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,181
Am I that hopeless?

118
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,948
-Oh, this is serious,
serious news.

119
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,114
-What is it, Headmaster?

120
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:51,914
-She's awake.

121
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:55,248
Maria Kurenai has woken up.

122
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,448
-Maria is awake now?

123
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,948
-It's Ichiro.

124
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,048
You lied, Headmaster.

125
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,848
He is to here.

126
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:06,714
-Well, that one is--

127
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,181
-Ichiru, that man is so cruel.

128
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:15,681
He says Shizuka was
killed-- you're not-- are

129
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:20,014
you-- are you really Zero?

130
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,948
-Maria.

131
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:26,781
-So Shizuka actually
did meet you then.

132
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:29,714
So must-- she must
really be dead.

133
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:38,348
At Shizuka's request,
I lent her my body

134
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:42,581
from time to time
when see needed it.

135
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:47,248
In return, Shizuka promised
to make me healthy.

136
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,614
But since I'm related
to her by blood,

137
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:53,581
I still would have even
without any promises.

138
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:57,548
Shizuka was put in isolation
right after she was born.

139
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:01,214
They said it was to protect
her, but no one ever

140
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:04,114
loved or even cared for her.

141
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:08,381
The one Shizuka cared for was
the first person in her life

142
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:11,414
who ever showed her any
form of love at all,

143
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,881
and when she lost him,
all her sadness and anger

144
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,048
caused her to go insane.

145
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:23,614
Zero, listen, I don't think
she regretted you killing her.

146
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:24,448
-All right.

147
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,081
Calm down, Maria.

148
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:27,881
You've only just woken up.

149
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:29,348
-No, Maria, that isn't what--

150
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:30,314
-It's OK, Yuki.

151
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,248
Let's let her rest for now.

152
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:32,748
Zero.

153
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:37,448
-Wait.

154
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:41,914
Zero, I want to make sure that
at least tell you the truth.

155
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,714
-What?

156
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:46,314
-You see, the Kiryus
were used as pawns

157
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,314
when they hunted
Shizuka's lover.

158
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:52,114
There was someone else
behind the scenes.

159
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,881
Someone who was not
happy that she was in

160
00:11:54,914 --> 00:12:00,281
love with a vampire,
who used to be a human.

161
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,781
When Shizuka realized
who the real culprit was,

162
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:07,181
she attempted to gain more
power to destroy her enemy.

163
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:10,181
Whoever did these things
to her is the real enemy,

164
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:13,481
the enemy of the
purebloods and of you.

165
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,914
-A true enemy.

166
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:23,014
-Maria also believes
that Zero killed Shizuka.

167
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:36,448
But, at that time,
Zero was-- I thought

168
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:39,381
that I saw someone here.

169
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,281
-Good evening, miss.

170
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,848
This is Cross Academy, isn't it?

171
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:47,748
I apologize for visiting
at such a late hour,

172
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,681
but I'm afraid that I lost
track of time at the office.

173
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,081
-I can sense it.

174
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:55,214
You're-- you're a vampire.

175
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:59,014
-I am, and the young
lady is a guardian.

176
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:01,314
I was wondering something.

177
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,281
-Just what do you want?

178
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,181
-Where is the other guardian?

179
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:10,381
-Zero.

180
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,014
-What do you want with me?

181
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:16,214
-Zero Kiryu, the Senate,
the highest governing body

182
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:19,348
of vampires, has
issued an order,

183
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,481
and I'm here to execute you for
the murder of the pure blood

184
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:23,748
vampire Shizuka Hio.

185
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:40,166
You see, the Senate proudly
protects our pureblood masters,

186
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,966
and yet, somehow you slipped
through and killed Shizuka.

187
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:46,532
-Wait!

188
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,232
Zero didn't--

189
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,466
-Stop!

190
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,766
The only way you can
atone for your sin is

191
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,765
to offer your life in return,
a cheapest price to pay,

192
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:59,931
isn't it?

193
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,431
Yah!

194
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,531
You have a lot of
nerve breaking my hand.

195
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:10,898
Soon, you'll just be
another vile level E.

196
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:14,398
ZERO (VOICEOVER): My
strength has increased.

197
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,565
-Zero.

198
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:19,798
-Sorry, but I'm not
willing to pay that price.

199
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:23,898
-Even if you kill me, you
can't escape your fate.

200
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,365
You will be executed
for your crime.

201
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,465
-Go on.

202
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,231
This has nothing to do with you.

203
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:37,498
-I won't do that.

204
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,231
-It was inevitable for
Shizuka to be hunted down

205
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,965
by Zero for what she did.

206
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,865
-Lord Kaname.

207
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:55,965
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Hunted down by Zero?

208
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:58,631
-Tell me, why do you
all feel so strongly

209
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,665
about Zero's execution?

210
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:03,331
To protect the so-called
sanctity of purebloods.

211
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:06,598
-Lord Kaname, if a
pureblood, such as yourself,

212
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:10,631
stands in our way, we
cannot complete our mission.

213
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:14,465
-Perhaps you don't realize this
Academy is very dear to me.

214
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,665
I don't want it spoiled by
foolish acts of vengeance

215
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,098
performed by the
Senate's henchmen.

216
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:22,131
-Lord Kaname, please.

217
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:22,631
Ah!

218
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,398
-Leave now.

219
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:34,765
-You're choice to protect Zero
Kiryu shall be reporting back

220
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,231
to the Senate, Lord Kaname.

221
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:42,331
-Are you all right?

222
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:45,098
-So Kaname, why'd you save me?

223
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:48,031
-Because I simply
will not tolerate

224
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:50,665
the execution of a school
mate by foolish members

225
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,298
of my race for
groundless reasons.

226
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:57,631
-Zero.

227
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:03,431
Thank you very much.

228
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:04,231
-It's fine.

229
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,698
-No, thank you.

230
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:09,065
But still, there's
absolutely no reason

231
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,998
why Zero should be
targeted for this.

232
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,698
-Yes, I know that.

233
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:17,265
Don't worry.

234
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:17,965
-No.

235
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,598
You don't understand.

236
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,298
How dare you speak that way to--

237
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,298
-Now, now.

238
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,331
All right, everyone,
it's time you all

239
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,365
go back to the classroom.

240
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:26,298
-But Lord Kaname was--

241
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:26,798
-Let's go.

242
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,865
-Just what is it that
I don't understand?

243
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,665
-That Shizuka was
hunted by Zero.

244
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,065
It wasn't him.

245
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,865
he didn't have
anything to do with it.

246
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:50,731
-Yuki, I have no intention
of making Zero a villain.

247
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,098
Please, belief that.

248
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,465
-Then say it.

249
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:56,365
I want you to say you realize
that Zero isn't the killer.

250
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,531
-Sure.

251
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:59,298
If you say it's true,
then I concede it.

252
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:04,698
-Come on, I'm serious.

253
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,298
-And I have always
been serious about you.

254
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,865
-Zero is not the guilty one.

255
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,298
-This talk is going
nowhere, Yuki.

256
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,131
-I don't care if
it goes nowhere.

257
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:19,531
Until you say Zero is
innocent, then I-- then

258
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,198
I won't ever speak to you again.

259
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,765
--[chuckling] This isn't a
children's quarrel here.

260
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:33,565
Uh, very sorry.

261
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:42,165
-He's willing to defy the
Senate to protect Cross Academy.

262
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:44,798
Just what is Lord
Kaname thinking?

263
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:48,365
-Does it really matter
what he's thinking?

264
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,731
-What are you saying, Senri?

265
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:53,198
-It really doesn't matter
what he's thinking.

266
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:56,798
We will simply obey
without question.

267
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:59,898
Personally, I find it
quite comfortable here.

268
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:06,298
-Senri, since President Kuran
created this place for us.

269
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,431
-I agree with what Senri said.

270
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:09,365
-Me too.

271
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,331
He's right.

272
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,598
The night class will
stand with Lord Kaname.

273
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:18,131
-And so will I, completely.

274
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,765
-What's wrong?

275
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:32,031
-Sorry, did I wake you?

276
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,965
-You can't sleep?

277
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:38,765
-I was just thinking about
how childish I can be.

278
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,531
-That's true.

279
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,765
But I don't think that your
childish side is actually

280
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,131
a weakness, Yuki.

281
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,998
Goodnight.

282
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:48,865
-Thanks, Juri.

283
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:00,298
-What do you want?

284
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,865
-You did it.

285
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:08,398
It was you who killed Shizuka
after I had already shot her.

286
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,565
I've heard the flesh
and blood of purebloods

287
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,498
hold strong powers.

288
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:16,431
So her powers, you took them?

289
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,798
-You heard?

290
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,965
As if you have no idea.

291
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:21,398
You know.

292
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,531
You know first hand.

293
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:26,731
You realize my blood
won't save you forever.

294
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,731
It's only temporary.

295
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,998
I pity you Zero.

296
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:33,465
But at the same
time, I'm envious you

297
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:36,765
can protect the girl you like.

298
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,431
-You and I are not done talking.

299
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:42,331
I spoke to Maria, who
is this real enemy

300
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:45,031
of the purebloods
she told me about?

301
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,098
-There's no need for
you to know that.

302
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,965
-You

303
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:52,598
-I just realized there's
another way of looking at this.

304
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:55,065
The only reason you
can protect Yuki

305
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:58,531
is because my blood
is flowing inside you.

306
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,365
I know you think that you're
the one protecting Yuki,

307
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:03,431
but really, it's me.

308
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:11,098
-You bastard.

309
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:33,198
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Kaname
Kuran's blood lives inside me.

310
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,165
-Come on now.

311
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:37,598
Aren't you craving it?

312
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:42,731
Kaname Kuran's blood should
have satisfied me for a while,

313
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:48,598
but still all I want is Yuki.

314
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:55,631
-You wanted to kill me
all this time, Zero Kiryu.

315
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,965
Where will your desires
go now that you've

316
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,431
lost your reason to live?

317
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:04,331
Will it be replaced by the--

318
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,298
-Merciless instincts
of a vampire?

319
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:13,765
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Blood.

320
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:21,431
The overwhelming
sweet smell of blood.

321
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,631
-Yuki!

322
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,131
-Zero?

323
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,931
What is it?

324
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,231
-Yuki.

325
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:30,865
you're alive.

326
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:31,365
-Zero.

327
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:37,031
-I thought I'd killed you.

328
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:39,631
-You're hurting me, Zero.

329
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,665
Zero, are you all right?

330
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:46,065
-Yeah.

331
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,365
-Thank goodness.

332
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,665
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I want this.

333
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:54,698
I want her gentle hands.

334
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:57,998
Her smile.

335
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:08,665
-It's nothing.

336
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:11,731
-The Senate sent
men to the Academy?

337
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,065
-They did.

338
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,398
-What's the Hunter
Association doing?

339
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:19,065
No matter how you
look at it, they--

340
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:23,865
-From the Hunter Association,
and it's addressed to Zero.

341
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,620
