1
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,300
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The first
time I looked at sunlight

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,866
with my vampire eyes.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,166
-I can't believe
it's morning already.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,833
Let's get back before
Lord Kaname returns.

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:23,966
-All right.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,766
YUKI (VOICEOVER): It
wasn't gentle anymore.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,100
I thought I smelled
Kaname's blood.

8
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,166
-You'll be sensitive
to many new things now,

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,933
but Lord Kaname will be
worried if you aren't there.

10
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,433
-But I-- I sense a
horrible presence.

11
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:46,633
It seems like others
are stirring too,

12
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,533
as if by command
of that presence.

13
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,133
-My master--

14
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,200
[gasp]

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,266
-This Academy is no longer the
safe haven I had hoped for.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,500
Let the students know.

17
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,500
They must go home.

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,500
[theme music]

19
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:41,517
-You all to return home
until further notice

20
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,436
from the headmaster.

21
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,903
Once you're packed, please
proceed to building 12

22
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:47,503
and follow Mr.
Yagari's instructions.

23
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,136
And just where are you going?

24
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,703
-To get Mister Bear.

25
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,136
-And what is that?

26
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,170
-He's my teddy bear?

27
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,536
-That's what you want?

28
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,170
You will leave that behind.

29
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:57,803
OK, fine.

30
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:58,836
You can get it.

31
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,803
But make it snappy!

32
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,903
-Sayori, what are you doing?

33
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,836
The class rep says we
have to leave here now.

34
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,503
-Yes, but--

35
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:13,636
-Come on, let's go.

36
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,036
-I wanted to take our time
and gradually show the world

37
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,770
that at this Academy, there
are vampires with whom

38
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:22,803
we can co-exist.

39
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,036
-It's too bad that dream
never became true for you.

40
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,203
-No, I won't give
up on that dream.

41
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:31,703
Not yet.

42
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,770
-I'm taking Senri.

43
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:45,303
He doesn't need him anymore.

44
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,503
-Do as you wish.

45
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,970
[door closing]

46
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:03,136
-Shizuka, it's all most time.

47
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,136
Just a little longer.

48
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,636
-Come on, this way.

49
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,703
And be quick!

50
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,370
-I didn't know there
was a hallway here.

51
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:13,103
-It's an emergency exit.

52
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,970
-Hey Shindo, have you
seen Yuki anywhere?

53
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:17,036
-Huh?

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,770
I figured you knew
where she was, Sayori.

55
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,170
SAYORI (VOICEOVER):
I know there's

56
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:24,103
something you can't tell me.

57
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:26,336
I understand you're
keeping it a secret

58
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,736
because you don't
want to make me worry,

59
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,670
but it feels like you
don't trust me, Yuki.

60
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:36,470
-Hey, I know I said to hurry,
but come on, wear your shoes.

61
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:38,036
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
This ominous feeling

62
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,203
I have, I've felt it before.

63
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,936
-Is it all right now to
let the students outside?

64
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,136
-Kaname's orders were clear.

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,570
We are to make sure the
day class students stay out

66
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:53,203
of harm's way.

67
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:56,336
-That's if we can even
get them out of here.

68
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,270
-What's that?

69
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,470
-Is that an elevator?

70
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:00,603
-If everyone's here, let's go.

71
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,236
-Wait!

72
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,936
Wait, wait, wait!

73
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,870
There's more.

74
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,870
We're missing some
female students!

75
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:08,070
It's all my fault.

76
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:12,270
I told them repeatedly to hurry.

77
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,703
-Why didn't they
get here in time?

78
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,603
-Gather all the students
in the auditorium.

79
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,036
I'll handle the rest.

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,970
-Got it.

81
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:19,070
Change of plans.

82
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,136
Proceed to the
auditorium immediately.

83
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,203
-Hurry up, people!

84
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,103
KAIEN (VOICEOVER):
Forgive me, Juri.

85
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,570
In order to fulfill
your wish, I'm

86
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:33,236
afraid that I must now
break my promise to you.

87
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,136
-Say, maybe this
wasn't a good idea.

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,070
But who knows when we'll see
the night class students next?

89
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,903
I'm already going
through withdrawals.

90
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:52,203
-Good morning, ladies.

91
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:53,536
-Huh?

92
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,936
-Young girls are so full of
energy, even in the morning.

93
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,770
I used to be that way too.

94
00:05:57,803 --> 00:06:04,370
My, my-- you will be
gifts for my master.

95
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:05,636
[screaming]

96
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,003
You bastard.

97
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:16,603
Akatsuki, why are you
going so easy on her?

98
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:19,170
These vampires
are former humans.

99
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:23,570
So then, I wonder whose
servants they are.

100
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:26,403
We will not stand
by and allow enemies

101
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,736
into Lord Kaname's territory.

102
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,303
[grunting]

103
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,236
[screaming]

104
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,703
-Kaien Cross.

105
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,270
-He's a legend among
vampire hunters--

106
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:59,436
the strongest in history.

107
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,870
-Thank you for
protecting the students.

108
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,070
-Of course.

109
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,436
-I'm sure the real attack
will come after sundown.

110
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,970
We can't led our guard down.

111
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:08,470
KAIEN (VOICEOVER):
Fighting vampires

112
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:12,503
with vampires-- I can't
believe the irony.

113
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,470
AIDO: Hey, what are you doing?

114
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:15,703
-I feel it.

115
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,570
Something's about to happen,
and I have to stop it.

116
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,970
-Look, you-- if you
get hurt, Lord Kaname

117
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,636
will hold me responsible.

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,803
-I may have become a vampire,
but I'm still a guardian.

119
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,003
-Yes, but-- huh?

120
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:37,636
[screaming]

121
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,603
-Well, hello there, miss.

122
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:56,336
We haven't seen our master
in a very long time,

123
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,303
and we so desperately
want to bring him a gift.

124
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:01,136
-Who are--

125
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,036
-That's not important, K?

126
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,636
-Yuri!

127
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,636
Yuri, are you all right?

128
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,370
-Yuki, what have you be--

129
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,270
-Stand back.

130
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:19,370
-She's the pureblood princess.

131
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:22,536
-So this is his princess.

132
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,003
-Anyone who tries to hurt
Yuri must first answer to me.

133
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,336
Why did--

134
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,836
-For our master!

135
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,936
-You're no match for me.

136
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,903
-Yuki, what is going on?

137
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:52,736
-I'm sorry, Yuri.

138
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,436
The man who just turned to
dust, I'm the same being.

139
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,636
I didn't mean to scare you.

140
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,236
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,970
-(SOBBING) No.

142
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,470
Don't apologize and
give me that sad face.

143
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,136
I'll feel even
lonelier if you do.

144
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,070
I've been waiting for
you to come back safely.

145
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,770
I would have been
more scared if I

146
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:19,470
didn't know why my best
friend never returned.

147
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,003
-Yuri.

148
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,703
KANAME: Yuki.

149
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,170
-Kaname.

150
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,803
-Yuki, what are
you doing out here?

151
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:30,903
-Something is about to happen
at the Academy, isn't it?

152
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:34,070
That's why I--

153
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,636
-You mustn't be so careless.

154
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,303
Your condition is
still unstable.

155
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,836
Take Yuki to a quiet
place so she can rest.

156
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,203
-Yes.

157
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,470
-Kaname, listen to me.

158
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,403
There are people here that
I want to protect as well.

159
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,036
-But you can't even
handle Artemis.

160
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,436
-All right, let's
get going, Yuki.

161
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,436
-Yuki.

162
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:11,136
No matter what, we will
always be best friends.

163
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,170
-Oh, Yuri.

164
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:13,670
-Yes.

165
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,103
-That was impressive.

166
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,270
What's with the long face?

167
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,003
You made Zero hunt
vampires under the guise

168
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,936
that you were protecting him.

169
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,703
But now that you're
back hunting yourself,

170
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:33,670
you suddenly have a problem
with the morality of it?

171
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:36,936
You, the legendary hunter?

172
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,470
-That may sound like
a good title to you,

173
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,736
but I wanted no part
of being a legend.

174
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,036
I feel that if I
condone vampire hunting,

175
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,103
I'll be rejecting
Yuki and Zero, as well

176
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:51,836
as all the night class students.

177
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,270
I've killed far
too many vampires

178
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:58,203
to say that I understand them.

179
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:02,370
However, at least I haven't
lost sight of my duty.

180
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:06,036
I'm going to see the
Hunter Society's president,

181
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,103
and I intend to
put an end to this.

182
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,836
-But you have lost sight.

183
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,303
I believe you have work
to do here, headmaster.

184
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:19,503
I'm tired of babysitting kids.

185
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:22,236
It's not my scene.

186
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,303
I am still a vampire hunter.

187
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:27,170
Now, let me show
you what I can do.

188
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:31,903
Besides, that tough talk
doesn't suit you, old man.

189
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:36,636
-Yagari, smoking on school
grounds is strictly prohibited.

190
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:54,687
-First, I thought you were
early risers for vampires.

191
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,127
Now I see you're human guests.

192
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,848
-You've been ignoring
the association.

193
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:01,148
The president is not
happy about that.

194
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:04,215
Just hand over Zero Kiryu,
and we'll all go away.

195
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:05,482
-I won't do it.

196
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,748
[gasp]

197
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,515
-We're not going
back to headquarters

198
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,548
without him, Yagari.

199
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,515
-Well, if that's
what you really want,

200
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:15,148
then you'll have
to come through me.

201
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:24,315
Not bad.

202
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:26,448
The sword's a good choice.

203
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,148
It works on humans
as well as vampires.

204
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,682
-That's enough.

205
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,648
Even if we all take
you on at once,

206
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,182
we won't be able to defeat you.

207
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,948
Yagari, why are you defying
the president's orders?

208
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,815
-Just because the
president gave the order

209
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,015
doesn't make it right.

210
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:49,448
Tell the president that if he
has a problem, he can come here

211
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,615
and discuss it personally.

212
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,715
ZERO (VOICEOVER):
Something is happening.

213
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:08,582
And whatever it is, it's
making the cursed blood

214
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,015
within my body begin to boil.

215
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,782
-Zero--

216
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:16,848
-Just go away.

217
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:18,815
-Zero!

218
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:19,715
-Go away!

219
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:29,082
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I want you
to be the one to kill me.

220
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,548
I didn't know anything.

221
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:35,048
-I'm really glad
nothing happened to you.

222
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,282
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I tried
to protect her, but--

223
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:42,015
-How could I ever hate you?

224
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:46,915
ZERO (VOICEOVER): --the only
thing I feel right now is hate.

225
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:50,715
-I think I was able to live
on because you were beside me.

226
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,182
ZERO (VOICEOVER): But Yuki has--

227
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:54,948
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Because the vampire Yuki

228
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:57,082
completely devoured her.

229
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:58,315
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Already.

230
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:00,048
AIDO: You'll be
able to rest here.

231
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:00,782
It's quiet.

232
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,748
-This room--

233
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:06,448
-I personally guarantee
that it's safe.

234
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:07,982
-A bell?

235
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,348
-Is something wrong?

236
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,515
-No.

237
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,915
-Now rest.

238
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:13,248
I mean, please rest.

239
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:15,615
-There's no way
that I can rest now.

240
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:18,582
I must help Yuri.

241
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:22,182
And everybody else
at the Academy.

242
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:24,248
-I understand.

243
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,182
But please rest.

244
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,948
You've become a vampire now.

245
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:32,882
This is the time you
must get your sleep.

246
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:41,782
-The truth is that Kaname is
the progenitor of the Kurans.

247
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,582
But to me, you're
something quite different.

248
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:48,848
You were my dear
old friend, Kaname.

249
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:51,215
Those are my only
memories of you.

250
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,448
That's why-- Shiki, I'm sorry.

251
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:58,148
I know I should have done this
much sooner, but I didn't.

252
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:01,282
And you ended up in this
state because of it.

253
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,615
I want to stay by
your side, but now I

254
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,082
must go and do
what I have to do.

255
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,782
I must end this curse.

256
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,648
ZERO (VOICEOVER): What's the
point in us meeting again?

257
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:26,448
That arrogant pureblood,
toying with people's emotions.

258
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:29,915
[ringing]

259
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:30,415
-Shizuka.

260
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,615
-You didn't know,
but your existence

261
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:39,015
had quite an effect
on everything.

262
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,648
I began to forget about revenge.

263
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:44,648
I even went so far as
to consider running away

264
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,648
with you to the very
ends of the earth.

265
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,182
This idea is pointless.

266
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:56,215
Even if humans and
vampires could co-exist,

267
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:01,715
their futures would be
the same as his-- hell.

268
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:04,748
I won't share my
feelings with you.

269
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:09,648
Instead, when my life is finally
over, the gift I will give you

270
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,982
is my own flesh and blood.

271
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:15,782
It's a fitting way for two
vampires to share their love.

272
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:27,082
Shall I remain with you?

273
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:28,015
-Sorry.

274
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:30,548
I didn't mean to wake you.

275
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,582
-Kaname, I just--

276
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,115
-What's wrong?

277
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:38,648
-It felt like Shizuka
was just there.

278
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:42,048
KANAME: Ah, well, this
was Shizuka's room.

279
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:43,315
You may have sensed something.

280
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:50,248
YUKI (VOICEOVER): That woman's
emotions, so full of hate,

281
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,948
came rushing.

282
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:54,815
Unable to escape her
fate as a pureblood,

283
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,915
she faded away,
feeling sad and alone.

284
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,082
-What is it, Yuki?

285
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:00,782
You all right?

286
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:08,015
Listen, there's
someplace I must go soon.

287
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,115
I want you to come with me.

288
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,582
-I can't.

289
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,682
I can't leave the Academy.

290
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,915
Can you do that, Kaname?

291
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,482
-Your Artemis should have
made it clear to you.

292
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:22,148
You can no longer
live as a human, Yuki.

293
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:24,148
Not like before.

294
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:26,282
-I don't care.

295
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,815
I will still protect
what is precious to me.

296
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,282
-Listen, Yuki.

297
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,082
I have allowed us
to be parted once.

298
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:36,282
I suffered that pain
for 10 long years.

299
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:41,548
Would you put me
through that again?

300
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,382
SHIKURA (VOICEOVER):
Shall I remain with you?

301
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:49,748
-When the time is right,
I will come for you.

302
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,482
Until then, get some rest.

303
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:53,215
-I'm so sorry.

304
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:54,682
I don't mean to
hurt you, Kaname.

305
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:57,515
I promise.

306
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:58,315
-It's all right.

307
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:01,582
I know that.

308
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:02,348
All too well.

309
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,315
-You don't know when to stop.

310
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,715
You shouldn't defy
Lord Kaname like that.

311
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:10,415
-I know.

312
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,048
I really didn't mean to.

313
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:15,315
I'm just so worried
about everyone.

314
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:17,182
-Like Zero?

315
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,215
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I sense
an arrogant pureblood

316
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,115
who does nothing
but toy with people.

317
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,048
-No, Zero is already--

318
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:40,648
-I was eagerly waiting for
your inevitable resurrection,

319
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:41,582
Lord Rido.

320
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,582
YUKI (VOICEOVER): That
distant, ominous feeling

321
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:51,882
has suddenly become
quite present.

322
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,148
Those sinister eyes.

323
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,948
-I have to go.

324
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:58,215
-Have you already forgotten
what Kaname just told you?

325
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:00,548
-I won't just sit in this
room and let the entire school

326
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,515
be put in danger because of me.

327
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,382
I'm still a guardian
at this Academy.

328
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:05,648
-You're wrong.

329
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,348
You are the pureblood princess.

330
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,482
-I know.

331
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,415
But I've-- I've lived
as a human for so long.

332
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:17,848
Everyone here has helped
me, and I've protected them.

333
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:21,248
If I just turn my
back on that now,

334
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,248
I won't have any idea
how to properly live

335
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,715
my life in the future.

336
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,115
-Perhaps, but you can't
even hold Artemis.

337
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:34,948
-I have a gun.

338
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,648
-Uh-- well, you must be hungry.

339
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,115
-I'm not hungry.

340
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,448
-Yes, you are.

341
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,015
You're hungry.

342
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,982
I have to get you food
because you're so hungry.

343
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:49,682
-Aido, you're--

344
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:50,948
-Enough.

345
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,482
Do not leave this room.

346
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:58,248
I may not be locking the door,
but do not leave this room.

347
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,848
-Aido, what are you--

348
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:05,582
-There's another
pureblood vampire.

349
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:08,082
How ominous.

350
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,548
No.

351
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:10,282
Yuki's different.

352
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,282
What am I saying?

353
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:22,082
-I'm surprised.

354
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:24,515
I thought for a moment
that you were crying.

355
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:26,082
-I don't want to see you.

356
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:26,882
Just leave.

357
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,648
-Ah yes, you must be strong.

358
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:32,182
Otherwise I'll be in trouble.

359
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,515
-Why would you be in trouble?

360
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,715
-It's been a little
over four years,

361
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:39,248
and the pawn I've
carefully nurtured

362
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,648
is now almost able
to devour the king.

363
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:44,682
You're the pawn.

364
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,915
You're going to destroy Rido.

365
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:50,582
The monster just
rose from his coffin.

366
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,182
-Are you crazy?

367
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:53,948
You can do it yourself.

368
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,748
-You want to pretend
like you haven't noticed?

369
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:00,148
What you have so willingly
taken inside yourself

370
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,382
has begun to pulsate.

371
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:06,348
First, you unconsciously
stole the powers of your twin,

372
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:09,582
and as a consequence, you
were born into your family

373
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:12,715
with the power of 1 and
1/2 vampire hunters.

374
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,815
If you had devoured
your twin entirely,

375
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,115
things would have been
a bit easier for you.

376
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,115
-Stop it.

377
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:21,515
-Then Shizuka made
you into a vampire.

378
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,948
Many, many times, you
devoured the blood of Yuki

379
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,415
who was watching
over you tenderly.

380
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,815
-Shut up!

381
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:30,115
-And because she has
awakened, Yuki's blood

382
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:32,448
is now permeating
throughout your body

383
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,382
with the true powers
of Kuran, which

384
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:37,348
I'm sure is coursing
inside you right now.

385
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,582
And then I too
gave you my blood,

386
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:43,615
which contains Shizuka's
blood and powers.

387
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,982
Everything was
done for this day.

388
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,415
Soon, you'll become
the strongest vampire

389
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,248
hunter of all.

390
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:56,248
Only you will be able to
free me from Rido's spell.

391
00:21:56,282 --> 00:22:01,815
-Do you really think I'd lift
a finger to save you, Kaname?

392
00:22:01,848 --> 00:22:05,882
-I know that you
will not betray Yuki.

393
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,382
I'll take Yuki and
leave this Academy.

394
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:11,882
But as long as Rido
exists, he will not stop.

395
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,348
He will keep coming
to devour her.

396
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:17,715
Goodbye.

397
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:34,998
