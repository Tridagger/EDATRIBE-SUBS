1
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,700
-Calling you my nephew kind
of gives me the creeps.

2
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:34,933
The last time we met was a
little over 10 years ago,

3
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,400
right?

4
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,400
You hurt me, Kaname.

5
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:44,566
That day, you shattered my
body until I lost my shape.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
It took 10 years
to regain my form.

7
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:52,800
Well, I suppose I should
thank my pureblood power which

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,433
allowed me to survive.

9
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:58,133
Oh, by the way, thank you
so much for getting rid

10
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,466
of my fiance, Shizuka.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,766
It was a load off my mind.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,533
If I waited around for
her to become obedient

13
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,466
like his mother, I'm
fairly certain that I

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,300
would have waited for
close to an eternity.

15
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm glad to see

16
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:17,266
-That you haven't
changed, Uncle.

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,733
You are still someone
that I want to kill,

18
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,433
and I would never feel the
slightest bit of remorse

19
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:22,933
for it.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,333
-No.

21
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,666
Kaname, stop.

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,300
I'm sorry, but I won't
let you hurt Senri.

23
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,866
I cannot stand by and allow him
to be sacrificed in the battle

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,700
between the two of you?

25
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,666
-So then, should I take
that to mean your allegiance

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,900
lies with the Senate on this?

27
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,466
-Well, you could
interpret it that way.

28
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,366
-I see.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,466
-Kaname can't kill
me, even if he wanted.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,066
Now, for the time being,
I'm going to use his room.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,466
I'm counting on you,
Dorm President Kuran.

32
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,900
[theme music]

33
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,416
[murmuring]

34
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,510
-So you couldn't sleep again?

35
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:07,011
-Yeah, but really I'm all right.

36
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,778
It's just a lack of
sleep, that's all.

37
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,011
-What is-- hey, Akatsuki.

38
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:15,845
-Yeah, what?

39
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:16,378
-See that?

40
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:20,578
AKATSUKI: Senri?

41
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,311
When'd he get back?

42
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,478
And is he with--

43
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,611
HANABUSA: Ichiru Kiryu.

44
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,478
-Wonder what that's all about.

45
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,745
Rima, do you know--

46
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:31,611
-I don't.

47
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,745
-His lover?

48
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:46,211
Kaname Kuran's?

49
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,778
-Yes.

50
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:50,078
-Interesting.

51
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,578
So that's why they've all
agreed to be her bodyguard.

52
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,611
And where's my vial?

53
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:59,111
-I'm afraid it has been lost.

54
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:03,211
-You're not very
useful, are you?

55
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:04,778
-No matter.

56
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,078
It's almost time anyway.

57
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:09,578
Even if we leave her
alone, that girl eventually

58
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,778
will-- however there's
still work to do.

59
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,445
Do your job well,
and I'll make sure

60
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,978
that your little
wish is fulfilled.

61
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:21,511
-Yes, you will
kill those who are

62
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,978
responsible for Shizuka's death.

63
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,278
Therefore, from the
very bottom of my heart,

64
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:30,745
I wish for your real body to be
resurrected, Lord Rido Kuran.

65
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:46,345
-So tell me, Yuki,
how are things

66
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,478
going between you and Kaname?

67
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:51,145
-I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

68
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,478
[gasping]

69
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,811
-Oh no, don't cry.

70
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:55,745
I understand how upsetting
it is that Kaname chose Yuki,

71
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,378
but (SOBBING) we should
be happy for them!

72
00:05:58,411 --> 00:05:59,878
[crying]

73
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:02,511
-Troublesome.

74
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:13,645
-So you still finding ways to
be involved with the Senate?

75
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:16,145
-That's really none of
your business, is it?

76
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:19,778
-Listen, if something
happens to Yuki,

77
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,578
you'll see a
different side of me.

78
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:22,878
-So scary.

79
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,478
-Once every 10 years.

80
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,045
-Is something wrong?

81
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:43,545
-Yuki?

82
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:52,945
-Hey, Akatsuki!

83
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,045
-Senri, what's wrong?

84
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,211
Where have you been
this whole time?

85
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:06,545
-Aren't you bored, cooped
up in here all by yourself?

86
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,745
-Senri, what have you--

87
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:16,345
-I have so much time
on my hands right now.

88
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,478
What do you say?

89
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,178
Let's have a little
fun together.

90
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:19,945
-Stop joking.

91
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,711
-Oh, I wasn't making a joke.

92
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,611
I'm serious.

93
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,345
-Let me go, Senri.

94
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,378
-Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:42,078
You see, I don't have total
control over my power yet.

96
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,645
Did that hurt?

97
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:47,911
If so, I'll try my best
to be gentle next time.

98
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:50,978
-Akatsuki!

99
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,945
-Senri, you bastard.

100
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,011
What were you doing?

101
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,078
-It's pretty obvious.

102
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,145
-Akatsuki, what are you--

103
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,711
-Stop!

104
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,578
Senri, go back to your room.

105
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,278
-So you're ordering
me around now?

106
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,445
-What have you--

107
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,345
-Just who do you think
you're talking to?

108
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:20,345
-I'm sorry.

109
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:24,878
Just please, go on
back to your room.

110
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:29,878
-Well, seeing how you
asked nicely this time.

111
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:30,511
See you around.

112
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:40,345
-Ruka, are you all right?

113
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,945
-Yes.

114
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:46,178
Takuma, what's wrong with Senri?

115
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:49,011
-Why don't you let me try
and deal with him for now.

116
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,311
And please, don't say
anything to Kaname.

117
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,811
-To Lord Kaname.

118
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:53,311
-But he--

119
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:53,811
-Akatsuki.

120
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:00,778
-Fine.

121
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,345
As you wish.

122
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,811
-OK, Ruka?

123
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,278
-Yes.

124
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,545
-I really am sorry
about all this.

125
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,878
-Akatsuki, thank you.

126
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:29,045
-Oh, man.

127
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,511
What is going on around here?

128
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,878
-It's no fun always meeting
up on school grounds.

129
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:38,211
Should we go somewhere tomorrow?

130
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,945
-Kaname, listen, I--

131
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,878
-What's wrong?

132
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,478
-Kaname, you still haven't--
you still haven't answered

133
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,278
my question.

134
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,178
-About what?

135
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:52,711
-I want to know if-- if
somehow or another you

136
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:56,045
are connected to my past.

137
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:58,645
Hanabusa told me something.

138
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,611
He said the only
reason you-- you

139
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,145
made me your lover
was because it

140
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:04,045
was the best way for
you to protect me.

141
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:09,145
As if there's
something-- what are

142
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,945
you trying to protect me from?

143
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,945
Is something going
to happen to me?

144
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:18,245
And does this mean when
you said those words to me,

145
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,345
when you said "I love you"--
come on, Kaname, please.

146
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:26,945
Please answer my question.

147
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,845
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

148
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,578
So much blood.

149
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:37,711
-Yuki, I saw a rare rose that
blooms once every 10 years.

150
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:39,845
It's a rose encased in resin.

151
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:42,578
These roses bloom only
once every 10 years.

152
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:43,645
YUKI (VOICEOVER): No!

153
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,511
JURI (VOICEOVER):
There's only one truth.

154
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,478
-Yuki.

155
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,045
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm scared.

156
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:49,911
Help.

157
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,645
Help me!

158
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,811
JURI (VOICEOVER):
You cannot run away.

159
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,878
There's nowhere to run.

160
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:58,545
-I just-- I just want--

161
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,378
-Yuki, calm down.

162
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,445
Yuki--

163
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:02,311
YUKI (VOICEOVER): No!

164
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,645
JURI (VOICEOVER): You can't run.

165
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:05,878
You can't run.

166
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,045
You can't run.

167
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:08,678
-What's happening?

168
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,778
I don't understand
what's happening.

169
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,554
Who are you to me?

170
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:15,036
How are we connected?

171
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,102
And why do you go to
such lengths to hide it?

172
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,736
Tell me what happened
to me, Kaname.

173
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,474
I just-- I just want to
know what the truth is.

174
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,340
-Yuki, Yuki--

175
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:44,007
-Kana-- Kaname-- tell me, why
is it that when you look at me,

176
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
your eyes are so sad?

177
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:52,507
-It's all right.

178
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,007
I will protect you.

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,540
I promise.

180
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:04,007
-Yuki, it seems that
finally the time has come.

181
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:07,215
Juri.

182
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:13,440
I only hope I have the
strength to protect her.

183
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:34,254
-Senri?

184
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,916
-Dorm President is
trying to protect

185
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,415
Yuki Cross from something.

186
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:44,448
-Ichiru's transfer, then
Takuma, and now Senri.

187
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,048
-That guy--

188
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,315
-Those eyes.

189
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,082
Is that really Senri?

190
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:04,601
-Both of you have had some
really bad experiences

191
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,180
in your life-- I mean, horrible.

192
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,546
So the last thing I want--

193
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,613
-Wake up.

194
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:18,986
Wake up and give your
blood to the monster

195
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,219
who sleeps in this casket.

196
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,752
-It's almost time.

197
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,386
Very soon, it will
be in my possession.

198
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,219
And when it is, I will then
make a full resurrection.

199
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:46,386
As you know, when that child
awakens from her slumber,

200
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,552
her sweet dreams will
then turn into nightmares.

201
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,786
And her ferocious
fangs will start

202
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:54,952
destroying her from the inside.

203
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:58,486
And I won't even have
to lift a finger.

204
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,386
She'll wake up no
matter what I do.

205
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,119
And then, with her blood--

206
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:07,252
-Rido, don't delude
yourself for even a second.

207
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:09,586
Your filthy hands
will never touch her.

208
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,686
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
It's all right, Yuki.

209
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,686
All that I ask is that
you just be yourself.

210
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,386
-No!

211
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:50,886
No!

212
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,819
-Yuki, are you awake?

213
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,152
-Ze-- ro?

214
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,152
-Are you all right?

215
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:45,386
-Why-- why aren't
you fighting back?

216
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,886
-Yuki, I told you, you can do
whatever you want with my life.

217
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,619
-Because you think that
I'm your victim, Zero?

218
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:56,619
-You're wrong.

219
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,052
You're so naive.

220
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:00,419
Can't you see that I'm the
one you can never escape from,

221
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,219
Zero?

222
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:07,586
I'm the one who's forced you to
play along with my selfishness.

223
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,952
All this time, me
being your only ally,

224
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:13,786
doing everything I could
possibly do for you.

225
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:18,119
I was only doing those
things for myself.

226
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:22,619
I thought if I could pretend
I was indispensable to you,

227
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:27,419
then it wouldn't matter if
I didn't have my own past.

228
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:30,719
Yes, I did it all for myself.

229
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:31,219
Otherwise--

230
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,419
-Do you think my heart will grow
stronger if I become a vampire?

231
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,519
--I would've never
said something

232
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:42,019
that I really shouldn't have.

233
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:45,186
ZERO: Yuki, you're
not making any sense.

234
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,719
It sounds as if
you're desperately

235
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:51,852
saying that you
really do need me.

236
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,486
But you're wrong, Yuki.

237
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,052
The only one you really
need is Kaname Kuran,

238
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,552
and it has been that way
from the very beginning.

239
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,552
Something is wrong with you.

240
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:15,352
-(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry, Zero.

241
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:17,719
-You really all right?

242
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,886
-I've been hallucinating,
and it makes me act weird.

243
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,619
I'm really sorry.

244
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:23,986
You should leave now.

245
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:28,086
I need to change out
of this nightgown, OK?

246
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,286
-Are you sure you're all right?

247
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,152
-Yes, I promise you
I'm perfectly fine.

248
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:33,719
Thank you.

249
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,219
Bye.

250
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:18,586
[sobbing]

251
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:31,352
ZERO: Kaname, I
want to know what

252
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:33,219
you intend to do with Yuki.

253
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:35,252
-You will not betray her.

254
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,186
-Red snow.

255
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:11,152
The world is dyed in blood,
and I can't see anything else.

256
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,052
I tried.

257
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,286
I tried my best to remember.

258
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,986
-Yuki, stop.

259
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,319
That's enough.

260
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:24,486
It's time that you wake
up before you go mad.

261
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:38,819
YUKI (VOICEOVER): It's cold,
but somehow I feel warm.

262
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:49,752
-Kaname, what are you-- Kaname,
what is buried in my neck?

263
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,052
-Yuki.

264
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,319
Please, only you.

265
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,819
-What the--

266
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:51,886
-This is--

267
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,119
-That blood smells
like-- but it can't be.

268
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:08,119
YUKI (VOICEOVER): This
taste, it's Kaname's blood.

269
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:21,486
Have you woken, Yuki?

270
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,986
Do you remember who I am?

271
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:34,600
-You're my--

272
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,257
ZERO: I know that smell.

273
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,757
It's Yuki's blood.

274
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,257
However--

275
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:47,791
-Zero--

276
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,657
-Now I sense two vampires.

277
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:51,857
Kaname, you've turned Yuki.

278
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:53,357
-No, stop it, Zero.

279
00:21:53,391 --> 00:22:01,324
This man, he's-- he's
my-- my older brother.

280
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:04,824
I'm-- I'm so sorry, Zero.

281
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:17,624
-You're-- siblings?

282
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,057
-That's right.

283
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:21,624
However, if I were truly
born her older brother,

284
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,157
then I would have
been much happier.
