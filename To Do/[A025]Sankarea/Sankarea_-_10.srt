sealed the deal by now.

started decaying,

that 15-year-old girl

177
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,541
and asked for her
hand in marriage.

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,041
The Sanka family
was shocked, of course.

179
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,708
As were all the other maids

180
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,416
who had served him in
the hopes of winning his heart.

181
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,208
Apparently, proper social
standing meant nothing.

182
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,500
He pushed us aside and chose
that child to be his wife.

183
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,041
And let me guess, that girl was
Rea's real mother, wasn't she?

184
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,333
The Sanka family fiercely
opposed the marriage.

185
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,166
They were determined
to talk some sense

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
into their befuddled heir.

187
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,375
But Dan'ichiro
had made his decision

188
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,208
and there was nothing they
could say to change his mind.

189
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,458
Her social status is an issue?

190
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,041
You are the Sanka family heir!

191
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,541
You can't marry a girl
from an unknown family!

192
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,375
In that case, I shall
renounce my position as heir.

193
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,125
By doing so, I'll be free
to marry whomever I choose.

194
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,375
Please think about what
you're saying, Dan'ichiro.

195
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,875
You're being ridiculous!

196
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,500
You would
abandon your own family

197
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,250
just to be with that cripple?

198
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,416
That "cripple"?

199
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,958
You'd better watch
your mouth from now on.

200
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,375
I won't have anyone
disrespecting her.

201
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,750
I understand you're
upset with my decision

202
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,458
to forsake the Sanka family
in the name of love.

203
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,083
However I will not tolerate

204
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,666
anyone insulting
my future wife in such a manner!

205
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,666
Once his relatives
had been silenced,

206
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,833
Dan'ichiro went on
to marry the girl.

207
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,583
Unfortunately, she passed
away soon after Rea was born.

208
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
Dan'ichiro fell
into a deep depression.

209
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,500
He couldn't sleep or eat.

210
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,500
I knew something had to
be done or he would die.

211
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,291
I did everything
I could to bear him up,

212
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,625
and gradually
he began to recover.

213
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:36,000
Dan'ichiro rewarded my diligence
by asking me to be his wife.

214
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,500
I became more
and more despondent

215
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,208
as each of our wedding
anniversaries passed.

216
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:53,291
In all that time, Dan'ichiro had
yet to look upon me as his wife.

217
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,166
What does that mean exactly?

218
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,791
You're as dumb
as you look, aren't you?

219
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,916
It means that he never
made love to me.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,208
It didn't take
me long to realize.

221
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,541
The only reason he married
me in the first place

222
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
is because Rea needed a mother.

223
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,125
But she didn't.

224
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,083
Her father was hands-on and did
everything for his little girl.

225
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,541
There was nothing for me
to do but sit and watch them.

226
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,750
I was always on the outside

227
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,083
watching the two of them
from a distance.

228
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,041
I never felt as though
I was a member of their family.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,458
What is it now, Aria?

230
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,750
I was wondering if we
could go on a vacation.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,625
Well, we never had a honeymoon,

232
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,625
and we don't get
to spend much time together.

233
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,625
I thought it'd be nice.

234
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,083
Yes, it would be.

235
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,458
Now that you mention it,

236
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,958
I've always thought
it would be good

237
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,041
for Rea to start traveling
at an early young age.

238
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041
Wait, we have to take
her along with us?

239
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,208
Well, of course.

240
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,291
Why wouldn't we?

241
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,166
Despite the evidence
to the contrary.

242
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,250
I honestly believed
Dan'ichiro had chosen me

243
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,708
to be his second
wife out of love.

244
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,208
Look at me, Daddy!

245
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,791
Mama!

246
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,625
I want a picture with you,
me, and Daddy together!

247
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,666
That's fine with me.

248
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,916
I believed Dan'ichiro's
love for Rea was no different

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,833
than the love any father
would feel for his daughter.

250
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,041
But I was wrong.

251
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,083
Would you mind telling me
why you've asked me here?

252
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,333
I'm getting impatient.

253
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,333
Well? Answer me.

254
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,875
It's not my place,

255
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,083
but I thought that I should give
you some advice, Madam Aria.

256
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,958
You're wasting
your time trying to win

257
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,958
Master Dan'ichiro's affections.

258
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,083
His heart already
belongs to another.

259
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,125
What are you talking about?

260
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,625
I must ask that you
not raise your voice, ma'am.

261
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,041
I don't want the master to hear.

262
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,208
It's a pretty blanket, Daddy!

263
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,416
This is how
I'd like you to pose, okay?

264
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,166
Keep your feet pointed.

265
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,583
Yes, sir!

266
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,083
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way, Madam.

267
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,125
I was disgusted with him.

268
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,500
I knew exactly
why he was doing it.

269
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,208
Because he couldn't
let go of the love

270
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,083
that he felt for his first wife!

271
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,875
Everybody thinks that
vapid girl is my daughter.

272
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:38,875
When in truth, the sight
of her makes my stomach turn.

273
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,916
As if her old man
weren't bad enough.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,250
Rea had to deal with
this basket case, too.

275
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Well, now that you've
heard my side of the story

276
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,541
you understand what
a tragic life I've led.

277
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,666
I haven't been touched in ages,

278
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,666
but now that you're
here we can change that.

279
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,750
Yeah.

280
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,333
Feels good, doesn't it?

281
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:10,041
You can't get this kind of body
heat from your dead girlfriend.

282
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:15,541
Uh.

283
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,083
I'm real sorry about that.

284
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,291
But I'm afraid I'm only
interested in zombie girls.

285
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:32,166
What is it about
that little bitch?

286
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
She's not half the woman I am!

287
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,291
Why won't anyone
pay attention to me?

288
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,458
How the hell did you
get in here, kitty?

289
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,000
Dan'ichiro would die if he knew

290
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,208
there was a cat in
the mansion but who cares?

291
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,291
I could use a friend right now.

292
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,583
Sweet, kitty.

293
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,666
You wanna live with me?

294
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,250
That sweet kitty's
a zombie, too.

295
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,958
Someone get these
troublemakers out of here!

296
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,541
I will not have them
playing with my emotions!

297
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,541
If I'm free to leave,
I'd be happy to get out of here;

298
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
I just need someone to untie me.

299
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,541
I'm sorry, but that's
not going to happen.

300
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,458
Master Dan'ichiro
is expecting you.

301
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,000
You think I care?

302
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,208
Who the hell does
your boss think

303
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,750
he is kidnapping me
and holding me hostage?

304
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
Huh?

305
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,125
Being the head of
the Sanka family

306
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,708
may give him more power
than the general population.

307
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,416
But no matter
how powerful he is,

308
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,666
he still isn't above the law.

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,875
Thanks for helping me out.

310
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,291
Hey, while you're at it,
would ya mind untying me?

311
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,500
Sorry, no can do.

312
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,625
Didn't think so.

313
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,791
Lucky you.

314
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,500
I'll admit, I'm jealous.

315
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,875
He's asked that
you spend time with him.

316
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,791
He never asked me.

317
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,041
I'm his wife and yet he would

318
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,791
rather spend time talking
to you than to me.

319
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,041
Um, excuse me,
could you please

320
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,291
turn the air conditioner up
as high as it'll go?

321
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,750
Sure thing.

322
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,041
I didn't think it was
all that warm out.

323
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,333
I just know those brutes
were sent by Father.

324
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,458
Who else would want
to kidnap Chihiro?

325
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,708
I've got to save him
before it's too late!

326
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,541
I'm sorry sir, but could
you go a little faster?

327
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,208
Whatever you say, miss.

328
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,666
I'm startin' to wonder if this
girl even has cash on her.

329
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,416
Please wait here, Mr. Furuya.

330
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,750
Why do I have to wait?

331
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,166
I thought "Master Dan'ichiro"
was expecting me.

332
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,416
Yes, he will be
with you momentarily.

333
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,583
Huh?

334
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,625
Hey! Come back!

335
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,666
I took these stunning
photographs myself.

336
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,458
Sick bastard.

337
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,666
I wish I could credit their
beauty to my photography,

338
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,083
but I had little to do with it.

339
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,958
I'm inspired by my subject.

340
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,583
Rea is a dazzling light
in a dark world.

341
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,375
innocence personified.

342
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,333
There is nothing
that terrifies me more

343
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,750
than the thought of losing her.

344
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:56,291
But, thanks to you,
I had quite an epiphany.

345
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,833
I had to lose her to realize
how much her love means to me.

346
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,083
I'm more determined than ever to
protect her from cads like you.

347
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,208
I'll prove that I'm
the only man she needs!

348
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,750
Thank you.

349
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,833
I'm grateful.

350
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,833
But you will pay for this.

351
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,750
Chihiro Furuya!

352
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,250
Okay, enough with
the temper tantrums.

353
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,125
Pull yourself
together and get with it.

354
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,083
Work is work.

355
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,916
You've already accepted the job

356
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,666
so it's not like you
can pout your way out of it.

357
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,750
Fine, I'll start.

358
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,500
Next time on Sankarea,

359
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,541
Episode 11,
"Nothing... Really...

360
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,000
Special." There, I did it.

361
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:21,291
If you're not gonna do it
right then why even bother?

362
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,416
At least give 'em your
"tune in to see Mero" line!
