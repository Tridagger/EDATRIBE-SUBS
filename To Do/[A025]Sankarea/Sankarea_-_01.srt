There's just
something about 'em.

31
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,291
[MOGI] Well, recent
studies suggest that men

are attracted to
vulnerable women;

33
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,666

from him far too soon.

popped into my head.

108
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,416
I went to visit a relative
in Tohoku last year

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,083
and as we were
sorting through stuff

110
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,250
to donate to a local museum,

111
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,875
I came across something amazing.

112
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,166
It wasn't really a book per se,
more like a collection of notes.

113
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,125
It was so beat up I couldn't
even tell when it was written.

114
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,750
The museum's curator told us
it wasn't worth anything,

115
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,208
but after skimming through it

116
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,666
I was sure they were notes
on the reanimation process.

117
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,125
I knew it was probably
a load of bull,

118
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,166
but I figured it couldn't
hurt to give it a try.

I chose an abandoned hotel
as my lab.

come looking for me here.

to be put to the test.

[YASUTAKA] I knew
you weren't listening!

154
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
I was talking about
how our school's

155
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,041
different from
Sanka Girl's.

156
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,083
Well, I can think of
one glaring difference.

157
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,166
Sanka Academy students
are some of the brightest

158

Meanwhile, the boys
at our school

160
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,875
are a bunch of
dopey schmucks.

161

I know they're superior
to us in every way

162
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,458
but why do we have to take
different routes to school?

163
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Maybe cuz Sanka's on the
opposite side of the river?

164
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,458
But they're so far away!

The only reason I came to Shiyo

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
was I thought I'd meet a nice
young lady, or two, or three.

00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,333
Look, there she is!

176
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,583
You see that girl
with the long, black hair?

177
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,625
She's the daughter of the
Sanka Girls' Academy director.

178
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,500
Rea Sanka!

179
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,375
Wow, you guys have no
idea what you're missing.

180
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,916
She's beauty and
elegance personified.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,916
And her family
is stinkin' loaded,

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,291
so when we get married
I won't ever to work again!

183
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,666
[CHIHIRO] She's her
own person, ya know.

184
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,458
Oh, Come on!

185
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,666
Don't tell me you wouldn't

186
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,000
wanna follow in your
rich parents' footsteps?

187
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,541
[RANKO] Delivery!

188
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,541
Thanks for swinging by, Ranko.

189
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,666
[DO'ON] I really appreciate it.

190
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,958
Mero's at a school function so
I had to improvise for dinner.

191
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,583
You just say the word
and I'll be right over, Uncle.

192
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,750
It's nice to get a break
from the restaurant and Mom.

193
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,333
[DO'ON laughing]

194
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,125
I bet it is.

195
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,333
It's so quiet.

196
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,750
Where's Chihiro?
[DO'ON sighs]

197
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,750
Probably lying down
in his room again.

198
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,333
Is he okay?

199
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,916
Well, I'm no psychologist but I
get the feeling he's depressed.

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,958
I would be too if
I lost my best friend.

201
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,000
Aw, he misses Babu.

202
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,583
Wakey, wakey!

203
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,625
[CHIHIRO grumbles]

204
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,000
What do you
want, "Wanko"?

205
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,041
Oh please,
don't get up.

206
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,083
Here ya go.

207
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,541
Oh right, I forgot
I lent this to you.

208
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,000
That's not the only thing
you forgot, short bus.

209
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,791
You promised you'd
come to my place

210
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,875
over the weekend
to pick it up.

211
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,541
[CHIHIRO chuckles]

213
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,041
I'm sorry, I had a busy weekend.

214
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,125
You expect me
to believe that?

215
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,000
You were sittin' here
watching movies alone

216
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,583
when you could've
watched 'em with me!

217
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,458
[CHIHIRO wails]

218
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,125
Hey, can I ask ya
something, Wanko?

219
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,208
That would be miss to you.

220
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,958
Fine, Miss Wanko.

221
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,833
What's up?

222
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,875
Is there a girl at your
school named Rea Sanka?

223
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,416
Well, yeah.

224
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,208
Why do you ask?

225
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,875
I was wondering if she's cool.

226
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,375
I couldn't tell ya.

227
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,708
I don't know know her but
she's the director's daughter

228
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,958
so she's kinda hard to miss.

229
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
She's okay I guess.

230
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,291
Why the sudden interest?

231
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,500
Don't tell me you've got the
hots for her, you horndog!

232
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,583
It's not like that!

233
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,041
I was just asking
a simple question!

234
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,000
Yasutaka was making
a big deal about her.

235
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,250
I thought you were in here
sulking 'cause Babu died,

236
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,250
but you're just daydreaming
about some chick!

237
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,291
No, that's not true!
Would you let go of me already?

238
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,125
Okay. Guess I'll
catch you later.

239
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,458
Bye.

240
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,083
You'd better not forget to
come by again this weekend.

241
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,458
Who knows what'll happen.

242
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,458
I might decide to
have my way with you!

243
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,208
[RANKO giggles]

244
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,208
She's insane.

245
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,541
And bring another
zombie movie for me to borrow!

246
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,583
Just take one with you now!

247
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,583
See you this weekend!

248
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,541
Ranko Saoji is my cousin.

249
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,458
She works for her
family's restaurant

250
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,791
and she's a sophomore
at Sanka Academy.

251
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,666
Geez, why does she like playing
the "bossy older sister,"

252
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,333
she's only a few
months older than me.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,583
So he's got a thing
for Rea Sanka...

254
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,541
[wind rustling
and birds chirping]

255
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,708
Uh-oh.

256
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,333
Probably would've been
smart to make a copy first.

257
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,125
The book is incredibly fragile,

258
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,375
and there's a page
that's unreadable.

259
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,750
It's calling for some
kind of poisonous plant,

260
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,125
but its name is
completely blacked out.

261
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
I tried using water hemlock

262
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,958
the night before
but that didn't work.

263
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,166
'kay, here's hoping
this one'll do the trick.

264
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,083
I feel bad carrying
Babu around in a cooler.

265
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,750
If I can't get this to
work by the weekend.

266
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,541
I'm gonna bury him.

267
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,541
[footsteps]

268
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,583
[CHIHIRO gasps]

269
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,250
Here we go again.

270
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,958
[REA screams]

271
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,500
[REA panting]

272
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,791
What did I do to deserve this?

273
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:20,208
I wish I was never born
into the Sanka family!

274
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,416
I just want to
be a normal teenager.

275
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,666
I want to be able
to have friends

276
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,208
and go out like
other girls my age.

277
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,458
It's not fair
you're so overprotective.

278
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,125
I've always been
the perfect daughter

279
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,833
so why can't you trust me?

280
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm not a baby anymore.

281
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,458
--I'm in high school!
--[CHIHIRO] Man...

282
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,583
--I'm practically grown!
--The poor girl.

283
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,250
It sounds like her parents
are pretty hard on her.

284
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,291
I follow your rules.

285
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,666
I do everything you tell me.

286
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,166
And I've kept your secret.

287
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,166
Even though it hurts.

288
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,208
I don't care if you're just

289
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,833
trying to commemorate
my growth, Father!

290
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,250
I don't like you taking naked
pictures of me on my birthday!

[REA gasps]

292
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,958
[CHIHIRO] Uhh...

293
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,666
[REA whimpers]

294
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,875
[raining]

295
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:26,458
[awkward silence]

296
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,500
Now what'll I do?

297
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:35,708
So... it's really
comin' down, isn't it?

298
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,750
Please!

299
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,916
Don't tell anyone
what you heard!

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,750
I'm begging you!

301
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,041
I'll do anything!

302
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,000
Nobody knows.

303
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
He'd be so angry.

304
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
Promise you won't tell?

305
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,666
Okay, I promise.

306
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,750
But can I talk about the stuff
that I heard last night?

307
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,708
[REA screams]

308
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,375
You heard what I said at
the well yesterday, too?

309
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,416
Yeah. I probably shouldn't
have mentioned that, huh?

310
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
I wish I could
just curl up and die.

311
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,291
I'd be better off that way.

312
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,958
Maybe I could come
back as someone else

313
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,875
and live a happy life.

314
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,708
Things at home might be tough
but it's not worth dying over.

315
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,041
I don't wanna sound insensitive
but it's kinda nice

316
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:28,958
to know you trust fund
kids have it hard, too.

317
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,916
We think
you've got it easy

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,416
just because
you're wealthy.

319
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,625
I can only imagine what it's
like to have overbearing parents

320
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,708
constantly shoving rules and
etiquette down your throat.

321
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,083
If I had to deal
with that crap

322
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,000
I bet I'd be out there
screaming my head off with you.

323
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,333
So what brings you here?

324
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,500
Are you trying to escape
your troubles like I am?

325
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,875
Oh no, no,
no, no, no.

326
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,291
[REA] No way! You're bringing
him back from the dead?

327
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,500
That's amazing.

328
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,541
Are you sure it's
going to work?

329
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,375
It hasn't yet
but I'll keep trying.

330
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,541
I don't know what to expect,

331
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,375
but even if he comes
back as a zombie

332
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,583
it's better than not
having him around.

333
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,375
I guess so...

334
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,041
I don't think Babu's
gonna be too jazzed

335
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,666
about joining the
legion of the undead

336
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,375
but I'm hoping he won't
hold it against me.

337
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,875
I know it's selfish but...

338
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,000
I just want my little buddy
to be part of my life again.

339
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,666
It's a win-win situation.

340
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,000
I get Babu
back and he gets...

341
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,666
Now that I think about it,

342
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,083
maybe it'd be better for
both of us if I gave up.

343
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:23,958
No!

344
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,166
You can't give up
on Babu yet!

345
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,333
I'm sure he'd be
happy to see you!

346
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,500
Even if it meant he
had to become a zombie.

347
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,125
Well, that's one way
to convince me.

348
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,291
I just realized you never
told me your name.

349
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,375
Oh.
It's Chihiro.

350
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,416
I'm Rea.
Nice to meet you.

351
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,833
Don'tcha mean
"nice knowin' ya"?

352
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,708
I didn't think you'd
be sticking around.

353
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh... Actually, I was
wondering if it'd be okay

354
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,708
for me to come
back tomorrow.

355
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,708
Huh? You for real?

356
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,416
Why would a proper
lady like you

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
wanna help out a
nerdy guy like me?

358
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,583
I've always wanted a pet

359
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,416
but my father won't allow it
because he's a germaphobe.

360
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
If this works and we bring Babu
back to life,

361
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,333
it'll be the closest I've ever
been to having a furry friend.

362
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
Oh, I mean...

363
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,541
He's your cat but I hope
you'll let me play with him.

364
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,791
Well, maybe.

365
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
Earlier you said you
would do anything I want.

366
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,708
Remember?

367
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,333
Yeah... I remember.

368
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
You wanna play with Babu?

369
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,750
Then prove your loyalty,

370
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,500
by acting as the test
subject for the potion.

371
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,458
You... want me
to drink it?

372
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,958
That's right.
Didn't you say you wanted to die

373
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,416
and come back as someone else?

374
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,458
This is your chance
to become... a zombie.

375
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,833
Ha! I was only kidding!

376
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,250
[REA whimpers]

377
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,750
Man, I had no idea
you were so gullible!

378
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,791
You really shouldn't believe

379
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,166
everything you're
told, princess.

380
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,333
I'm telling you.

381
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,458
Guys can smell
naivety a mile away.

382
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,625
And I know plenty of dudes

383
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,458
who would love to take
advantage of you.

384
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,000
Well how would I know that?

385
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,458
I've never been on...

386
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,916
I, uh...

387
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,333
I've never been on a date with
a boy before.

388
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,625
Well, not yet.

389
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
But I don't need protecting!

390
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,541
Quit treating me like
I'm a little girl!

391
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,625
The princess of Sanka Academy's
never had a boyfriend?

392
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,875
I want to, but I can't.

393
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,083
It's my father.

394
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:23,875
Fine, you win.

395
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,250
All right,
what about you?

396
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,541
What about me?

397
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,333
Uh... well, have you ever
had a girlfriend before?

398
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,333
I haven't met
the right girl.

399
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,500
You don't have any
right to tease me

400
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,500
about never
having a boyfriend

401
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,916
when you've never
had a girlfriend!

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,166
I don't want one.

403
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,583
I have no interest in
dating regular girls.

404
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,083
Why's that?

405
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,625
My heart has been stolen by
the beauties of the undead.

406
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,166
What?

407
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,416
I know you think
I'm joking, but I'm not.

408
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,166
They're just the only
ones who do it for me.

409
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,000
I've loved 'em ever since
I was a little boy.

410
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,041
I would totally have
a girlfriend right now

411
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,166
if I could
find a zombie girl.

412
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,833
But they don't exist
so what can ya do?

413
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,500
Call me crazy,
but I refuse to give up hope.

414
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,583
I mean, you
never know, right?

415
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,333
What's the matter?

416
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:13,750
You feeling inferior?

417
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,791
[REA] Chihiro...
[CHIHIRO] Hmm?

418
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,791
I'll do whatever it takes,

419
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,291
as long as you promise
whenever I become a zombie

420
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,958
you'll take
good care of me.

421
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
[CHIHIRO gasps]

422
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,625
Well, uh...

423
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,833
[REA chuckles]

424
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,708
Silly boy.

425
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,375
You really shouldn't believe
everything you're told.

426
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,333
I should head home
before it gets too late.

427
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,791
Goodnight.

428
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,166
Damn, I can't believe she turned
the tables on me like that.

429
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,791
Oh, Chihiro?

430
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,875
Just wanted to say, thanks
again for letting me help you.

431
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,375
See you tomorrow. 'Kay?

432
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,875
[REA giggles]

433
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,833
[CHIHIRO] At that moment,
I never could have imagined...

434
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,416
That the
beautiful girl in front of me?

435
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,041
[REA]
Chihiro... Please...

436
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,916
Help me. 

437
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,083
[CHIHIRO] Would eventually
become a zombie.

438
00:23:58,791 --> 00:23:59,708
What?

439
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,583
You want me to
read the preview?

440
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,916
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,291
Especially not
with this script.

442
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,958
Would you mind if I
had a quick word

443
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,250
with the writer
before we record?

444
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,750
Oh, we're already
recording?

445
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,875
I see.

446
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,375
Okay then, here goes nothing.

447
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,250
Next time on Sankarea,

448
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,125
Episode 2,
"It Was... Successful."

449
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,791
Tune in to see Mero!

450
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,041
I feel like I don't
even know you anymore.
