00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,958
[CHIHIRO]
Ever since that day,

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:31,041
I can't help but ask myself
if this is really for the best.

3
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,625
[DAN'ICHIRO]
I have decided

4
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,666
I shall leave
my daughter in your care.

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,875
[CHIHIRO] I'm happy that
Rea finally has her freedom,

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,458
but now that her creepy
dad's left her here with me.

7
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,875
I can feel the weight
of that responsibility

8
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,875
bearing down on me
like a ton of bricks.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,708
[JOGORO] No!

10
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,416
Mero, why is there slimy green
stuff floating in my miso soup?

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Calm down.

12
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,166
Those are just
green peppers, Grandpa.

13
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,208
Well, I'll be damned.

14
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,416
Mero?

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,916
Is something wrong, Father?

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,208
Rea's dinner looks interesting.

17
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,833
What is it?

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,458
Lady Rea has a taste for leafy
greens of the poisonous variety.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,333
She requested boiled
hydrangea leaves.

20
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,583
Stir-fried hydrangea leaves.

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,708
And hydrangea leaf
broth for dinner.

22
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,416
I've never had
them, are they good?

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,791
I wouldn't know, I simply
followed brother's directions.

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,500
Even though it hurt
my heart to do so.

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,625
Mero just doesn't like
cooking for a vegetarian.

26
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,291
Since when are hydrangea
leaves considered vegetables?

27
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,416
I can always just
go eat by myself

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
so my diet won't be a
distraction at the dinner table.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,958
Oh no, it's not a distraction,

30
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,875
I was just asking
out of curiosity.

31
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,166
Geez, would you
cut it out, Dad.

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,875
Why do you have to be so nosy?

33
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,416
I'm sorry, I've just never heard

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,541
of anyone eating
hydrangea leaves for dinner.

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,250
There's no need to apologize.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,666
I understa--

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,333
Kiyo?

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,250
Kiyo!

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,666
When Grandpa goes cuckoo,

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,416
just hold your arm out and
he'll clothesline himself.

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,750
Um, okay.

42
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,500
Our quirkiness isn't going
to scare you off, is it?

43
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,750
No, sir.

44
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,708
[CHIHIRO] What have
I gotten myself into?

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
This is brutal.

46
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,166
I can tell Dad and
Mero are freaked out

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,875
that Rea's been
left in my care,

48
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,250
but they're not gonna say

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,958
anything because
they're too nice.

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,083
I never realized it'd be so

51
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
difficult to care
for another person.

52
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,875
Especially a zombie.

53
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,916
Hey.

54
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,708
What's up?

55
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,125
I know it's not much,

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,083
but I'm afraid that this
is the best I can do

57
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,833
considering your
current "condition."

58
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,333
It's okay.

59
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,708
I just wish.

60
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,041
I could take you someplace
nicer than this, y'know?

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,458
No need to beat
yourself up about it.

62
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,416
I'm having a great time.

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,875
When I was living at home,

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
my father would never let
me do things like this.

65
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
Are you serious?

66
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,250
Oh, yeah!

67
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey Chihiro?

68
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,208
Check it out!

69
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,291
There's a fireworks
show tomorrow night.

70
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
Yeah, they do that every year.

71
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,791
I've never actually
seen it, though.

72
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,458
But it's so pretty!

73
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,666
I've only ever seen
it from my window

74
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,000
but I've always wanted
to see it up close.

75
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,500
I think it would be thrilling

76
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,541
to watch the fireworks
explode overhead.

77
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,500
Do you wanna go?

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,958
Yeah, I'd love to!

79
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,416
Well, it's not gonna
start until after dark,

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,625
so yeah, I guess it's okay.

81
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,166
Thanks, Chihiro!

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
I don't want to ruin
this opportunity

83
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,208
so I'll do everything
in my power

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,666
to keep my body from decaying
before tomorrow night!

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,458
Calm down, it's not gonna
happen that quickly!

86
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,083
I can't believe you're gettin'
all worked up over fireworks.

87
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,458
What are you, a child?

88
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,791
Yeah, we both are!

89
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,500
So don't act like
you're better than me!

90
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,958
Whoa, I never
said that, did I?

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
I've researched
different methods

92
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,875
of preserving dead bodies,

93
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,875
such as embalming or
evisceration,

94
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,666
but I haven't found anything
that'll work in this situation.

95
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,791
I shouldn't be surprised.

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,458
It's not like I'm gonna
find a hypotheses

97
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,166
on how to keep a zombie from
decaying at the local library.

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
Hey, are you coming
upstairs with me?

99
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,083
I'll be up in a bit.

100
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,208
The only person I can turn to
right now is Grandpa, but...

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
How'm I supposed
to preserve Rea's body

102
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,250
and make sure
she's enjoying herself?

103
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,333
Brother, why are
you up at this hour?

104
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,291
Just.

105
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,666
Checking on Grandpa.

106
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,166
I've been meaning to ask you.

107
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Do you know when Lady Rea
plans on returning to school?

108
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,083
Don't have a clue.

109
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,041
but I don't think she's
ready to go back just yet.

110
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,541
And may I ask why not?

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,958
Well, because she's got some
health complications, okay?

112
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,750
I didn't notice that there
was anything wrong with her.

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
It's not somethin' you'd notice,

114
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,041
but I'm tellin' ya,
on the inside, she's a big mess.

115
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:05,500
If that's true, why'd she stop
me on my way out this morning?

116
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,541
"Are you going to school?

117
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,125
I'm so jealous, Mero" she said.

118
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,625
Dunno.

119
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,833
If she's ill she could leave
early or go every other day.

120
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,416
There's no reason
to keep her from going.

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,458
You've got a point but
I don't think it's a good idea.

122
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,916
So you're going to force Lady
Rea to stay at home from now on.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,791
Is that it?

124
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,208
It's not fair for me to keep
her from going to school.

125
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,916
In fact, it makes me
no different

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,208
than the father she despises.

127
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,500
All she wants is to be
treated like a normal girl,

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,083
but that's a lot
easier said than done

129
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,833
when you're dealing
with a zombie.

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,416
As if mother nature
was trying to echo my mood,

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,000
the fireworks show
was called off, due to rain.

132
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,791
It was cancelled, huh?

133
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,666
I guess there's
nothing we can do about it.

134
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,208
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

135
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,291
It's not your fault so
why are you apologizing?

136
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,791
I just felt like it.

137
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,750
I don't get you sometimes.

138
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,916
Chihiro.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,458
I know this is farfetched but
if I'm still around next year,

140
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,083
I would love to see it with you.

141
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,583
We'll make it a date, okay?

142
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
You know, I still can't believe
they cancelled the fireworks.

143
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,416
I'm pissed that
I didn't get to hang out

144
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,458
with a bevy
of beauties in yukatas.

145
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,666
As far as I'm concerned,
that's a huge life experience

146
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,458
for a red-blooded high-schooler

147
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,833
to miss out on
'cause of a little rain.

148
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,916
What do you think Mogi?

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
I think this has
less to do with yukatas

150
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
and more with
you being a horn dog.

151
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
Oh, gimme a break,

152
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,250
you know you
were lookin' forward

153
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,583
to it too, ya little fink!

154
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,666
It would've been nice
to see 'em all dolled up.

155
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,166
You agree with me,
dontcha Furuya?

156
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,000
Uh.

157
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,166
What are you talkin' about?

158
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,666
There are Sanka girls
dressed in yukatas

159
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,833
dancing around in
your head right now, huh?

160
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,250
No, because I'm not a perv.

161
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
Hey, wait up!

162
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,166
Good mornin' Chihiro!

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,875
What do you want, Wanko?

164
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,583
What's got your panties
in a bunch?

165
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,166
I dunno. Your presence?

166
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,875
Please don't tell me
you and your lady friend

167
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
are on the rocks already?

168
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you really think
I would tell you if I was?

169
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,041
Aw, c'mon!

170
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,875
Why don'tcha
tell me all about it

171
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,791
and I'll try to ease
your pain, you poor boy!

172
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,458
Gotta admit, I'm jealous.

173
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,333
Wow, you really will
take it any way you can get it.

174
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,208
I suppose there's
no denying it, is there?

175
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,875
You were gonna go
watch the fireworks?

176
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,583
Yeah, Rea was really
looking forward to seeing it.

177
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,291
I was looking forward
to seeing it, too.

178
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,541
In fact... I was hoping
we could go together.

179
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,625
There's always next year.

180
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,000
Here's an idea.

181
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,041
Why don't we all put on
a fireworks show of our own?

182
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,416
Lady Rea.

183
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,125
I don't know if
this is a good idea.

184
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,375
Brother's gonna be upset

185
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,000
when he finds out
you've been helping me.

186
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,208
Don't worry.

187
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm sure that he won't mind.

188
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,833
He doesn't want
you exerting yourself.

189
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,333
How could a little
sweeping hurt?

190
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,666
Uh-oh.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,666
I don't know, by
breaking my broom maybe?

192
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,833
I guess I don't know
my own strength.

193
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,083
What're you two doing?

194
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,333
Hi Chihiro, how was your day?

195
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,083
Brother, you're
home awfully early.

196
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,833
Rea, why're you outside
cleaning in broad daylight?

197
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,583
And with a broken broom,
no less.

198
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,083
I was helping with the chores.

199
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,125
It shouldn't be a big deal
because it's cloudy out,

200
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
and besides,
you worry too much.

201
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh, really?

202
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,833
Yeah, really.

203
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,375
Fine, just be sure
to get some rest later.

204
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,791
Yes, sir!

205
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,041
Seriously, you need to
rest up 'cause you don't wanna

206
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,583

show later tonight.

207
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,458
Wait, I thought it had
been cancelled.

208
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,791
Yeah.

209
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,458
But we're having our own.

210
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,791
I figured we could shoot off

211
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,291
some bottle rockets
or somethin'.

212
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,250
I prefer the dainty flame
of a sparkler but count me in.

213
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,583
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun!

214
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, I guess that settles it.

215
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,958
Wanko's gonna bring an extra
yukata over 'specially for you.

216
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,875
She said she'll
help you get ready.

217
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,666
I know it's not the real deal
but it'll still be fun.

218
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,666
Miss Wanko's coming?

219
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
You're right that'll be a blast.

220
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, they're her fireworks.

221
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,416
I'm gonna change.

222
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,666
When she gets here,

223
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,625
make sure she doesn't
come barging in on me.

224
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,583
Well, I should go inside
and start getting supper ready.

225
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,875
Oh, okay.

226
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,500
Do you want me to
clean this up for you?

227
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,250
Yes, but try not
to break anything else.

228
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,833
She's coming too?

229
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,583
Neat.

230

Is anybody home?

231
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,541
Hi Ranko, it's a pleasure
to see you as always.

232
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,375
Are you kids gonna
shoot fireworks?

233
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,666
Yes, sir!

234
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,166
We were all pretty bummed
they got cancelled.

235
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,208
So we decided we should take
matters into our own hands.

236
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,041
[CHIHIRO]
Perfect timing.

237
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,916
[RANKO] I thought you said
yukatas were tricky?

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,375
I can't figure 'em out
but Mero's a pro.

239
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,125
[MERO] True, but
it's taken years

240
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,750
of wearing them daily
to master the art.

241
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,083
So, uh, where's Rea?

242
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,541
She's upstairs.

243
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,666

Oh.

No, I doubt I'll even feel it.

248
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,541
In fact, I'd actually prefer it

249
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,708
if you'd wrap me up
nice and tight.

250
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,250
You got it.

251
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,833
May I ask you something?

252
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,458
Have you and Chihiro
always been this close?

253
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,583
You betcha.

254
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,958
We've been friends
since we were kids.

255
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,250
It's funny, 'cause
when I first met him

256
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,750
he annoyed the crap outta me.

257
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,458
I'd never met an oddball
like him before.

258
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,458
But once I got to know him
I saw his good points.

259
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,708
He may be weird
but he's a sweetheart.

260
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,541
I think so, too.

261
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,208
He's not the type
who's into fireworks,

262
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,708
or any outdoor activity, really.

263
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
So I was surprised
when he was on board.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,416
And that's when I realized.

265
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,625
He's doing it because
he thinks it'll make you happy.

266
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,291
I know he can be kinda weird,

267
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
but when it comes down
to it, he's a good guy.

268
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,833
Once you get past
the freaky stuff.

269
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,416
Considering my situation,
that's pretty easy.

00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,958
Just so you know,

350
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,291
I don't think you should
give up on him either.

351
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,958
Okay!

352
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,416
[CHIHIRO]
Are you having fun?

353
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
[REA] Yeah,
I'm having a blast!

354
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,291
Sorry I wasn't
able to pull off

355
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,416
something more
spectacular for ya.

356
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,750
Why do you keep apologizing
when you don't need to, Chihiro?

357
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,916
Well, I dunno.
Sorry.

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,625
Seriously, there's
no need to apologize.

359
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,500
I know it might seem
kinda lame to you,

360
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,666
but this is the most fun
I've had in a long time.

361
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,583
Are you sure
we're not boring you?

362
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,958
Not at all.

363
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,875
Is there anything
I can do to make it more fun?

364
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,041
Not a thing.

365
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,125
I think our little
fireworks display

366
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,083
is better than any big show.

367
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,375
I've never held one before.

368
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,625
Now that I think about it,

369
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,333
I can't imagine
sharing this experience

370
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,166
with anyone other
than you and your family.

371
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,958
I'm sorry to bother you.

372
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,500
Don't be silly,
you're always welcome.

373
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,875
May I ask what brings you
to the mansion today, Miss?

374
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,541
I've decided to
go back to school.

375
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
So I've come by to pick up
some things that I might need.

376
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,833
Is that okay with you ladies?

377
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
Yeah that's fine.

378
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,166
Go tell the madam.

379
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,541
Yes, I'll do that right away.

380
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,916
[door opens]
[REA gasps]

381
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,125
Oh. Hello, Mother.

382
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,541
I hear you've decided
to go back to school.

383
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,875
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,208
I don't see any reason not to.

385
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,500
You've got some
nerve if you think

386
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,125
you can just waltz right
back into Sanka Academy.

387
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,875
Let me guess, you've had
me expelled from school?

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,166
Don't I wish.

389
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,625
Dan'ichiro made me promise

390
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,125
that I wouldn't prevent
you from attending.

391
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,583
You're still enrolled there.

392
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,625
For now, anyway.

393
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,875
Thanks.
I appreciate it, Mother.

394
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,375
Don't be too grateful,
you're going to be on your own.

395
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,541
Don't approach me, don't call
me, and don't ask me for money.

396
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,541
I can handle that.

397
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,375
Very well.

398
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,958
If you've got what
you need hurry up and get out.

399
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,000
I'd be more than happy to.

400
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,916
Hey, are you alright?

401
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,333
I'm fine.

402
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,708
I wanted to thank you, Chihiro,

403
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,375
for letting me
go back to school.

404
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,000
It's not like I can stop you.

405
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,166
But, you sure
you're okay with it?

406
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,333
Yeah, I mean,
if that's what you wanna do.

407
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
I'm happy to hear that.

408
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,416
It's funny.

409
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,958
I don't think I'd have the right
to call myself a normal girl

410
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,333
unless I was going
to school every day.

411
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,666
I've actually
started to miss it.

412
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,666
I guess you weren't really
as happy as you let on, huh?

413
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,083
I wouldn't say I was unhappy.

414
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,708
More like unsatisfied, you know?

415
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,750
I know you're excited,

416
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,083
but will you promise me
that you'll be careful?

417
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,625
I promise.

418
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,208
Try to be as cautious

419
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,333
about preserving
your body as I am, okay?

420
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,583
I'll do my best.

421
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,166
Rea?

422
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,666
What's up?

423
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,375
Can I be completely honest
with you about something?

424
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,250
Of course you can.

425
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,541
If I had it my way, I'd keep
you from going to school

426
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,958
until I figure out how
to preserve your body.

427
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,000
In that case, can I be
completely honest with you, too?

428
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,500
Sure.

429
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,125
I don't want to leave
behind a legacy of regret.

430
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,375
I don't know how much time
I have left in this world,

431
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,416
so I've got to make the most
of every moment that I've got.

432
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,375
And that's why I have
to live like I'm dying!

433
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,541
No point arguing, huh?

434
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,250
Nope, neither of us will win.

435
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,458
She's got a point.

436
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,291
Why couldn't I see it?

437
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,708
We don't see eye to eye.

438
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,166
Everything that makes me happy

439
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,000
only brings her down
and vice versa.

440
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,416
I get it.

441
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,833
It's not fair. but I get it.

442
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,708
Remember that crazy idea I had?

443
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,625
The one about fixing
that coat I got you

444
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,125
so you can put a bunch
of dry ice in it?

445
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,541
You don't have
to wear it all day,

446
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,666
just to school and back,
but I bet it would help.

447
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,375
If that works, you could even
wear it in the summertime!

448
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,791
So does that sound good to you?

449
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,833
But at that moment...

450
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:06,416
I...I got the feeling

451
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,708
Rea and I were sharing
our happiness and sadness.

452
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,625
At that moment...

453
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,000
Next time Sankarea,

454
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,875
Episode 13,
"I, Too, Am... A Zombie..."

455
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,500
Tune in to see Mero!

456
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,416
Woo hoo!

457
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,208
Alright!

458
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,333
You did it!

459
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,208
Woo hoo!

460
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,000
Well thank you, but I couldn't
have done it all by myself.

461
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,250
Let me take this opportunity
to thank you, the little people,

462
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,875
who have helped me to
get where I am today.

463
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,083
You like me,
you really like me!
