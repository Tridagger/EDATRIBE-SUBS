00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,791
[Television]
Zombies!

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,750
Creatures that've been
brought back to life

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,000
with the use of dark
magic or secret potions.

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,000
They are said
to roam the Earth

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,833
feasting on
the flesh of the living.

6
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,500
They are terrifying.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,666
Monsters!

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,708
[BABU] There's a girl who
lives in our peaceful town

9
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,000
who's keeping a dark secret.

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,875
She's a zombie!

11
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,041
[REA gasps]

12
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,833
Babu!

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,625
Don't sneak up
on me like that!

14
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,208
You nearly
scared me to death!

15
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,375
[BABU] I, too,
am a zombie. Babu!

16
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:18,791
What? Wanna join me?

17
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,375
[BABU] We are
the living dead.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,541
C'mere.

19
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,916
You could use a bath, too.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,916
But let's get those
bandages off first.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
[BABU] We were
unfortunate enough

22
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,750
to lose our lives at a young age

23
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,666
due to unforeseen accidents.

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Thankfully, an incredible
elixir allowed us

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,541
to be reborn as zombies.

26
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,750
The person
responsible for that elixir.

27
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,083
is my master, Chihiro Furuya.

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh!

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,833
Hey Babu! I'm home!

30
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,375
Ya miss me?

31
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,083
Luckily for us, he considers
himself a devotee of the undead.

32
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,333
He's a zombie fanatic

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,416
and he's had plenty
of practice making potions.

34
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,291
I got some more dry ice
to keep your body cool.

35
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,041
Hey Chihiro!

36
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,250
Didya have a good day today?

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,500
Geez!

38
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,791
You know, you don't have
to shower all the time,

39
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,958
you're a freakin' zombie now!

40
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,000
I know.

41
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
But still...

42
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,041
We aren't like all
the other unhygienic zombies,

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,708
we prefer to stay clean.

44
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,375
Right, Babu?

45
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,708
[BABU] To be honest,
I don't particularly care

46
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,916
whether I bathe or not.

47
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,583
It'd be nice if I could
open up the wound on my belly

48
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,666
and scrub everything
on the inside, too!

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,750
I don't think that's a good
idea considering those stitches

50
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,208
are the only thing keeping your
intestines from popping out.

51
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,375
There.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,625
Here you go, Babu.

53
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
Have some hydrangea leaves.

54
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,500
[BABU] I've always lived here
as the Furuya family's housecat.

55
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,791
The girl, on the other hand,

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,500
ran away from home
when she became a zombie.

57
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,166
That's how she ended up
living here, too.

58
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,291
It's so beautiful outside.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,625
She spent her youth living

60
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,208
under the watchful eye of
her overprotective father.

61
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,500
But all she wanted was to live
the life of a normal girl.

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,291
Hey, Chihiro?

63
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,125
Whaddya say we go for a walk?

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
We can be back by suppertime.

65
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,416
What'd I tell you?

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,583
You shouldn't expose
yourself to the elements!

67
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,791
I explained what happens
to the body when you die.

68
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,583
Don't you remember?

69
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
Lemme see.

70
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,083
You said amino acids
increase because

71
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,291
proteins start to
decompose and so

72
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,416
the body becomes more savory!

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,958
That's gotta be it, right?

74
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,583
I wouldn't know if it
affects their flavor.

75
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,125
Nasty.

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,416
Now think back, remember how
just a few hours after you died

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,083
you couldn't move
your body anymore?

78
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,916
That's called rigor mortis.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,125
It causes the limbs of a corpse
to become rigid and stiff.

80
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,041
I see.

81
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,666
So it's kinda like when you
take a fish that just died,

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,916
turn it into sashimi,
and then it gets crunchy.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,166
It's impossible to talk
to you when you're hungry.

84
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,125
Now listen.

85
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,458
Once rigor mortis has passed,

86
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,708
the body will then
gradually begin to uh...

87
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Never mind.

88
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,791
Just try not to spend
too much time outside

89
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,791
while the sun
is still up, okay?

90
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,958
If you say so.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,125
[BABU] While my
master is concerned

92
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,333
about preserving
the girl's zombified-body,

93
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,125
he also understands her desire

94
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,416
to go out and enjoy
her newfound freedom.

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,375
Fine, let's go.

96
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,958
But we can't stay out long.

97
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,750
[BABU]
This experience has changed

98
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,375
my master
for the better.

99
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,041
He's much more dependable now

100
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,958
than he ever was
during my lifetime.

101
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,458
Wow, it's so
beautiful out today!

102
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,458
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

103
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,958
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

104
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,583
Geez.

105
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
I get that you're excited about
going back to school and all,

106
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,208
but you've really gotta be more
careful with your body, Rea.

107
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,375
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,958
Well, the sun's
not at its peak yet.

109
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
Guess she'll be okay.

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,208
You got it from here?

111
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,125
Uh-huh.

112
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,041
I'll see ya later on.

113
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,166
I hate to be a nag but try to
stay out of direct sunlight.

114
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
and don't forget to
eat your hydrangea leaves.

115
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,500
I know!

116
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
If I don't eat them
I'll be in big trouble, right?

117
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
After all, they're
maintaining my body.

118
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,666
Got it!

119
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't worry about me!

120
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,958
Okay. I'll try.

121
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,291
Have a good day, Chihiro!

122
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,208
I'll see you at home!

123
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,875
Aw crap.

124
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,833
That's my cue to go.

125
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,083
There's that guy.

126
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,625
Yeah, he's such a weirdo, right?

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,916
Wanko!

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,666
Well... what's this?

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Are you transferring
to Sanka Girl's Academy?

130
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,333
Oh, you're so funny.

131
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,458
I walked Rea to school to
make sure she got here okay.

132
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,250
That's nice of you.

133
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,250
I have early morning tennis
practice every day, you know.

134
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,750
Think you can walk
me to school, too?

135
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,708
I'm such a delicate young lady.

136
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
You're a lot of things
but delicate ain't one.

137
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,250
Alright, that does it!

138
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,791
You're done!

139
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,875
[CHIHIRO yells]

140
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,250
Good morning, Miss Matsukida.

141
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,791
Oh, good morning,
Miss Onozawa.!

142
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,166
The same to you, Miss Sanka.

143
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
You look pretty today,
Miss Sanka.

144
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,875
Oh, thank you, Miss Kusakabe.

145
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,583
Rea! Wait up!

146
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,666
It's so good to see you!

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,666
I was worried you were
never coming back to school!

148
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,541
Oh. Hello Heren!

149
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,583
Glad to be here!

150
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,791
How're you?

151
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, I'm good!

152
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
A little tired after
morning tennis practice

153
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
but that's because I have to
be there at the crack of dawn.

154
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,583
I'm kinda surprised
I've stuck with it.

155
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,583
Oh really?

156
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,875
You must enjoy it, huh?

157
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,208
Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,416
But I hate that it leaves
me drenched in sweat!

159
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,333
I'm gonna go and take
a quick shower now.

160
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,333
I'll see you in class, kay?

161
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,666
Wait!

162
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,875
Well, if it isn't Miss Sanka.

163
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,416
Good morning.

164
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,750
Ms. Morizono!

165
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,250
I didn't see you there.

166
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,750
You must be doing better if
you've come back to school.

167
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,083
I was worried because
you seemed to be getting

168
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,208
more and more
depressed each day,

169
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,833
but now, you've got
a happy glow about you.

170
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,291
Sorry.

171
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,166
I didn't realize
it was so obvious.

172
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,041
Tell me something, Miss Sanka.

173
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,791
You haven't fallen in love
with a young man, now have you?

must've been an old ball.

Please excuse me.

181
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,708
[BABU] It's said that human
muscles perform at 20 to 30%

182
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:01,375
of their capacity because of
limitations set by the brain.

183
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,458
However, those
limitations disappear

184
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,541
once you
become a zombie.

185
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,458
We have superhuman
strength because our muscles

186
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,500
perform at their full
capacity all the time.

187
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,000
[girls cheer]
[whistle blows]

188
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,333
That was awesome!

189
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,583
Who'd have known she
was so great at basketball?

190
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,750
She made a slam dunk
without even breaking a sweat!

191
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,791
I hope Rea's okay.

192
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,791
She better not be overdoin' it.

193
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,041
She wants to be
a "normal girl," huh?

194
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,666
Hey.

195
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,958
What the heck are you
babblin' to yourself about?

196
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,166
We're high school kids,
not like we have any stress.

197
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,750
You'd be surprised.

198
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,208
Unlike you, I've got all kinds
of problems I gotta deal with.

199
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,750
You know, now
that you mention it.

200
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,958
I have noticed that Furuya's
been acting differently lately.

201
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,958
Maybe he's just maturing
faster than the rest of us.

202
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,166
Wha--?

203
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,708
How can the guy who's
in love with zombies

204
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,083
be more mature than us?

205
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,875
Hey, Yasutaka.

206
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,291
Let's say, you had a
date with a normal girl,

207
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,541
what kinda activities
would you have planned?

208
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,541
Huh?

209
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,666
Sorry.

210
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,541
I didn't mean
to catch you off guard,

211
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,750
I just asked because I thought
you might know, that's all.

212
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,125
Wow, I never
thought I'd see the day

213
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,083
you'd fall for
one of the living.

214
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,250
You! How dare you?

215
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,541
Whoa, what's your problem?

216
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,416
Alright spill it!

217
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,250
Who is she?

218
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,250
What?

219
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,458
You sneaky bastard.

220
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,125
Don't tell me you're tryin'
to get your grubby hands on Rea?

221
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,416
It's not Ranko, is it?

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,541
Or maybe an incestuous
crush on Mero?

223
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,500
You disgust me, man!

224
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,458
No, it's nothing like that!
Lemmo go!

225
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,291
I can't believe it.

226
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,250
Just when you think
you really know a person.

227
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,500
You better watch your step or
I'm gonna knock your teeth in!

[BABU] From what I can tell,
the life of a human

229
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,500
can be incredibly stressful
and rather complicated.

230
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,958

of a cat, thank you very much.

I was so worried I had run
you over, little kitty!

[REA] Wait 'til you hear this!

239
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,791
So we were playing
this game "basketball"

240
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,625
in gym class today
and I made a--

241
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,916
wait, what's it called?

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,041
Oh yeah!

243
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,916
Can you believe I
made a grand slam?

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,916
I think what you're trying
to say is slam-dunk, Rea.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,458
Yeah! That's it!

246
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,416
All of the other girls
were so shocked.

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,041
Zombie power is
pretty amazing, isn't it?

248
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,208
Hold on.

249
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,041
You went to gym class today?

250
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,291
You shouldn't be straining your
bones and muscles like that.

251
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,791
Just because you
don't feel any pain

252
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,333
doesn't mean it's
not doing damage.

253
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,833
You've gotta be more careful!

254
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah. I know.

255
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,083
I promise you I'll take
it easy next time, okay?

256
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,291
Geez.

257
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,041
I don't think you get
how serious this is.

258
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,666
Uh-oh.

259
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Looks like rain.

260
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Seems weird to sit here like
this doing absolutely nothing.

261
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,625
It's boring but we've gotta wait
for this rain to lighten up.

C'mon, live a little, Chihiro!

263
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,375
The sun is hidden
behind the rain clouds,

264
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,375
and the temperature's fallen,

265
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,125
it's the perfect weather for me!

266
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,500
I think we should go
for a little walk.

267
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,083
No way!

Don't worry.

I'm gonna catch a cold.

or you'll trip on somethin'!

to die and become a zombie

whenever I want to now.

278
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,583
I wasn't allowed to play
with them when I was alive

279
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,958
because my father
was such a germaphobe.

Nobody's stopping me now.

281
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,666
Guess that makes me one step
closer to being a normal girl.

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,083
Yeah.

I shouldn't have made you

come walking with me
when you're tired.

294
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,333
No.

295
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,833
I should apologize.

00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,458
I just wish I could do more
than take you out for walks.

Well, in that case,

298
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,791

to go to school with me?

00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,125
Huh?

300
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,000
I bet if you disguised
yourself as a student.

You'd have no trouble
sneaking in to my school.

Are you asking me to
dress up like a girl?

surprised by how good you look.

supposed to respond to that.

Even I did fall, it's not like
it'd hurt me or anything.

317
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,541
I realize that but there's
more at stake here

318
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,083
than whether
you'd feel any pain.

319
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,583
Now that you're a zombie, if
you get seriously injured then.

My body can't heal itself.

That's right.

It would be a shame to leave
this world with any regrets.

330
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,250
[BABU] It's common knowledge
that cellular metabolism

331
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:02,041
ceases almost immediately
after a creature dies.

332
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,250
Once a living thing is incapable
of producing new cells

333
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,375
and expelling old ones,
it's impossible to sustain life.

334
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,500
Except in the case of a zombie.

335
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
The effects of the reanimation
drug they've been given

336
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,083
will help sustain their
body to a certain degree.

337
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,791
But there's no longer any
active production of new cells.

338
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,583
In other words.

339
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,041
Even though we remain conscious
and don't feel any pain.

340
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,916
There is no denying
that gradually.

341

Our bodies are decaying.

00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,083
Perfect timing.

355
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,583
I just finished putting some
more dry ice in your bed for ya.

356
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,000
Goodness, look at you.

357
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,208
Someone's becoming
a spoiled little kitty.

358
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,708
That cat.

359
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,625
What's up with him?

360
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,583
[BABU meowing]
[REA laughing]

361
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,291
Bye Babu!

362
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:38,625
We'll see you when we get home!

363
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,500
Hey!

364
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
Watch yourself!

365
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,541
Try to stay in the shade
while the sun's out!

366
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,833
[BABU] Nothing in this world

367
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,291
ever goes the way
you want it to,

368
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,291
it doesn't matter
whether you're alive or dead.

369
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,541
I'm sure those two still have
a tough road ahead of them.

370
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,916
But I'm going to enjoy

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,250
every last moment
I have on this Earth.

372
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,125
Until my body wastes away.

373
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,541
[BABU meows]

374
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to thank you

375
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,000
for flying with us today.

376
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,333
In preparation for landing
at Tokyo Narita airport,

377
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,000
please make sure your
seatbelt is securely fastened.

378
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,416
The "Newly Dead" Period.

379
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,458
This period is
followed by a two week span

380
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,958
in which a zombie's emotions,

381
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,083
desires, and instincts
become blurred.

382
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,958
No matter how much rationality
they may seem to possess,

383
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,208
they have the urge to
devour their loved ones.

384
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,583
This is called
the "Confused" period.

385
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,541
Oh, Professor Jojo.

386
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,375
I'm excited to see what kinds of
samples await me here in Japan.
