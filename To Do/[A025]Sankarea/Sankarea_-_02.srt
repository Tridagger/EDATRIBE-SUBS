[RANKO] Now, then...

345
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,000
You gonna tell me where
you've been out to this late?

346
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,958
Or am I gonna have
to beat it out of you?

347
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,416
[CHIHIRO]
She caught me off guard!

348
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,791
What should I say?

349
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
[CHIHIRO] Well I bought
some ice cream earlier today

350
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,791
and then I kinda
fell asleep by the river.

351
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
[RANKO] That's the best
alibi you've got?

352
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,833
Shame it doesn't match up
with what Mero told me.

353
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
She said that you've been
running off and disappearing

354
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,666
until late in the night
ever since Babu died.

355
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,625
[CHIHIRO whimpers]

356
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
[RANKO] And she said
you're always carrying

357
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,666
that cooler with you.

358
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,041
[CHIHIRO] Oh...
Yeah, that...

359
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,833
Ya can't go to
the river without a cooler.

360
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
[RANKO] Alright, fess up...
what's in this thing?

361
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,583
[CHIHIRO] Don't touch it!

362
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,083
I'm serious!

363
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,958
[RANKO] Don't tell me
your obsession with zombies

364
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,583
has pushed you to do something
sick with Babu's body.

365
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,666
[CHIHIRO] No, don't!

366
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,791
[CHIHIRO and RANKO gasp]

367
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
[BABU screaches]

368
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,958
[RANKO] That did not just happen
because it's not possible.

369
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:21,958
[CHIHIRO] Wow.

370
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,416
I can't believe it
actually worked.

371
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,250
[REA] I'm sorry,
Chihiro and Babu.

372
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,916
I can't make the funeral.

373
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He said he'll never let
me leave the house again.

374
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,500
He won't even
let me go to school.

375
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,791
And I know my father.

376
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,416
He means every word of it.

377
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,375
I'm so sorry.

378
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,833
I hope you don't mind...

379
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,583
but I took a little bit
of the potion.

380
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,416
I know it doesn't actually
bring the dead back to life.

381
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
But still...

382
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,625
I'm more concerned
with the poison in it.

383
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
I just want it
to work in reverse.

384
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,791
If I can't be reborn...

385
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,333
I would rather be... dead.

386
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,875
[MERO] Hey...

387
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,958
Why don't you just
go ahead and call it quits?

388
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,208
There's no way you're ever gonna
get people to watch this thing.

389
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,625
What?

390
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,833
It was well received in Japan?

391
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,416
You've gotta be kidding me.

392
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,416
[MERO] Next time, on Sankarea,

393
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,791
Episode 3, "Sanka... Rea..."

394
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,000
Tune in to see Mero!

395
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,625
[MERO] Let me speak to the
illiterate creep who wrote this.

396
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,375
I'd like to have
some real words with him.
