1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,833
[CHIHIRO] Hey,
are you all right?

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,958
[REA] Hmm?

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,625
I just noticed that
you're limping.

4
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,000
I guess I must've
twisted my ankle

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,000
a little when I fell earlier.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,541
But it looks
worse than it is.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll be fine.

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,208
Geez.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,416
Hey, wait a minute...

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,791
just what do you
think you're doing?

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,708
Careful!

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,000
Watch where you
put your hands!

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,666
There.

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,458
[CHIHIRO thinking] The whole way
home... it was radio silence.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,166
Neither of us said a word.

17
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,125
I should've used that time
to get to know her better.

18
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,000
If I'd asked her about her
about her hopes and dreams...

19
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:22,916
maybe she would've opened up
about her problems at home.

20
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,708
Thinking back on it now.

21
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,625
I feel like I dropped the ball.

22
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,375
That walk home
was my last chance

23
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,166
to save her,
and I blew it.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,166
Rea...

25
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,791
How dare you!

26
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,083
How could you
betray me like this?

27
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,625
I don't know that
I'll ever trust you again.

28
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,958
From this day forward,

29
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,625
you are never to
leave the house!

30
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,166
Not even to go to school!

31
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,791
I don't want you
seeing anyone!

32
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,333
You have no need
for friends!

33
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,375
I can't take it anymore.

34
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
No one should
have to endure this.

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,375
Drinking the potion
is the only way

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,916
I can escape
this wretched life.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,291
They will never care
for you as much as I do!

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,333
I am the only person you need...
do you understand?

39
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,583
Well... I'm still alive.

40
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,208
Guess I'll have
to face another day.

41
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,833
Good morning
Mother and Father.

42
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,125
It's a beautiful day.

43
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,583
Wouldn't you agree?

44
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,416
Well, you're certainly in
good spirits this morning.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,750
Can't imagine why.

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,500
I heard about the stunt
you pulled yesterday.

47
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,000
Sneaking out of the house
and coming back late at night.

48
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,916
What were you thinking?

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
I can tell you're
disappointed with me, Mother.

50
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,583
I know I shouldn't leave
the house unattended

52
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,250
but the moon was so pretty
I had to take a walk.

53
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,541
Cut the crap.

54
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,166
You're on thin ice,
young lady.

55
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm not going to have
my good reputation

56
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,750
sullied by your
promiscuous behavior.

57
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,666
Don't take that
tone with her, Aria.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,041
She's already apologized
for her indiscretion.

59
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,625
Whatever you say, dear.

60
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,458
You're not going to stay
and join us for br--

61
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,666
I'm not hungry.

62
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,416
About last night.

63
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,708
I apologize for
losing my temper.

64
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
It was inappropriate of me
to slap you that way.

65
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,583
No, that's not true.

66
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,500
I deserved it.

67
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,958
I know that sneaking out
of the house is dangerous,

68
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
but I did it anyway.

69
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,125
I'm lucky to have
made it home safely.

70
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,250
You are lucky, aren't you?

71
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:45,750
I'm glad you're able to see
things from my point of view.

72
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,625
Just remember...

73
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,333
I do these things
because I care.

74
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,083
No man will ever
love you like I do.

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,208
[DAN'ICHIRO...]

76
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,416
I know.

77
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,916
I just noticed your clothes.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,291
May I ask why you're
wearing your school uniform?

79
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,083
I thought I made
myself clear when I said

80
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,958
you would be
homeschooled from now on.

81
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,250
Oh yeah...

82
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,625
You did say that.

83
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,416
I guess it's just habit.

84
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,166
I'm sorry, Father.

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,000
I hate to interrupt, sir.

86
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,375
Rea dear.

87
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,208
Why don't you
go change clothes?

88
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,083
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,958
I'll do that right away.

90
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,083
Did you find out anything?

91
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,416
Indeed, sir.

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,833
I have identified
the young man

93
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,791
who was the cause of
last night's "incident."

94
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,166
He's a freshman student
at Shiyo High School

95
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,458
who lives with his family
in a temple off Second Street.

96
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,833
[Dan'ichiro] I see.

97
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,125
[REA thinking] Could they
be talking about Chihiro?

98
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:56,166
We must ensure he'll never
lay a hand on my daughter.

99
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,541
I want the boy castrated.

100
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,125
[REA gasps]

101
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,208
Why would he
do such a thing?

102
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,083
Chihiro's in danger.

103
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,333
I have to warn him!

104
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,666
[RANKO] Are you insane?

105
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,000
Please tell me
you're joking!

106
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,333
[CHIHIRO] Hey Babu!
Where are ya, little buddy?

107
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,583
[RANKO] You expect me
to believe you whipped up

108
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,666
a reanimation potion,
fed it to your dead cat,

109
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,125
and now he's alive?

110
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,708
If that's true, you're not
setting a very good example

111
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,416
as the son of
a temple priest.

112
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Dummy.

113
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,750
Am I wrong to think this calls
his morality into question?

114
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,458
No, I completely agree.

115
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,583
I've always thought my brother's
morals were questionable

116
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,500
because of his bizarre love
of zombies but I never imagined

117
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,208
he'd go to such lengths
to interact with one.

118
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,041
I just wanted
my cat back, okay Mero?

119
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,500
You got me.

120
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,625
I will admit that attempting
to resurrect the dead

121
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,291
is more than a little creepy.

122
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,291
But who cares
'cause it did the job

123
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,291
and now Babu
is alive and kickin'!

124
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,250
C'mon, why can't you just
say you're happy for me?

125
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
You know how much
I missed my little buddy!

126
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,125
Right?

127
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,625
Chihiro, I'm really
starting to worry about you.

128
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,166
I mean, you don't
honestly believe

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,791
you brought him
back to life do you...

130
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,500
ecause that's impossible.

131
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,958
How can you say that when
he's right in front of you?

132
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:07,875
[BABU meows]

133
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,375
Did you hear that?

134
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,500
There's no mistaking
his weird, nasally meow.

135
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm telling you, that's him!
There's no doubt about it!

136
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,083
That meow did sound like him,

137
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,500
but there's
something about him

138
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,875
that seems off...
you know?

139
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,166
I don't remember his eyes
glowing that brightly.

140
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,875
And I hate to say it
but he doesn't seem

141
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,500
to be quite as
affectionate as before.

142
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,291
Okay, but other than that
he really hasn't changed, right?

143
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,958
This could get you
in serious trouble.

144
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,833
For what?

145
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,958
I didn't hurt anybody!

146
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,500
Not yet anyway!

147
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,041
I'd think you, of all people,
would be aware of the risk.

148
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,125
What if he starts attacking
people now that he's a zombie?

149
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,708
If his victims
turn into zombies too,

150
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,291
it won't be long 'til we're
outnumbered by the undead.

151
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:51,291
Aw c'mon, that kinda stuff only
happens in zombie movies.

152
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,708
I wouldn't be so sure
about that if I were you.

153
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,375
Where do you think
you're going, Babu?

154
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,458
Don't let him get away!

155
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,000
You forgot your
backpack, brother.

156
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,250
Don't you need it?

157
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,833
Thanks, Mero,
but I don't think

158
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm gonna make it
to school today.

159
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,875
He can be such a weirdo.

160
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,333
Mero! What's going on?

161
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,791
What's with all
the damn ruckus?

162
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,208
Oh, hey there Grandpa.

163
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,333
Brother found another
stray he wants to take in

164
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,916
and instead of just asking Dad,

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,708
he's insisting that he's brought
Babu back from the grave.

166
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,125
Well, I'll be!

167
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,500
Babu's back, huh?

168
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,583
And to think your brother's
the one who did it, too.

169
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,208
That's my boy!

170
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,791
What the heck's
gotten into you?

171
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,208
I used to pick you up
all the time,

172
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,916
you never had
a problem with it before.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,416
Be careful.

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,708
Don'tcha think you should
be using gloves to catch him?

175
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,083
I can handle this
on my own, Wanko.

176
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,958
I'm sure you don't
wanna miss practice.

177

00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,166
[CHIHIRO crying]

355
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,458
You weren't supposed
to actually die.

356
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,666
I thought you were
just joking around.

357
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,666
Were you serious?

358
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,750
I want you to bring me
back whenever I die.

359
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,166
I'm sorry but...

360
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,041
I just can't do it.

361
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,291
[REA] Chi...

362
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,250
Chi... hiro.

363
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,833
Chihiro.

364
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,333
Whoa.

365
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,916
No way.

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,625
I didn't even give
you the potion but you...

367
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,250
You're alive.

368
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,250
Dear God,
how could this happen?

369
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,125
Master Dan'ichiro, sir?

370
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,708
Chihiro please.

371
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,625
I've asked
you this once before,

372
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:08,291
but now that I'm a zombie
will you please take care of me?

373
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,791
Rea, I... Uh.

374
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:21,750
Okay.

375
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,250
Sorry I've been kinda moody
the last few previews

376
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,750
but that won't happen again.

377
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,583
I finally got to meet
with the writers

378
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,000
and I'm happy to say that
everything's been resolved.

379
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,916
I had a nice,
long talk with them.

380
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,375
Next time on Sankarea,

381
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,458
Episode 4
"A Normal... Girl."

382
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,625
Tune in to see Mero!

383
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,875
They said they're trying to
appeal to our male fan base.

384
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,458
Apparently, men are suckers
for cutesy crap.
