00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,208
[MAN 1] Didn't I tell you?
We hafta go back.

4
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,666
[WOMAN 1] Fine.

11
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,208
That's quite alright.

12
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,708
Although I would prefer
somewhere a bit quieter.

13
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,083
[speaking in Japanese]

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,791
[BALALAIKA] Our neutralization
of enemy targets

15
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,875
is proceeding
according to plan.

16
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,625
But the Kousa Clan
is a very large outfit.

17
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,708
To squeeze them out,

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,333
we'll need to
intensify our efforts,

19
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,541
so we'll be
shifting gears

20
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,875
and moving to phase
two of the operation.

21
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:05,875
[speaking in Japanese]

22
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,125
[BALALAIKA] Yes,
we'll shift gears.

23
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,500
First we clamp down on
their sources of revenue--

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,125
clubs, narcotics, pachinko
parlors, waste management...

25
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:18,000
[speaking in Japanese]

26
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,791
Of course, these actions are
just to rattle their cage,

27
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,625
whereas our main target is...

28
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
...something else.

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,666
[BANDO speaking in Japanese]

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,750
[BALALAIKA] I'm referring to a
tactic that works... anywhere.

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,791
An abduction, Mr. Bando.

32
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,708
We'll target the family
of the Kousa Clan's head--

33
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,041
Masami Kousa.

34
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:49,000

[speaking in Japanese]

36
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,875
What did he just say?

37
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,125
He just said,
"We can't do that."

38
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:04,500
[speaking in Japanese]

39
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,208
The idea was for
you to stir things up

40
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,875
so that they'd be forced
into negotiations with us.

41
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,166
If you go overboard,

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,041
you'll make things
impossible for us later on.

43
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,708
[BALALAIKA laughing]

44
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,875
Hear that, Sergeant?

45
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,958
I don't think
they understand.

46
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,166
Rock, translate this
word for word, okay?

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
Mr. Bando.

48
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,291
We will employ any means
necessary to secure profits.

49
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,958
May I remind you, we are
bearing most of the risk here.

50
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,791
Therefore, it follows
that the decision-making

51
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,375
lies with us, not you.

52
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,541

[CHAKA] Oh, Rumi. It's just you.

57
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,208
I told you not to call
now, you stupid bitch.

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,750
You what? Prada?

59
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,958
I don't want any.
I've got enough to sell.

60
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,625
You talk too much,
you know that?

61
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,208
Keep it up and I'll
knock out two more teeth.

62
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,625
Huh? You're already ugly.

--Show some respect!
--Do you have any idea

00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,791
what's going on here,
you dumb shit?!

Oh. Sorry about that, guys.

68
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,291
Go on! Get outta here!

69
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,416
[CHAKA] Yeah, sure. I get it.
I'm going. I'm going already.

[MAKI] What the... Yukio?
You're still here?

73
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,333
Oh, hi, Maki.

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,750
Oh, it is getting late.

75
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,541
Hey... that must be a
good book. What is it?

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,375
[YUKIO] Oh, this?

77
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,166
It's Martin Heidegger.

78
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,583
He's a German philosopher.

79
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,250
This one's called
<i>Being and Time</i> .

80
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,541
I think I'll pass.

81
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,458
Fantasy and horror
stories are more my thing.

82
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,208
[YUKIO] That's right. You're a
big Anne Rice fan, aren't you?

83
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,666
So... what about light reading?
What authors do you like?

84
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,208
Hmm...

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,625
Let's see.

86
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,375
Umm...

87
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,291
[MAKI] Never mind.

88
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,333
Forget I asked, 'kay.

89
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,666
You know what?

90
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,750
I'm pretty sure whatever
you were just thinking of,

91
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,500
probably wasn't
light reading at all,

92
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,708
at least not for me.

93
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
You think so?

94
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,500
I guess I like any book
that takes me away

95
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,166
and makes me feel
like I'm lost out at sea.

96
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,666
Soaking in all that wisdom
and emotion and everything.

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,791
Endlessly expanding... yet
somewhat different from reality.

98
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,541
An escape.

99
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,666
I think that's what I like.

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,083
[MAKI] Ahhh.

101
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,791
I dunno, I just can't
get into the heavy ones.

102
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,625
How about King,
you ever read him?

103
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,833
[YUKIO] No. I really
don't like scary novels.

104
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,875
Weird. I'm surprised
you'd say that.

105
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,708
You seem like someone
who'd like Poe.

106
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,416
No.

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,458
It's just I've never
liked the ones

108
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,708
that make you
imagine the night.

109
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,708
So dark and lonely and sad.

110
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,958
I don't like the night.
There's something about it...

111
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm afraid of being
swallowed by the darkness.

112
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,083
I don't find it romantic.

113
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,625
Not at all.

114
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,625
[car approaching]

115
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,833
I understand we've
got a little problem.

116
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,666
They're waiting
for you now, Sir.

[speaking in Japanese]

120
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,875
Of course we can wait,

121
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,291
as long as it doesn't
interfere with the operation.

122
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,833
That way we can
still raise a glass

123
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,958
to each other
when this is done.

124
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,541
Hey, Taka- <i>san.</i>

125
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,250
So, what's the deal
with that chick?

126
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,791
[TAKA] Huh? Fucking idiot.

127
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,041
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet?!

128
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,416
[CHAKA laughing] Easy.
It's not what you think.

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
[TAKA] Tch! All I know is

130
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,083
she's that scrawny
interpreter's bodyguard.

131
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,833
She came with
him from Roanapur.

132
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,000
Huh?

133
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,916
A chick and a bodyguard?!

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you serious?!

135
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,291
Hey, Chaka! Cut it out!

136
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,083
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

137
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,791
These people are guests!

138
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,416
[CHAKA] Yeah.

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,541
I know they're
our guests and all.

140
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,666
But still...

141
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,791
I wanna see
what she can do.

142
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,666
[REVY] Is this almost over?

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,083
[ROCK] I'm afraid it's time
for socializing now.

144
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,708
What a waste of time.

145
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,500
[ROCK] Don't complain, Revy.

146
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,250
It's a way to make sure
things don't get out of hand.

147
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,791
If this is all it takes,
it's well worth it.

148
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,916
[sighing]

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,291
Whatever you say.

150
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,791
If it was up to me, I'd just
serve up a round of...

151
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,708
...arsenic cocktails.

152
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,208
[CHAKA] Oh, there she is.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,958
[REVY] Hmph.

154
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,166
[CHAKA] Well, well.
So, is it true?

155
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,500
I hear... you like
playing with guns?

156
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,791
You Japanese have the
lamest pickup lines.

157
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,583
Go fuck yourself.

158
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,333
Alright, let's try again.

159
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,625
I run this place.

160
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,750
Now how could I do that

161
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,791
if I didn't know how
to talk to a lady?

162
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,750
So, honey, you're
from Roanapur, right?

163
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,708
Rumor has it that city has
more bad-ass motherfuckers

164
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,458
than a supermax prison.

165
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,250
Tell me, sweetheart...
ever shot anyone?

166
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,916
I've got about ten
kills under my belt.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,250
[REVY] Romeo,
can you handle the truth?

168
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
[CHAKA] Huh?

169
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,625
[coughing]

170
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,833
Your breath stinks like
you've been sucking cock.

171
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
The bad cologne
doesn't help either.

172
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,208
I think your insides
must be rotting.

173
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,166
Revy.

174
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,375
Revy! Let's go.

175
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,166
Balalaika's waiting
for us outside.

176
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,750
Come on.

177
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, Mr. Interpreter.

178
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,083
Can't you see we're in
the middle of a conversation?

179
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,083
If I were you,
I wouldn't interrupt.

180
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,916
Go on, Revy.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,416
Go and get Mr. Bando or...

182
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,458
[CHAKA] Hey!

183
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,833
Who do you think you
are, you little faggot!

184
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,375
Don't you fucking ignore me.

185
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,458
'Cause when I snap, there's
no telling what I'm gonna do.

186
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
Ya hear me?! Pal?!

187
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,500
[ROCK grunting]

188
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,083
Hey, cutie.

189
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,125
Must be hard for you to watch
me kicking his ass like this.

190
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,083
Maybe you should
try me instead.

191
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
A little pussy like
this couldn't possibly

192
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,541
satisfy a woman like you.

193
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,416
Well, faggot?!

194
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,833
[YOSHIDA] Chaka! What the
hell is wrong with you?!

195
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,416
Look at me, you little punk!

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,666
You think you can do
whatever the hell you want?!

197
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,833
Hey, lighten up Yoshida- <i>san.</i>

198
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,250
I was just playing
with the guy.

199
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
I'm very sorry.

200
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,625
I'll have a talk
with him later.

201
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,666
An incompetent officer and
a soldier who ignores orders.

202
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,791
This is simply
unbearable, Sergeant.

203
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,166
[BORIS] It would be better
if this were a battlefield.

204
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,750
We could just kill them
all and be done with it.

205
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,666
[REVY] Sorry, Rock.

206
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,666
He had his hand on his
gun the entire time.

207
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,333
I was the bait.

208
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,958
He just wanted you to draw.

209
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,708
I think you're finally
starting to get better at this.

210
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm impressed.

211
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,083
I may need my Cutlass after all.

212
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,291
[ROCK] Wait, Revy!

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
[REVY] Don't worry.
I won't start anything.

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,666
But I can tell you
right now, at some point,

215
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
he's gonna turn
his gun on us.

216
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,958
He's just a poor, dumb fuck

217
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,750
who thinks he's got
something to prove.

218
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,875
We'll give him his fight.

219
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,083
But for now,
we'll just sit tight.

220
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,916
When he draws, he's
a fucking dead man.

221
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,791
[GINJI] Boss.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Would you please
pass me the <i>miso</i> ?

223
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,416
[BANDO] Here.

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,833
We don't have enough power
to shut the Kousa Clan up.

225
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,083
The plan was good

226
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,916
despite the Peacekeeping
Council's decision.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,541
I was counting on
the fact that our money

228
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,333
would speak louder
than our actions.

229
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,208
But because of those
damned Russians...

230
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,208
[GINJI] Boss,
the sweet rice vinegar.

231
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,875
[BANDO] Here you go.

232
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,583
Honestly, this isn't good.

233
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,166
[ROCK] Is there anything
else you need, Benny?

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,916
[BENNY] That's it. Thanks again.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,041
I prefer not to go
through the black market

236
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,125
in Bangkok if I can avoid it.

237
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,375
[ROCK] Oh, yeah, Revy needs
you to do her a favor.

238
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,583
Yah?

239
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,000
She wants you to send
over her Cutlasses.

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,458
A troubling request.

241
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
Is there a storm brewing?

242
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,416
I don't know yet.

243
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,083
But I sure hope not.

244
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,250
[BENNY] So do I.
I'll take care of it.

245
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,458
Thanks.

246
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,333
[announcement about
train being canceled]

247
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,541
You're kidding me.

248
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,500
Guess I'll take... Huh?

249
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,500
--I know you...
--I know you...

250
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,625
[ROCK] Yeah, it's been a while
since I felt this cold.

251
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,208
[YUKIO] Right, you live
in a subtropical zone.

252
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,208
So, have you managed

253
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,250
to make it home
yet, Mr. Okajima?

254
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,500
My home? Well, ah...

255
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,708
Well, to be honest,
I've kinda been avoiding it.

256
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,208
You know, you sound an
awful lot like the old me.

257
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,625
Honestly, I used
to hate my home.

258
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,625
But then it occurred
to me it was

259
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,750
the one place where
I could always return.

260
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,666
I guess... that's
something, right?

261
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,583
Well, you're wise beyond
your years, Yukio.

262
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,208
Actually, my friends say
I act like an old lady.

263
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,458
Huh?

264
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh, no. I didn't mean...

265
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,125
[chuckles]
I know. I'm just kidding.

266
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:37,250
For me... I guess
it's different.

267
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,541
Right now I feel
like I'm in limbo.

268
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,333
Don't wanna go
back to where I was,

269
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,791
but I'm not sure
I like where I'm going.

270
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,333
I've heard it said
that people are like dice.

271
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,875
I think Jean-Paul
Sartre said that.

272
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,041
And like dice, we
can throw ourselves

273
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,333
in any direction.

274
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,125
And that's why we're
condemned to be free.

275
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,291
Everyone's starting
point is different,

276
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,083
but no matter how
small the choice,

277
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,250
at the very least you
can still throw yourself.

278
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,333
In the end, you can't
blame fate.

279
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,708
Your life is the result
of the choices you make.

280
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,666
Well, do you agree?

281
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,708
That's kinda hard to take.

282
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,125
[cellphone ringing]
Please excuse me.

283
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,583
This is Yukio.

284
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,458
Oh, it's you, Ginji.

285
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,625
Uh-huh.

286
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,916
I know. But still,
you worry too much.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Yes. In fact I'm having
coffee with Mr. Okajima.

288
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,916
You know, he's the one
we met at the fair.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,916
--[GINJI] Miss...
--What is it, Ginji?

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,250
[GINJI] Perhaps you should...

291
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,333
[YUKIO] What?
Mr. Bando's there now?

292
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,666
Then I'd better hurry home.

293
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,625
Yes. I understand. Right.

294
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,125
I'm really sorry.
I have to go. Bye.

295
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,375
Uh, Yukio... one sec.

296
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,416
[YUKIO] Uh-huh?

297
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,125
Well...

298
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,208
I never asked you
what your last name is...

299
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,916
Huh? Oh, it's Washimine.

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,791
Pretty solemn, isn't it?

301
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,666
I'm against this.

302
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,791
What does it have
to do with Yukio?

303
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,333
[BANDO] What if the Peacekeeping
Council heard about this?

304
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,458
They'd never let
us rebuild our clan,

305
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,166
and on top of that,
they'd probably

306
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,625
have us thrown out of
the region altogether.

307
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,833
--Oh, Miss!
--You're already home...

308
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,958
I apologize for not noticing.

309
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,125
Mr. Bando.

310
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,041
What were you just saying?

311
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,416
[BANDO] Goodnight, Miss.

312
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,375
When your father died,
they started making noise

313
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,875
because we didn't have
a legitimate successor.

314
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,166
They said they'd accept
any blood relation.

315
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,583
Goddamn it, they knew exactly
what that would mean.

316
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,416
--So then...
--Yes. That's right.

317
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625
You were the only one
they would accept,

318
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,125
those damn bastards.

319
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,291
And they're using
that to destroy us.

320
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,166
[cellphone ringing]

321
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,208
Yoshida?

322
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,791
[YOSHIDA] Boss! Are
you okay, Boss?!

323
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,666
[BANDO] I'm fine, but it looks
like someone put a tail on me.

324
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
They're not the local police.

325
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,166
[YOSHIDA] Boss!

326
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,541
Could be someone
from higher up.

327
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,791
I'll lose them when
I get the chance.

328
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
After that, I've gotta
lay low for a while.

329
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,083
[YOSHIDA] Boss! The Russians are
going completely crazy on us!

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,375
They blew up a car in front
of the police station today

331
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,208
when this guy from Kousa
went there to turn himself in!

332
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,166
A fucking car bomb!

333
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,750
[BANDO] Yeah?

334
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,166
[YOSHIDA] I thought they were
gonna wait! That fucking bitch!

335
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,333
[BANDO] I hear you.

336
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,500
I'll be in touch.

337
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
--[YOSHIDA] Boss!
--Prepare for trouble

338
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
and get cleaned up.

339
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,958
[BALALAIKA] Anything
from Washimine?

340
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,875
Nothing yet, Ma'am.

341
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,125
Waste of time.

342
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,875
Earlier at 0600 hours,
we know that a detective

343
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,875
approached the Washimine
office for information.

344
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,041
It's only a matter of time.

345
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,958
Tell the main unit to
relocate to the Maria Zeleska.

346
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,541
[BORIS] Yes, Ma'am.
What should we tell Laptev?

347
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,333
Don't tell him anything.

348
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,416
[ROCK] Um, Miss Balalaika.

349
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,333
Hmm? What do you want?

350
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,166
Well, um...

351
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,625
What...

352
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,000
What happens if they don't
keep up their end of things?

353
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,500
[BALALAIKA] Rock.

354
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,625
Is that any concern of yours?

355
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,583
[ROCK] No...

356
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
That's right.

357
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,291
You'd be wise not to forget
your place in all of this.

358
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,458
Hey, Sis.

359
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,250
Why not cut him some slack.

360
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,166
It's not exactly a big
secret or anything...

361
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,583
...so why not tell him?

362
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,041
There's no reason to make
this personal, Two-Hands.

363
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,208
Silence is golden.

364
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,333
Won't argue with you there,

365
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,125
but Rock's on our side, right?

366
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,083
Trusting each other's
important, too.

367
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,250
I see you're getting
better at this.

368
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Alright, fine.

369
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,125
Let's suppose for a
moment they were to

370
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,958
do something stupid like that.

371
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,875
Well, we'd just add one
more name to our hit list.

372
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,375
Our job here won't change
and life would go on as usual.

373
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,208
It's as simple as that.

374
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,000
[YOSHIBO] Yuki!

375
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,166
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,958
We'll stay to help
you next time, I swear.

377
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
Yeah. Sorry. Bye.

378
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,416
Don't worry. Have
fun at work, alright.

379
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,666
[MAKI] Here's the thing, Yukio.

380
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,958
My last finals went so bad.

381
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,333
When my mom saw the results,
she freaked out

382
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,541
saying she totally
wants me to quit my job.

383
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,291
But I need that job
or I can't afford my...

384
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,750
[YUKIO] Ginji.
I am involved in this.

385
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,916
I was raised in this house.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,333
I hold the Washimine name.

387
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,375
[MAKI] She just kept
nagging and nagging,

388
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,833
like I don't want
a good future?

389
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,208
About that guy, Okajima...

390
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,583
You should know
he's involved in this.

391
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
He's on the Russians' side.

392
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,791
Yukio! Yukio!

393
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,666
Huh?

394
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,833
Ohhh...

395
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,666
You probably didn't
hear a word I said.

396
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,791
Oh, sorry.

397
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,250
This is seriously a
big deal for me, okay.

398
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,500
I need your help.

399
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,166
It's just... I'm not...

400
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,041
Huh? What's wrong?

401
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
Actually, never mind.

402
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,125
On second thought,

403
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
talking about it isn't
really going to help.

404
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,875
What?! Come on!

405
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,208
It's no fair to leave
me hanging like that!

406
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,416
[YOSHIDA] Boss!

407
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,125
[BANDO] Yeah, what is it?

408
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm just out for a walk.

409
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,166
No reason to be concerned.

410
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,666
Bro! You're going to meet
the Russians, aren't you?!

411
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,500
It's been a long time
since you called me Bro.

412
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,333
Wait up! I'm coming, too!

413
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,666
Yoshida. Take this.

414
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,500
I want you to find Ginji.

415
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,833
You ask him what to do next.

416
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,458
I know you don't like him,
but he's a good man.

417
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
[crying]

418
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,625
Don't do it!

419
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,708
[BANDO] Guess this's goodbye.

420
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,583
It's been quite the ride.

421
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:05,833
[YOSHIDA sniveling]

422
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,750
[GINJI] When did this happen?

423
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
[YOSHIDA] Just this morning.

424
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,333
There was a suitcase sitting
out in front of our office.

425
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,208
Those goddamned
fucking Russians!

426
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
Yoshida, regardless
of who did it,

427
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,416
it still would've
ended this way.

428
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
Something had to
be done about Kousa.

429
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,333
They were trying
to destroy our clan.

430
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,916
The boss was too
smart for his own good.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,083
That's all it is.

432
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
[YOSHIDA] So, what the
hell do we do now?

433
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,291
It's so dark and lonely.

434
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,666
The snowy night sky.

435
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,625
Stop right there!

436
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,125
You Russian bitch!

437
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,875
[stabbing sound]

438
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,208
[BALALAIKA] Rock!

439
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,166
Translate and make sure
he understands every word.

440
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,125
[ROCK] But...

441
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,958
[BALALAIKA] I'm gonna tell
you the truth tonight.

442
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,625
What I seek is
destruction and domination.

443
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,166
I don't care
about anything else.

444
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,583
I'm only interested
in how much I can dance

445
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,458
in the pit of Hell
when it's all over.

446
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
See you there one day.

447
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,500
[loud cracking sound]

448
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,500
[REVY] Hey!

449
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
Wake up, Rock!
Are you alright?!

450
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Was...

451
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,458
[REVY] You're
sweating like crazy.

452
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,416
Was I asleep?

453
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,916
[REVY] You could call it that.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,166
You sounded like
an old Buick engine.

455
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,833
You shouldn't drink so much.

456
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

457
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,083
Anyway, the shit's
about to hit the fan.

458
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,083
We're moving.

459
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,041
--We are?
--They're splitting up.

460
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
Between a cargo ship
and the Russian Embassy.

461
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,708
So, this really
is gonna be war.

462
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,125
Damn right it is.

463
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,208
Hotel Moscow is serious.

464
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,000
A storm is coming, Rock.

465
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,333
A storm of steel and blood.

466
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,083
[YUKIO] You're planning
to go, aren't you?

467
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,583
So, if I choose to
walk a path in the sun,

468
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,166
the rest of you will be forced
to wander in the darkness.

469
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,416
Please, Miss.
You mustn't do this.

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,708
No, Ginji.

471
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,750
I know how you feel,
but I can't run from this.

472
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,041
You know. I can actually
feel the night

473
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,791
inside of you right now.

474
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,000
It's sorrowful,
but at the same time,

475
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,500
it's not cold like
I thought it'd be.

476
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,666
I feel warmth.

477
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,041
[GINJI] Miss. I...

478
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,500
I wanted you to
have a normal life.

479
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,250
And I always hoped you'd
find true happiness.

480
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,416
I've lived only to see that.

481
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Now Kousa's rats,
those Russian bastards...

482
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
They're trying to
take it all away!

483
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:31,791
Our name, our legacy,
and everything we stand for!

484
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,083
As small in number as we are,
we will not go easily.

485
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:40,750
If the Council accepts me
in place of my father, so be it.

486
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,333
You know what?

487
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,250
The snowy night is so beautiful.

488
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,875
This is the first time
I ever thought that.

489
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,458
Ginji.

490
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,041
Will you protect me
as you did my father?

491
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,041
I will. Though unworthy,

492
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,250
I am Chief Lieutenant
of the Washimine Family.

493
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,666
I, Ginji Matsuzaki,
will protect you

494
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,000
with all seven
of my incarnations!

495
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,458
[ROCK] People are
just like dice.

496
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,666
We throw ourselves in the
direction of our choosing.

497
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,083
Wait, Ginji. Before you go,

498
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,166
promise me you'll
be careful tonight.

499
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,500
[BALALAIKA] Let's take care
of this quickly, shall we?
