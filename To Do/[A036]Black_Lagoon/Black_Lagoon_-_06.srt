1
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,041
[STANFORD]
So, this is Brunhilda.

2
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,291
It's a lot smaller
than I expected it to be.

3
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,916
[RACHMANN] It has an air to it
befitting of its grand ancestry.

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,958
And what an impressive
array of colors.

5
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,625
The piece is simply splendid.

6
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,000
Commander?

7
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,416
What is it?

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,166
Well, sir, although it may
be a valuable inheritance,

9
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,791
to use so many of our resources

10
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,708
for its retrieval
seems a bit...

11
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,708
It was Lord Alfred's
passion and grand vision

12
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,125
that we make this painting
the ideological basis

13
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,375
for our national
socialist movement.

14
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,208
This painting will bring
new life to our cause.

15
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,291
Try to understand.

16
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,250
--Sir!
--When we deliver this to him,

17
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,500
he has promised our party

18
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,416
considerable financial
assistance,

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,625
as well as an introduction
to the Anti-Communist Union.

20
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,166
Although our numbers are
small in America at present,

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,166
this is the opportunity we've
needed in order for our party

22
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,125
to make a significant
breakthrough.

23
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
[DUTCH] What is it
with that painting?

24
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,500
I mean, there's not much
we can do if these guys

25
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,333
have bad taste in politics
and even worse taste in art.

26
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,416
But still, coming all
the way out here

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
with that kind of
equipment and weaponry

28
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,375
is not something you can
do without a lot of money.

29
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,833
The investment is way out of
proportion to their objectives.

30
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,666
Or... wait a minute...

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,000
Talk about spending too
much money for the job.

32
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,625
So, that's it.

33
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,125
[DUTCH] You're pretty smart,
Rock. Sounds familiar, huh?

34
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,375
We've been hired to
find that same painting

35
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,666
and we're getting
a lot of cash to do it.

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,458
You'd think it was valuable.

37
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,708
But we're talking
about an artist

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,833
who was virtually unknown.

39
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,375
Well, hopefully that mystery's
gonna get solved tonight.

40
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,166
I have a bad feeling
about this.

41
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,041
[DUTCH] Rock, go and
feed Revy, will you?

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,416
Sure.

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,208
[DUTCH] Tell her they don't
deliver pizza out here.

44
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,333
So, she'll have to give up
and eat something from a can.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,583
[ROCK] Revy.

46
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,375
I brought dinner. 

47
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,375
Dutch says you should probably
have something to eat.

48
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,250
I'll leave it here.

49
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,083
If this is about what happened
earlier in the U-boat, I--

50
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,791
[REVY] Rock, we're done
talking about that.

51
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think
there's any reason

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,458
for us to go over all
that again. Got it?

53
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,625
Right.

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,000
[DUTCH] It's a good night.

55
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,583
The moon is about to sink,
then it'll get dark.

56
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,375
And when that happens,
we'll raid those bastards.

57
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,291
I've been keeping an eye
on the course of their ship

58
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,125
at the outer range
of our radar.

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,166
Good work. Revy and I
will take care of the rest.

60
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,875
Since they have
their little painting,

61
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,125
I'm guessing they're busy
celebrating right about now.

62
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,541
Idiots. That's right. Go ahead
and keep toasting each other.

63
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
We're gonna come in
banging on our tom-toms

64
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,541
and raid you like
the wild Apaches.

65
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,250
Wagner's shit next to that.

66
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,958
[classical music in distance]

67
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,583
Sorry, but we got one more
errand to run, partner.

68
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,125
[REVY] Sure. Why not?

69
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,916
[DUTCH] Your chance
to take those 92s

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,458
to these motherfuckers.

71
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,625
You distract 'em and
I'll do the searching.

72
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll start some shit.

73
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,583
Works for me. I got no
complaints as long as I can

74
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,916
kill who I want and
steal what I want.

75
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
I'm going now, Rock.

76
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,125
You seem down, Revy.

77
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,291
What's going on? Did
something happen with Rock?

78
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,125
[REVY] Nothing happened.

79
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:25,375
[men laughing]

80
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:30,416
[Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries" plays]

81
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,166
Hmm?

82
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,666
I-I think we got trouble!
Someone--

83
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,291
And just like that, the first
little piggy met his end.

84
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,041
Oink, oink, oink.

85
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,291
[gunshots]

86
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,916
It's started.

87
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,250
I'm makin' my way to the
upper deck from the bow.

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,500
I need you to turn this place
into a cluster fuck. Okay?

89
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,625
Yeah. You don't
need to ask twice.

90
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll eat till I get my fill.

91
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,166
What the hell? Where did
that gunshot come from?

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know.

93
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,333
[gunshots]

94
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,750
It's fine if they
wanna get wild,

95
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
but tell 'em to stop shooting.

96
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,041
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,000
[gunshots]

98
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,416
Commander! It's the enemy!

99
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,708
The enemy got on board!
We're under attack!

100
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:37,750
[alarm]

101
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,500
They're still at it.

102
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,041
[ROCK] Hey...

103
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,833
Times like this,

104
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,166
what are we supposed to
do while we're waiting?

105
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,500
Do we sit here smoking,
drinking beer, looking bored?

106
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,958
When you two were being
shot at earlier today,

107
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,291
I noticed Dutch remained
incredibly calm.

108
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,333
And to be honest,
I envied him for that.

109
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,416
But hey, we're not really
the type of people

110
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,416
who can pull out a gun and
shoot other human beings.

111
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,750
Let's face it, that's
why we watch the fort.

112
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,583
All squad leaders, gather your
men in front of the galley.

113
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,333
Remain there--

114
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,291
--Yo.
--Bastard. Shoot him!

115
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:20,083
What a joke! They've got the
uniforms, but that's about it.

116
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,833
So, is this where
the boss is hiding?

117
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,416
Y-You won't find the commander
here. He's on an upper level.

118
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,875
I swear it's the truth.

119
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,833
Well, thanks a lot.
That's very kind of you.

120
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,041
Revy, you hear me?

121
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,458
Revy? Revy? Where are you?

122
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,208
Damn it, that bitch!

123
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,791
Wait, please don't shoot. 

124
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,916
All the sailors here
are hired outsiders.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
We're not with these guys.

126
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,125
So what? "Please don't kill me"?

127
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,291
Unaffiliated and nonresistant
means nothing to me.

128
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,500
If you're all insured,
it shouldn't matter, right?

129
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,875
Oink, oink, oink.

130
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,833
Revy, what the hell
are you thinking?

131
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,416
Stanford. Eradicate these
hoodlums with a decisive blow.

132
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,208
Roger that.

133
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,250
What the hell's your problem?

134
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,541
I was just doing my job, Dutchy.

135
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,333
Bloodbaths are what we do
best. Isn't that right?

136
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,791
A gunman is a professional.

137
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,333
A shooter's someone who kills
'cause they got issues.

138
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,875
I do not remember hiring
Charles fucking Whitman.

139
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,833
If you want, you can go
wild and lose your shit.

140
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,458
But if you fuck this up
here and now, I die too.

141
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,625
Just keep your cool, Revy.

142
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,500
If that's too much for you,
go climb a fucking clock tower

143
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,666
and start shooting
up college kids.

144
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,416
Fuckin' great! So, now you're
gonna preach to me, too?

145
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,375
Spare me the bullshit, Dutch.

146
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,500
What do you expect, Two Hands?
I'm your employer, after all.

147
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,416
Huh, I actually thought
you were gonna kill me.

148
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,416
Me too, partner.

149
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,083
Not a whole lot of trust
going around here.

150
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,708
You couldn't even take
a joke. That's too bad.

151
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,833
So, why don't you tell me
what's next on the agenda,

152
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,500
big boss man.

153
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,083
The commander.
We're gonna find him.

154
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,583
[RACHMANN] Your Excellency,

155
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,625
the enemy is most likely those
grave robbers we spoke of.

156
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,291
Currently, our comrades are
boldly countering their attack

157
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,708
and dealing with them.
We'll be sure to get them.

158
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,208
So, please do not
worry, Your Excellency.

159
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,416
[ALFRED] Rachmann, not once has
a military unit been victorious

160
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,125
when entering a battle
with nothing more

161
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,208
than desired outcomes.

162
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,041
To say "please don't worry"
shows a lack of sincerity.

163
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,958
Would you not agree?

164
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,833
Unless you have some basis
for this confidence,

165
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,375
I would think it
best to refrain

166
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,750
from making such
casual consolations.

167
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,416
I-I'm sorry to
have offended you.

168
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,458
[ALFRED] Did I sound like I
wanted an apology from you?

169
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,458
Frankly, I'm quite surprised.

170
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,791
Do you think I'd place greater
importance on your apology

171
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,416
than the painting itself?

172
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,583
We spoke about this
at great length.

173
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,958
I want the painting
delivered to me

174
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,541
and you're in need of
connections into our world.

175
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,250
And that's about all there
is to it. Isn't that right?

176
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,291
You must understand that.

177
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,375
[DUTCH] Revy, have you
cooled off a bit?

178
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,458
[REVY] What do you mean?

179
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, in case you
haven't noticed,

180
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,458
you get Whitman fever every time
we get a newcomer on board.

181
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,041
The exact same thing happened
when we took in Benny.

182
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,541
[REVY] Not digging too deep
is our style, isn't it?

183
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,125
I'll finish the job. Perfectly.

184
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,041
Of course you will. 

185
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,583
Or you won't be able to
support your way of life.

186
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,458
I'm gonna check this area.
We'll finish talking later.

187
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,875
[wood breaking]

188
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,083
So, you're still
alive, little girl.

189
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,791
I complement you on
your audaciousness.

190
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,708
The name I've proudly carried
since birth is Blitz Stanford.

191
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,416
I am the acting captain of the
glorious Aryan Socialist Union.

192
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,833
And you, a nefarious
grave robber.

193
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,583
This is clearly the most
fated of confrontations.

194
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,875
For the sake of those
who died for the Union,

195
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,833
you shall atone
with your blood.

196
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,500
Behold!

197
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,500
Witness this mighty gun I wield.

198
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,916
I call it the Eiserne
Reich Luger Special.

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
The barrel is the
Luger artillery long

200
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,583
and the frame is
hardened carbon.

201
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,791
Featuring a thick grip
and a two-bullet chamber,

202
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,833
it is truly one of a kind.

203
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,625
This weapon is
far too destructive

204
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,125
to simply be referred to as
specialized in man-stopping.

205
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,291
I am the only one on Earth

206
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,583
capable of taming
this terrible gun!

207
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,541
Are you afraid?
There's no way you're not.

208
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,833
Now witness the
awesome power of--

209
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,708
[REVY] Shut the fuck up.

210
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,333
Didn't you see I
wasn't even listening?

211
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,666
I mean, were you trying to
sell me the damn gun or what?

212
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,083
You fucking coward--

213
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,541
Now it's my turn to talk.

214
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,750
Here's some advice--
if you can hit your target,

215
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,333
pretty much any gun
will do the trick.

216
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,458
Now that's one to grow on.

217
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,750
Say "hi" to the Führer
for me, would ya?

218
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,916
[gunshot]

219
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,833
[ALFRED] That's the
sound of the finale.

220
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,666
It appears that you've
lost the battle, Rachmann.

221
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,541
I've heard that tune
many times in the past.

222
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,333
Even now, I have fond
memories of those times.

223
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,958
Yo, Nazi.
I've come to get you.

224
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,541
Were you on the phone?

225
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,833
Well, after all
we've been through,

226
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,208
I don't think I'll apologize
for the rudeness.

227
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:30,875
Don't mind me. I'll wait
here and let you finish up.

228
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,083
[ALFRED] He certainly is a brave
man. I want to talk to him.

229
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,000
Put him on, will you?

230
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,000
It's for you.

231
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,500
[DUTCH] You the boss? 

232
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,208
You're subordinates were a
real waste of good uniforms.

233
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,458
[ALFRED] Indeed.

234
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,125
You must forgive me for
the shameful display.

235
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,666
[DUTCH] Now I've got
two questions for you.

236
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,916
[ALFRED] Oh? About the
importance of the painting?

237
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,250
Let's start with that.

238
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,083
There's another
artist besides Janke

239
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
thought to be responsible
for this painting.

240
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,541
[ALFRED] I commend you
on your research.

241
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,833
[DUTCH] A little-known
artist from Austria.

242
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
Good old Adolf Hitler himself.

243
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,666
Or that's how the
rumor has it, anyway.

244
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,125
It's the Führer's?

245
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,750
[DUTCH] Don't rush to
conclusions, old man.

246
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,875
[ALFRED] The Führer
as an artist could,

247
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,125
at best, only paint
mediocre scenic pieces.

248
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
But the theory
brings back memories.

249
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,125
On the day he left for Batavia,

250
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,250
the SS officer carrying
that painting was also

251
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,583
under the impression that
it was the Führer's work.

252
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,083
[DUTCH] I see. So...

253
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,166
...what you want
isn't the painting,

254
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,875
but something else
inside of it.

255
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,541
And this is just
a wild guess, but

256
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,333
I'd be willing to bet
you know the phone number

257
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,208
to our office pretty well,
don't you, old man?

258
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,250
The antique trading
company from Madrid

259
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,416
that asked for
this salvage job.

260
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,958
Indeed, I'll admit that was me.

261
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,041
I was also the one who
wished you and Rachmann

262
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,791
to confront one another.

263
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,708
[RACHMANN]
What?

264
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,250
[ALFRED]
A most amusing method,

265
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,250
which provided insurance and
acted as their rite of passage.

266
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,708
And it's nothing more
than a fleeting

267
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,541
and dear memory to me now.

268
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,916
The day Heydrich decided
on the "Final Solution,"

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,666
we made a vow at
the Wannsee lakeside.

270
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,125
We would become realistic
guardians rather than idealists,

271
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,666
believing only in victory.

272
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,416
So, we gathered all of our
capital and created a file

273
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,875
which included our signatures
and account numbers.

274
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,916
When signs that
the end approached,

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,875
we hid our files
in four paintings

276
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,208
and escaped Berlin before
the Allies took the city.

277
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,000
That painting you have
there is the last piece.

278
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,166
You have shown surprising
insight, <i>schwarzen.</i>

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,916
You watch your mouth, you old
cracker. No need to be rude.

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,791
I might get upset and throw
it back into the ocean.

281
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,875
[ALFRED] That's fine with me.
I simply wanted to get it back

282
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,083
because it was discovered.

283
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,958
Financially speaking, we are
quite successful these days.

284
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:01,041
But what about the loss
of reputation for yourself?

285
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,125
Well, I don't like it, but I'm
not gonna argue with you there.

286
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
[ALFRED] You're a wise man.

287
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,875
You know, it's a real
shame you're black.

288
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,833
[DUTCH] I'll take that as
a complement. Now go on.

289
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,750
Continue with
your conversation.

290
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,083
[ALFRED] There won't
be any need for that.

291
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,708
He has already fulfilled
his role in all of this.

292
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,375
Alfred, you bastard!

293
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,166
First, you set me up
in this fixed race

294
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,833
and then you betray me?!

295
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,666
I suggest you watch
your mouth, young one.

296
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,666
Whether or not you
choose to admit it,

297
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,875
you and the black man were
given a level playing field.

298
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,375
You should have known
better than to try and

299
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,250
enter into our society
considering your ineptness.

300
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,625
I'm afraid you've only
yourself to blame.

301
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,291
As for you, black man,
that was a splendid job.

302
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,750
If you were fortunate enough
to have been born an Aryan,

303
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,083
I would have sent
you an Iron Cross.

304
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,916
I don't want one. All I want's
the money, you old Nazi fuck.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,916
[ALFRED] Honesty is wonderful.
Hypocrisy rots this world.

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,750
I sincerely wish your kind

307
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,041
will one day be wiped off
the face of this planet.

308
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,791
[DUTCH] Thank you kindly.

309
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,708
And I sincerely wish
that you rot in hell.

310
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
Come on.

311
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,750
Are you still not
done cleaning up?

312
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,000
So, is this guy here
the commander?

313
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
[DUTCH] Yeah.

314
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,208
[REVY] Wanna make a bet, Dutch?

315
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,041
You know, the usual?

316
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,291
It's really not much
of a bet, Revy.

317
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,958
Let's just try it.

318
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,500
Here you go, old man.
Knock yourself out.

319
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,333
I say black.

320
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,458
I already told you,
it's not that much of a game.

321
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,375
I say black, too.

322
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,833
[whimpering]

323
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,875
Ahh!

324
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,625
I told you--it's not
that much of a bet.

325
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,333
You know, I thought the
commander might surprise us

326
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,250
and actually show some balls.

327
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,791
But I guess I was wrong.
These guys are all the same,

328
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,041
pathetic till the end.

329
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,791
[DUTCH] You're right about that.

330
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,416
Let's finish this job.

331
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,958
Fuckin' eh.

332
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,916
I sure got the shivers
today. Way too much trouble.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,041
Shut up.

334
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,250
I won't cause any more trouble.

335
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,916
[DUTCH] I think I'm finally
starting to understand

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,916
what you're so hung up on.
And I'll tell you right now,

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
whatever's eating you
comes from deep inside.

338
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,875
In other words,

339
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,708
no amount of killing is gonna
make that pain disappear.

340
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,875
[REVY] Dutch?

341
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,625
[DUTCH] What is it?

342
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,166
It's Rock. He's on the
other side of the tracks.

343
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,625
He's nothing like
the people on our side.

344
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,208
I don't know why, but I just
can't stand that feeling.

345
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,791
It's not that I don't like him. 

346
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:11,416
But, Dutch, it's just... It's
not possible. I just can't...

347
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,500
I can't partner with that guy.

348
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,666
Shut up! Shut the
fuck up, damn it!

349
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,541
I'm serious! I'll kill you!

350
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,583
[ROCK] Fine. Then do it.
