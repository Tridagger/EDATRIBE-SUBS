1
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,583
I can't. You know
how I make my living!

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,833
If I fuckin' squeal, I'm done!

3
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,416
Right back atcha. You know how
I make my living, right Leroy?

4
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,625
Squeal, piggy, squeal. Squeal.

5
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,500
In nineteen-forty, the Japanese
built a huge bunker complex.

6
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,791
They planned to
fight to the last soldier.

7
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
Hide your ass in there
and no one'll find ya.

8
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,958
Now we know where she is.

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,541
Hey! Ya maniac!

10
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,291
Leroy's an easy nut to crack.
Information's not free though.

11
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,541
The tab's going
on the kid's bill.

12
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,166
I just "reminded" him that

13
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,791
the maid wasn't paying
him enough to be a hero.

14
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,500
You mean--
You found Roberta?

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,916
That's where we're headed.

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,125
Caxton! It's Will!

17
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,208
In here!

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,625
Something's definitely
wrong. I can feel it.

19
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,625
I sent a couple of men
to check out the perimeter.

20
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,708
They just got back.

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,083
Copy that.

22
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,541
For several hours now
our lines have been clicking

23
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,625
indicating someone
is tapping us.

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,875
Here's the latest intel on

25
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,875
the target's location
and the new game plan.

26
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:17,458
It's from Brigadier General
Wilder. The operation is a go.

27
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,875
Finish making your report.

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,416
Sir, the approaches at Chalquam
and Manthey Streets have

29
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
been closed
due to construction.

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,750
However, it did not look like
there was any work being done.

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,000
There are no street vendors

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,375
or prostitutes in the
immediate vicinity, sir.

33
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,166
From here to the
town perimeter there are

34
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,125
roughly nine guard
posts and four foot patrols.

35
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,791
Good job. Prepare for
Operation: Street-Cleaner.

36
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,083
That's it.
You should get back

37
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,500
before the shit
hits the fan, Will.

38
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,166
We're across from the
hotel Abrego told us about.

39
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,041
Copy that.

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,958
Hmm, so let's see,
we've got the Americans, FARC,

41
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,416
and the local dickwads that
the maid hired to stir shit up.

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,458
I think we're gonna
have a war in the hood here.

43
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,791
Stop the car!

44
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
Revy, where're you going?!

45
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,375
I know we're in a rush,
but we could use some help!

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,958
What the hell?! Phone been
ringing forever, you guys!

47
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,791
You two are so sad!

48
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,750
Hi, hi!

49
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,333
Hey, Chinglish! Want a job?

50
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,250
You'll get to kill
a whole lot of dipshits!

51
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,708
I be happy to
skin you for free, slut.

52
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,916
Jesus, nice fuckin' attitude!

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,708
You're the one
who attacked me!

54
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,916
It's being bankrolled by a
stinking rich South American.

55
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,833
How much it pay?

56
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,000
Charlie to Alpha.
Current status: D-Four.

57
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,375
Looks like a group of
armed men coming your way.

58
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,666
Keep your heads up.

59
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,125
Roger that, Charlie.

60
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,500
Bravo and Charlie Teams,
prepare to move out.

61
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,875
I have no idea what kind of

62
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,625
giant clusterfuck
we're caught up in,

63
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,750
but the time for
sittin' on our asses is over.

64
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,500
Gentlemen,
time to earn your pay.

65
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,750
D-one here.

66
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,333
Armed civilians are entering
the target building now.

67
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,791
We're here
for Rosarita Cisneros.

68
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,916
Until we spot
the Bloodhound herself,

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,708
no one is to
leave their position.

70
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,791
Roger that.

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,958
The snitch said
this is where that

72
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
guido we're supposed
to whack is hiding.

73
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,875
Are you sure he
said the second floor?

74
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,958
Leroy always gives
us the straight shit.

75
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,625
This is the place alright.

76
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,791
On three: one, two, thr--!

77
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,083
Cease fire!

78
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,666
I'm gonna blow the
Claymores. Everyone, down!

79
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,458
Holy fuck, who's
blowing shit up?!

80
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,791
Everyone who went
upstairs is dead, man!

81
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,208
Don't just stand there,
you prick! Come on!

82
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,041
Fuck me!
What happened up there?

83
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,166
Hallway's empty. No one's here.

84
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,333
They're gone, man!

85
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,166
Shit! Even the walls are gone!

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,250
That's so messed!
What's going on?

87
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
Shane, heads up!
Enemy sniper!

88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,125
She's on top of the billboard!

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,666
Everyone, take cover!

90
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,041
Major, what do you
think we're up against here?!

91
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,041
Don't know!

92
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,708
Wright and Horner,
lay down suppressive fire!

93
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,750
Everyone else,
move out on the double!

94
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,041
Go, go, go!

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,041
Shit, we didn't
make it in time!

96
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,083
Dammit, she's got some
serious fucking toys, too!

97
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,875
I gonna have to
charge you guys more.

98
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,708
This look like
real war zone to me!

99
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,458
If we can
still hear fighting,

100
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,958
then that means
Roberta is alive!

101
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,625
Garcia.

102
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,125
Yes?

103
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,416
Dutch said that if it ever
came to this I was to pull back.

104
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,583
But if you really wanna
to see this through to the end,

105
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,500
I won't abandon you.

106
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:10,708
I'm going. Roberta needs
my help. I won't let her down.

107
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,666
That quite well said.
Rich boy have heart of warrior.

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,583
Target's location spotted. She's
on an office building roof.

109
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,541
I am deploying my team now.

110
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,125
Wait, Garcia. Take this.

111
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,083
No, it's for later. Read it
in case you lose your way

112
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,875
and you don't
know what to do next.

113
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,416
He isn't coming? Why not?

114
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,208
He's not cut out for this.

115
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,958
He's made for sittin'
in the sun with a cool drink.

116
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,375
Let's go, troops.

117
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,375
In that case, the Young Master's
shouldn't be here either.

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,666
Back at the bar, that was
your first time, wasn't it?

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,125
What?

120
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,666
I could tell that was
the first time you'd ever

121
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,791
shot at people, for real.

122
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,500
You were in an all-out
gunfight with those assholes,

123
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,625
but you didn't
kill a single person

124
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,583
that entire time, did you?

125
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,041
Don't look at
me like that, I know.

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,583
Here's a tip for ya.

127
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,333
Try to think of them
as cardboard targets.

128
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,791
They're just a bunch
of crappy old cut-outs.

129
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,250
If you can pull that
trick off and stay alive,

130
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,625
you'll be an
honest to god gunslinger.

131
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,333
Thank you, but I think
I'll pass on being a--

132
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,583
They're right there!

133
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,708
Now! Cross over!

134
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
Move, she's reloading!

135
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,166
This is D-one!
We're engaging the enemy!

136
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,625
We've got her cornered!

137
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
We're in trouble,
we've got no cover!

138
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,333
Get over there and
help them, D-three.

139
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,666
Bloodhound's on the move!

140
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,125
Madre de Dios.

141
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,625
She's in pursuit of another
group! They're up ahead of us!

142
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,083
Rendezvous with D-three,
keep after the target.

143
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,458
Roger that!

144
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,625
I was wondering
what this was about.

145
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,541
You just can't trust
those cartel assholes.

146
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm hearing a lot of
M-Four carbines out there.

147
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,541
Hurry! We're meeting
up with D-three!

148
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,541
Chinglish! Go!

149
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,375
Why am I gettin' the feeling
she's got this all figured out

150
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,041
and we're being played
like a bunch of fucking newbies?

151
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,666
Shit. How can we question
them if they're all dead?!

152
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,000
Should have thought of that

153
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,208
before you kill
last one so quick.

154
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,916
Any of you pussies
still alive or what?

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,458
This one's alive.

156
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,708
Fuckin' A.

157
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,916
This the guy?
Good find, Spooky.

158
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,916
Hey, beaner!

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,083
Stop it! Don't be rough
on him! His wound is fatal!

160
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:26,000
No shit, Mini-maid. Translate
this: "Where is Roberta?

161
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,208
Tell us and we'll take you
to a doctor." Tell him that.

162
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,166
Le damos la mala intencion.
De donde Rosarita ir?

163
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,333
Queremos saber donde esta.

164
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,458
Si nos dicen, vamos
a llevarte a un hospital.

165
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,166
Rosarita esta
persiguiendo a alguien mas.

166
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,541
Ella se mueve, hacia la
interseccion occidental.

167
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,125
Voy a vivir?

168
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,791
No te preocupes,
Dios protegera su alma.

169
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,416
Roberta is
chasing the Americans

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,666
towards an
intersection to the west.

171
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,333
She's going west. All right.

172
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,208
Does it hurt bad,
beaner? This'll fix it.

173
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
All done.
Must be the intersection

174
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,625
at Ramsap and Nankroy.

175
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,625
Let's haul ass.
We're running outta time.

176
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,000
Come on, Mini-maid!
Try and keep up!

177
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,500
Fabiola!

178
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,916
Mini-maid. You got the wrong
end of that puppy pointed at me.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,750
What the fuck are you thinking?

180
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,583
Why did you shoot him?!
The fighting was over!

181
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,000
Why did you shoot him?!

182
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,416
It's never over
until the last shot.

183
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,250
And it's the same in
the barrios, you know that.

184
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,375
But he was dying and
we'd just promised him

185
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,666
that we would save him!

186
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
And you shot
him like a mangy dog!

187
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,625
What you did to
him was carniceria!

188
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,125
Speak English, chiquita.

189
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,416
She said that it was
overkill, Miss Rebecca.

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,666
You're inhuman! Part of
you kills for the fun of it,

191
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,625
you're no different than the
serial killer Jeffrey Merdah!

192
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,958
You mean Dahmer.

193
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:16,833
Listen maid, I hope
morality lecture be over.

194
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,083
It really boring.
If not, we leave now.

195
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,958
Please, let's go!

196
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,333
We have to hurry if we're
gonna catch up to her now.

197
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,375
That was the right thing
to say, "Young Master."

198
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,125
Sawyer, you're on point.

199
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,500
This place.

200
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,208
It's a nightmare where everyone
knows the Dance of Death.

201
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:40,083
We don't. And that's why we
need experienced mercenaries.

202
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,291
Which is what those women are.

203
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,083
But you're different, Fabiola.

204
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,333
I want you to stay true to
your own beliefs no matter what.

205
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,791
And then, when this
is over, we can go back home.

206
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:56,375
To the home where we all
belong. You, me, and Roberta.

207
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,833
Yes, Young Master.
We're all going home together.

208
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,083
That's why we came here!

209
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,208
It's hard to say if Garcia
will catch up to Roberta.

210
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,833
As for the Americans,

211
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,791
there's really nowhere
for them to hide in this city.

212
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,208
They'll keep running, but
it'll be impossible for them

213
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,750
to lose the
Bloodhound of Florencia.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,916
If I wanna help
those men escape,

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,750
I have to introduce another
factor into the equation.

216
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
That requires one
of the other players

217
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,666
to come out of the shadows.

218
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,458
Now I just have
to coax them out.

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,625
It looks like you
didn't make it in time, Rock.

220
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,041
I can see the smoke from here.

221
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,416
Damn it! The last thing I need
right now is lecture from Chang.

222
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Time for you to call it a day.

223
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,333
Dutch must be in
one hell of a bad mood.

224
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,708
I'm not gonna
do that, Mr. Chang.

225
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,833
All the actors
are still in play.

226
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,458
Like the boy,
and the maid, too.

227
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,958
I'm not ready to leave the
stage just yet. They need me.

228
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,583
Don't give me that nonsense.

229
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,625
When you're playing chess
and the odds are stacked

230
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,375
this heavily against you,
you would forfeit.

231
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,125
Just give it up, Rock.

232
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,416
Now that the whole
city is about to explode,

233
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,375
why bother worrying about
the boy and his little maid?

234
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,375
Rock, you know what
I hate most in this world?

235
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,875
Hypocrisy. It's even worse
than what people call "evil".

236
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,083
It's like a poison that affects
both the victim and the user.

237
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,250
Enough perfume and you can
make a turd smell like a rose,

238
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,000
but underneath it's
still a piece of shit.

239
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,083
You know the deal here, Rock.

240
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,041
Right now, you and
I both view the Lovelace kid

241
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,125
and his maid as nothing
more than chess pieces,

242
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,041
pawns in a game they
don't even understand.

243
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,416
With all due
respect, Mr. Chang,

244
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,916
you are the
goddamn piece of shit!

245
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,666
I love it. I can't
even remember the last time

246
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,000
somebody talked
to me like that!

247
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,791
That's what I
like about you, Rock.

248
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,666
You're angry for two reasons:

249
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,458
One, you're a sore loser because
you know this game is lost.

250
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,875
And two, because I have the
ability to consistently guess

251
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,375
what you're really
thinking deep down.

252
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,750
See, I understand people.
I've looked into the hearts of

253
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:41,000
human beings and seen
things you can't even imagine.

254
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,791
What do you know
of the human heart?

255
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,250
You're a gangster
who lives in a world

256
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,833
of cheap lives and violence!

257
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,375
You want an explanation?

258
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,458
Ya know, this "gangster"
used to be on the other side.

259
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,291
You might not believe it,
but a long, long time ago

260
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,708
he was a fearless guard
dog who burned with justice.

261
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,416
A guard dog for
the Hong Kong police.

262
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,791
That's nothing special.

263
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,833
It's not unusual for people here
to lead lives of contradiction.

264
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,625
Remember, Rock, you're nothing
but a pawn in this game, too.

265
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,958
Just step aside. Do it, before
it's too late to save your soul.

266
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,708
Thank you, Mr. Chang,
but I'm not done.

267
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,791
Fine then, do as you like,
but after a declaration

268
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,500
of defiance like that, I expect
you to put up a good fight.

269
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,750
Goddamnit!

270
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,083
This is Recon Team D-two.
Target is in view.

271
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,375
She's a block away.

272
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,708
Move in closer.

273
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,583
Fuck, why are we still
out here?! We're hurtin', man!

274
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,375
Shut your hole, Jose!

275
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,833
No one wastes my friends
and gets away with it!

276
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,250
Shit!

277
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Ai ya. This really sucks ass.

278
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,625
Think they let us
through if say please?

279
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,916
We'll just have to

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,958
murder every motherfucker
who gets in our way.

281
00:18:55,041 --> 00:19:00,250
I'm completely okay with that. I
just have one question for you.

282
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,958
Well, holy shit. Ya actually
talk? So what's your question?

283
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,958
That elevated platform!

284
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:14,875
Wouldn't diving into battle from
there make for a cool entrance?

285
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,458
Did you have to
bring that freak with us?!

286
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,625
Eh, cut him slack.

287
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,833
You know, he kinda "special".

288
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,416
Still a lot of
gunfire out there.

289
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,291
Who the hell is shooting who?

290
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,750
Let the enemy units through
and then send the Recon.

291
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,916
Eventually they'll link with

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,625
Bravo and Charlie
in a pincer attack.

293
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,250
Everybody, check
your mags. Don't waste ammo.

294
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,375
So, what's the
plan after we get out?

295
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,791
We'll go to
ground outside the city

296
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,000
and wait for
orders from the NSA.

297
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,958
But first things first.
We need to concentrate on

298
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,541
finding and
killing that sniper.

299
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,750
Let's hope we catch a
break and she follows the bait.

300
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,291
Let's go around!

301
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,208
Take this, you motherfuckers!

302
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,750
Fuck, yeah!

303
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,791
Roberta's on the other
side of this crazy fight!

304
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,291
Yeah!

305
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,250
Let's go!

306
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,875
Surprise!

307
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,208
This is D-four. We're
moving to support D-two.

308
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,666
We're entering the area now.

309
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,875
Nobody move!

310
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,625
Get back, Young Master.

311
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,708
But--

312
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,500
Get Outta the way,
you fuckin' brats!

313
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,750
I can pull through if I'm by
myself. Hurry up! Don't move!

314
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,958
Wait!

315
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,333
What do I find on this night

316
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,541
beneath a moon
so clear and blue?

317
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,291
Vile scum who raise
foul blades against children!

318
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,416
Any foes who face the
fury of my beloved sidearm

319
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,375
will be blown to pieces!

320
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,041
God is with me,
he protects me.

321
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,500
And I am his
executioner here on Earth!

322
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,833
Now prepare to face
the wrath of-- Wait!

323
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,291
Awww.

324
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,375
Fabiola!

325
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Young Master!

326
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,250
I can't get over to you!
Just stay there and hide!

327
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay! You hide too, Fabiola!

328
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,500
Another group is
delaying D-four, sir.

329
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,458
All this and we
still haven't found her.

330
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,875
If I were the Americans,
I would prepare a pincer attack.

331
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,041
Rosarita will be expecting it.

332
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,625
We taught her
that strategy in training.

333
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:56,208
I know her. The Bloodhound
will be in here. Find her!

334
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,666
Fabiola?

335
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,958
It's not her!
It's the enemy!

336
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,375
They're still fighting.
This is terrible.

337
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,541
Hmm?

338
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,083
A central nervous
system stimulant.

339
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,958
This is what Roberta
ordered from Dr. Heartland!

340
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,791
Still nothing from Lopez.
He was on the third floor.

341
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,458
We've found her.
She's somewhere upstairs.

342
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:27,125
Roberta's here! Finally!
I've caught up with her!

343
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,708
Lopez!

344
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:46,083
Did you find anything?
Lopez? What's wrong?

345
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,375
It's okay. There's still time!
I know Roberta's still alive!

346
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,458
She's alive, have faith in her!

347
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,083
It seems the Bloodhound
is still as ferocious as ever.

348
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,000
It's no use.
I know all your moves.

349
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,458
We were trained the same way.
I've come from Havana.

350
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,958
You're from the
Cuban Navy's Special Forces.

351
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:58,000
Precisely. The request
came directly from Marulanda,

352
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,958
the leader of FARC.

353
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,125
"Why doesn't he just shoot me?"
I can see it in your eyes...

354
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,333
I could have shot you
dead several times already.

355
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:14,125
Your old commander may
want your head, but not me.

356
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:18,041
You see, when Central would
meet to plan out our operations,

357
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,333
you were always
essential to our strategy.

358
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,083
We thought you might
inherit Carlos' old name.

359
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,833
You could have
been the next Jackal.

360
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:30,791
We need someone in our
organization with your talent.

361
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,458
Come back with me, Bloodhound.

362
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,083
Pretending to be
a maid in a country manor

363
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,041
isn't who you really are.

364
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,541
You can't resist
the smell of blood.

365
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,416
Yeah, you're right.

366
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:51,000
That place was boring. There was
no blood, no gunfire, nothing.

367
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,750
Now that the Master
is dead, it's time to move on.

368
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,916
Once I avenge his death, my
debt to him will have been paid.

369
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,083
This isn't what I
expected from you, Rosarita.

370
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,750
It'll all be over soon.
Just let me finish it.

371
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,833
Very well. A few American
heads should make for

372
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,500
some nice souvenirs.

373
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:21,000
But, I doubt the commander
will simply forgive me.

374
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:25,041
Leave that to me. I have
powerful friends in Havana.

375
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,708
Those FARC pricks
wouldn't dare object.

376
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,583
Considering what's going
to happen, I think it would be

377
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:41,791
a good idea for you to let me
get to know you a little better.

378
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,458
What about those
Americans you need to kill?

379
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:48,333
They're not going to move until
I show up and take the bait.

380
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,333
Besides, it's so hot in here.

381
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:53,375
I can smell the blood
and death everywhere.

382
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,375
It's like a greenhouse
filled with funeral lilies.

383
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,291
Makes me wanna fuck.

384
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,125
Bloodhound, are you testing me?

385
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,666
'Cause I'm in charge here.

386
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,083
You wanna be my dog? Show me.

387
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,208
Be my bitch and
stick out your tongue.

388
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:43,000
Wait! Don't tear my clothes.

389
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,333
I don't want to fight
the Americans naked.

390
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:50,458
Reach down and,
take my pants off. Do it.

391
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:56,083
Don't make me laugh.
Do it yourself.

392
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,750
You're being cautious.
Alright then.

393
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:04,500
Nice and slow.
So don't shoot me.

394
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,791
F-Fucking whore!

395
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,458
What a shame.
You were careful,

396
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,583
but you weren't quite
careful enough, you pig!

397
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,291
I would never join
your damned revolution!

398
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:41,416
Why? Because you and those
foxes serve the same master!

399
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,250
Your so-called principals.

400
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:50,208
They're just illusions. And I'll
never be fooled by them again!

401
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,875
There is only one
person that I serve.

402
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,125
One person who can leash me.

403
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,916
And that's Garcia
Fernando Lovelace.

404
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,958
He is my only master! For
him I would wade in the shit

405
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,875
and mud of this world
and give my life to save his!

406
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,875
It is for him alone that I
kill and seek revenge on those

407
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,666
who destroyed his family!

408
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,833
For him I have severed
all my old allegiances!

409
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:17,875
You're no longer a bloodhound.

410
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:21,500
You're a lone
wolf that's gone mad.

411
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,958
No, Roberta, stop!

412
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,083
No more, that's enough!

413
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,500
Stop it, Roberta!
Please, stop it! Stop it!

414
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,458
Stop it!

415
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:56,583
Young... Master?
Young Master?

416
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:01,500
What are you-- What are
you doing here? No, no, no!

417
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:07,500
No! No!

418
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,458
Oh dear God, don't look
at me! Don't look at me!

419
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,791
Stop. That's enough.
That's enough.

420
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,625
Young Master! No! No! No!

421
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,583
Young Master! Oh my God! What
have I done? What have I done?!

422
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,625
Perhaps your hallucinations
of me were an attempt to

423
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,833
prevent this from happening.

424
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,708
How long? How long
are you going to haunt me?!

425
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,083
Haunt you?

426
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,291
You're wrong about that.

427
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,916
I'm just an old memory
from the time when you attacked

428
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,416
Taisho Electric's
Magnarelli office

429
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,166
and shot two
Japanese technicians.

430
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,375
Remember? An assassination
from seven years ago.

431
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,958
And just before you killed me,

432
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,750
you tore up a
picture of my family.

433
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:04,000
So many sad little wounds
that eventually turned into one.

434
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,750
Filling your world
with pain and misery.

435
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,666
And maybe in those
days of peace and quiet,

436
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,500
you found that wound
didn't hurt quite so much.

437
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,375
If you had lived
the rest of your life

438
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,250
in the company of that child,

439
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,458
then maybe those wounds
would have healed eventually.

440
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,333
But, you are the one
who threw all that away.

441
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,250
It was your choice.

442
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,666
What would it take
to find true forgiveness?

443
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,708
I tried to find peace in that
manor, but what was the point...

444
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:36,625
if I am to be haunted
for all eternity?!

445
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,291
You've hounded
me day and night--

446
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,250
You've never
let me forget my sins!

447
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,541
Why won't you let me forget?!

448
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,333
You took my Master from me

449
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:48,000
and now you've done
this to the Young Master!

450
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,000
Now, I understand.

451
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,750
So that's it. That's
why you showed him to me.

452
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:05,541
You'll try anything
to kill me, won't you?

453
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:10,000
Of course! It's impossible
for the Young Master to be here!

454
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,833
He's still back at
the manor waiting for me

455
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:16,083
to bring him the
heads of the foxes.

456
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,916
When I return,
he'll smile at me

457
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,083
and everything will
go back to how it was.

458
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,041
But you just had
to show me this illusion

459
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,250
of the Young Master
in this hellhole!

460
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,875
You showed me the one
thing I never wanted to see!

461
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:36,041
Well, you've
gone too far this time!

462
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,333
This isn't really
the Young Master!

463
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,666
He's just like you,
something from my imagination!

464
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,416
One shot will prove
that he's not really here!

465
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,250
This is Burroughs!
We've encountered the target!

466
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,041
We've deployed tear gas

467
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,583
and the First Sergeant
has pulled a boy to safety!

468
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,916
First Sergeant Horner here.

469
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,625
We've canceled the feint.
Returning to Point A!

470
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,666
Who's the boy?

471
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,125
You said to read
this if I lost my way.

472
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,916
Did you know
who was going to

473
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,791
have to do it
when you wrote that?!
