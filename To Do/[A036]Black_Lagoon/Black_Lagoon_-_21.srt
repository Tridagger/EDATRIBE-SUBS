Please, we have to
at least warn her.

173
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,666
[REVY] Don't be stupid, Rock.

174
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,250
We're here working
for the Russians,

175
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,083
so what do you think
that makes us?

176
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,666
As far as that girl's concerned,
you and I are enemies.

177
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,083
[ROCK] Please, Revy!

178
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,041
If she's connected to the
Washimine Clan in any way,

179
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
she's gonna end up being
dragged into this!

180
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,250
We've both seen how
Balalaika handles things,

181
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,833
so don't tell me I'm wrong!

182
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,625
Yukio's not like us!

183
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,916
--Hey, Rock.
--She's just a kid!

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,125
Enough!

185
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,250
This is not Roanapur!
It's different here!

186
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,041
[REVY] You really think so?

187
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,791
How is it any different?

188
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,333
Like it or not,
she's in our world now.

189
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,416
And Balalaika will
sort things out here

190
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,416
like she does in Roanapur.

191
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,333
It'd be the same anywhere.

192
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,166
But still, I...

193
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,375
[REVY] Come on, Rock.

194
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,375
You're on the edge of a cliff
and once you jump off,

195
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,666
you're traveling
in one direction.

196
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,625
Your AmeriPass is expired
and the Greyhound

197
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,458
will never travel
this road again.

198
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,666
What I'm trying to say is
this is your country.

199
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,250
Your home, Rock.

200
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,541
And... I just wanna make
sure you understand that.

201
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,791
I do... but...

202
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,833
[REVY] You know what? Fuck it.

203
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,083
Forget what I just said.

204
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,375
There's something
I just remembered.

205
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm just a hired gun on
this trip. In other words,

206
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,833
the only reason I'm here
is to protect your life,

207
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,041
not to interfere with it and try
and change your mind and stuff.

208
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,791
So, lead the way... Boss.

209
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,041
[wind whistling]

210
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,166
[BELLHOP] Uh, thank you.

211
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,875
So, you don't want any
phone calls coming through

212
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,041
unless they're from
the Russian Embassy.

213
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,791
That's correct... right,
Miss... um... Vlatinera?

214
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,833
That's right.
Thanks for everything.

215
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,666
Um, if there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to ask.

216
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,875
That boy is at the peak
of his adorableness.

217
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,250
Now then, Sergeant.

218
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,916
Yes, <i>Kapitän</i> .
The recon team report.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,625
As of now, "Attack Point Two"
is in stage yellow.

220
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,125
They've set up a security
perimeter around Kousa's office.

221
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,166
The police here
are actually skilled.

222
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,750
Yes. Police who don't accept
bribes are always competent.

223
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,666
It's a matter of
quality, Sergeant.

224
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,000
Have you seen the news?

225
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,916
[BORIS] Yes. It would
appear that comrade Laptev

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,833
did a fine job.

227
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,333
Indeed he did. For a
useless KGB agent,

228
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,125
he reconnoitered
the enemy quite well.

229
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,375
His successor in Tokyo will
be Bulgazivry the Priest.

230
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,458
I hear he's very skilled
with the abacus.

231
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,583
Not surprisingly, they've
left the violence up to us.

232
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,041
So, let's get to work, Sergeant.

233
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,000
[YOSHIDA] That was
a job well done, Miss.

234
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,083
They should be contacting the
office with the results shortly.

235
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,083
Right. Thank you very
much, Mr. Yoshida.

236
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,250
Oh, ah, Miss...

237
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
I'm sorry about what
happened at your school.

238
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,541
I knew it would
cause you trouble,

239
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,541
but I didn't feel
we had a choice, so I...

240
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,208
I understand. It was
something she was going

241
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,583
to have to find out
about eventually.

242
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,708
The truth is you may
have done me a big favor

243
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,416
by showing up.

244
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
Thanks again, Mr. Yoshida.

245
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,625
[YOSHIDA] Please, Miss,
you're being much too kind!

246
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,916
In any case, it's getting
too cold for you out here,

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,125
so please, go inside and...

248
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,083
Well, look who it is! You're
here sooner than I expected!

249
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,000
It's too bad really. I was
hoping to surprise you guys!

250
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,041
Chaka! What the hell
are you doing here?!

251
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,875
You were given your station!

252
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,375
--Why aren't you there?!
--[CHAKA] Come on, man. Ease up.

253
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,041
Think of the situation.

254
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,541
Isn't that right, Miss?

255
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,666
[YOSHIDA] You need to learn
your place, goddamn it!

256
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,583
This would never be
allowed and you know it!

257
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,333
You listening, you little...

258
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,666
Chaka? Are these... your guys?

259
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,083
[CHAKA] Mr. Yoshida,
you know what?

260
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,416
You're too... trusting.

261
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,500
[YUKIO gasps]

262
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,333
Did that hurt? Sorry
about that, old timer.

263
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,125
Fuck you!

264
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,625
[CHAKA] How should
I put this...?

265
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,208
My loyalty costs money and
the family can't afford to pay.

266
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,125
It doesn't really matter if
it's Kousa or the Russians.

267
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,458
If we can offer her as a gift,

268
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,791
they'll welcome us with
open arms. Right, Miss?

269
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,375
Miss. Get outta here!

270
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,916
You know something... you're a
real pain in the ass, old-timer!

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,958
So, fuck it. I'm done with you.

272
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,375
Here, have some more!

273
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,041
Hey!

274
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,583
That hurt!

275
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,500
--Dumb slut.
--Aw, you're fucked.

276
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,791
Hanada can be pretty
scary when he snaps.

277
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,166
[THUG 1] That bitch
is in for it now.

278
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,750
[HANADA] Don't you know
you can hurt someone

279
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,750
when you run into 'em like that?

280
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,833
You listening to me?!
I said it hurt!

281
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,458
I'm serious, you little
fucking slut!

282
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,958
You sure there's nothing
you wanna say to me?!

283
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,166
How about "I'm sorry"?! Or
"I apologize"?! Let's hear it!

284
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,291
Now get up!

285
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,291
[CHAKA] Hey, hey, Hanada.

286
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,666
--Huh?
--I don't remember telling you

287
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,541
to beat the shit outta her.

288
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,500
If you start acting up...

289
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,166
...I'll fucking kill you.

290
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,625
Looks like I owe you
an apology, Yukio.

291
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,083
The thing is about this bunch,
there's a lot of guys here

292
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,291
who have a hard time
controlling their tempers.

293
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,958
[THUGS laughing]

294
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,583
[OKAZAKI] Now who's
the bitch, Hanada?

295
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,333
Well, at least now you know.

296
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,625
You better learn
to follow orders

297
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,416
or it could get dangerous.

298
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,375
Hey, Rock, d'ya think
this is the only entrance?

299
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,625
Revy, we're uninvited
guests here.

300
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,708
The backdoor would be--

301
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,208
No, Rock. Haven't you noticed?

302
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't know about you,

303
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,500
but I'd recognize
that smell anywhere.

304
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,166
Footprints! Oh, no! Yukio!

305
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,083
Don't just rush in, Rock!

306
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,291
Yukio!

307
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,500
Damn it.

308
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
[REVY] Was it Balalaika?

309
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,416
If it was, Yukio would be
lying here right next to him.

310
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,791
As far as they're concerned,

311
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,375
that girl has no value
as a hostage.

312
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,583
She uses a Stechkin. The other
guys use military autos

313
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,541
like Variags. Maybe even AKs.

314
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,791
But I'm looking around and
I don't see a single casing.

315
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,625
They used a revolver.

316
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,708
[REVY] Yep. Poor old Yoshida.

317
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,166
Now the breeze blows
right through his body.

318
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,916
Look at that. This hole is huge.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,791
It was high caliber. Any idiot
using a gun like this

320
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,541
has gotta be some
show-off wannabe

321
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,250
who's beyond all salvation.

322
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,625
I can think of one guy who
fits that description exactly.

323
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,333
It's him! But why
betray his own?

324
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,625
That's strange.

325
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,791
Why don't I smell
any gunpowder?

326
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,000
That's right, Jumbo.
My gun had nothing to do

327
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,416
with how Yoshida bought
the farm, alright.

328
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,500
Mr. Ginji. We didn't do this.

329
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,666
And Hotel Moscow's not
responsible for this either.

330
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,041
We came here to try and get
Yukio away from the fighting

331
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,708
and we ended up
walking into this.

332
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,708
You have to trust me.
Revy and I...

333
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,916
...we're not involved
with what Hotel Moscow's...

334
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,333
Wait, Mr. Ginji!
Please just hear me out!

335
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,083
I didn't hear a car pull up
when you got here.

336
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:20,250
Which means, you came
here on foot... alone.

337
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,666
There are tread marks
everywhere out front.

338
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,208
Judging by that and the number
of footprints in the house,

339
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,500
we know that whoever
did this came in numbers

340
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,208
and from a distance.

341
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,000
Tell me... Do you
plan to go alone?

342
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,541
This doesn't concern you.

343
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,791
We don't have time!

344
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,000
It was one of your
own who did this!

345
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,541
Think about it.

346
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
He knows you'll
be coming for her

347
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,833
and he's gonna be
prepared for that.

348
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,541
He's expecting you.

349
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,750
But what if a skilled gunman
happened to be at your side?

350
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,541
He wouldn't have
accounted for that.

351
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,375
So, you want to know
where he is, do you?

352
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,833
[REVY] Every station
is just someone talking.

353
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,375
Isn't there any music?

354
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,458
I don't have a fuckin'
clue what they're saying.

355
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,625
Try FEN.

356
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,625
[REVY] The last couple
songs they played

357
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,750
have been fuckin' lousy.

358
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,166
Yeah! Guitar Wolf!
I love these guys!

359
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
This ain't no fuckin' J-Pop.

360
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,416
Take a left at the
next intersection.

361
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,416
Why are you helping us?
It doesn't make any sense.

362
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,833
I'm helping 'cause she
doesn't belong in this world.

363
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,041
She deserves better.

364
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,750
I don't want her to be robbed of
a chance to live a normal life.

365
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,958
[GINJI] If someone had
just given her a chance,

366
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,125
maybe she would've
had a normal life.

367
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,583
If only she'd been
given the chance...

368
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,666
[CHAKA] Strike!

369
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,208
All I need is one more point.

370
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,583
What d'ya say, Okazaki?

371
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,208
The top or the bottom?

372
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,041
[CHAKA] Ahh... I say bottom.

373
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,875
[OKAZAKI] Alright, but once
she's completely naked,

374
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,416
the game's over.

375
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,833
[CHAKA] Yeah. There's plenty
of things we can do with her,

376
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:32,250
like shaving her bush.
That would be hilarious!

377
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
[REVY] It's the Dark Tower.

378
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,791
The knight has arrived
to save the princess.

379
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,916
Rock. Jumbo and
I'll take the front.

380
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
You sneak in from the back door.

381
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,083
But what should I do?

382
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,791
[REVY] Simple, Rock. Just cover
our backs when we need you to.

383
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,333
That's it.

384
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,625
Revy! You barely know him!

385
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,875
--Can you really--
--[REVY] No problem.

386
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
Once the fighting begins,

387
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,083
our instincts will take
over and that'll be it.

388
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,625
No preparation necessary.

389
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,333
It's just how we're made.

390
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,583
[REVY] You're spending
the night in Hell's Motel.

391
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,833
Better start running

392
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,041
'cause the boogeyman's
coming to eat you up!
