00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,916
Roberta.

2
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,916
Get down! Both of you!

3
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,916
[ROCK] Get outta the way!

4
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,416
[GARCIA] No! Please
don't shoot Roberta!

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
If this could kill her,

6
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,708
we wouldn't be in
this fuckin' mess.

7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,583
[GARCIA] Roberta!

8
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,666
[horn honking]

9
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,166
Oh, shit!

10
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,375
Damn it!

11
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,333
Dutch! We're off the main road!

12
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,416
We're headed right
for the ocean.

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,375
There's nowhere to go.
It's a dead end.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
Shit, we're screwed!

15
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,708
No!

16
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:27,875
[crow cawing]

17
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,583
It pays to be a
religious man, after all.

18
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,791
All survivors, speak up.

19
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,583
Somehow, we're both alive.

20
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
[DUTCH] What about Revy?

21
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[ROCK] She never even woke up.
Still knocked out.

22
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,416
You okay, Benny?

23
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,625
[BENNY] You've
gotta be kidding!

24
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,416
What the hell's
this woman made of?

25
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
[REVY] Damn it.

26
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
Revy.

27
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,625
Fucking hell. Hey, what
happened to that stupid bitch?

28
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,958
She dead yet? Well?

29
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,916
You're in luck.
She's alive and well.

30
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,125
[REVY] Well, that's the
best news I've heard all day.

31
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,875
I've got an errand to run.

32
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,458
Wait! Revy!

33
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,208
[REVY] Listen closely, Rock.

34
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,708
I'm about to light up
like a goddamn firecracker

35
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,416
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

36
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,041
When that happens,
it's pretty much over.

37
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,416
I'm not even gonna warn you

38
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,416
before I give you
a second asshole.

39
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,916
When she decided to
use that shell on me,

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,250
she made a big fuckin' mistake.

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
I'm gonna make that bitch
wish she was still home,

42
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,166
cleaning shitty toilets.

43
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,708
It's time to go teach
this fucking cunt

44
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,875
the meaning of pain.

45
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,458
[sirens in distance]

46
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,791
Make a move, <i>señorita</i> .
Or are you scared?

47
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,833
You fuckin' should be.

48
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,708
[ROBERTA] I have no
need for filthy language

49
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,208
and idle threats.
You will not find me

50
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,041
so easily intimidated.

51
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,375
Knowing you could not
defeat me with skill alone,

52
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,083
you chose to hide behind
the young master instead.

53
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,083
You are a coward.

54
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,166
[DUTCH] Rock, watch out
for stray bullets.

55
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
I can't see them.

56
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,625
They just disappeared.

57
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,458
[gunshot in distance]

58
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,583
Roberta.

59
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,583
[gunfire]

60
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,166
Oww... Damn it.

61
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,375
Somehow, she managed to put
a bullet in the great Revy.

62
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,041
Who the fuck is this woman?

63
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,625
I'm no shrink, but you must've
had one fucked up childhood.

64
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,625
Where'd you come from?

65
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,208
Tell me!

66
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,583
[seagulls]

67
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,125
I get it now.

68
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,500
I thought I knew that smell
lingering around you.

69
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,875
I'd recognize that
scent anywhere.

70
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,583
It's the smell of gutter mud
still clinging to your feet.

71
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,750
It's perfect, really.

72
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,416
All the more reason why
we need to finish this off.

73
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,208
[birds chirping]

74
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,041
[ROBERTA] I can't go back.

75
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,625
I can never return there now.

76
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,458
Roberta!

77
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,083
Now...

78
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,458
What's the plan?

79
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,875
I suppose we should try
to get outta this car.

80
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,875
Whaddya think?

81
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,583
Uh... Yeah, you're right.

82
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,666
Roberta!

83
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:42,875
How?

84
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,583
It's impossible, alright.

85
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,166
We'd never make it no matter
how many lives we had.

86
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,541
I'm not about to go
anywhere near that fight.

87
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,083
[BENNY] Amen!

88
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,208
You know what they say--

89
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,000
there's an end to
every beginning.

90
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,625
I'm sure they'll
settle this eventually.

91
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,250
Hey, kid! Whadda you doing?

92
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,041
Garcia, wait.

93
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,041
Roberta!

94
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,208
You can win!

95
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,375
Roberta!

96
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:16,083
Don't you let that
woman beat you!

97
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,916
Sounds like the gunfire
is getting closer.

98
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,833
[REVY] This bitch! I'll kill
her! I swear I'll kill her!

99
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,750
[ROBERTA] I'm gonna
send you straight to Hell!

100
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
[BALALAIKA] Osta-noh-vee-tish!
[don't move]

101
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,833
Why don't you call it
quits now, you two?

102
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,000
Neither one of you
stands to gain anything

103
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,166
from continuing this battle.

104
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,083
So, stop wasting your
energy, Two-Hands.

105
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,916
Shut up.

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,416
I'm gonna kill this bitch.

107
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,500
[BALALAIKA] There's something
you should probably know,

108
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,666
Miss Maid.

109
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,666
Hotel Moscow has
been planning a war

110
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,375
against the Manisarela
Cartel for some time,

111
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,666
so imagine my surprise.

112
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,458
Taking care of this one was
actually supposed to be my job,

113
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,791
but you came along and
saved me the trouble.

114
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,333
As we speak, their
headquarters in Venezuela

115
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,041
should be in ruins.

116
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,541
Therefore, all of our problems
have now been solved.

117
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,916
Garcia's kidnapping has also
been dealt with and he may go.

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,750
So, you have no
reason to fight, do you?

119
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,125
Those are no doubt the
three most terrifying

120
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,416
women in the world.

121
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,375
This feels way too
much like Ground Zero.

122
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,416
It doesn't matter.

123
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,708
Indeed.

124
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,666
Is that so?

125
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,083
Don't misunderstand me, ladies.

126
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,083
That's not just some
friendly suggestion.

127
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,958
It's an order.

128
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,666
[ROCK] Who are those guys
and where did they come from?

129
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,833
They don't seem like they're
just ordinary Russian mafia.

130
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,250
Those uniforms...
Are they military?

131
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,791
Roberta!

132
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,041
You don't have
to worry, Roberta!

133
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,041
Look at me! I'm fine!
They never even hurt me!

134
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,666
Please. Let's go home!

135
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,791
This has to stop.

136
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,750
I don't wanna see you
with a gun anymore.

137
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
I don't want you to kill.

138
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,750
I agree, kid. You're right.

139
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,375
But...

140
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,458
...what does the Bloodhound
think about that?

141
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,041
Bloodhound?

142
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,333
Oh... so no one ever
bothered to tell you?

143
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,500
--Well...
--You shut up!

144
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,000
[BALALAIKA] I suggest
you keep quiet, bitch.

145
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,541
Let me tell you...

146
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,208
I'm not sure what you think,
but this isn't just some servant

147
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,875
who looks good walking the dog.

148
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,625
She's the Bloodhound
of Florencia.

149
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,708
Rosarita Cisneros.

150
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,708
Trained as an assassin in Cuba,

151
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,083
she's a former
FARC guerilla.

152
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,791
She's wanted internationally

153
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,666
for multiple
kidnappings and murders.

154
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,000
And she's a suspect in the
bombing of the US embassy

155
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
in Tegucigalpa.

156
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,166
She's a real hardcore terrorist.

157
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,416
[GARCIA] Roberta...

158
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,458
Is it true?

159
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,000
[ROBERTA] I swear
that I never intended

160
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,750
to deceive you, Master Garcia.
However, there are things...

161
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,041
There are some things
in this world

162
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,166
that it's better not to know.

163
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,541
They bring only sadness.

164
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,541
Everything she said
is the truth.

165
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,083
I... I believed in it
with all my heart.

166
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,666
I believed in the
dawn of a revolution

167
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,750
that would bring justice
to this world at last.

168
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,708
For that reason and
that reason alone...

169
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,416
...I became a soldier.

170
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,875
In the blind pursuit
of this ideal,

171
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,041
I killed in every
place imaginable.

172
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,166
Politicians, businessmen,
counter-revolutionaries,

173
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,583
election officials.

174
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,458
I even killed women
and children.

175
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,083
So many of my nights
stained with blood...

176
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,750
Countless mornings spent
feeling cold and empty,

177
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,125
and what I realized in the end

178
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,875
was that I was
no revolutionary.

179
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,250
I was nothing more
than a guard dog

180
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,791
working for the mafia, helping
to protect their coca fields.

181
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,625
Isn't it ironic?

182
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,125
The revolutionaries

183
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,291
working side by side
with the cartels.

184
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,666
They said revolution would not
be possible with ideals alone.

185
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,208
And in saying that,

186
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,458
they'd already sold their
souls and I knew it was over.

187
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,333
My only option was
to leave the military.

188
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,541
And there was just one
man I could think of

189
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,541
who would agree
to take me in.

190
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,416
A close friend of
my deceased father.

191
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,625
The man who saved me was
none other than your father,

192
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,750
Master Diego Lovelace.

193
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
Master Garcia,

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,458
allowing your
kidnapping to happen

195
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,958
was negligence on
my part. I failed you.

196
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,166
And then I knew of no other
way to save you except to

197
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,708
awaken a side of myself that
had long been hidden away.

198
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,083
A side of me that I
had abandoned long ago.

199
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,125
Bloodhound. Guard dog.

200
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,500
I've lived my
entire life as a dog.

201
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,791
And this is the only
way that I know

202
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,125
how to prove my
devotion to you.

203
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,000
I wanted to repay
you with my life.

204
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,875
No! How could you call
yourself a dog, Roberta?!

205
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Don't believe in those lies!

206
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,750
We're a family,
aren't we, Roberta?!

207
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,791
So, how could you
ever say you're a dog?!

208
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,875
You're nothing like that!

209
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,583
It's just not true!

210
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,583
And I don't know
any Bloodhound!

211
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,625
She died a long time ago!

212
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,875
There's no more
Rosarita, either!

213
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
I bet she moved
somewhere far away

214
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,333
to try and hide from her sins!

215
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,666
Don't you see?!

216
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,500
That woman has got nothing
to do with you anymore!

217
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,125
The only one I see
here is my Roberta!

218
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,500
Young Master.

219
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,166
[GARCIA] So...

220
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,500
Let's go.

221
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,041
I... I just wanna
go back home now.

222
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,583
It's okay, Young Master.
Let me dry your eyes.

223
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,041
Boys should not cry so easily.

224
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm glad that's settled.

225
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,375
We could've had a
big mess on our hands.

226
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,541
[REVY] Give me a fuckin' break.

227
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,458
I'm sure everybody
is just delighted

228
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,875
with this teary-eyed
happy ending.

229
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,208
Well, fuck that!

230
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,958
I'm not gonna pretend
to be happy about it.

231
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,291
What about this fuckin'
tunnel in my shoulder? Huh?

232
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,208
Couldn't you just let that go?

233
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,791
Come on now, Sis. We both
know that's not cool.

234
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,375
Even criminals have a code of
honor. We have to settle this.

235
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,541
You know that perfectly
well, Sis, so come on.

236
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,541
Hmm... Yes, you
do have a point.

237
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,708
Well, seems obvious to me.

238
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,250
A little bare-knuckle boxing
until they're satisfied.

239
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,375
Anyway, I doubt
that anyone will die.

240
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,958
Fine by me!

241
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,083
Young Master?

242
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,500
Don't you lose to
that woman, okay?

243
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,625
You're stronger
than her, Roberta!

244
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Well, then I guess it's decided.

245
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,916
Go for as long as you want.

246
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,375
Fine.

247
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
I'm gonna make
you uglier, bitch.

248
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,208
But before we start,

249
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,500
your shoelace is untied.

250
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
She got one in!

251
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,708
Must be nice to be so young.

252
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,375
[REVY] Damn it!

253
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,791
Come on, Roberta!

254
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,458
Don't lose to her!

255
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,916
Who are you betting on?

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,125
I'm going with two on Revy.

257
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,500
Alright, then I'll hafta
go with three on Roberta.

258
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,333
You, Rock?

259
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,875
W-Wait a minute!
We should stop this, right?!

260
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,041
We can't let this go on!

261
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
Hm? Why not?!

262
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,958
[ROCK] Well...well,
it's completely barbaric!

263
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,500
Am I the only one
who sees this?

264
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,250
It's totally insane to have
two girls going at it like that!

265
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,541
Then why don't you
go and stop them?

266
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,541
You said you don't like this.

267
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,916
I did, but--

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,958
[BALALAIKA] Then get out
there and put a stop to it.

269
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,125
Really, don't worry
about it, we don't mind.

270
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,833
[ROCK] Umm...
Excuse me. Ladies?

271
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,125
Haven't you had enough
of this fighting?

272
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,541
Why not try this--sit down
and talk things through.

273
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,750
I'm sure you have more
in common than you thought.

274
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,333
--Stay the fuck out of this!
--Stay the fuck out of this!

275
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,791
Or I could do that. Great idea.

276
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,750
[DUTCH] What did you expect?

277
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:15,208
[BALALAIKA] They just won't
give up. This is getting boring.

278
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,708
Why won't you die?

279
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,125
Die already, fuckin' four-eyes!

280
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,375
Same to you. W-Why the hell
won't you just go down?

281
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,916
Damn you! Take this, bitch!

282
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,833
There! It's a draw.

283
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,500
[GARCIA] Roberta!

284
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,291
Young Master...

285
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,208
I'm so sorry.
I should've beaten her.

286
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,041
[GARCIA] No, don't talk.

287
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,791
In the end, you were
the last one standing.

288
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,083
So... it's alright.

289
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:01,958
[chuckling]

290
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
[DUTCH] That's a terrible sight.

291
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,708
[ROCK] She's out cold.

292
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,875
Can you stand? Hang on to me.

293
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,250
[ROBERTA] I'm sorry.

294
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,291
Don't you say that, Roberta.

295
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,791
You want a hand
with her, Garcia?

296
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,791
[GARCIA] Leave us alone.

297
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,208
I don't need anyone's
help looking after her.

298
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,666
Roberta is a maid at my house. 

299
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,250
So, it's my job to get her home.

300
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,916
Spoken like the
future patriarch.

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
--Comrade Sergeant.
--Ma'am.

302
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,666
Treat her wounds, then
take them to the airport.

303
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,458
If any remaining cartel
members attempt an attack,

304
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,875
dispose of them immediately.

305
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,416
Understood.

306
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,125
I have a favor
to ask, please....

307
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
What?

308
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,416
It's my glasses... Could you
go and pick them up for me?

309
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,541
Why?

310
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,708
I mean, they're just
fake, aren't they?

311
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
Yes.

312
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,958
However, I need them.

313
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,541
Those glasses help
me believe I'm her.

314
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,250
I just want to be your Roberta.

315
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,625
[ROCK] Hey! It's morning,
Revy! Wake up!

316
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,041
That barely registered.

317
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,500
I do not wanna be around when
she wakes up. Won't be pretty.

318
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,833
But...

319
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,500
...who were those
guys back there?

320
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,416
You know, all those guys
from the Russian mafia.

321
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,875
They were, like, military.

322
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,208
Actually, they're
ex-miliatry. You're close.

323
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,500
They were either paratroopers
or in the Special Forces.

324
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,458
Her immediate subordinates
have enough training

325
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,958
to fight and win World War III
if they wanted to.

326
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,625
They're pretty much
all Afghan vets

327
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,833
with an insane amount
of experience and skill.

328
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,666
She was the brains
of the operation

329
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,916
and these men became
unstoppable killing machines.

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,541
Eventually, these same guys
returned from that hell

331
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,041
of hot sand and carnage.

332
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,958
[ROCK] Everyone's
feet are covered

333
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,125
with mud from the gutter.

334
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,083
[CHANG] Five teams will leave
Roanapur at the same time

335
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,541
and each will have a completely
different destination.

336
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,500
There are five cases.
