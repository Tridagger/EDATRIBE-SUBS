178
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
We figured we'd capture them,

179
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,916
and then use them to
negotiate with Move Point.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,166
To get into the
building without windows.

181
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,708
[MERCENARY 05A]
Yes.

182
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,041
BLOCK figured out that Move
Point was the secret guide.

183
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,333
Since it can't be
destroyed from the outside,

184
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,041
we were assigned to learn
how supplies were delivered,

185
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,708
and use that information
to blow the building

186
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,791
up from the inside using
synchronous composite bombs.

187
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,083
Is that so? Interesting.

188
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,875
Do you even know who's
standing in front of you

189
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,041
right now?

190
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,000
No! You can't be!

191
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,333
[yells]

192
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,958
Time to go. Are you ready?

193
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,916
Check it out.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,041
It's the world's one and only
esper internment facility.

195
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,250
They've installed
AIM jammers in there,

196
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,833
so you know what that means.

197
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,000
Yep, sure do.

198
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,500
It means none of us
will be able to use

199
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,041
our abilities inside.

200
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
[TSUCHIMIKADO] It's not
that you can't use them.

201
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,666
But it's possible they
could spin out of control.

202
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,833
[ACCELERATOR]
Well...

203
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,166
Sounds like it's best
for us to refrain

204
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,708
from using ability mode.

205
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Makes sense now.

206
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,958
I wondered why it was
so quiet around here.

207
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,291
Looks like every one of these
guys killed themselves

208
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,833
with their own weapons.

209
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,916
[XOCHITL]
There you are.

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,083
[ACCELERATOR] If you're here,
then that must mean

211
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,875
you're with BLOCK.

212
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,791
Not true. I'm from MEMBER.

213
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,083
I was just using those guys.

214
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,500
Etzali! The reason
I did it was to find you!

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,375
This girl is Xochitl.

216
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,375
She's an Aztecan sorceress
from my organization.

217
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,458
The one I used to be in.

218
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,083
A sorceress?

219
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,625
You filthy traitor.

220
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,500
I abandoned everything
to come here today

221
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
and dispose of you.
I don't care about the rest.

222
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,250
You guys go ahead.

223
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,333
I'll stay here and
clean up this mess.

224
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,791
I can't believe we're
cornered here like this

225
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
while BLOCK's inside.

226
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,958
You guys need to
hurry it up and get going.

227
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,583
I move the slowest
out of all of us,

228
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,708
so I'll stay here
and hold them off.

229
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,916
Tsuchimikado. Make sure
you've got Musujime's back.

230
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,458
Let's get movin.' 

231
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,500
[TESHIO] Won't we get
hurt when the blast goes off?

232
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,208
[SAKU]
Not at all.

233
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,708
It's rigged to direct the
explosion into the door.

234
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,500
There're 38 kids
being detained here.

235
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,291
So it's really not gonna
make any difference

236
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,250
if we blow up one
or two of them.

237
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,666
You didn't mention that before!

238
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,666
Heh. Don't tell me you've got
a soft spot for these kids

239
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,625
all of a sudden.

240
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,291
[gunshots]

241
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,416
[ARMY yelling]

242
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,625
What a bunch of morons.

243
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
Stop!

244
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,375
I haven't finished
packing the explosives yet,

245
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,000
which means the results
could be unpredictable.

246
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,708
I'm afraid I can't
guarantee the kids' safety.

247
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,041
Don't you dare
touch that detonator.

248
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,958
Awaki Musujime,
the famous Move Point.

249
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,500
That saves us some time.

250
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,125
Tell me something, GROUP.

251
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,208
The incident on September
30th sure was something, huh?

252
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,916
You learn anything from it?

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,458
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,333
I know I certainly
learned a lot.

255
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,250
I always thought Aleister
controlled every corner

256
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,125
of this world, but he doesn't.

257
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,916
It turns out there's a way to
get out from under his thumb

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,958
and places to flee where his
authority isn't recognized.

259
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
So you're traveling to
the new world on the backs

260
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,416
of others?

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,125
Honestly, that's not something
I'd brag about if I were you.

262
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,791
Nothing wrong with
hoping for a Heaven

263
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,000
or a paradise that
doesn't exist for us yet.

264
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,333
It's something we all
have in common--

265
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,416
[TESHIO]
That's enough.

266
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,458

Huh?

00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,583
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Don't move!

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
What are you
trying to pull here?

269
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,708
Believe me when I say
I have my own reasons

270
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,833
for wanting Aleister dead,
but I will never take hostages!

271
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,291
I'll keep roughing
you up personally

272
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,875
until I have the information!

This is how a pro does it.

277

We don't need magic
abilities or cute one-liners.

Just years of experience
and fundamental tactics.

[XOCHITL]
Tell me, Etzali.

282
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,083
Does it look different
when it's that close?

283
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,125
[UNABARA]
She takes control of the weapon.

284
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,208
And then uses it to kill
the enemy without getting

285
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,125
her own hands dirty.

286
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,083
I guess you could say
it's like a suicide spell.

[UNABARA grunting]

288
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,166
You dropped something.

Aren't you going to pick it up?

290
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,666
What happened to you?

291
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,250
You shouldn't even
know about spells

292
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,916
with this kind of power.

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,291
No, wait.

294
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,000
Didn't you take the
position to never be involved

00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,625
in violent acts?

00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,541
Tell me what's
going on with you!

happening in the organization

A weapon like that is
not very becoming of you.

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,958
Then let's see what
it says about you

305

and what you've become.

You, who abandoned us.

307
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,791
And now you just want
to hide your face

308
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,250
and undermine the peace?

313
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,833
You lured me in!

314
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,041
[UNABARA] The Aztecs have
no way of processing metal

into their weapons,

316
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,833
which means your sword really
isn't as sharp as it looks.

317
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,041
So if I was willing
to be cut to the bone,

318
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,750
I could actually stop it
with my own limbs.

319

Like I said earlier.

320

doesn't suit you.

to take your life.

What's got you so
angry with Aleister

I've experienced serious
tragedy in this city,

and I deserve to find out
if he was involved in it.

I want answers. That's all.

00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,791
Trust me, I know what
it's like to be fixated

on finding out the
truth about something.

335
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,583
But... Nothing he'd say
would provide peace of mind.

336
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,541
You would be suspicious
of any answer he gave you.

337
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,750
Is that so?

338
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,333
Then how do you find peace?

339
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,125
[MUSUJIME] The trauma
I've sustained is keeping me

340

from transporting myself,

fight hand to hand either.

[MUSUJIME]
Right.

343
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,291
It's because this is
my constant mindset.

If I don't change it, I'll never
be able to protect anyone.

Yeah, and I hope you're ready,

I'll overcome this.

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,666
I can overcome this.

I can overcome everything
about these infuriating scars!

[TESHIO grunts]

352
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,875
Pretty bold. Good job.

353
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,083
I know it's unfortunate.

354
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,541
But this is the
kind of leadership

355
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,500
that's expected
of me these days.

356
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,500
Xochitl. What in the world?

357
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,125
If you ever try to compensate
for lack of abilities

358
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,333
with a grimoire,

359
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,833
this is the kind of
thing that can happen.

360
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,333
You could learn from me.

361
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,916
What? You mean you read one?

362
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,166
[XOCHITL]
No. It's worse than that.

363
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,083
What are you saying?

364
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,458
That you've fused with
the original grimoire text?

365
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,208
You tried to gain more power
by making it a part of you?

366
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
Any spell that distorts
your own body will fail!

367
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,375
You had to have known that much!

368
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,583
Sure, but it doesn't matter
as long as I'm still able

369
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,541
to kill you while
it's consuming me.

370
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,875
If I do it before I die,

371
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,375
then the organization's
goal is achieved.

372
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,833
The organization that I knew
was already terrible enough.

373
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,333
But what the hell's been
happening while I've been away?

374
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,083
You won't die. I won't let you.

375
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,250
The original text will
display its knowledge

376
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,750
to anyone who desires it.

377
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,166
I'll have to visualize
it consuming me.

378
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,708
And that should allow me to
draw it completely out of her.

379
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,958
Of course there's no precedent,
so if I fail, it'll kill me.

380
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,375
[FRIEND 05A]
I always believed in you.

381
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,041
FRIEND 05B] I knew trusting
you was the right call.

382
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,375
Thank you so much for coming.

383
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,000
[FRIEND 05C]
It's enough that you're here.

384
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,500
[FRIEND 05D]
Okay, go on. Get going.

385
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,750
You're sure about this?

386
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,500
I am. It's for the best.

387
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,666
[ACCELERATOR]
Damn, you're slow.

388
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
Guess it's about that time.

389
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,875
Back into the darkness.

390
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,333

392
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,500
[KAKINE]
Come on.

393
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,208
Damn, you're pretty tight
lipped for someone

394
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,458
who's got no chance
of leaving here alive.

395
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,208
Looks like I might just have to
start cleaning a little house.

396
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,291
[FRENDA]
No, please don't.

397
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,708
Fine, I'll tell you everything.

398
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,416
[KAKINE]
Wow.

399
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,583
You've got a pretty
cushy base here, huh?

400
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,208
[KAMIJO]
Those who have power survive.

401
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,833
White wings spit upon
conventional principles,

402
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,041
and sneer at common knowledge.

403
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,291
Next time, "Super-espers."

404
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,125
When science and
magic cross paths,

405
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,416
a story is born.
