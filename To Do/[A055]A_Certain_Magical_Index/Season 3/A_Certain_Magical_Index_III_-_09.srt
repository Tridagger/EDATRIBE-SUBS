1
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,625
Hacking by way
of magic, are you?

2
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,750
[KANZAKI yells]

3
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,166
You really are quite
something else.

4
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,333
But it seems to me
your body is screaming

5
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,708
from all this high-speed
combat, isn't it?

6
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,166
[KANZAKI] The power of Gabriel
dwelt within Misha Kruezhev.

7
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,916
That incarnation seems
to have been incomplete.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,916
But I'm sensing something
greater from Acqua.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,375
Still, can a human really
possess this much power?

10
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,333
[KANZAKI yells]

11
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,041
It's been a long time since
I've had a decent workout.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,083
However, it's about
time to finish this.

13
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,291
[ACQUA]
T-H-M-I-M-S-S-P!

14
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,458
What is this?

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,333
[ACQUA]
T-C-T-C-D-B-P-T-T.

16
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,583
R-O-G-B. W-I-M-A-A-T-H!

17
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,083
Now tell me where
to find Imagine Breaker.

18
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,541
Perhaps,

19
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,791
if I continue breaking through
all the various levels,

20
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,083
I may eventually run into him.

21
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,583
[KANZAKI]
Acqua!

22
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,625
[KANZAKI coughs]

23
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,500
You are no longer in any
shape to continue fighting me.

24
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,958
[KANZAKI] I won't let the
reason that boy demonstrated

25
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,833
or the conviction he showed
by risking his life

26
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,500
be trampled underfoot
by this coward.

27
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,250
With nothing but his talent!

28
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,500
[KANZAKI gasps]

29
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,625
[KANZAKI yelling]

30
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,541
[ITSUWA]
What in the world was I doing?

31
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,125
I feel like I was putting
in grueling effort,

32
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,416
but compared to
both of those saints,

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,958
I may as well have been
playing some kind of a game.

34
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,625
[MIKOTO]
Aw, damn it!

35
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,041
I don't know if the system
is glitching or what,

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,333
But now I'm stranded because
of this low-oxygen alert.

37
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,500
And to top it all off,
the gate is malfunctioning,

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,416
so I can't get back
to the ground level.

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,583
This sucks!

40
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,416
[gasps]

41
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,875
You're not looking so good.
Is everything okay?

42
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,708
Hey, is that you, Misaka?

43
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,083
I have to go.

44
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,166
Huh? Wait, hold on!

45
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,625
Dummy. What's going on?

46
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,958
What happened to you?

47
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,166
Don't tell me you snuck
out of the hospital.

48
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,208
I really have to go.

49
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,500
They're fighting.

50
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,625
Still. I have to go, too.

51
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,875
They're close.
I have to find them.

52
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,625
[MIKOTO]
Why won't you just say it?

53
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,125
That you need my help!

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,000
Or that you need
help from someone!

55
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,500
Just say that you feel
scared or anxious!

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,958
You don't even have to
be specific about why!

57
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,541
Misaka, what are you saying?

58
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,083
Listen. I know all
about it, okay?

59
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,583
I know that you have amnesia.

60
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,750
I get that you're carrying
the weight of something huge

61
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,291
inside of you.

62
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,833
But is it absolutely
necessary for you to carry it

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,541
all by yourself?

64
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,500
You look like you've been
through the wringer.

65
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,583
You even lost your memory.

66
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,500
So what reason could
you possibly have

67
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,083
to keep doing things alone?

68
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
I can fight too, you know.

69
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,666
I'm serious!

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,500
I can be of help to you!

71
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,750
So say something.

72
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,541
Tell me where you're going

73
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,000
and who it is
you're about to fight!

74
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,541
I want to make this easier.

75
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,083
I'm gonna fight too this time!

76
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,125
Misaka.

77
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Whatever. Fine.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,125
You're not listening
to me anyway.

79
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,583
I'll watch out for you
until you go back.

80
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,041
So. I guess you found
out about all that,

81
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,333
but you've got it wrong.

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,708
I can't remember
who I was before,

83
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,000
but apparently I wasn't the
kind of guy who was willing

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,875
to ask for help.

85
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
The me that I can't remember

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,250
is the one who is
driving who I am now.

87
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,791
He's still there.

88
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,750
Maybe not up here.
But here.

89
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,958
If I don't know,
he still understands.

90
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,875
He knows what I
want to accomplish

91
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,125
and what to do.

92
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,916
I'm sorry, Misaka.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,916
But you should hurry
up and get going.

94
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,083
When you think about
it, nothing's changed.

95
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,041
Even if my gears hadn't slipped
and I hadn't lost my memories,

96
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,375
I'd still be doing
the same thing.

97
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,333
I wouldn't be able to
leave it to someone else.

98
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,791
That's not Toma Kamijo.

99
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,708
He's not shaken by whether
or not he has his memories.

100
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,375
[MIKOTO] There's nothing
wrong with what I said.

101
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,708
He has to get back to
the hospital right away.

102
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,708
Even though I have the
option of going with him

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,083
and assisting with the fight.

104
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,083
Should I?

105
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,333
I mean, I believe what he said,

106
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,458
and there's probably
some special significance

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,541
for him in standing
on his own two feet.

108
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,000
So if that's the case, it
wouldn't be right to stop him.

109
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,291
The best thing I could do
is see him off from here.

110
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,791
What now?

111
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,291
I don't feel satisfied
by that at all.

112
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,875
[MIKOTO]
Oh. That's why.

113
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,166
[KANZAKI yells]

114
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,833
[KANZAKI yells]

115
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,708
[ACQUA] Are you finished
already, Saint of the Far East?

116
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,958
[KANZAKI] How can he
possibly wield such power?

117
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,708
Drawing forth that much
from one being

118
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,833
should instantly
disintegrate a person's body

119
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,041
both physically and magically.

120
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,458
Not to mention,

121
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,833
Acqua's power is from
the Right Seat of God.

122
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,791
This shouldn't be possible.

123
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,625
It's beyond the realm of
potential and natural talent.

124
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,958
There is no way
he can condense two

125
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,041
extraordinary aptitudes
into a single body like this.

126
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,833
There's more to it.

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,083
He must be using
some sort of trick.

128
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,208
Saintly powers and those
from the Right Seat of God

129
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,666
are incompatible.

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,500
What's allowing them to coexist?

131
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,083
So you still intend to fight!

132
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,750
I bet you're fuming right now.

133
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,666
Telling yourself not
to drag civilians

134
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,541
and Amakusa Church
members into a fight

135
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,000
between saints when our
powers are so vastly different.

136
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,125
But that's the nature
of the battlefield.

137
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,000
Differences in abilities,
the quality of weapons,

138
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
the strength of numbers.

139
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,125
Attacking others with
such obvious disparities

140
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,666
is the rule here.

141
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,291
If you don't like that,
then too bad!

142
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,500
You shouldn't have come
here in the first place!

143
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,583
[KANZAKI grunts]

144
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,375
[ACQUA] There is absolutely
no reason to make those

145
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,458
who have no power fight.

146
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,958
It shouldn't be done.

147
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,500
Only true soldiers should be
the ones to take up swords!

148
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm sure I've never heard a
more arrogant way of thinking.

149
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,500
How could I have
been such an idiot?

150
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,583
What is the right
decision to make?

151
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,458
What choice will ultimately
save my friends?

152
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,666
What choice will finally correct
Acqua of the Rear's mistake?

153
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,875
What will uncover his secret?

154
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,541
And what choice
could I possibly make

155
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,500
to counteract his
overwhelming power?

156
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,458
Help me. Give me strength.

157
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,875
Yes, I need your strength!

158
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,916
[ITSUWA gasps]

159
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,916
Let's move!

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,916
It's time for us to bring
the Amakusa Church

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
where it needs to be!

162
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
[AMAKUSA CHURCH yells]

163
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,750
What's this?

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,041
You're seeking salvation
from the weak?

165
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,625
Is this how badly you
fear the fate of death?

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,916
Is that what it looks like?

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,791
It's true that I have
friends who were hurt

168
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,333
standing by my side, and I
feared it would happen again.

169
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,750
Because of that,

170
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,916
I decided to rethink my
involvement with the Amakusa.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,416
But I was wrong.

172
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,583
This tragedy did not happen
because they were weaklings.

173
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,291
I labeled them as weak,

174
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,958
and I was unable to
trust in their abilities.

175
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,291
Somewhere inside me,
I looked down on them.

176
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,750
And I would never
allow them to protect me.

177
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,416
The real tragedy is my
arrogance in believing

178
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,250
that I was the one who
had to protect them.

179
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,666
And that's why I'm
going to overcome it.

180
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,791
I'll trust them to have my back.

181
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,750
And with all of us trusting
and supporting each other,

182
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,291
I will surmount this.

183
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,791
And the Amakusa Church will
have the revival it deserves!

184
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,208
[ACQUA] Your baseless hope
is simply a delusion.

185
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,708
What's wrong with you?

186
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,250
Did you truly think you could
surpass me by doing this?

187
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,666
[KANZAKI] Saints were born
with physical characteristics

188
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
very similar to the Son of God.

189
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,583
So they have a portion of
that power on loan to them.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,375
[KANZAKI]
Be that as it may...

191
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,458
They cannot wield the kind
of power that you have.

192
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,583
You clearly have powers
above those of a simple saint.

193
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,000
And why is that?

194
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,708
The answer's obvious.

195
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,750
It's your Holy
Mother Veneration.

196
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,625
You have physical
characteristics not just similar

197
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,958
to the son of God, but to
the Holy Mother as well.

198
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,750
By stacking the attributes of
both saint and Holy Mother,

199
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,458
you've taken that power
that would normally

200
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,916
run out of control,

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,416
and found a way to
forcibly integrate it!

202
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,666
So what difference does
it make to you if I have?

203
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
It doesn't.

204
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,666
Because you have an
unfortunate weakness.

205
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,583
Compared to all the
other saints in the world,

206
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,250
you have an even greater
vulnerability to counter spells

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
that specifically target you!

208
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,041
She means Saint Breakout.

209
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,375
[KANZAKI]
Saint Breakout.

210
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,458
It forcibly collapses
the balance of traits

211
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,416
similar to the Son of God.

212
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,291
And this causes the power
to run rampant within them.

213
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,791
If you have both those traits

214
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,250
and are then hit with
a Saint Breaker spell...

215
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,000
He would detonate.

216
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,541
It makes sense.

217
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,000
That's why he was exclusively
using his magical abilities

218
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,125
defensively when
we fought earlier.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
I see. So that's your play.

220
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,750
[KANZAKI yells]

221
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,000
These are all symbols
from the crucifixion

222
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,416
of the Son of God.

223
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,666
[KANZAKI] Longinus,
It's time for the final key

224
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,125
to his execution!

225
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,333
This should be good.

226
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,208
Fighting against the
entire Amakusa Church.

227
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,708
Such is a name worthy to
be engraved upon my heart

228
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,041
for all time.

Just leave him to me!

Sir William, you're safe!

241
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,291
[KNIGHT 9B]
That's William Orwell for ya!

242
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,000
That's what you
get for tricking me

243
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,750
and saving the best
part for yourself.

244
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,458
So, is it true what I've heard--

245
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,750
that you're really planning
to leave England?

246
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,833
[ACQUA (WILLIAM)]
Yes.

247
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,875
[VILIAN gasps]

248
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,375
[KNIGHT LEADER] You're not cut
out to be a mercenary, William!

249
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,166
I pulled so many strings.

250
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,291
I had hoped to finally
welcome you in as a knight,

251
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,208
but you didn't care.
You just brushed it all away.

252
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,375
What is it you're going after?

253
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,125
It's not that I'm turning
it down for a better option.

254
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,500
Knights and mercenaries
are both important roles.

255
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,916
You know that.
Changing won't solve anything.

256
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,375
Meaning what?

257
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,541
We're fine as-is.

258
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,333
I protect from without.

259
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,000
Meanwhile, you safeguard
everything from within.

260
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,166
It's perfect.

261
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,333
We'll have greater
latitude this way.

262
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,250
I guess there's
no stopping you, then.

263
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,625
[ACQUA (WILLIAM)]
Oh, that reminds me.

264
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,875
Could you do me a favor?

265
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,583
An order has been
placed with a craftsman

266
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,708
outside of London
for an escutcheon.

267

Cancel it for me, would you?

268
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,083
[KNIGHT LEADER]
As though he could lay it aside.

269
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,708
As though it could
be laid aside.

270
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,750
Damn it.

Looks like you're
coming around!

Uh, here.

Oh, no! Please don't
strain yourself!

Not after the battle
you've been through.

275
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,500
Uh, actually, to be honest,

276
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,916
I don't remember
much of anything

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
after I'd left the hospital.

278
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,041
We took down a saint!

279
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,666
There's not even twenty
of them in the entire world!

280
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,416
And you were a big part of that!

281
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,291
That on its own is a miracle!

282
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,750
Just like a shooting star.

283
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,833
Or like Santa Claus
tripped and all the presents

284
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,500
were scattered everywhere!

285
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,500
You know?

286
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,958
Sure.

287
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,958
So then, you're basically
saying we beat Acqua

288
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,166
and that you and the
Amakusa are awesome?

Oh! No!

00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,125
I didn't mean it like that!

Although, I have
to admit it's true.

292
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,208
But it's not really
for me to say, so...

Wait. Can you tell me
what day it is today?

350
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,833
What do you think those lovely
testaments to mammality are for?

351
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,333
Yes, those. Right there.

352
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,125
I mean your boobs, sweetie.

353
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,625
Why are they there?

354
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,791
And what are they for if you
don't know how to use them?

355
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,166
Wh-What?

356
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,291
Come on. Level with me.

357
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,583
You think this slow pace
is the best tactic?

358
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,625
Wait. What are
you talking about?

359
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,125
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
I'm talking about Itsuwa.

360
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,041
The fact is, she
wouldn't think twice

361
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
about playing the sexy
fallen angel maid

362
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,125
if she needed to.

363
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,958
You're wrong! She'd never.

364
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,125
Listen!

365
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,208
You're starting to fall
way behind Itsuwa.

366
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,500
On a feminine level!

367
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,958
Really.

368
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,833
Are you going to let your
pride get the better of you?

369
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,083
You women and your
delicate sensibilities.

370
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,333
How dare you say
something like that to me?

371
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,416
Maybe you're not
truly cut out to lead

372
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,041
those little lost
sheep of yours.

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,500
What will you do?
What will you do?

375
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,666
What will you do?

376
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,125
[KAMIJO] Every inch of me
is covered in bruises.

377
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,958
But something like that won't
stop you from biting me, huh?

378
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,208
Hmph!
It's your own fault, Toma!

379
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,958

I don't understand.

00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,208
How in the world
was Acqua beaten?

385
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,041
[FIAMMA] It means the
opposition is progressing

386
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,708
more quickly than expected.

387
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,125
When did you emerge
from your bolt-hole,

388
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,791
Fiamma of the Right?

389
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,958
[FIAMMA]
That sort reaction won't do.

390
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
It makes it seem like
you're not cut out

391
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,666
for your exalted position.

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,250
[ROMAN POPE]
What are you planning?

393
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,333
[FIAMMA] First, we are
going to strike England.

00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,375

[FIAMMA]
Don't you understand?

396
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,083
With the exception of England,

397
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,166
we've now managed to
bring nearly all of Europe

398
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,583
under our control.

399
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,375
We're going to contact
the other nations,

400
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,750
and with their help,
we'll dry England up.

401
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,250
I don't see how that will
do any substantial damage

402
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,666
to Academy City.

403
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,875
[FIAMMA] I'm not interested
in Academy City.

404
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,333
My focus is England
because it is there.

405
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
What do you mean by "it"?

406
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,416
[FIAMMA] Heh. Something we
will get our hands on.

407
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
Though it may require
exerting a great deal of power.

408
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,125
[ROMAN POPE]
It can't be.

409
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,333
Are you truly a follower
of the Church of the Cross?

410
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,791
You tell me.
Do you think that I am?

411
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,875
Damn you.

412

Now, now.

413
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,833
Such rough language is
hardly suitable for a pope.

You fool!

415
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,291
Do you really expect me
to sit back and do nothing?

416
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,791
Would you take me on?

417
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,833
An old man against the leader
of the Right Seat of God?

418
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,291
Old man, eh?

its proper meaning.

that by this power,

You will remain idle here
for the next forty years.

426
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,041
You should use the experience
of this extended isolation

to sharpen your mind and
achieve some measure of wisdom.

Yes. The right hand
symbolizes miracles, old man.

In Michael's right arm

I have within me the very
quintessence of miracles,

00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,375
but I am unable to
use it to its fullest.

I lack the correct output
terminals to collect

and control it.

438
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,916
The power I wield in my
current state is nothing

439
