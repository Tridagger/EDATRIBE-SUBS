of 2.3 million.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm Toma Kamijo,
a level zero student there,

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,291
which means I'm powerless.

00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,916
At least, that's what they say.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,125

got a mysterious ability

in my right hand
that can cancel out

00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,083
And as a result of this gift,
happiness, divine favor,

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,875

might actually be good

fell from the sky

onto my doorstep.

memorized 103 thousand books.

Shortly after that,
I was attacked

some lady with a katana,

20

He says he's probably nice.

00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh? That's good.

356

[MONAKA]
Um, will you excuse me?

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,541
Yes? Yes.

358
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,208
I understand. Yes, thank you.

359
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,833
[MONAKA]
I have to be going now.

360
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,416
It was lovely to meet you.
Thank you for chatting with me.

Oh, goodness no, thank you!

362
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,041
For the all the
yummy food you gave us!

363
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,958
Right? Tell her, Sphinx!

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,916
[INDEX] Have a good night!
Bye-bye!

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,166
I'm so sorry.

367
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,125
[KAMIJO]
What she said is true.

368
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
Ever since the
Kazakiri incident,

369
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,208
there's been trouble
stirring all over.

370
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,125
Maybe I should swing by
Tsuchimikado's apartment

371
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,333
after I get home.

372
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,916
Excuse me!

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,208
[MONAKA]
Not at all.

374
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,791
I'm the one who should
be apologizing here.

375
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,791
No way.

376
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,791
It's my fault.
I bumped into you.

377
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,708
[MONAKA]
I'm not talking about that.

378
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,541
I mean for all the trouble
you're about to go through.

379
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,625
Poor boy.

00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,875
[KAMIJO gasps]

381
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,125
Let's go have a chat.

382
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,083
About all the
unrest taking place

383
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,666
around the world right now.

384
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,416
[KAMIJO] You said you
want to talk about it.

385
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,083
But I don't know how
much there is I can say.

386
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,916
There's a huge problem here
that needs to be solved.

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,666
Your input is quite necessary.

388
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,708
Oh, yeah?
And who exactly are you?

389
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,416
Monaka Oyafune.

390
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,583
Sound familiar?

391
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,750
I work for Academy City.

392
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,791
I'm a member of
the Governing Board.

393
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,416
Wait, the governing board?

394
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
You're kidding.

395
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,333
You don't believe me?

396
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,583
Well, it's just that
scarf you're wearing.

397
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,375
I figure that somebody
who's on the board

398
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,375
could afford something
a little nicer.

399
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,375
[MONAKA gasps] I'll have you
know my daughter made this scarf

400
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,791
for me as a gift!

401
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,083
I will not allow you
to insult it!

402
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,791
Whoa! Okay!

403
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,541
I take it all back!

404
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,875
But, uh, as far as that
problem you mentioned,

405
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,750
there aren't exactly
any definite reasons

406
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,291
or causes for it.

407
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,916
So no one can really
take action, right?

408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,166
[MONAKA]
Yes.

409
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,916
But if there was a
definite cause or reason,

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,125
I'd want to know.

411
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,625
[KAMIJO gasps]

412
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,708
[MONAKA] That's the main reason
I thought it would be good

413
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,250
to talk to you.

414
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,625
Maybe you have something
but don't know its importance.

415
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,083
Something that the state
heads and United Nations

416
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,291
don't have.

417
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,875
What are you talking about?

418
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,500
[MONAKA]
Your right hand, of course.

419
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,750
You don't mean...?

420
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,041
[MONAKA]
Yes, I do.

421
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,208
You want my Imagine Breaker?

422
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,666
So then...

423
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,875
Whatever's causing this
unrest is really powerful.

424
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,083
That's right.

425
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,916
But what's happening
right now isn't a result

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,791
of September 30th.

427
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,625
I'm afraid it goes
far deeper than that.

428
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,916
Whether or not the
protests were their doing,

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,333
the Roman Orthodoxy's
making use of this confusion.

430
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,541
Instead of attacking
Academy City directly,

431
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,125
they're turning their
attention to the world

432
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,416
that has come
to rely on it so much.

433
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,041
Undermining science
on a global scale.

434
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,416
[KAMIJO] So, let's assume
the Roman Orthodoxy

435
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,958
is currently on the move.

436
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,250
I wouldn't know
where they would be

437
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,625
or what kind of tricks
they would use.

438
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,916
I don't see how
I could help you right now.

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,125
If they tried to pull
something again, then, maybe.

440
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,541
[MONAKA]
Right. As for that...

441
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,625
He can explain it
better than I can.

442
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,708
Tsuchimikado?

443
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
Did you have a nice chat?

444
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,958
We're not quite finished,
but it should be enough.

445
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,500
I think I'll let you
handle it from here.

446
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,666
Sounds good.

00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,125
[MONAKA grunts]

448
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,375

449
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,041
Are you crazy?!
Snap out of it!

450
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,958
You bastard!

451
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,875
[KAMIJO]
Damnit, Tsuchimikado!

452
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,833
[MONAKA]
Please.

453
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,375
Please, don't.

454
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,583
Don't hold this against him.

455
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,250
It's not him.

456
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,125
It's because of me.

457
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:52,375
My actions don't align with
the governing board's agenda.

458
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,583
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

459
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,708
[MONAKA] They want to
increase hostilities

460
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,750
and destroy religion.

461
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,583
Science's counterpart.

462
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,791
As it's represented by
the Roman Orthodox Church.

463
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,250
You have to put a stop
to all of that insanity.

464
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,375
That's the reason
I chose to contact you.

465
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,166
You have the ability
to defuse the situation.

466
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,166
I know eventually they
will learn I spoke to you.

467
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,833
But if I were to try to escape,
my family would most likely

468
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,541
bear the brunt
of the punishment.

469
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,416
And so, to keep
my loved ones safe,

470
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,791
I asked him to punish me.

471
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,541
Don't say any more.

472
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,791
I'll take care of the rest.

473
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,041
You've done exactly
what you needed to do,

474
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,333
so don't you worry.

475
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,541
They're gonna be just fine.

476
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,375
I need you to
remember that, okay?

477
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,833
Well, what do ya think, Kami?

Yeah, all right.

480
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] First we'll head
to the 23rd School District.

481
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,333
From there, we'll have
to fly to France.

482
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,333
Our objective is a
Roman Orthodox magical item,

483
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,500
the Document of Constantine.

Also known as the Document of C.

485
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,208
That's gonna be the
key to resolving this case.

486
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,166
Ready, Kami? Here we go!

487
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,083

[KAMIJO] After dropping
into a foreign city,

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,291
I'm reunited with Itsuwa.

492

Magical items? Geoducts?

493
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,125
Do you really even
need my right hand?

"The Right Seat of God."

cross paths, a story is born.
