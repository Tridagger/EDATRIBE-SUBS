00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,500
[OPERATOR 14A] We've broken
through the designated point!

00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,125
Target within firing range!

00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,833
[OPERATOR 12A] Large scale flash
shelling will now commence!

4
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,916
All witches, withdraw
from the line of fire!

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,375
I repeat, withdraw
from the line of fire!

00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,291
[SMARTVERY]
Here it comes!

7
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,166
[OPERATOR 14A]
Targeting Buckingham Palace!

8
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,458
Commencing shelling!

9
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,208
[KAMIJO gasps]

10
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,125
Man, that is quite
the bombardment,

11
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,166
but I'm concerned
about the area around it.

12
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,166
The palace is surrounded
by a large park,

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,041
so I don't think stray shots
should be a major problem.

14
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,791
I'm more concerned
about whether an attack

15
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,250
that strong will even be
enough to bring down Carissa.

16
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,458
I'm a level-zero esper
charging into battle

17
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,875
with only my fist to depend on.

18
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,750
Pretty reckless if you ask me.

19
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,916
[VILIAN]
But why?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,791
Why would you willingly
immerse yourself

21
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,416
in such extreme
danger when you have

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,750
absolutely no obligation
to risk your life

23
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,291
for the British state?

24
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,541
'Cause I'm not doing this
for the British state.

25
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,500
Think about the people
who're caught in the middle

26
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,791
of this coup.

27
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,708
They aren't just nameless,
faceless characters

28
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,583
created to be targets in
some arcade shooting game.

29
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,000
Or I'd've gone back
to Academy City by now.

30
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,500
But those are people.

31
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,458
They're all running
for their lives in terror.

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,458
Desperately clinging to
whatever's important to them

33
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,458
and trying not to lose it.

34
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,916
What kind of monster would
abandon them right now?

35
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,125
I'm used to William,

36
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,625
but you're an entirely
different sort of mercenary

37
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,000
than he is, aren't you?

38
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,583
[KAMIJO] That's wreckage
from Curtana Original's

39
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,250
pandimensional fragmentation!

40
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,750
[ITSUWA]
Everyone, hold on tight!

41
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,375
[KAMIJO yells]

42
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,791
[KAMIJO coughs]

43
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,750
Damn it!

44
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,166
Where's Index?

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,958
Kanzaki! Itsuwa!

46
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,375
Where the hell are you guys?

47
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,666
That's enough! Stop this!

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,541
My. I have to admit,
this is an unexpected twist.

49
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,250
The mindless little sister
is the first to arrive.

50
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,250
You know, if you want to
kill me, you'll have to notch

51
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,666
the bolt and draw back
the string first.

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,083
There's no point
in having a weapon

53
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,541
if you're too afraid to use it.

54
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,750
Here, let me
demonstrate for you!

55
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,125
Stop, Carissa!

56
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,458
Well done!

57
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,500
Now that's what I call an
award-winning fine play!

58
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,541
Already battling the final boss.

59
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,125
And of course,
however many knights

60
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,208
there are lying in wait.

61
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,791
If you're looking
around for an ambush,

62
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,416
you won't find one.

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,666
Just me.

64
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,291
I used them earlier for
a little live broadcast.

65
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,041
So you killed them?

66
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,750
But they were your allies!

67
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,541
They fought alongside you!
And you--

68
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,416
[CARISSA]
That's enough!

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,958
Why do you think
they're compensated

70
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
with status and riches?

71
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,958
It's because of their
willingness to do

72
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,291
whatever it takes to
protect their country.

73
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,291
Being expended for
the good of their kingdom

74
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,666
is a knight's lifelong dream.

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,833
And now as a result,
their firm solidarity

76
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,208
has been reborn.

77
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,166
If the coup d'etat
is unsuccessful,

78
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,416
both they and the country
will perish in terror!

79
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,916
They're called Griffon Skies--
mobile attack fortresses.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,708
Unmanned magical items.

81
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,916
But as such, they are second
to none in coordinated attacks,

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,333
even among the nation's
other fortresses.

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,958
--[KAMIJO grunts]
--[VILIAN gasps]

84
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,041
[CARISSA] They're too powerful
against human targets,

85
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,875
so their auto-discriminators
must have been thrown off.

86
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,666
Ordinarily, an attack
like that would have

87
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,333
sliced you in half.

88
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,250
Princess Carissa,
you don't want to do this.

89
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,333
Just die.

I'm alive?

91
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,791
It took longer than
I would have liked,

92
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,416
but I've finally managed
to repay my debt to you.

93

96
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,208
Would you mind assessing
that magic for me?

97
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,458
Reanalyze the spell
related to Curtana.

98
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,041
You mean how to
control or contain it, right?

99
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,541
I'll give it my best try.

100
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,541
[CARISSA] Aren't you the lazy
soldier who couldn't even

101
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,375
make it to the main battle?

102
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,000
And now you want to be the
central figure in the fight?

103
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,750
I didn't mean to imply
that I was going

104
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,000
to settle everything by myself.

105
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,333
Sorry about that.

106
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,583
I am joined by allies now
who all have my back!

107
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,958
You're saying you were
holding back against me?!

108
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,000
Then die!

That speed!

111
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
All I have to do is
distract Carissa a little

112
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,208
and Kanzaki will win.

113
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,041
Well, aren't you a brave
one to jump in like this.

114
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,291
Nice try.

118
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,416

incurring an inordinate cost!

Hate to say it, but it
looks like we're gonna need

00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,416
your right hand after all.

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,125
[KAMIJO] I can't promise
anything, but I'll give it

124
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,708
a try!

125
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,958
There's a delay between
when Curtana cuts through

126
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,958
an object and when
the wreckage appears.

127
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't let it throw you off.

128
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,375
Even if you can cancel
out the actual slice

129
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,791
with your right hand,

130
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,041
there's a real possibility
it won't have any effect

131
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,583
against the wreckage
that follows.

132
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,916
[KAMIJO] So we get close
to her after she slashes,

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,916

I can't imagine anything
more humiliating.

Is this a coordinated attack?

That's quite a cheeky trick!

This is the pinnacle
of relying on others...

head of state as she's

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,458
wielding Curtana Original
is quite an unfortunate mistake.

179
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,875
[VOICE 14A] Pardon me, miss,
but you were correct.

180
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,375
It's a tomb, all right.

181
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,416
Fit for the king of
an entire civilization.

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,916
I'll send you the material.

183
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,833
[RIMÉA]
Indeed.

184
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583
Turns out there's
a rational explanation

185
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,000
as to why she hasn't
killed any of them.

186
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,125
I understand now why you're
rushing through life,

187
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,375
my sister, and I know
very well what you're after.

188
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
Hello? Do you read me?

189
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,916
Listen up. This is
First Princess Riméa.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,750
As you know, Second Princess
Carissa has spun wildly

191
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,083
out of control.

192
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,000
But her actions have been
entirely for the sake

193
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,208
of Great Britain.

194
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
[RIMÉA] We have been under
pressure from the forces

195
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,250
of France, the Roman Orthodoxy,
and the Russian Church.

196
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,416
They have all used
the EU as their pawns

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,708
and violated our
national dignity.

198
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,250
Amidst such humiliation,

199
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,375
Carissa made the decision to
wield Curtana Original herself

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,041
in hopes that we would overcome
these external pressures.

201
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,708
However, she also
simultaneously resolved

202
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,833
to lock away such a
doomsday weapon forevermore,

203
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,791
so that it would
never be misused again.

204
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,291
Once the fighting was over,

205
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,708
she planned to take the
destroyed Curtana Original

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,250
and shards of Curtana Second
to a hole in the ground

207
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,875
destined to be her grave
and spend the rest of her life

208
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,750
there waiting to die.

209
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,208
Second Princess to
Destroyer Wimbledon.

210
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,666
Prepare to fire.

211
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
Launch another cluster.

212
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,083
[RIMÉA] To protect those
who might otherwise fight

213
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,500
alongside her,

214
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,083
she is acting as a tyrant
to justify a solo battle.

215
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,208
She is using the weapon
to wipe out all enemies

216
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,458
of our nation--
both foreign and domestic.

217
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,416
If there are any listening
who would take pity

218
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,083
on my sister--
some knight, perhaps,

219
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,833
who would like to
save this young woman--

220
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,750
Would you now please take
up your sword once again?

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,708
No matter what, I can't give up.

222
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
[laughing]

223
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,583
Is that a fact?

224
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,875
Well, the second
cluster is almost here.

225
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
So what will you do?

226
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,333
What an ignorant fool!

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
Our military will
blow you apart!

228
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,750
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

229
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,750
It's you!

230
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
[KNIGHT LEADER] Once this coup
d'état is over, you're welcome

231
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,833
to take my head for my actions.

232
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,833
But first, we have to
ensure there's a future

233
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,416
where that can happen.

234
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,625
I'm requesting that the
members of this royal family

235
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
start working together

236
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,125
so that we may
properly confront France

237
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
and the Roman Orthodoxy.

238
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,791
Forgive me.

239
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,750
For leaving the
fate of my country

240
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,416
and the fate of the
princess in your hands.

241
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,916
It's fine.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,708
Let's just work together
and end this thing.

243
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,125
How interesting.

244
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
It seems my sister
manipulated you

245
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,791
with her cunning performance.

246
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,833
[KNIGHT LEADER] If you're
wondering what motivated me

247
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,000
to save you, then yes,
that was a part of it.

248
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,500
That's unfortunate.

249
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,125
I suppose I'll just
have to use all of

250
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,916
the bunker clusters, then.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,416
[KNIGHT LEADER] My Thororm spell
can't stand against Curtana.

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,875
It's not that strong,
but it's more than capable

253
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,833
of zeroing out the
attack of your remaining

254
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,666
bunker clusters.

255
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,541
You'd only be wasting them.

256
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,000
I've factored
that in, of course.

257
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,208
The Wimbledon has
twenty-four missiles,

258
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,583
the King Henry the
Seventh has twenty-six,

259
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,833
and the Sherwood has fifteen.

260
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,500
If I hide one of those
behind an illusion,

261
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,500
then your spell
would become useless

262
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,708
since you wouldn't be
able to identify a target.

263
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,500
Second Princess to all
destroyers who are on standby.

264
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,375
This is an order to launch
all of your cruise missiles!

265
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,125
Huh? An antenna?

266
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,291
[ACQUA] It might be difficult to
issue an order to the military.

267
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,500
I see.

268
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,916
You would dare to
interfere with my plans?

269
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,583
[KAMIJO]
Acqua!

270
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,208
I'm sorry if I'm late;
science isn't my forte.

271
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
I'm afraid destroying
all the military antennae

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,750
in the area took a bit
longer than I expected it to.

273
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,041
Who would have imagined that
one day the time would come

274
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,625
where you and I would be forced
to work together again?

275
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,250
It'll be fine as long as
you don't slow me down.

276
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,333
Right. Come, then.

277
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,333
Let's put our
skills to the test.

278
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,791
Show me what you've learned
over the past ten years!

279
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,041
I'll cut off your head!

280
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,708
[KANZAKI] Don't think I'm gonna
let you two have all the fun.

281
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,583
[KANZAKI]
Single Flash!

282

--[KANZAKI grunts]
--[ACQUA grunts]

284
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,083
No way.

[CARISSA grunts]

286
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,875
[CARISSA yells]

287
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,708
[CARISSA] It looks like
you've finally beaten me

288
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,250
at this game of hot potato.

289
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,291
Taking on three of you
saint-level monsters

290
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,833
is too much trouble.

291
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,791
Your mistake is
thinking "special people"

292
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,500
are the only ones who
can accomplish anything.

293
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,666
The reason we can
harness such strength

294
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,208
is because there are
others here who support us.

295
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,708
Yes, perhaps.

296
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,000
But I wager you never
imagined that strength

297
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,708
might also be your weakness.

298
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,416
[CARISSA grunts]

299
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,791

[laughing]

301
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,166
The greater your numbers are,

302
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,166
the more opportunities I'll be
able to find to rip you apart!

303
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,333
Whether there's a thousand
or ten thousand of you,

304
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,875
it won't stop me!

305
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,083
[CARISSA] Well, if it
isn't my dear mother.

306
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,125
The cause of all the commotion.

307
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,000
[ELIZARD] If you're going
to do whatever you please,

308
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,625
you should at least come
up with a better plan than mine.

309
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,166
Too bad. Your idea is
turning out rather terribly,

310
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,208
so I'm here to stop you.

311
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,500
Nonsense.

312
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,416
You only say that because
you want the throne.

313
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm simply appalled

314
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,416
at how small you're thinking.

315
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Dearest daughter, if you truly
wish to change this nation...

316
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,291
You old fool.
What are you saying?

317
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,791
Try revolution.

318
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,208
Among all the state-level
Royal Household magic,

319
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,041
there's still one little trick
you haven't considered yet.

320
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,458
Now, Union Jack, I command you!

321
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,916
Take the tremendous
power of the British Empire,

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,125
made up of the four cultures
from which it is comprised.

323
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,125
Release and redistribute
it equally among

324
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,166
all of the British people
that they may rise up

325
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,375
and fight with us!

00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,041
[CARISSA gasps]

327
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,375
The power infused
in Curtana Original...

328
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,333
This is Queen Regnant Elizard,

329
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,291
and I have a message for
the people of this country.

330
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,916
Many of you have
come to harm since

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,875
this coup d'état first
started without knowing why.

332
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,291
However, you now have the
ability to fight back!

333
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,500
If only for tonight,
you all have the opportunity

334
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,833
to become heroes.

335
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,208
As such, I implore you to choose

336
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,125
which side of history
you wish to fight for.

337
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,500
Weigh everything
within your own minds.

338
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,291
And whatever justice,
courage and nerve remains,

339
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,208
I ask you to heed it!

340
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,958
This is the opportunity for
our nation's new champions

to emerge!

We're champions?

To be heroes?

What the--?
It's you... Curtana?

350
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,958
Look around.

This was the Queen's ace.

You can feel it, too, right?

353
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,125
This is the power
that's been shared among

all the nation's people.

Come on. It's our turn.

356
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,791
It's going to take
far more than that

357
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,708
to turn aside Curtana Original.

358
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,875
You're in a ninety-million
to one tug-of-war match.

Should you lose your
concentration for even a moment,

360

all the sword's power
will be pared away.

What's the deal
with this country?

It's like everyone
in it is a key figure.

367
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
She must have known this.

368
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,375
That's why she set
herself aside for her nation.

369
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,916
Okay, then.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,166
I'm going to save the princess.

Well, that was quite the loud
show we put on last night.

00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,208
It may be presumptuous
of me to say this, but...

381
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,125
It might have been too loud.

382
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,500
Was it?

383
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,708
I actually think our citizens
will try to measure

384
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,875
last night's events to no avail.

385
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,541
And ultimately,
I'm sure everyone

386
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,583
will interpret them
in their own way.

387
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,541
That's a possibility,
but what will we do

388
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,958
if they interpret last
night's events as magic?

389
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,958
If that happens,
we'll just have to admit it.

390
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,333
After all, it's not as if
there is a law stating

391
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,083
that magic can't be out
in the public eye, is there?

If I told you that I was
Fiamma of the Right,

would you recognize the name?

I'm grateful.

402
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,625
It was well worth it to harass
France via the Roman Orthodoxy

403
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,500
in order to apply all
that stress to Britain.

And thanks to that, I got my
hands on what I was after.

to steal that you'd go

406

Perhaps no one has told you.

realized it yet,

His name is Fiamma.
