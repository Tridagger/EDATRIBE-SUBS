1
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,541
[PRIEST 20A] Wait. Your
Holiness, what are you doing?

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,625
[ROMAN POPE]
I must hurry.

3
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,541
The citizens are
overwhelmed with anxiety.

4
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:44,000
They're gathering in groups
to march on the Vatican.

5
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,500
Yes, I'm aware.

6
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,458
You need not say anything more.

7
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,916
[VASILISSA]
Hello there, my dandy gentleman!

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,375
Can I assume you are still
living life as the Pope of Rome?

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,750
[ROMAN POPE]
Is that you, Vasilissa?

10
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,458
The cardinals are about to
convene a papal conclave.

11
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,583
They must have decided
that my authority

12
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,500
is no longer what they need.

13
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,875
If we want to put
a stop to this war,

14
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,041
it will take much more
than just my words.

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,000
[VASILISSA] Nonetheless,
you have stood forward.

16
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,458
[explosion]

17
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,208
[VASILISSA]
I'm sorry about that.

18
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,791
I'm in the middle of bringing
the dissenters to tears.

19
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,416
They were trying to sell out
our beloved Sasha, after all.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,250
[ROMAN POPE]
You must go easy on them.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,041
They are still our brethren.

22
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,750
[VASILISSA]
I knew you would say that.

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,333
So enlighten me.

24
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,916
How are you planning to bring a
war of this magnitude to an end?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
[ROMAN POPE]
I will do what must be done.

26
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,750
But not as the pope who leads a
flock of two billion followers.

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,291
I will act as my conscience
tells me to as a man.

28
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,375
And as an adherent
of the Roman Orthodoxy.

29
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,416
I made a promise to that
mercenary, and I will honor it.

30
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,208
The Lord always has a plan.

31
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,791
It appears His plan
for me involves enduring

32
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,333
even more trials.

33
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,625
[AIWASS]
So then, what now?

34
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,250
A being very much like
yourself has been identified

35
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500
within Russia's borders.

36
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,875
She is the Archangel,
"Power of God," Misha Kruezhev.

37
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,833
Once the encroachment
begins, a great tragedy

38
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,833
will befall everyone
in that area.

39
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,041
[KAZAKIRI] And when that
happens, what will you do?

40
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,250
[AIWASS]
Nothing.

41
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,916
I only undertake that
which interests me.

42
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,583
I don't mind going.

43
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,875
However...
I do have one condition.

44
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,333
I don't want you to take
action against my friends.

45
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,500
[AIWASS] As long as they
arouse no interest in me,

46
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,583
that should be easy.

47
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
If you do hurt them,

48
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,250
you will have made
an enemy out of me,

49
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,958
and that could result
in massive destruction.

50
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,416
[AIWASS]
Heh.

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,875
How naive you are
to threaten me.

52
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,416
You never know.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,375
You might have stimulated my
interest just by saying that.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,000
[RUSSIAN PILOT 21A]
What was that?

55
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,458
An angel?

56
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,916
Amazing. Even way out here
in the middle of nowhere,

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
we can still get this stuff.

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,250
[LESSAR] Yeah, and they
all use the same recipes

59
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,458
so you know what to expect
even when you travel.

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,083
We've been blending in
pretty well with the rest

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,708
of the human smugglers.

62
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,500
But I think this is probably
as far as we're getting by car.

63
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,458
We still need to
get to that base,

64
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,666
but whattaya say we
take a different route?

65
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
Hey, what's wrong?

66
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,750
Oh.

67
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,541
Are there really this
many people all fleeing

68
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,000
to the same place?

69
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,083
To the Elizalina Alliance?

70
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,500
The opposite might be true, too.

71
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,458
I don't know anyone who
would want to be a citizen

72
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,041
of a vanquished nation.

73
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,041
We should do our best
to put a stop to this war

74
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,916
--as soon as we can.
--[KAMIJO] Huh?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,958
I mean, Fiamma is the
one pulling the strings

76
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,583
behind the scenes, isn't he?

77
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,083
So all we have to do now
is kick that bastard's ass

78
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,708
and the war will come to an end,

79
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,416
and peace will finally
be restored to the world!

80
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,958
You're right.

81
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,500
Let's show Fiamma what's what,
and then we'll rescue Index.

82
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,375
Great, so now that
we've decided on a plan,

83
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,666
we can get back to this
important eating session!

84
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,291
[LESSAR]
Now's my chance!

85
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,041
I'll pay for that with my body!

86
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,291
Okay, get back.

87
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,833
I'm not comfortable with
the random lip licking

88
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,000
and the twinkling stars
floating in your eyes.

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,083
[HAMAZURA]
What is this?

90
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,708
It was the privateer base.

91
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,250
It's wiped out.

92
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,625
Is he of one of those
Academy City esper folks

93
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
you were telling me about?

94
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
That guy?

95
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,500
No, he isn't.

96
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,625
It's been handled.

97
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,833
That should be it for now.

98
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,791
I'm sorry to have to ask again,

99
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,916
but who exactly are you, anyway?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,458
Acqua of the Rear.

101
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,750
I'm a has-been
mercenary miscreant.

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
There's something coming.

103
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
[HAMAZURA]
Academy City forces.

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,750
Interesting.

105
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,916
Looks like they're here
to occupy this territory.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,416
What now? Drive them off?

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,666
Not yet.

108
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,791
If all they're doing is
defending the village,

109
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,250
we're better off
leaving them to it.

110
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,041
I'm not sure exactly
who you're supposed to be,

111
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,458
but you can't keep shoring
up the defenses in one spot

112
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,708
forever, right?

113
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,833
Okay, then.

114
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
It's better to let
Academy City's forces

115
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,833
establish themselves here.

116
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,166
The place will be occupied
for the time being,

117
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,208
but with these guys,
it will be protected

118
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,541
for several months.

119
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,333
Hold on, Hamazura,

120
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,958
didn't you tell me you
were trying to run away

121
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,041
from Academy City
for some reason?

122
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,250
That doesn't matter.

123
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,500
We still have to protect
the village, right?

124
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,416
Okay, it's time for us
to get moving.

125
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,375
Oh, wait, one last thing.

126
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,666
[ACQUA]
Yeah?

127
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,083
I owe you.

128
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,791
If you hadn't shown up here,
the villagers and myself

129
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
and the best girl
I've ever known--

130
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,916
we wouldn't have survived.

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,916
I'm gonna make it
up to you someday.

132
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,625
[ACCELERATOR] It looks like
some sort of instruction manual.

133
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,708
Fascinating.

134
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,416
[ACCELERATOR]
You understand it?

135
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,750
No, not at all.

136
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,333
It just looks like a list
of what appears to be

137
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,333
magical conversion provisions.

138
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,916
To the best of my knowledge,

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,333
those are instructions on how
to make a Roman Orthodox spell

140
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,750
work in the
Russian Church style.

141

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,166
I'm sorry.
I'm not like Madam Elizalina--

143
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,791
I don't know much
about magical things.

00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,583
[ACCELERATOR]
Magic?

145
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,875
What the hell is
he talking about?

146
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,000
Does this mean there's
something that exists

147
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,958
that I can't understand?

148
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,250
If so, it could end up
being the answer I need.

149
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,083
Who is this Elizalina person?

150
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,166
Let's see.

151
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,708
She's either a sorceress
or a magician.

152
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,083
I don't care.

153
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,125
It doesn't really matter
to me what she is or isn't.

154
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,333
Do you think she'd be able
to decipher this parchment?

155
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,833
If she can speak.

156
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,458
As of right now, she's lying
in bed at a field hospital.

157
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,458
I don't plan on
staying here long,

158
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,875
and I won't be
doing any killing.

Sleeping Beauty will be up?

it's my responsibility

to arrange a nice,
clean environment

stand isn't the only hell

you some real darkness

Pathetic, isn't it?

I know. But bailing on them
halfway turned out to be

175
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,125
the best option for both of us.

176
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,833
Don't feel bad about it.

177
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,333
I'm not upset with you.

178
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,500
All you've done this whole
time is fight to keep me safe.

179
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,291
So no, I don't find
that pathetic at all.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,833
[HAMAZURA]
What's this?

181
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
He says it goes to the car.

182
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
It's parked just up ahead.

183
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,791
Oh, no, I can't.

184
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,208
If I take this,
it would be evidence

185
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,833
that you helped us escape.

186
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,250
Actually, he says
you can start the engine

187
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,916
without using the key at all.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
Try it.

189
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,750
Well, if you insist.

190
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,750
[TAKITSUBO]
Hamazura, they're coming!

191
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,166
It's 500 meters to the border!

192
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,875
We... We made it.

193
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,875
[metallic footsteps]

194
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,083
[HAMAZURA]
Seriously?

195
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,583
Is this the end?

196
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,833
[HAMAZURA]
Accelerator?

197
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,583
I'm right in the middle
of hunting down spies.

198
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,500
Do you really think I
have time to deal with

199
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,416
your stupid drama?

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
But tell me everything.

201
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,500
I want to hear it all.

202
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,000
[ELIZALINA]
This is a tough one.

203
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,833
I'll do what I can, of course,

204
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,708
but they both need
restorative magic,

205
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,958
and to be honest,
that takes a lot out of me.

206
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,666
Really? I see.

207
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,875
Here's what I can offer you.

208
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,291
I can probably handle
the girl in the track suit.

209
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,833
But the little one here
will be more difficult.

210
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,958
That's all.

211
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,041
[HAMAZURA]
Huh? What do you mean?

212
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,208
They're different.

213
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,375
There are two distinctive
toxins at work.

214
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,833
In the little one,
toxins are continuously

215
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,250
being injected on
a permanent basis.

216
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,875
So even if I removed them now,

217
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,916
they would be
replenished in no time.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,166
But if I removed
them from the other,

219
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,708
she should have a
more lasting response.

220
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,375
Wait, so then you're saying
she's going to get better?

221
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,416
Really? You're gonna be okay!

222
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,833
Hamazura, I can't breathe.

223
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,291
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy.

224
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,333
[ACCELERATOR] I'm neither
surprised, rattled, nor angry.

225
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
I could stomp my feet
on the ground and scream

226
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,625
at the top of my lungs,
but that won't change

227
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,958
the outcome of this
crappy situation.

228
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,791
Regardless, there's not a
whole lot of time left, so...

229
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,333
I just have to do
what must be done.

230
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:15,208
I'm fine with whatever sort of
treatment you cook up for them.

231
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,416
But first,

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,583
I need you to answer
an important question.

233
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,416
Do you know what this
is and how to read it?

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,375
That's not something
I could answer right away.

235
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,750
I'd need some more
time to study it.

236
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,458
Do you want to leave it with me?

237
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,708
[ACCELERATOR]
Nope.

238
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,875
At least I know you can
decipher it eventually.

239
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,666
Anyway, I'll let you get
back to treating them.

240
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
I'm not wasting
anymore time here.

241
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,708
I'm taking off.
I'll see you later.

242
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,208
Do you have any clues?

243
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,291
[ACCELERATOR]
If I don't, I'll find some.

244
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,750
What happened to all
the spies I flushed out?

245
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,708
[SOLDIER 21A]
They're being interrogated,

246
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,541
but it's not going very well.

247
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,750
[ACCELERATOR]
You don't say.

248
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,333
Want me to take you there?

249
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,833
[ACCELERATOR]
Nah,

250
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm gonna hunt down a more
reliable source of information.

251
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,708
[door opens]

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,166
Is there something
I can help you with?

253
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,541
Yeah, cooperate.

254
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,458
With what? And how? And why?

255
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,875
I was able to find and
recover a number of bugs.

256
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,708
They're yielding a
bunch of bits and pieces

257
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,291
from the small timers.

258
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,458
What I need you to do is sort
through all that information.

259
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,416
On what grounds does Misaka
have to cooperate with you?

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,708
[ACCELERATOR sighs] There are
some punks in Academy City.

261
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,625
And they're planning to
use the Misaka Network

262
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,875
to do something shady.

263
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,500
Listen.

264
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,041
They were replacing a network
that was causing them trouble,

265
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,166
and you started coming
after me and the kid

266
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,666
in the middle of that repair.

267
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,375
But you need to know
that your system

268
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,000
is gonna wind up
the same way--

269
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,666
at a dead end.

270
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,583
And that's just how people
who applaud the killing

271
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,166
of twenty thousand puppets
feel it should be done.

272
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,500
That's their vision
for the world.

273
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,500
I mean, you know it
wasn't created to be used

274
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
for any respectable
purpose, right?

275
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,125
So Misaka must work with you?

276
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,958
She should just
give in and join forces

277
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,458
with the most malicious
partner that ever existed?

278
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,541
Okay, fine.

279
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,625
Maybe it's time to negotiate.

280
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,541
Let's talk about the
Dark May Project.

281
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,041
You mean...

282
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,166
[ACCELERATOR] It was the project
that attempted to enhance

283
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,875
other espers' Personal
Realities by applying

284
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,291
the method I use to
control my ability.

285
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,083
For you to become an
irreplaceable resource,

286
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,708
you had to obtain a capacity
that the other Sisters

287
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,375
didn't have.

288
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
Intrigued?

289
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,375
The question now, of course,
is what are you going to do?

290
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,166
If you analyze
the way that I fight,

291
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,500
you could find
a way out of this.

292
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,125
Yes, indeed.

293
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,291
That truly does sound
like this Misaka's style.

294
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,875
[ACCELERATOR] All right, then
I'll find a lead to eliminating

295
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,291
the kid's symptoms.

296
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,875
And with any luck,
you'll stumble upon a route

297
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,541
other than the one where
you'll only get used and wasted.

298
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,708
We'll keep these goals in
mind as we fight Academy City.

299
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,541
And we will outwit them.

300
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,541
I'm glad we're on the same page.

301
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,791
Now, then, stop being
a baby and let's go.

302
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,791
[MISAKA WORST]
This Misaka must admit--

303
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,750
after being built solely to kill
Academy City's first-ranked,

304
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,708
and with everything
she's been put through,

305
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,291
it feels strange.

306
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,833
She never imagined
the day would come

307
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
when she'd have
to force a smile.

308
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,666
That was my mistake for
letting them manipulate me

310
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
with their bullcrap.

311
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,250
[laughing]

312
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,875
What was all that about?

313
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,750
When a villain makes a face
as sheepish as that one,

314
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,916
it makes this Misaka's
reason for existing

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
seem instantly less
important! [laughing]

316
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,500
Who are you calling a villain?

317
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,541
Even after I
perfected the craft,

318
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,666
I could never find a way to
keep the kid safe from harm!

319
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,958
I can't think of a single
good reason to continue

320
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
along this path.

321
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,000
Simply taking the side that
makes the most logical sense

322
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,208
isn't good enough.

323
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,125
You and I are both monsters.

324
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,416
We didn't have a choice.

325
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,375
We were deliberately set
to evil by Academy City.

326
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
We never opposed them.

327
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,083
In fact, we mastered
the ways of evil.

328
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,416
But it didn't matter.

329
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,125
We were simply chugging
right on down their rails

330
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
as planned.

331
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,083
But the course is changing.

332
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
It's time to make
them pay for this.

333
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,250
And I don't care if I
wind up doing some things

334
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,541
that are typically
out of character for me.

335
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,583
[ACCELERATOR]
Please.

336
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,958
You're killing me
with that dumb face!

337
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,250
[laughs] That stupid dead-eyed
look is hilarious!

338
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,458
[laughing]

339
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
I know it's Misaka's first time,

340
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,208
but have you ever held
someone's hand like this before?

341
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,375
I guess it's more
of a grip than a hold.

342
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,375
I have.

343
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,625
[MISAKA WORST]
Huh?

344
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,875
I've been here.

345
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,958
A number of times.

346
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,708
Each time with the
same obnoxious kid

347
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,916
who happens to
look a lot like you.

348
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,666
[KAMIJO]
Is Academy City attacking them?

349
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,291
Yeah, but the Russian
army is attacking as well.

350
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,375
Let's go.

351
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,916
We should take advantage
of all the chaos

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,458
and see if we can sneak
onto Fiamma's base!

353
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,541
Do you happen to know
why the Russian army's

354
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,625
coming to the base's defense?

355
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,791
I think it's because Fiamma
doesn't want to move.

356
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,375
Either he doesn't
want anyone to find out

357
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
that he's in hiding here,
or he's conducting

358
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,958
some kind of secret
magical operation.

359
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:31,750
Okay.

360
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
So then how do we do this?

361
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,541
[LESSAR] We'll steal some
of those powered suits!

362
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
I know you're overwhelmed
by my brilliance,

363
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,541
but you can thank me later
in bed while you gently

364
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,041
stroke my hair.

365
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,666
[KAMIJO]
Hey! Wait for me!

366
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
Damn it.

367
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,875
[KAMIJO]
That's strange.

368
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
When we snuck in earlier,

369
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,833
there were a bunch of sorcerers
from the Russian Church.

370
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,708
Why wouldn't some still be here?

371
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,083
Another thing.

372
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,500
Why would they act like
they're intentionally luring

373
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,708
Academy City in?

374
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,708
[FIAMMA]
Hmm...

375
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,375
Is it not obvious?

376
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,000
So you'll be motivated
to defend them

377
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,750
with your all-important weapon.

378
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,583
Not that I would
let it go that far.

379
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,291
I can't have you getting caught
up in the actual attack.

380
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,250
You might lose your
precious right arm,

381
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,250
and what good would
that do after all the effort

382
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,833
I made to get it here?

383
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,541
I always thought he got out
of there way too willingly.

384
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,166
Turns out he was just
letting me get away.

385
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,916
[MISAKA WORST] Those spies
are crybabies. Damn.

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
They didn't give us much of
a challenge, now, did they?

387
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,166
You guys are no fun at all!

388
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,916
[ACCELERATOR]
Deceptive practices are the same

389
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,083
as always.

390
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,875
The key is to remember
to deprive them

391
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,125
of any chance they have
to make a sound judgment.

392
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,041
That weepy guy talked a lot.

393
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,375
What'd you think?

394
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,708
Everything sounded contrived.

395
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,083
The Russian army was always
planning to take advantage

396
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,500
of this war to invade
the Elizalina Alliance

397
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,208
of Independent Nations.

398
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,833
They've had their sights
set on them for a while.

399
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,833
It seems kind of strange
that they would even send

400
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,916
spies at all under
the circumstances.

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Those are the circumstances
that created a mission

402
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,625
in the first place.

403
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,791
They had to deliver
classified documents

404
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,916
to designated points
before any full-scale

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,958
aerial bombing could begin.

406
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,666
Once they arrived,
they would meet with someone

407
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,791
who was expecting this.

408
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,000
Meaning...

409
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,750
They were taking it
to somebody who knew how

410
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,708
to decode and use this thing.

411
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,000
Delicious! Misaka is
getting tingly all over

412
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,666
just from thinking about such
a self-serving development!

413
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,083
Hey, shut up!

414
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,750
The designated point of contact
was the Russian army's

415
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,625
frontline base near
the border, wasn't it?

416
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm going to find
it and raid it.

417
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,583
That means you're free
to do whatever you want.

418
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,125
So then what are you
going to do with Last Order?

419
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,291
What would happen
if I left her with you?

420
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,458
Probably a lot of activity
you couldn't handle

421
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,625
knowing about to keep me
from getting bored.

422
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,125
[STIYL] There were two remote
control magical items for her.

423
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,125
Fiamma took the one
from the royal family.

424
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,916
But the puritans'
item is still here.

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,750
Also, it's obvious to me
who was in possession of it.

426
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,500
[LAURA chuckles]

427
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,625
You're trying to use
the puritans' magical item

428
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,625
to keep Fiamma from
misusing the knowledge

429
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,000
kept within the grimoires.

430
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,416
Your strategy is to
interrupt his magical item,

431
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,083
isn't that correct?

432
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,291
You're deliberately
confusing the programming

433
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,875
of her body.

434
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,958
[LAURA] Supposing your
delusional accusations

435
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,625
turn out to be true,

436
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,708
let's not forget I am the
head of this organization.

437
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,666
How far do you think
you would get dealing

438
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,541
with this mess on your own?

439
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,500
[STIYL]
If that were the case,

440
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
then I'd have no
choice but to destroy

441
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,750
the leader right here.

442
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,625
I think I understand
what you're saying.

443
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,750
Good thing the question
was hypothetical.

444
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,291
Ah, well.

445
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,291
I guess we'll have to wait and
see what happens, won't we?

446
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,333
What?

447
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,416
Caution. Chapter four.

448
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,875
Connecting. By remote user.

449
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,375
Connection by remote confirmed.

450
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,208
Automatic purge of
risk factors initiated.

451
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,416
Now commencing.

452
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,333
[NIKOLAI]
Please, don't hold back.

453
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,083
If you've secured Sasha
Kruezhev, then commit already!

454
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,625
[FIAMMA] I have finished
preparing the attack.

455
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,916
You will not be able to
observe the military situation.

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,041
Soon, Academy City's
trademark control

457
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,000
will no longer be effective.

458
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,583
[FIAMMA] This is about
to become a true war.

459
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,541
[NIKOLAI]
Proceed however you like.

460
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,041
I have no problem with it
as long as I achieve my goal.

461
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,708
[FIAMMA] The goal of
becoming the Patriarch

462
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,041
of the Russian Church.

463
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,500
You're certainly going
to great lengths for it.

464
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,291
[NIKOLAI]
Enough about me.

465
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,875
Where are you right now?

466
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,916
I don't see you on their base.

467
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,625
Your signal has
completely disappeared

468
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,125
from those coordinates.

469
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,333
[FIAMMA laughing]

470
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,291
Oh, you'll find out very soon.

471
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,708
Like it or not.

472
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,500
[KAMIJO gasps]

473
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,125
What the--? [grunts]

474
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,833
[LESSAR]
Oh, crap!

475
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,333
[FIAMMA] What I was preparing
was not some giant magical item

476
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,916
or facility.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,041
It was the ability to
manipulate this space.

478
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,416
[PILOT 21A]
You can't be serious.

479
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,291
Don't you realize how much
of a risk you're taking

480
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,625
by doing this?

481
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,583
Probably not, but that's
because the risk involved

482
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,500
doesn't matter to me.

483
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,125
Between those who
are doing their best to kill

484
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,416
an innocent high-schooler,

485
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
and those who are
doing their best to save

486
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,333
that same innocent
high-schooler,

487
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,541
which side would
you want to be on?

488
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,250
Which one could you honestly
say you were proud of?

489
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,666
[MIKOTO]
Ugh. What am I doing?

490
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,375
This just isn't my style at all.

491
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,958
[PILOT 21A gasps, yells]

492
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,333
[MIKOTO]
What is that?!

493
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,583
No way. What's he doing?

494
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,500
[gasps]

495
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,333
You've gotta be kidding me!

496
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,125
Looks like the pilot is safe.

497
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,333
[MIKOTO grunts]

498
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,916
[MIKOTO grunts]

499
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,666
[MIKOTO]
Oh, great.

500
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,083
How am I supposed to get up
into the clouds from down here?

501
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
[footstep]

502
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
[MIKOTO]
Are you--?

503
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:21,333
"Misaka's serial
number is 10777,"

504
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,791
says Misaka, politely
answering Big Sister,

505
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,875
who clearly doesn't know
what to say in return.

506
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,750
I'm guessing by the
uniform you're with one of

507
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,208
Academy City's
Russian co-op outfits?

508
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
"Since the withdrawal there
has finally been completed,

509
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,958
the choice was made for
Misaka to have some

510
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,625
well-deserved private
time," says Misaka,

511
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,416
reporting her leisure-time mood,

512
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,916
while holding a
very dangerous rifle.

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,875
What do you mean
"private time?"

514
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,166
"Aren't you here
on private time, too?"

515
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,125
asks Misaka,
seeking confirmation.

516
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,041
[MIKOTO]
Uh... I mean...

517
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,708
I'm not here on business.

518
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,416
[KAMIJO] Wings of ice
spread across the night sky.

519
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,208
A giant aerial fortress.

520
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,083
Divine punishment meted out.

521
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,291
What tidings do the
angels and stars bid?

522
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,000
Next time, "Gabriel."

523
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,166
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
