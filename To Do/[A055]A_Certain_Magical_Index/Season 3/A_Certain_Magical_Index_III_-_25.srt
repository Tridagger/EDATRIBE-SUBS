1
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,916
[HAMAZURA grunts]

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,250
[HAMAZURA]
Come on.

3
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,000
Where are you, Takitsubo?

4
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,500
Damn it. Help me!

5
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,833
We have to dig her out of here
before the enemy finds us.

6
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,500
I can't do it on my own!

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,916
Why should I help you?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,166
It's freezing out here,

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,125
and she's still nowhere
near her full strength!

10
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,916
We need to get her warmed up!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,083
[MUGINO]
Tch.

12
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,041
Hamazura, I've had
enough of your whining!

13
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:57,250
[screaming]

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,500
[MUGINO]
Ugh... My head.

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,333
Damn those ability crystals.
Curse their stupid side effects.

16
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,375
So dizzy.

17
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,083
Be careful! We don't know
where she's buried.

18
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,833
Quit attacking me
and start digging!

19
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,958
[MUGINO]
Ugh. What's your problem?

20
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,083
The way I see it,
I gave you a head start.

21
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,208
It's hopeless!

22
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,791
I need someone gentle as a lamb,

23
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,125
not this rabid tiger who's
looking to devour me!

24
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,375
Huh?

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,916
Hey, look. Here's your
sweet little lamb now.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Huh?

27
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,583
No way!

28
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,000
[HAMAZURA]
Takitsubo!

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,375
Not right now. That comes first.

30
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,583
[HAMAZURA]
Uh?

31
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,041
Dark Matter?

32
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,291
[yelling]

33
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,500
No. That isn't Dark Matter.

34
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,500
And they're not Academy
City espers, either.

35
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,666
[HAMAZURA]
Huh?

36
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,541
[ATTACKER 25A] Esper powers
are a lot like flames.

37
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,791
Humans are the only ones
who can control flames.

38
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,500
But simply brandishing
them is no better

39
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,875
than being a caveman
swinging a torch.

40
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,000
Civilized people use
flame to forge iron.

41
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,041
This is the same thing.

42
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,583
[HAMAZURA]
So that's it.

43
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,750
They failed to fashion
Mugino into a weapon,

44
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,041
so they're here to retrieve her.

45
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,666
What's the next plan?

46
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,375
To turn her into a blast
furnace or something?

47
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,458
[gasps, yelps]

48
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,791
[HAMAZURA] Do you realize
what you've just done?

49
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,583
That bottle you broke
was the last hope

50
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,000
for negotiating
with Academy City!

51
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,500
It's the biological weapon
that Russia was going to use

52
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,250
according to the Kremlin
Report protocol!

53
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,958
Now you've infected us, too!

54
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,958
[ATTACKER 25A]
Huh? Damn it!

55
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,625
Ha! I'm kidding.

56
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,500
That was actually just
a bottle of club soda.

57
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,791
[ATTACKER 25B]
Ugh. Sneaky bastard!

58
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,958
[HAMAZURA yells]

59
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,833
I think you may be forgetting
something pretty important.

60
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,541
Mugino's probably still
got some blasts left.

61
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
Two or three, I'd say.

62
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,750
[ATTACKER 25C]
You're bluffing.

63
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,041
We're not gonna fall
for another stupid trick.

64
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,791
Oh, no? That's a shame.

65
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,208
Let's see if you're
still that confident

66
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,041
a few seconds from now.

67
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,708
[gasps]

68
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,541
[ATTACKER 25C]
What the--?

69
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,208
Shizuri Mugino?

70
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,833
The fourth-ranked
allowed somebody else

71
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,666
to help steady her aim?

72
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,416
I don't believe it.

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,458
So, you were planning
this trap the whole time?

74
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,458
Yeah. Thank you for
stepping right into it.

75
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,166
[ATTACKER 25C] Who knew
you were capable of this?

76
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,250
Me? I'm not.

77
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,125
But... ITEM is!

78
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,416
Take that thought
to hell with you.

79
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,666
[gunshot]

80
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,250
[ACCELERATOR]
Damn it. This is crazy.

81
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,750
It's so far beyond abnormal--

82
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,958
even the thought of
analyzing it is ridiculous.

83
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,291
Does this mean that the
very makeup of the world

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,458
is being transformed?

85
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,583
What do I care?

86
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,041
How's it coming?

87
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,583
Have you gotten the
data from the song

88
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,125
that purged Amata
Kihara's virus yet?

89
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,791
Yeah, in the Misaka Network,
a fairly shallow end.

90
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,458
Misaka does have the song,

91
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,291
but she can't render it
with her current specs.

92
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,041
The breathing technique and
internal resonance it requires

93
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,083
are not exactly normal.

94
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,083
It would be more efficient
to output the song

95
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,416
as electronic signals instead.

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,750
Music notes, pseudo-audio data,
or surround amplitude graphs?

97
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
Which one would you prefer?

98
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,791
All of 'em. Right now.

99
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,166
Being stingy's something
a third-stringer does.

100
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,375
You really can be demanding.

101
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,083
Then again, I suppose you're
more charming that way.

102
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,833
It's going to take more
than just this song

103
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,250
to get anywhere, right?

104
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,833
Wasn't there something
about converting

105
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,750
the specialized parameters?

106
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,916
I can manage it.
As long as I have this.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,375
Is this your way of
making fun of Misaka?

108
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
Sure hope you're
not trying to say

109
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,250
that creepy, occult-reeking
contract with the devil

110
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
has the necessary parameters
hidden within it.

111
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,833
No, I'm not.

112
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,125
Here, as far-removed from
Academy City as we are,

113
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,250
there just happens to be
a handbook lying around

114
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,875
with the solution in it?

115
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,833
It's almost like hunting
for a quest item

116
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,375
in a game or something!

117
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,833
[ACCELERATOR]
I told you, it's not that.

118
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,291
Whether it's high-level
security encryption,

119
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,875
or a secret code embedded
in an ancient diagram,

120
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,416
it all boils down to
the world of numbers.

121
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,958
The roots remain the
same no matter what.

122
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,708
I digitized all the
necessary data,

123
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,125
then put the puzzle
together inside my head,

124
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,416
and I should've been able
to solve it that way.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Misaka thoroughly enjoys hearing

126
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,041
the frustration and
displeasure in your voice

127
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,916
when you're forced to admit you
failed to accomplish something.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,375
[ACCELERATOR]
I can't solve the puzzle.

129
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,083
There's still a piece missing
in the math portion.

130
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,625
It's like some other form
of law's been mixed in,

131
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,958
which is the reason I've been
dredging up every last bit

132
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,666
of knowledge stored
away in my mind

133
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,541
to the point of exhaustion.

134
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,458
And then dredging up
some more, over and over.

135
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,166
And that's when I suddenly
realized something.

136
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,833
I already had some information
placed inside of me

137
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,166
that I didn't
comprehend at the time.

138
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
It happened not too long ago.

139
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,708
Sometime during the battle

140
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,833
between the water angel
and the science angel.

141
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,541
But I must have understood
it all on my own

142
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,500
long before that moment,

143
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,750
that some kind of unidentified
law was in effect.

144
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,666
Establish an imaginary
vector grid

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,666
that can process
these incongruities.

146
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,625
Back trace from the vectors
right in front of you

147
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,291
to highlight the laws that
have been put in place.

148
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,750
Once a single line of
this unique physical law

149
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,166
had been input, the
substance of the parchment

150
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,791
would immediately stand out.

151
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,250
But that's not what
was important.

152
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,333
What matters is that
once I solved the puzzle

153
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,250
using the clues I found,

154
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,541
the Aiwass vectors lodged inside
of me would begin to act.

155
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,125
They would've been able to
chip away at this deduction.

156
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,583
It's as close to realistic
as it's going to get,

157
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,000
and it's on the same level
as the Big Bang Theory.

158
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,333
In other words, it's done.

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,750
I've acquired the parameters
I need to save the kid.

160
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,458
From now on, I'm the one
who will turn the tables.

161
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,416
[ACCELERATOR] I made a promise
long ago that I would become

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,583
the ultimate villain
who would rescue her.

163
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,166
I fought all those sons
of bitches to the finish,

164
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,041
and a great darkness
swallowed my soul.

165
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,833
But... this fight is different.

166
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, yeah, that's right.

167
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,416
I can save her.

168
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,958
So there's no longer any
reason for me to be a villain.

169
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,500
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

170
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
Let's do this.

171
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,625
[ACCELERATOR]
The question is what am I?

172
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,541
[ACCELERATOR]
Am I good or evil?

173
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,875
Am I a man or a monster?

174
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,000
Am I ruled by science or magic?

175
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,916
[ACCELERATOR]
Maybe that's the answer.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,958
What I am... is something
that cannot be defined

177
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,708
by any other word than "me."

179
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,916
Why bother? How can
you hope to stop me?

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,541
Your power only works to
neutralize other powers.

181
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,083
All you are is an adapter--

182
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,750
a mere anchor for that hand
until the designated time.

183
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,458
You're nothing more
than a potato vine

184
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,458
that falls back into the
earth after the harvest!

185
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,333
Heh.

186
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,000
[KAMIJO]
You still don't get it, do you?

187
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,875
Remember what you said?

188
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,208
That the power of your right arm

189
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,208
varies according to the
strength of your opponent.

190
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,708
You decided you wanted
to try stimulating

191
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,541
its maximum power.

192
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,250
You thought starting World War
Three would do the trick.

193
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,958
You wanted to fuel
the people's hatred.

194
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,500
That way your enemy
would be clearly defined,

195
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,625
and the rest would
be smooth sailing.

196
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,083
But have you ever
thought about this?

197
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,958
What if you're wrong?

198
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,291
What if there isn't
as much hatred

199
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,916
in everyone's heart
as you think?

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,333
Then you wouldn't
be able to summon

201
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,791
the amount of power
you're imagining!

202
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,416
You're operating under
a false assumption.

203
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
The four fundamental
elements were about to be

204
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,083
permanently disrupted.

205
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,125
Lucky for the entire world,
I stepped in and restored them.

206
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,583
The war that I started is
not ending any time soon.

207
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,166
The larger conflict springs

208
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,875
from all the smaller
thorns in people's sides,

209
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,125
spreading out all over the world
until there is nothing left.

210
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,041
Resource shortages.
Racial conflicts.

211
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,041
Religious differences.
Food shortages.

212
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,583
International conflicts.
Environmental destruction.

213
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,166
They are all results of
the evil man creates.

214
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,375
Like that's some
great revelation!

215
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,250
That darkness lurks
in man's true nature.

216
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,791
There may be some
malice within me

217
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,750
that I'm not ready
to admit is there.

218
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,500
However, there's more to
human nature than just that!

219
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,833
Like what?

220
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,166
[KAMIJO]
How can you say flat-out

221
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,875
that people's inner workings
are only one-sided?

222
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,291
Even if it's true,

223
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,833
and everyone you meet has
a dark side buried within,

224
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,833
how can you declare
that's all there is?

225
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,625
We don't have to have a reason!
People don't have to explain.

226
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,291
They believe in fighting
for those they love,

227
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,250
and that's all there is to it.

228
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,791
I, myself, have been saved
by that power, so I know!

229
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,291
All this without any reason?

230
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,875
That sounds like the kind of
logic that only applies to us.

231
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,166
If there was a nuclear missile

232
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,541
about to be launched
right in front of you,

233
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,333
no one could do
anything to save you

234
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,166
without a key to stop it.

235
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,583
So why would they bother?

236
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,625
'Cause they don't need a key!

237
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,833
That's only one way
to resolve the situation!

238
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,000
Anyone can fight
if they want to!

239
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,833
Even if the rest of the world
turns against them.

When it involves someone
they care about,

they'll risk their own
lives to protect them.

I'm going to get
Index back from you.

243

And that's not all.

244
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,333
I'm gonna put a stop to science
and magic fighting each other.

That fortress.

00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,958
Did you know that it

and churches of the cross
from all around the world?

were gathered together

and placed in the same spot

mentioned before,

the Roman Orthodox Church must
be involved in this as well.

of that, silly.

00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,583
[gasps]

350
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,083
Warning. Chapter forty-seven,
verse eighty now activating.

351
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,875
Psychological effects present,

352
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,333
causing severe physical
and mental restraint.

353
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,291
Redirecting spell effect
into dummy location

354
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:42,250
and prioritizing security of
back-calculation abilities.

355
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,833
You're still a library
of 103,000 grimoires.

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,708
I never expected that would
be enough to contain you.

357
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,291
Even so, it doesn't matter.

358
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,375
If that confounded boy
is finally able to bring

359
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,666
an end to this madness,
it will be a win for all of us.

360
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,958
[footsteps]

361
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,958
Very well. As you wish.

362
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:06,416
Our quota appears to be filled,
so you will have your reward.

363
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,625
Meanwhile, I will do
everything I possibly can

364
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,750
to help retrieve the
grimoire library.

365
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,666
[yells]

366
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,291
What now?

367
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,291
Why isn't this going
the way I wanted?

368
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,625
[FIAMMA yells]

369
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,666
[LESSAR] The English Puritans,
the Roman Orthodox Church,

370
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,166
and the Russian Church
have all begun

371
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,416
breaking down the Star of
Bethlehem's joint spell.

372
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,541
We're just about to climb into
an escape chamber over here.

373
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,416
There aren't very
many of them left.

374
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,375
You have to work
faster than that!

375
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,833
It's all over, Fiamma.

376
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,125
Your right arm as well
your ceremonial site,

377
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,541
the Star of Bethlehem,

378
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,625
they're both losing power now!

379
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,458
If it was truly your
desire to save the world

380
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,875
more than anything,
then you would be ecstatic

381
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,291
to see the people's goodwill
winning out over evil!

382
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,000
If you don't see it that way,

383
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,833
then your fantasy has
already been shattered!

384
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,583
I know that I'm at a
disadvantage in this situation.

385
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,125
And with the way things stand,

386
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,708
I find it unlikely that I'll be
able to continue as planned.

387
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,708
[chuckles]

388
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,958
So I'll have to
make some changes.

389
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,125
[gasps]

390
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,541
[FIAMMA] This is actually the
outcome that you've invited.

391
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,708
[KAMIJO]
What do you mean?

392
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,333
[FIAMMA] You see,
the earth was originally

393
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,541
supposed to be
transformed in stages.

394
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,625
However, all of the
goodwill you rave about

395
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,416
has prevented that
from happening.

396
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,125
As a result, an unnatural
distortion has developed

397
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,666
between heaven and earth.

398
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,750
Which means all that's
left for us to do now

399
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,041
is to wait patiently for
the accumulated telesma

400
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,625
to come plunging
down from above.

401
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,833
Honestly, even though
this is not the route

402
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,750
I had originally anticipated,

403
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,041
as long as the earth ends
up inundated with light,

404
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,625
the outcome is all the same.

405
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,250
Do you know what's
really going to happen?

406
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,750
If that tremendous
amount of power

407
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,125
starts to run amok
uncontrollably,

408
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,416
it could cause all of human
civilization to be destroyed!

409
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,916
[FIAMMA]
That's true.

410
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,375
And it would be quite a
shame for you, wouldn't it?

411
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,458
As for all the goodwill
you speak of,

412
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,333
despite how much may
be burgeoning forth

413
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:24,291
amidst this war, an overwhelming
power will crush it from above.

414
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,291
This divine punishment
will sweep down

415
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,750
on the fruits of mankind,

416
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,958
wiping them from the
face of the earth.

417
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,166
Great change is
born out of pain.

418
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,166
And just as the destruction
of the Tower of Babel

419
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,375
once severed the
ties of humanity,

420
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,291
I will use the animosity
brought about by this

421
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,625
to pick up the broken
pieces I see before me

422
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,791
and once again draw
upon tremendous power!

423
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,875
Damn you, Fiamma!

424
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,500
[FIAMMA]
I'm afraid your preferred way

425
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,708
of saving the world
is overruled.

426
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,958
You're too late.
I've already won.

427
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,166
[KAMIJO] There is still
something left for me to do.

428
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,625
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:05,500
I promise... I will return soon.

430
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,416
Next Time, "Son of God."

431
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,916
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
