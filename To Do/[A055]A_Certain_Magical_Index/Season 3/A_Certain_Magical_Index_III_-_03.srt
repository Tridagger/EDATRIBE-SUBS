1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,416
[TERRA]
Well, well, well.

2
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,291
What is the matter?

3
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,000
Why ever did you stop?
Please amuse me some more.

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,916
[TERRA]
Precedence!

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,166
The motion of the
spear will be lower.

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,083
The air will be higher.

7
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,125
[ITSUWA gasps]

8
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,458
[KAMIJO yells]

9
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,333
[KAMIJO]
Crap, I missed!

10
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,625
[grunts]

11
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,583
I'm still alive?

12
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,875
But how?

13
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,333
Was that attack different
from the previous one?

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,625
[ITSUWA]
Flour? Is it symbolic?

15
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,708
Meant to signify
the flesh of God?

16
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, my.

17
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,791
Even an easterner
like you can tell that?

18
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,750
By any rationalization,
there is no way

19
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,833
a mortal man would be
able to kill the Son of God.

20
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,458
And yet, the legend says
that it was His fate

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,916
to be crucified by
mortals in order to take

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,541
the original sin of
man upon Himself.

23
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,625
To that end,
there was an alteration

24
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,666
to the order of
precedence performed

25
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,833
between man and the Son of God.

26
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,458
It is this esoteric
procedure of changing

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,208
the order of priority
to fulfill mythology

28
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,416
that is my technique--

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,666
It's called
The Light's Execution.

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,666
That's it.

31
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,375
He prioritized a spear
made out of flour

32
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,333
over the outside wall,
which is why it had

33
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,166
such a destructive force.

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,750
And because the air
had priority over the spear,

35
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,583
Itsuwa's attack was
stopped dead in its tracks.

36
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,708
Is this the power of
the Right Seat of God?

37
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,125
So in the face
of that technique,

38
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
all the strengths and weaknesses

39
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,500
of any opponent
become irrelevant.

40
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,583
Oh, dear, you're
looking troubled again.

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,166
Either try to find a way
to defeat me or run away,

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,041
but don't just stand there.

43
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,916
I am going to give
you ten seconds.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,666
I expect you to
use it to come up

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,416
with your plan of attack.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,541
[chuckling]

47
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,208
That is, assuming there
is one that actually exists!

48
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,125
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
In ten seconds, I could come up

49
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,208
with at least three plans!

50
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,500
Precedence.

51
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,083
Magic is lower,
and skin is higher.

52
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,291
[KAMIJO gasps]

53
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,750
Tsuchimikado!

54
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,333
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Sorry to keep
you waiting so long, Kami.

55
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,333
Ha! I hope you're not going
to tell me that that was your

56
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,708
big breakout strategy.

57
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,708
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Unfortunately
for you, I've got you cornered.

58
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,500
This next move
will be checkmate.

59
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,875
[TERRA laughs]

60
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,500
Do you really think you
can fight me with that toy?

61
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,666
Precedence!

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,375
Bullets are lower,
skin is higher!

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,666
Heh, it's like I said.

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,125
You've been checkmated.

65
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,125
[CROWD yelling]

66
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't need this.

67
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:14,000
[TERRA] I see, so that's how
it's going to be, Aleister?

68
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,375
There's just a regular
spellcaster using

69
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,500
the Document of C
in the Papal Palace.

70
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,958
It would be quite bothersome
if they were attacked

71
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,333
by a large-scale military force.

72
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,541
So you leave me
no other choice.

73
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,791
Hold it! [yells]

74
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,583
Are you okay?

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,875
Come on, Kami, we gotta
head to the Papal Palace, too.

76
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,666
They're from Academy City,
those powered suits.

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,541
But they weren't supposed
to make a move.

78
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,625
We need to go
after Terra right now.

79
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,291
At this point,
the Right Seat of God

80
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,916
is about to wage an all-out war,

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,750
so if we want to stop
the Document of C,

82
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,166
we have to do it now or
we're gonna lose our chance.

83
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,083
Why would they target us?

84
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,541
You guys go on ahead
to the Palace. Leave.

85
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,458
I'll stay here and deal with
these Academy City idiots.

86
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
You'll be okay?

87
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,583
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Yeah, it's not
like they're entrenched enemies

88
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,833
or anything.

89
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,458
I think I can find some
room for negotiation.

90
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,541
Now go!

91
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,333
Damn it!

92
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,625
[ITSUWA] Looks like they're
knocking out rioters

93
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,000
and removing them from
town in those balloons.

94
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,208
Tsuchimikado wouldn't
pull something like this.

95
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,541
Are we just supposed to
accept this kind of violence

96
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,125
as a way of doing things?

97
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,833
It doesn't look like
there's anybody here.

98
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,208
I have to wonder.

99
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,500
Where did those
powered suits come from?

100
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,041
[ITSUWA]
Huh?

101
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,333
And what the hell is Academy
City planning to do with them?

102
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,458
Hey, Misaka?
Is this a good time?

103
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,833
[MIKOTO]
Are you kidding me?

104
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,541
You can't send a single text
and now you're calling

105
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,916
out of the blue!
What do you-- 

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,291
Can you look at the news?
Either TV or internet?

107
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,750
I need you to check and see
if there's anything going on

108
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,541
in a city called Avignon.

109
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,083
Huh? Are you serious?

110
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,000
Avignon is all
they're talking about.

111
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,208
Jeez.

112
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,958
They're saying a religious
group made weapons

113
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,916
of mass destruction and
violated international law.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,500
Apparently, Academy City
is helping to carry out

115
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,750
a mopping-up operation.

116
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,208
Wait, where are you right now?

117
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,791
Hello? You're, uh, cutting out.

118
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,666
--What the--?
--[MIKOTO] Hello?

119
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,375
[KAMIJO]
That sound... It's gone now.

120
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,875
Itsuwa, did you...?

121
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,541
[ITSUWA yells]

122
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,458
[TERRA]
Well, this is a fine mess.

123
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,000
While trying to stop
the chaos of the riots,

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,041
you create an even
larger disturbance

125
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,083
and get caught up in it.

126
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,125
I suppose we're
seeing just how serious

127
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,291
Academy City is about this.

128
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,416
He has the Document of C!

129
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,583
[laughs]

130
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,791
The ordinary caster
enacting the spell

131
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,708
was being targeted
by Academy City forces.

132
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,666
So I thought it prudent
of me to recover this first.

133
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,083
I am not able to
perform mortal spells,

134
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,583
and average spellcasters
hold me back.

135
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Therefore, I think it would
be wise to cut things short.

136
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,916
You think I'm gonna
let you walk away?

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,416
Suit yourselves.

138
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,125
You can stay here and fight
to your heart's content.

139
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,416
After all, I much prefer
to keep things interesting!

140
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,250
[TSUCHIMIKADO chuckles]

141
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,250
You blockheads have one job,
so make yourselves useful.

142
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,666
And act as a shield!

143
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,541
That's not the kind of side
effect you can ever really

144
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,708
get used to.

145
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,416
Now wake up, ya' bastards!

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,166
Smash it all up so we
can go home laughing!

147
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO grunts]

148
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,125
I surrender.

149
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,750
You can do whatever
you want with me.

150
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
Go on.

151
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,958
Let's see what you're
capable of, shall we?

152
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Wondering how I did that?

153
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,208
Those H-S-P-S-fifteens
are equipped

154
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,458
with fancy new stand-alone
auxiliary drive units,

155
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,708
which is a mixed blessing.

156
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,875
See, they're still prototypes
with a lot of bugs left to fix.

157
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,708
When you give it any
contradictory conditional input,

158
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,916
its decision-making
functions freeze.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's worse--for you at least--

160
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,125
is that the onboard
databank functions

161
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,583
are overdeveloped.

162
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,750
So if one suit malfunctions,
all of them are affected.

163
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,000
And now, you've all been
stopped in your tracks.

164
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,208
Those are Academy City's
supersonic stealth bombers--

165
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,250
H-S-B-zero-twos.

166
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,958
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
What are you thinking, Aleister?

167
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,041
It'll take more than that to
eliminate the Document of C.

168
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,250
Or is there another
trick up his sleeve?

169
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,916
Operation A
objective accomplished.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,041
B is next.
Get your parachute.

171
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,500
[ACCELERATOR]
Don't need it.

172
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,458
So now they're opening
fire on the outside, too.

173
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
[BOMBER TECH 03A]
Commencing Operation B.

174
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,791
[ACCELERATOR] Heh. With just
three kilograms of iron sand,

175
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,458
these Earth Blades could

There's a change of plans.

The target is the
Papal Palace, right?

181

Then concentrate your
main attack there first.

Looks like I have a

That spell has a weakness.

There was something unnatural
about what you just did.

Is that so? How troubling.

The name raised my expectations.

But I never imagined
it could be so flawed.

Oh, my. You really don't know?

00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,333
you should have--

You haven't by chance forgotten
anything you shouldn't have?

[KAMIJO]
Why, you...!

223
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,041
[TERRA]
Does that mean I'm right?

224
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,791
And have you been keeping
this memory loss hidden?

00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,083
But for what reason?

226
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,333
Maybe your sorceress
friend knows?

227
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,000
I bet it would be fascinating
to discover why

00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,125
you've lost your memories.

229
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,375
[KAMIJO]
I won't reveal it.

230
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,541
For her sake.

00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,291
I've made it this far
without telling anyone!

00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,458
Well, I suppose
it doesn't matter

233
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,625
since you're about to die.

234
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,125
[KAMIJO]
I won't let him get to me.

235
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,541
I have to figure out what
his spell's weakness is.

236
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,833
[TERRA] Oh, no, does this mean
you won't be coming for me?

Now how could that be?

241
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,416
You deflected Itsuwa's spear
and Tsuchimikado's spell.

242
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,041
So why couldn't your
Precedence defend

00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,541
against a simple wallet?

244
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,708
Now that I think
about it, it's strange.

245
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,458
Even after taking a
direct hit from that blade,

246
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,208
Itsuwa and I are still alive.

to hold back on us,

or allow us to escape.

00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,000
Which makes it all very simple.

00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,916
It's not that you
decided not to kill us.

It's that you couldn't!

than one target at a time!

253

Or am I wrong?

254
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,791
There are still some kinks
to work out, you're right.

255
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,166
But what good is
knowing that gonna do?

256
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,583

whole lot more than that

To drag a whole city
in like this?

of this commotion.

something I've been wondering.

to redefine salvation

that fantasy to rest.

[LIDVIA] Now that they've
eliminated the original sin

00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,875
that binds them to humanity,

318
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,000
they are searching for a
method to become like angels.

319
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,166
[STIYL] All right, and what
does that have to do

320
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,916
with the Right Seat's name?

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,083
The word "right" in this
sense means Equivalent.

322
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,000
The angels Lucifer
and Michael were a pair,

323
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,666
until one defeated the other.

324
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,708
And thus obtained the
power that allowed them

325
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,208
to sit on the right,
or equal, side of God.

326
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,916
So then you're saying
that their ultimate goal

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,083
is to attain the place
occupied by Michael?

328
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,500
Well, no. That is...

329
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,875
They want the seat,
but it's not their endgame.

330
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,041
Once they possess that
power, they can use it

331
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,291
to transform from angels
into something more.

332
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,875
Or so they seem to believe.

333
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:17,000
"La persona superiore

all right, Terra.

A-ha.

As long as the attacks
are all the same type

or are delivered one at a time,

my Precedence serves
me quite well.

to deploy our forces.

350
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,041
[ACQUA]
Very well.

351
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,750
But before we do that,
I need to have a word with you.

352
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,916
I've heard some disturbing
rumors I'm hoping

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,208
you can clarify.

354
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,166
These reports are saying
you're using children

355
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,583
and tourists in Roman
suburbs to improve

356
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,333
the alignment of your spell?

357
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,375
Oh, yes. Of course.

358
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,041
Is that really something
to fuss over, though?

359
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,041
It works.

360
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,416
I'm sure.

361
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,291
I just thought you were
supposed to be representing

362
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,708
salvation for all people
of the world equally.

363
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,250
[TERRA]
I'll have you know.

364
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,750
I've only ever used heathens
as my test subjects.

365
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,583
They've been a blessing,
thanks to their contribution,

366
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,458
I've discovered new
improvements and realignments

367
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,750
that my Light's
Executioner needs.

368
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,916
[ACQUA]
But first...

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,416
I'm afraid there's
something more pressing

370
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,791
that needs to be done.

371
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,000
[ACQUA grunts]

372
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,291
[TERRA groaning]

373
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,125
[ACQUA] Just so you know,
there is absolutely no way

374
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,708
God will ever choose
you as one of His own.

375
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,166
He knows everything
you've done, Terra.

376
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,500
You can ask Him all about it
yourself at Final Judgment.

377
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,583
[ROMAN POPE] This is the
Basilica of San Pietro.

378
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,541
As a member of the
vaunted Right Seat of God,

379
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,583
one would hope you would
have better manners

380
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,000
than to destroy it in the
presence of the Roman pope.

381
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,291
[ACQUA]
I apologize.

382
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,541
Tell me.

383
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,791
What is the next move
you're going to make?

384
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:31,000
[ACQUA] Vento is unable to act,
and Terra's been purged.

385
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,000
So that leaves only
one course of action.

386
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,875
And what could that be?

387
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,083
You're planning to attack Japan
by way of Russia as Terra said?

388
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,583
[ACQUA] This incident
has taught me something.

389
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,333
Civilians should not
stand on the battlefield.

390
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,250
Only soldiers need
to cross swords.

391
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,750
I see.

392
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,666
You're saying it will be you.

393
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,666
As a member of the
Right Seat of God,

394
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,750
and one who bears
the qualities of a saint,

395
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,041
you will step up.

396
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,791
Acqua of the Rear.

397
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,291
[KAMIJO]
You know about it?

398
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,833
[TERRA laughs]

399
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,750
If you're asking
me for confirmation,

400
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,875
then it would seem you really
have lost your memory.

401
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,333
[MIKOTO]
What's going on?!

402
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,541
Amnesia?

403
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,166
Him?

404
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,333
[KAMIJO] In a city on the
verge of its law collapsing,

405
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,625
an organization lurks
in the darkness.

406
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,333
Who will slip through
the tangle of outcry

407
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,250
and bullets to survive?

408
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,416
Next time, "The Dark
Side of Academy City."

409
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,250
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
