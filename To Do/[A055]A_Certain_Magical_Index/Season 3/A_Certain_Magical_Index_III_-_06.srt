00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,166
[MUGINO yawns]

2
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,875
Man. Come on. He's so slow.

3
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,208
Hamazura?

4
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,916
Yeah. I sent him out on a
garbage run a while ago.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,833
And he's supposed to
pick up a salmon lunch

6
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,000
after he's done with that.

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,625
It's about time.
What took you so long? Huh?

8
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,250
[KAKINE]
Ah, so this is where you are.

9
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,333
Well, if it isn't Dark Matter.

10
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,250
I really wish you
would use my name.

11
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,041
If you've forgotten,
I'll refresh your memory.

12
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,000
It's Teitoku Kakine.

13
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,458
And I thought I'd stop
by to declare victory.

14
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,041
[HAMAZURA]
I don't know who you are, but...

15
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,875
I'm sorry that I'm the
one sending you off.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,375
[HAMAZURA]
In this city,

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,333
those without power
are like trash.

18
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,708
Nobody even bothers
to help them.

19
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,916
And I'm sure I'm one of them.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
[phone buzzing]

21
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,000
[HAMAZURA]
Kinuhata?

22
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,875
I was just finishing the job.

23
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,666
[KINUHATA]
Hamazura, secure us a vehicle

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,291
as fast as you can, please.

25
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,833
[HAMAZURA]
Huh?

26
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,750
We're currently under
fire from SCHOOL.

27
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,125
[HAMAZURA]
What?

28
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,083
It appears that one of
their targets is Takitsubo.

29
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,083
I bet they're here because they
heard about her AIM Stalker.

30
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,625
They wanna get rid of her.

31
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,833
As long as she stays safe,
we can still turn this around.

32
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,125
So, I need you to get
her somewhere safe as--

33
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,041
Kinuhata!

34
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,125
I'm ultra-fine.

35
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,625
[TAKITSUBO]
I'm fighting with you.

36
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,625
That's okay.
You just stay put.

37
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,875
There you are!

38
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,041
[gasps]

39
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,750
[KAKINE]
Huh? What is this?

40
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,666
Oh, that was awesome.

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,000
Guess they were snuffed.

42
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,791
Tough break for Sunazara
and his sniper rifle, huh?

43
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,166
[KINUHATA] Which means
you're gonna have to face me!

44
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,708
Do you really think
you can beat me

45
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,708
with Level Four Offense Armor?

46
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,666
I'm well beyond the level you're
able to scheme your way out of.

47
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,666
[HAMAZURA] Either I go up
there and get killed,

48
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,625
or I bail and wind up
in the incinerator.

49
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,166
[yelps]

50
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,416
Damn it!

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,708
[HAMAZURA]
Kinuhata?

52
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,541
Huh?

53
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,125
Let her go right now!

54
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,666
Who the hell are you?

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,708
Don't tell me you're expecting
to defeat me with that toy.

56
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,916
Oh, so you're a
sacrificial pawn.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,666
Your big boss Mugino
has already left.

58
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,458
Of course. Damn that woman!

59
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,333
[TAKITSUBO]
No, don't.

60
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,125
Just go. Please, Hamazura.

61
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm Level Four. You're Zero.

62
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,750
It's okay. I promise
I'll protect you.

63
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,791
Takitsubo.

64
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,083
What is that?

65
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,041
What the--?

66
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,541
Are you trying to disrupt
my AIM diffusion field?

67
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,666
You wanna take
over my ability?

68
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,916
Hurry up, Hamazura!

69
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,208
[gunshot]

70
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,708
[KAKINE] I don't recall
ever asking for help.

71
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,666
[GIRL IN DRESS]
Hello. Long time, no see.

72
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,208
[HAMAZURA]
What? You again?

73
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,083
[GIRL IN DRESS]
Hm? So that's what happened.

74
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,541
Yeah.

75
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
She must be really desperate
to use an Ability Crystal.

76
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,500
I don't even know what that is.

77
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,041
It's a chemical that triggers
an adverse reaction.

78
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,958
She was using it to make her
ability run out of control.

79
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,708
In most cases though, it does
nothing but harm to the user.

80
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,250
And even if it does
produce favorable results,

81
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,833
one shouldn't keep using it.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,250
[cries]

83
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,625
Takitsubo!

84
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,458
She just has to use her
power one or two more times

85
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,375
and she'll destroy herself.

86
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,625
That's fine by me. She can
finish the job for us.

87
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,125
[GIRL IN DRESS]
Heart Measure.

88
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,458
What that does is shrink
the emotional distance

89
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,041
between you and me.

90
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,833
The closeness we feel now is...
I dunno, that of old friends?

91
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,750
You wouldn't shoot your
friend, would you?

92
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,958
[HAMAZURA]
Applied telepathy?

93
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,750
[gasps]

94
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,291
[yells]

95
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,166
Damn it!

96
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,125
Takitsubo!

97
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,291
[phone buzzing]

98
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,083
[HAMAZURA]
Mugino.

99
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,666
[MUGINO] Hamazura,
I'm looking for Takitsubo.

100
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,416
Is she with you?

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,833
Damn it, Mugino!

102
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,000
You're just gonna run
away by yourself?

103
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,958
[MUGINO] Do me a favor
and pipe down, all right?

104
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,375
Our counterattack begins
now, so be ready.

105
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,666
We'll take this chance
and use Takitsubo's power

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,750
to pursue SCHOOL.

107
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,875
[HAMAZURA]
That's crazy!

108
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,416
You're gonna get
everyone killed!

109
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,333
Besides, she's in
no shape for that!

110
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,333
So she's still alive, then?

111
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,916
Well, thank goodness!

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because I am going to need her
to produce some serious results

113
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,416
even if it kills her.

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,916
Now then.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,291
[gasps]

116
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,083
Just go, Hamazura.

117
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,541
I don't want to get
you killed. Go.

118
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,833
[gasps]

119
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,708
[KAMIJO] Will you accept
no responsibility?

120
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,666
You ever try asking for help?
Or just lashing out?

121
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,125
The reason people
look down on you

122
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,125
has nothing to do with power,
or your lack of it.

123
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,375
That's just an illusion
you're clinging to.

124
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,208
At some point, you'll
need to let it go.

125
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,208
How about right now?

126
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,333
[HAMAZURA]
Yeah, an illusion.

127
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,750
I get it now.

128
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,791
He was right, damn it!

129
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,500
[YOMIKAWA]
Really, Hamazura?

130
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,541
You do know what I do
for a living, right?

131
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,666
I know it looks bad. I'll
explain everything afterwards!

132
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,291
I just need you to take
her somewhere safe

133
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,416
as fast as possible!

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,458
She could fall apart
at any moment

135
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,541
because of something called
an Ability Crystal.

136
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,000
[YOMIKAWA]
Excuse me?!

137
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,291
What did you say?

138
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,333
Because I thought you
said "Ability Crystal."

139
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,000
[HAMAZURA]
I did! That's the reason she's--

140
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,541
[MUGINO]
Hamazura!

141
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,041
I've been looking for
you all over the place!

142
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,916
It's exhausting lugging
around this baggage!

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,750
You're not gonna make me do
this to you too, are you?

144
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,083
She betrayed ITEM.

145
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,791
Okay, what's going on here?

146
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,375
Just go!

147
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,083
You're not going to force me to
hide behind a child like this!

148
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,583
Get out of here right now!

149
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,666
Please go.

150
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,375
If we wait too much longer,
she's gonna die.

151
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,750
I've wasted a lot of
time just worrying.

152
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,333
I'm done with that!

153
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,250
I know this is what I wanna do,
but I can't protect her alone.

154
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,000
So you have to take her away.

155
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
If you don't, everything
will go up in smoke

156
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,041
right in front of us.

157
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,333
[MUGINO chuckles]

158
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,916
Electrifying,
isn't it, Hamazura?

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,208
How did you get that?

160
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,250
[HAMAZURA]
It doesn't matter.

161
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,041
Because you won't be
able to force Takitsubo

162
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,625
to use her ability
without it, will you?

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
[laughs]

164
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,333
Try to catch me,
you psychotic hag!

165
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,708
[crash]

166
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,208
Hamazura.

167
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:58,583
Run all you want, it won't
be long before I kill you.

168
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,500
[MUGINO]
Mmm... Nice place.

169
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,541
I can understand why you
would wanna choose

170
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,916
an unmanned facility.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
It's definitely
the perfect choice

172
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,375
when you're about to die alone.

173
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,000
Your time is up, Hamazura!

174
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,791
[MUGINO]
This is ridiculous.

175
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,250
Stop making things so difficult.

176
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,166
Just hand over
the Ability Crystals

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,000
and we'll call it a day.

178
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,208
[grunts]

179
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,583
I hope you realize
I'm not going to rest

180
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,541
until I kill every single
member of SCHOOL.

181
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,125
So give me the crystals.

182
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,791
[HAMAZURA]
I refuse!

183
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,583
I won't let Takitsubo
use them anymore.

184
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,791
[MUGINO]
What?

185
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,291
She's already reached
her limit with them!

186
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,333
You think it matters if she has?

187
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,666
Once she's all spent,

188
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,083
I'll just recruit another
esper to replace her.

189
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,583
Well, then again,
she is the only one

190
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,583
who can actually search AIM
diffusion fields for us.

191
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,000
I guess it's fine if another
esper does it differently--

192
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,625
as long as I always
know where those

193
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,458
SCHOOL bastards are.

194
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm sorry, but I can't
work with you anymore.

195
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,291
You'll never be able
to beat Kakine.

196
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,083
You've already run away
from him twice now.

197
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,416
It appears that you have
a couple of screws loose

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,416
in that thick head
of yours, Hamazura.

199
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,541
Let me tighten them!

200
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,958
[HAMAZURA]
She said...

201
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,750
Takitsubo said she
didn't want me to die.

202
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,625
Why? When I've been
such a selfish jerk?

203
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,958
It's up to me to make sure

204
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,583
someone like her
finds happiness!

205
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,208
[MUGINO screams]

206
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,333
I give you a Level Zero ear.

207
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,250
In exchange for a
Level Five eyeball.

208
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,041
Now that's a bargain,
am I right?

209
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,666
Hamazura!

210
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,125
It doesn't make any difference!

211
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,125
Rip off my arms and legs,
or tear up my internal organs,

212
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,708
it wouldn't change how
outclassed you are!

213
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
I am a Level Five,
do you hear me?

214
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,833
I could kill a hundred
of you Level Zeros

215
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,500
without having to lift a finger!

216
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,166
[HAMAZURA] Then what does
this say about me?

217
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,416
Well, that was easy.
Ms. Level Five.

218
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Damn. I really did get the
better end of that deal, huh?

219
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,250
Hamazura.

220
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,750
Hamazura!

221
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,166
[yells]

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,208
It's Hamazura.

223
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,958
Um. I don't need
Antiskill's help anymore.

224
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,583
Yeah. It's all over.

225
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,458
So, has there been any progress

226
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,791
on the data analysis
of the tweezers?

227
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,541
There has. But it's no use.

228
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,000
Nothing we've uncovered in
all of our research so far

229
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,291
is going to be enough to put me
on equal footing with Aleister.

230
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,708
We'll just have to
make another push.

231
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,041
Then you're gonna
do it, aren't you?

232
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,750
[KAKINE] I'll kill the
top-ranked guy in Academy City.

233
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,333
[phone ringing]

234
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah?

235
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,458
[SHADOWY MAN]
Excellent work.

236
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,083
BLOCK's plot to assassinate
a governing board chairman

237
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,583
has failed.

238
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,750
It pleases me greatly to have
such capable subordinates.

239
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,000
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

240
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,291
Sounds like you wanna
get killed pretty badly.

241
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,583
[SHADOWY MAN]
Not at all.

242
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,000
I am genuinely
grateful for this.

243
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,166
Which is why I'd like to offer
some valuable information

244
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,958
as a personal reward.

245
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,041
Specifically regarding
a threat to the life

246
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,333
of Serial Number
20,001, Last Order.

247
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,625
[gasps]

248
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,333
By the way, what ever
happened to the lost child?

249
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,833
Is your crazy hair still getting
all those tickley feelings,

250
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,291
or did they go away?

251
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,500
"Misaka doesn't have crazy
hair," answers Misaka Misaka

252
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,416
as she starts to wither
from exhaustion.

253
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
"Hmm.

254
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm pretty positive they were
wandering around here earlier,"

255
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,708
says Misaka Misaka.

256
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
"But then they went
somewhere else," she added,

257
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,541
still tired from all
that walking she did.

258
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,958
Ah!

259
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,833
"Misaka really wants
one of those, too!"

260
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,583
says Misaka Misaka
with excitement

261
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,916
even though she has no money.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,625
But Misaka has a thought,
and turns toward Uiharu

263
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,000
with a sparkle in her eye.

264
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,583
Aw. How can I resist?

265
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,166
[UIHARU]
Here.

266
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,666
Be sure to come back right
after you're done, okay?

267
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,625
[UIHARU sighs]

268
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,166
Oh, well.

269
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
In the meantime, I'll just enjoy
having some of this sundae.

270
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,083
[KAKINE]
Please pardon the interruption.

271
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm trying to find this girl.
Have you seen her?

272
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,250
Sorry, I'm afraid I haven't.

273
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,541
You should file a report
with an Antiskill station

274
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,083
as soon as possible, though.

275
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,500
You're right.
That's a great idea.

276
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,916
Thanks.

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,708
Oh, and, Miss? There's
something I forgot to mention.

278
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,291
[gasps]

279
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,041
[KAKINE] I know Last Order was
just here, you little airhead!

280
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,583
Guess I should've
said that to start!

281
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:51,208
[KAKINE] Where is she now?
Tell me, and I'll let you go.

282
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,750
You'll never find her.

283
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,083
[KAKINE]
Huh?

284
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,291
Could you not hear me up there?

285
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,750
I said she's in a place where
you'll never be able to find her

286
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,541
no matter how hard you look.

287
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,291
Ha!

288
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,791
Very well, then.

289
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,333
This is where we'll say goodbye.

290
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,041
Ha.

291
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,583
You showed up much sooner
than I was expecting.

292
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, man. What is this crap?

293
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,208
Don't get all worked up

294
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,583
playing these pathetic
games, Third-string.

295
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,458
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

296
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,958
[ACCELERATOR] Not a good
look for you, Fairy-boy.

297
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,000
I know what it looks like.
Don't you worry.

298
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,333
Yes, let's focus on something
that'll be useful to you.

299
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,833
You need to learn to act more
like a villain and I can help!

300
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,083
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

301
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,666
[KAKINE]
Fun fact.

302
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,291
Did you know that
everything in the universe

303
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,708
is made up of
elementary particles?

304
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,291
It's true.

305
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,125
Although, that particular rule
doesn't apply to my Dark Matter.

306
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,500
Because what I've
produced doesn't exist.

307
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,791
At all. Anywhere
in the universe.

308
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,208
And I don't mean that it
should theoretically exist

309
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,791
and we just haven't
discovered it yet,

310
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,791
or some crap like that.

311
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:12,041
What I'm saying is that
it actually doesn't exist.

312
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,541
And, of course, matter
that doesn't exist

313
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,708
operates under laws
that don't exist.

314
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,625
For example, turning
light from the sun

315
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,458
into rays that are strong
enough to kill a man.

316
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,125
All right. I'm ready.

317
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,333
[gasps]

318
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,541
Hey, Accelerator!

319
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,000
You claim to have the ability
to reflect anything,

320
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,375
but that's not quite
accurate, is it?

321
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,416
You unconsciously filter
out what's harmful

322
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,375
and what's beneficial.

323
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,000
And then choose to reflect only
that which you don't need.

324
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,000
My ability affected the
sun and wind just now.

325
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,583
I injected them with
25,000 vectors each.

326
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,416
And depending on how
those were reflected,

327
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,750
I just have to attack you
by using vector fronts

328
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,791
from among those you've
unconsciously accepted.

329
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,875
[KAKINE]
This is Dark Matter.

330
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,250
A space with foreign
matter in the mix,

331
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,625
and a place you
know nothing about!

332
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,958
[yells]

333
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,791
[KAKINE]
I'm going to gain the right

334
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,500
to deal directly with Aleister!

335
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,125
And that's what the
tweezers were for.

336
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,458
But it looks like killing
you will be a lot quicker,

337
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,166
Mr. Top-Rank.

338
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,375
Oh, please.

339
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
At this point, is the
order of our ranking

340
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,125
really that important?

341
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,875
Aleister's a fan of fail-safes

342
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,333
and always moves multiple
plans forward concurrently.

343
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,750
But he also comes prepared
with an alternative option

344
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,125
for each of them.

345
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,333
And I am the alternative
option for you!

346
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,500
[ACCELERATOR] Oh, so you
think getting rid of me

347
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,500
automatically shoots you to
the top of the totem pole?

348
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,583
[KAKINE]
That's right.

349
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,875
If I'm at the center of it all,

350
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,875
Aleister can't
ignore me anymore.

351
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,375
Tch. Are you kidding me?

352
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,166
I have no idea what
happened to you in life

353
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,250
that finally broke you down,

354
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,083
but when you use
it as your cause

355
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,958
and say that that's what
makes it okay for you

356
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,875
to go about killing civilians,

357
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,875
you've cheapened
yourself as a villain.

358
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,708
Oh, I'm sorry, how many
civilians did you smash up

359
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,500
while battling me
at the café earlier?

360
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
[chuckles]

361
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,833
I knew you'd make
that comparison

362
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,875
because you have
absolutely no aesthetic.

363
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
And by the way, do you
have any idea at all

364
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,666
why you and I are
currently divided

365
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,333
into first and second ranks?

366
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,291
It's because there's a
complete wall between us

367
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,541
that you'll never get past!

368
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,541
[gasps]

369
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,541
What? No way.

370
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,750
So you were defending all those
people while we were fighting?

371
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,583
Yeah, well, screw you!

372
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,291
How much control do
you actually have?

373
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,583
Aw, did that make
you a little angry?

374
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,166
That's what real villains do!

375
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,000
[growls] This is my
world, Accelerator!

376
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,375
No, it is not!

377
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm redefining this world
as being made up

378
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
of elementary particles,

379
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,583
and that includes
your Dark Matter.

380
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,458
And once I crack your
formula, that's checkmate.

381
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,916
You think you've got me figured
out to the core, don't you?

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,041
[ACCELERATOR] Your core's
not that deep, trust me.

383
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,958
There's not very
much to figure out.

384
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,958
[ACCELERATOR]
See ya later, Third-string.

385
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,541
[laughs]

386
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,166
At least it's not as pathetic as
being beaten by the good guys.

387
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,875
[YOMIKAWA]
Stop! Don't shoot!

388
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,208
Just calm down and
hand me the gun.

389
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,416
What in the world could you
possibly need one of those for?

390
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm a villain. I need weapons.

391
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,041
Then I'm gonna have to stop you.

392
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,791
Do you really mean that?

393
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
You're not giving me
any other choice,

394
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,500
so I need you to hear me.

395
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,125
I am never going
to give up on you.

396
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,000
I will drag you out of
the dark if I have to.

397
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,125
That's why I'm here
standing in your way.

398
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,375
I do it for the children
I have to protect,

399
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,916
and for the peace
I love so much.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,750
I see a place where you are.

401
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,666
You're there with Last Order.

402
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,375
We're all living together,
laughing and having fun.

403
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,250
Isn't the gun you're
holding in your hand

404
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,125
detrimental to the
manifestation of that future?

405
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,958
I know you're not a complete
villain at heart, Accelerator.

406
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,250
[thud]

407
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,083
I guess we're the same.

408
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,166
Neither one of us has the
ability to protect anyone.

409
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,458
Isn't that right?

410
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,916
Plus.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,083
You've sent plenty of people
to their deaths already--

412
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,250
just like your friend here!

413
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,416
[gasps]

414
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:55,833
[screams]

415
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,541
[KAKINE laughing]

416
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,416
Damn. Impressive evil.

417
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,291
I always knew you had it in you.

418
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,833
I'm speechless.

419
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:19,166
Seeing this, I get why Dark
Matter was the alternative plan.

420
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,541
I'm trying really hard not to
get too excited about this.

421
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,166
I mean, do we have to
fight to the finish now?

422
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,500
[laughing]

423
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,833
[yelling]

424
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,416
[KAKINE]
What the hell?

425
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,541
[gasping]

426
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,458
So that's what you
were used for?

427
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,833
Is this your true
form or some--?

428
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,666
Lower your weapons, men!

429
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,833
The only way to
stop him is by...

430
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,416
[LAST ORDER]
"I found him."

431
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,583
[LAST ORDER] "That's my lost
child," says Misaka Misaka,

432
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,625
insisting on speaking with you.

433
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,541
[yells]

434
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:29,291
[growling]

435
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,875
"It's gonna be all right,"
says Misaka Misaka

436
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,166
as she stretches out her hand.

437
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,416
Accelerator. Was that you?

438
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,625
[MALE ANTISKILL 06A gasps]

439
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,000
[MALE ANTISKILL 06A]
Fire!

440
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,625
[screams]

441
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,166
Stop now!

442
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,791
"There, there. You don't have
to do this anymore. 'Kay?"

443
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,291
says Misaka Misaka,
stating what's right.

444
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,958
[growls]

445
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,250
[screams]

446
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,083
[LAST ORDER]
"It's okay. It's done.

447
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,125
And thank goodness,"
says Misaka Misaka.

448
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,916
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Apparently,
the SCHOOL organization

449
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,833
needed the tweezers.

450
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,958
They used it to recover a
very important nanodevice.

451
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,041
[ACCELERATOR]
What does that even mean?

452
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,916
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Well, it means
that a roughly 50-million-unit

453
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,916
surveillance nanodevice
was dispersed by Aleister

454
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,208
throughout the air
of Academy City.

455
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,541
"The Underline."
That's what it's called.

456
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,458
It's a nexus that makes up
an intelligence network.

457
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,708
Which directly connects
Aleister to anything

458
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,416
regarding Academy City.

459
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,333
So, you can probably guess
the level of information

460
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,458
that each unit holds.

461
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,541
Here it is.

462
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,666
Codes to the city's dark side.

463
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,875
There's GROUP, and SCHOOL,
then ITEM, MEMBER, and BLOCK.

464
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,666
[MUSUJIME]
We know all those organizations.

465
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,708
Yeah, seems a little
after-the-fact.

466
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,666
No, wait, there's
more than just that.

467
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,083
[MUSUJIME, UNABARA]
Hm?

468
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:36,333
The last one to come
up is called: DRAGON.

469
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,583
[ACCELERATOR] I swear I'm
gonna get the better of them.

470
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,541
On everything.

471
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,833
[KAMIJO] An underground complex
extends beneath Academy City.

472
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:04,416
A momentary peace is torn
apart when he appears.

473
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,541
Next time, "The Third Level."

474
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,500
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
