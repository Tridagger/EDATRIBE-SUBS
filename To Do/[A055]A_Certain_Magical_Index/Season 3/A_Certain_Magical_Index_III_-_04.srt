that bastard Kihara
was fine and all,

00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,791
but somehow,
I've ended up involved

00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,708
with an organization
called GROUP.

Most customers these days

13
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't get many like you
who drop by in person!

what sort of jobs was

Unabara did this.

He has a special
technique that allows him

Yeah.

A little distraction
to break up the event

141
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,375
and now there's no more
sneaky sniper to worry about.

myself, Sunazara.

00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,041
I think I found the name of
the group who hired Sunazara.

"SCHOOL."

152
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,666
I get the sense that they're
smaller scale and informal--

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,250

There's more to it though.

they play in this case, but...

several names of similar

that thing that SCHOOL bunch

192

So then... How did they even
manage to go through with it?

I mean, didn't we just get rid
of that sniper three days ago?

195

Well, they probably
hired a new one.

196
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,666
And I guess that means they also
decided ignoring our warning

What do you think
will happen after a VIP

228
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,541

to cover the
treatment facilities.

231
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,125
They'll round up all the
specialized researchers.

Then materials, machinery,
and anything else they need.

234
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,208
That could throw security
arrangements off completely.

[MUGINO] That's exactly
what SCHOOL was counting on.

236

They want to use this
chaos to their advantage.

237
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,750
That's why they targeted
a low-security VIP.

There's our answer.

Laboratory is the only place

over today's incident.

350
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,750
You're right, I'd say
odds are pretty good

351
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,791
they're trying to lure us there.

352
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,083
I don't know who these guys are,

353
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,791
but it seems like they're
begging for a fight

354
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,791
they won't win.

355
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,583
[DRIVER 04B] What should
we do about Monaka Oyafune's

356
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,125
attempted assassination?

357
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
We'll come back to that later.

358
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,291
[DRIVER 04B] All right,
what about Mr. Unabara?

359
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
I was never really
planning to rescue him.

360
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,750
[phone ringing]

361
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,833
[YAMATE (UNABARA)]
It's Unabara.

362
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,458
Who are you out goofing
around with now? SCHOOL?

363
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,500
Well, no. It's BLOCK.

364
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm sure you've figured it out,
but BLOCK's hacking satellites.

365
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,666
It's not SCHOOL.

366
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,291
However, it's a diversion.

367
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,583
What they're really after
is the aerospace engineering

368
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:42,041
research institute's auxiliary
satellite control center.

369
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,791
I'll let you deal with that.

370
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,041
Talk to you later.

371
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,666
They want the
satellite control center.

372
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,666
Makes sense.

373
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,375
I can see why.

374
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,875
The Hikoboshi II satellite
is fully equipped

375
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,500
with a high-caliber
surface-attack laser.

376
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
But that doesn't mean
we disregard the virus leak

377
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,791
at the storage center.

378
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,833
[pounding noise]

379
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,541
You guys have fun
with those jerks.

380
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,750
Playing decoy games
isn't my thing.

381
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,291
[laughing]

382
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,291
[CITIZEN 04A yells]

383
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,583
Uh... Who are you?

384
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,041
Take me to the
satellite control center.

385
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,291
[CITIZEN 04A]
Yes, sir.

386
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,666
[KAMIJO] Those struggling
to escape control.

387
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,541
Those who voluntarily
leap into the framework.

388
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,750
Their motives cross,
provoking a new battle.

389
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,541
Next time, "Dark Matter."

390
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,000
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
