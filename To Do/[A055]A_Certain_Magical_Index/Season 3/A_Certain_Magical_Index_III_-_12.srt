1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,166
Alert every knight hidden
throughout the land!

2
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,750
Be ready to move quickly!

3
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,500
Let the invasion commence!

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,666
Curtana Original
is now in our hands!

5
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,083
Those who do not wish to
see their country befouled

6
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,791
are invited to rise up
with me, Carissa,

7
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,708
as I am now your
new head of state!

8
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,083
This is the start
of a new United Kingdom.

9
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,875
We will improve whatever
we see as necessary.

10
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,125
And whatever we don't need
will be destroyed!

11
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,125
[SISTER 10B] The knights are
even coming after those of us

12
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,875
in Necessarius.

13
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,208
I need to rendezvous with the
sisters in the other fortress

14
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,375
so we can regroup.

15
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,833
[SISTER 10B]
Oh, no!

16
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,000
[OPERATOR 12A]
Attention!

17
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,250
Three through twenty and
thirty through thirty-five,

18
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,791
ready to fire!

19
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,416
Designated witches will
please accelerate in sequence

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,375
and attend to
intercepting the knights.

21
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,666
What do you think
about this, Smartvery?

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,458
There's no way to be
certain that our attacks

23
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,291
will have any effect against
those knight monsters.

24
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,083
Guess our only choice
is to tough it out

25
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,625
until Coven Compass
crosses the border.

26
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,833
Great. So we're decoys, then?

27
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,916
Knights do love to
chase after witch tail

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,625
no matter what year it is.

29
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,000
Right, here we go!

30
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,750
[KNIGHT 12A] We have
instructions to avoid

31
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,583
lethal force
whenever possible,

32
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,000
but with this many
of us in one fight,

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,791
I'm afraid there will
be no guarantees.

34
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,666
So you're suggesting
we surrender to spare us

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,791
from danger.

36
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,625
How generous of you, sir.

37
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,083
[KNIGHT 12A] You don't
care if your people die?

38
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,166
[KNIGHTS yell]

39
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,416
[KNIGHT 12A]
What?!

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,708
Spread out and begin
searching the area!

41
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,625
They couldn't have
gotten too far away.

42
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,833
[KNIGHTS]
Sir!

43
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, well, that worked out
even better than expected.

44
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,083
Yes, but what do we do now?

45
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,125
[AGNESE]
Hmm...

46
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,250
[LAURA] My goodness, I had
intended to call in the List

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,750
of Prohibited Books
and have her determine

48
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,000
whether the First, Second,
and Third Princesses

49
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,000
posed a threat before
something as drastic

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,708
as this happened.

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,791
It's likely the militaristic
second princess's work.

52
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,750
Given the number
of knights involved.

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,083
Hmm. Very impressive, her
locating the Original like that.

54
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,125
As a result, Curtana Second
here is all but useless.

55
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,583
I might have a parent's bias,

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,416
but so far the invasion's
going splendidly.

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes, it's been wonderful.

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,083
Perhaps her fool mother
should just stick her head

59
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,500
in the noose right now.

60
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,500
[KNIGHT 12C] Offer no
resistance, and you needn't come

61
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,416
to any undue harm.

62
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,833
Please choose wisely.

63
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,791
This must be quite
rough for you.

64
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,666
That is not the way
Carissa operates.

65
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,083
Her orders would've been
more along these lines:

66
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,166
"If she doesn't obey you,
kill her without hesitation.

67
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Once you decide to kill her,
show no mercy."

68
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,708
[KNIGHT 12C gasps]

69
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,541
Well, then, shall we?

70
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,708
[INDEX] From what I can sense,
a Roman Orthodox spell

71
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,666
based on the lore of
the House of Loreto

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,958
was used as a destruction glyph.

73
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,250
[CARISSA]
Hmm.

74
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,083
[INDEX] The original House
of Loreto is famous

75
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,416
for having been visited
by King Louis IX of France.

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,791
And he was known for
his magical item theory.

77
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,375
It's possible someone updated
it and used it to cause

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,041
the blast in this tunnel.

79
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,875
[CARISSA]
Well, that is excellent news,

80
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,416
and not just for me,
but for you, as well.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,916
Your analysis of the spell
and its connection to France

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,250
is definitive proof that they
were involved in the blast.

83
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,875
If you had denied
their complicity,

84
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,541
things would have gotten ugly.

85
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,500
I wouldn't have had any
choice but to kill you

86
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,875
right here, right now.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,875
Issue the ultimatum
to France immediately.

88
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,625
Then mobilize the military.

89
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,708
Get the destroyers to Dover.

90
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,291
I want them ready to fire
on Versailles at any moment,

91
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,916
pending France's response.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,041
Should we consider Academy City?

93
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Ignore them.
This is our military might.

94
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,458
And we alone must
hold the reins to it.

95
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,291
To hell with this damn war.

96
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,750
The Puritans, Academy City,

97
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,041
the Orthodoxy, and
the Russian Church.

98
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,416
We can't win.

99
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Whether magic or science
is victorious in this fight,

100
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,375
Britain will go down
for having gotten mixed up

101
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,750
with both sides of the battle.

102
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
If we're going to avoid that,

103
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,583
we can't wage a war
of just two powers.

104
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,291
Instead, we must make
it a three-sided war

105
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,708
for British independence.

106
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,875
Mother's way isn't
aggressive enough.

107
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
For the sake of
our nation's future,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,666
we need to win
this war on our own,

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,416
without help from anyone.

110
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,541
Their interference
will only weaken us.

111
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,125
Well, then, that just
leaves my mother.

112
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,416
And my sisters, too, of course.

113
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,583
To secure my claim to the
usage of Curtana Original,

114
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,291
we'll have to kill them at once.

115
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,333
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Right.

116
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,875
Damn, those knights
are everywhere.

117
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
[LESSAR grunts]

118
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,041
We need to go and meet up
with Necessarius quickly.

119
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,250
She's fading fast.

120
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,666
--[blast]
--[BOTH gasp]

121
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,333
Are you kidding?!

[KNIGHTS yelling]

123
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,208
Wait, Golem Ellis?

124
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,541
Sherry's making a move?

125
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,416
[SHERRY laughing]

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,291
[ORIANA] She looks like
she's completely unhinged.

127
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,500
I forgot.

128
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,666
Of course.

129
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,416
A friend of hers was
killed by a knight.

130
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,375
Looks like we
have a distraction.

131
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,291
Use it to get her to
Necessarius's dorms.

132
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,625
I'm going to knock out those
knights while they're busy

133
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,541
fighting the golem and
then wait for the chance

134
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,916
to bring the sorceress
back to her senses.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
You really think you can
handle that by yourself?

136
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,000
You mean, "Good luck
out there. I trust you"?

137
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,458
If you don't trust me,
then you can always

138
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,833
abandon the girl
and stay here to help.

139
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,291
Once you deliver her,
head to Waterloo station

140
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,791
and find a way to sneak
aboard the Eurostar train.

141
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,708
The knights will be using it to
move people and goods around.

142
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,208
Why would I do that?

143
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,958
The train will take
you to Folkstone,

144
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,125
where you'll find
what you're looking for.

145
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,750
Namely, Carissa and the
List of Prohibited Books.

146
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,000
Good luck. I trust you.

147
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,458
There, that's better.

148
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,000
Go, I've got things here.

149
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,625
[CARISSA] I was wondering
how she sensed the danger

150
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,666
she was in.

151
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,875
I see.

152
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,750
The servants are to
blame for her escape.

153
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,000
The virtuous third daughter
lives up to her reputation.

154
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,208
[KNIGHT LEADER] Princess
Vilian's carriage appears

155
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,625
to have headed toward
Canterbury by way of Dover.

156
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,000
That's where the English
Puritans' main cathedral

157
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,333
is ostensibly located.

158
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,958
For being the
slow-witted sister,

159
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,208
she made an impressively
quick getaway.

160
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,333
Let's go.

161
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,708
We don't have any time
to waste at this point.

162
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,666
We'll kill Vilian
with all haste,

163
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,208
then go after my older sister.

164
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,250
An aircraft.

165
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,291
Really?

166
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,458
[CARISSA]
Is it hostile?

167
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,708
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Likely so.

168
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,500
We haven't received word
of any reinforcements.

169
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,666
I'll bring it down.

170
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,500
Too late. It's here.

171
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
This mess you created
is going to take

172
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,416
a very long time to untangle.

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,583
But defeating the ringleader
should speed things up.

174
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,666
I don't have time for this.

175
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,708
Please, allow me
to take care of her.

176
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,250
Is that why you were so
determined to get me here?

177
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,833
Because you knew it was
going to end up like this.

178
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,583
My desire to see you behave
in a more ladylike fashion

179
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,875
was unfeigned.

180
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,375
Though, it seems it's
too late for that now.

I don't understand why
you're so surprised.

184
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,500
This kingdom was first
forged around Curtana

185
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,750
and our four cultures,
and that itself binds us

186
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,291
under unique
church-of-the-cross rules.

187
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,458
You see, within our realm,
the king is the archangel.

188
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,375
Which means the
knights are angels.

As long as we're in this land,

192
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,458
my power is on an
entirely different level.

193
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,791
[VILIAN] I'll head to
Canterbury Cathedral.

If there are any puritans
remaining when I get there,

195
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,333
I must ask if they'll
rescue the servants

might as well come out.

There isn't a single
soul left on your side.

Not a single one.

214
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,125

bother us anymore.

I won't use a sword, though.
An axe.

even listening.

It seems that no matter who
you are or who you're with,

ahead that should work.

no more than a meter deep,

I can see them hurting
more with each blow.

00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,750
Can you no longer take up
your sword and do battle

353
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,375
without making excuses
for your actions,

354
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,875
both to yourself and
to everyone else?

355
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,333
[KNIGHT LEADER yells]

356
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,541
[ACQUA yells]

357
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,541
It's such a pity.

358
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,833
If this is the great
battle of our lives,

359
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,291
then I would have
preferred to fight you

360
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,708
when you were at your best.

361
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,541
[ACQUA grunts]

362
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,875
[ACQUA]
That was not Hrunting.

363
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,375
Changing your attack pattern?

364
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,833
I'm just impressed you
realized it so quickly.

365
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,458
And here I was hoping
we'd be able to settle things

366
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,750
between us without
me having to use this.

367
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,791
That's not like you.

368
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,208
I wouldn't think
you'd hold back

369
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,333
against the sign
of the evil dragon.

370
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,916
Let's go.

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm ready.

372
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,416
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Movement Speed!

373
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,083
[KNIGHT LEADER]
And Weapon Weight!

374
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,666
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Slicing Power!

375
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,500
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Attack Range!

376
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,250
That's all you have.

377
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,750
You have no chance of overcoming
my blade in your condition.

378
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,708
I'll give you a choice.

379
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,500
Lay down your sword
and leave the country now.

380
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,041
Or stay and become one with
the United Kingdom's soil.

381
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,625
Which would you prefer?

382
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,041
Before I choose,

383
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,958
I have a question for you.

384
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,708
If you support the
Second Princess

385
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,041
and her bloody coup d'état,
and kill the third princess,

386
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,791
do you truly believe it will
salvage this nation's future?

387
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,708
It isn't the ideal course.

388
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,916
However, history is
already in motion.

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,083
As such, I had no choice
but to take a side.

390
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,625
So I have chosen,
and I believe this path

391
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,500
will bring the most
benefit to my country.

392
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,541
I see.

393
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,250
Will you flee, or will you die?

394
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,333
Neither.

395
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,375
The real question is,
will I kill you,

396
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,458
or will I let you live?

397
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,833
Very well.

398
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,500
It appears I have
my answer, then.

399
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,041
So be it.

400
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,458
Prepare to die!

401
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,000
[LAURA]
How about that?

402
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,125
I managed to get us
out of our restraints.

403
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,791
Are you insane?

404
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,875
That wasn't "getting us
out of our restraints"--

405
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,083
it was just an explosion.

406
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,166
As long as the
outcome's the same,

407
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,416
who really cares
about the process?

408
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,083
Whatever you call it,
the carriage is a wreck now.

409
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,916
What are we supposed
to do about transportation?

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,833
[LAURA]
Uh... Never fear!

411
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,833
I have a terrific
idea about that.

412
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,875
[ELIZARD]
Huh?

413
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,833
No! Please tell me
you're not doing

414
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,416
what I think you're doing.

415
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,291
Yes!

416
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,000
It's the hitchhiking gambit!

417
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,375
Hey, driver of that
wretched-looking lorry there.

418
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,833
How would you fancy a
drive with this beautiful lady

419
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,291
and her companion?

420
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,000
That was rude.

421
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,166
Moron.

422
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,166
The driver clearly
made the right decision.

423
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,500
[horse whinnies]

424
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,875
All right!
London, here we come.

425
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,208
What are you waiting for?

426
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,416
What?

427
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,583
You really think I know
how to do something

428
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,041
as brutish and uncouth
as riding a horse?

429
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,958
[ELIZARD]
Off we go! Ha!

430
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,583
[LAURA] Wait, you can't
just leave me here!

431
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,250
Come back! I'm serious!

432
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,000
What do you expect
me to do? Hitchhike?

433
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,625
[KAMIJO]
The sword rips apart dimensions,

434
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,208
and engulfs Britain
in a sea of flames.

435
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,833
Will the sorcerers
be able to withstand

436
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,333
such overwhelming power?

437
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,541
Next time, "Curtana Original."

438
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,333
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
