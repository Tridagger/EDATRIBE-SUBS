[TÉCPATL] Since you're part of
this dark outfit called GROUP,

00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,125
the usual intelligence
networks weren't able

00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,916
to pin down your location.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,333
We ended up using Shiokishi
here at the core

00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,333
of Academy City instead.

6
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,500
Here's the plan.

00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,166
We're going to end your life.

Yes. It's the original

[SOLDIERS gasp]

12
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,250
[TÉCPATL] Normally, that kind of
blast would have directly struck

14
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,083
Apparently, the rabbit
bones used to fuel it

15
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,291
were of poor quality.

16
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,166
What the hell did you just do?

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,208
And what have you
done to Tochtli?

18
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,000
Rabbit bones, remember?

19
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,375
Perhaps it might make more
sense if I drew you a picture.

it's entertaining.

37
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,833
[SUGITANI] I happen to know
that Amata Kihara was able

38
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,833
to break through
your Reflection Barrier

00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,000
I see.

45
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,250
I'd love to take a page from
their exceptional methods

46
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
and duplicate them,
but I cannot.

47
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,041
We call that a third-stringer.

48
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,208
Even though you've got
modest skills of your own,

49
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,875
all you know how to do is
follow that old man's orders.

50
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,625
A dude like you
claims to be the heir

51
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,250
of those who fought
in the name of justice.

52
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,416
You saying that bastard
Shiokishi seems like

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,541
a good guy to you?

54
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,791
And now, for some reason,

55
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,000
you think you're in the
right for following him?

56
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,041
Are you trying to make me laugh?

57
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,208
It's true, the word "good"
always ends up

58
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,208
being exploited by those
in power somehow.

59
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
Although, if your default is
to relegate everything to evil,

60
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,083
is that really going
to solve every last one

61
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,333
of the world's problems?
From my perspective,

62
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,208
the only thing
your brand of evil does

63
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,583
is scavenge the scraps that drop
down from the table of good.

64
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,083
You scumbag, the moment
you call any good deed

65
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,708
"table scraps" makes it
obvious nothing good you do

66
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,958
is genuine.

67
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,750
You're telling me
I'm not genuine?

68
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,666
As if you know someone
good who is?

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,250
Damn right I do.

70
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,708
So good that it pisses me off
how you caused me to remember.

[SUGITANI]
I see.

And it is quite unfortunate that
you will never see them again.

Because you're about
to die right here.

75
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,916
By the way, your electrode
has been modified

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,833
so that it can easily be
controlled remotely when needed.

77
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,541
Once you are isolated
from the Misaka Network,

78

your fighting strength
drops to zero.

This is the "good"
I've been talking about.

00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm amazed by the
amount of struggle a man

81
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,416
must endure just to be good
in a world full of miscreants.

00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,041
What happened?

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,125
[KINUHATA] Let's see, you were
ultra-familiar with fighting

85
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,416
against espers,
and you had the ability

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,583
to determine our weaknesses.

87
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,291
On the other hand,
you didn't seem to understand

88
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,208
that I am also a person
who has had to fight

89
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,250

90
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,625
Oh, I almost forgot.

91
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,458
I am virtually unbeatable
in close-quarters combat.

92
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,500
So the most dangerous
thing I could ultra-face

93
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,708
is taking an ultra-precise
attack from someplace

94

out of my reach.

choose to fire at random,

deadlier shot than you are.

You see, it really does require
some experience, Etzali.

If you're going to use
this as a weapon,

106
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
then you need to take
the necessary steps

107

to prevent the
backflow of knowledge.

108

Allow me to enlighten you.

come face to face

with the original
text's knowledge.

120
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,291

that it would ever let you

get away with that?

122

I'll explain.

Just a simple electronic jammer.

It has the ability to affect
the Misaka Network.

I analyzed the EM
waves from before

and then calculated
their inverse.

evil's supposed to work.

I also could not name
a single difference

between you and me.

133
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,750
The last word anyone would
ever use to describe me

134
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,916
is "good."

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,416
You and I use the same methods,

136
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,750
and that makes you
a prize-winning villain.

137
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,250
[KINUHATA] I think you
kinda overdid it, there.

I can see how you ultra-got
the gun on your own,

I don't know what
you're talking about.

If I could get an
attack helicopter,

142
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,041
the obvious move would've
been to attack you

from well beyond your range.
Think about it.

144

True.

Ultra-what is it you
think you're doing?

158
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,666
[HEART MEASURE] Were you
aware that Aleister is devising

159
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,375
and carrying out a very
important plan of some sort?

160
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,916
That's right. As it happens,
Toma Kamijo and Accelerator

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,333
are two of the irregular
factors that fall within

the tolerance levels
of this plan.

163
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,000
That's why they can be
situated at the center

164
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,000
and be used as much as
needed to make it succeed.

165
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,083
On the other hand, it's not the
same for your friend Hamazura.

He appears to be a bit
of a hindrance.

He was supposed
to have been killed

Shiage Hamazura is a
Level Zero without any power.

170
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,750
He has no definite role to play,

171
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,166
so he's trying to achieve
something all on his own--

172
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,291
perhaps he seeks
a new kind of value.

Not even Aleister
knows what to expect.

But depending on
what it turns out to be,

it may or may not have
the potential to damage

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
Aleister's plan.

177
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,500
Therefore, Academy City
is marshalling

178
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,000
all of its forces
to kill Hamazura

179
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,708
before he causes
any destruction.

180
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
What do you think?
Is he worth the trouble?

181
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,208
[SHIOKISHI]
DRAGON? [grunts]

182
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,291
I'm sure you all have
your own suppositions.

183
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,416
Oh, come on, you're not
gonna try and tell us

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
you know nothing
about it, are you?

185
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,125
Believe me, it would be
easier to say I didn't.

186
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,833
But unfortunately, I did
learn a few things.

187
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,750
It's something nobody
should ever be forced

188
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
to lay their eyes upon.

189
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,416
We get that.
Just tell us what it is.

190
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,666
Where is DRAGON,
and what is it exactly?

191
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
You don't get it, do you?

192
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,625
DRAGON can be found everywhere.

193
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,958
Look.

194
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,500
Turn around and you'll see
DRAGON behind you now.

195
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,833
What? Hey!

196
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,000
[thud]

197
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,833
[VOICE]
DRAGON?

198
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,458
The name isn't exactly wrong,

199
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,916
but to be the most accurate,
"Angel" would also apply.

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,916
However, if you want
to be more precise

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,291
when addressing me directly,
it would be prudent

202
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,083
to use the following
name instead.

203
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,833
The name that
belongs to the being

204
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,958
who once gave an eccentric
sorcerer, Aleister Crowley,

205
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,916
the necessary knowledge
in the necessary amount.

206
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,666
"Aiwass."

207
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,250
[HAMAZURA, TAKITSUBO panting]

208
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,166
Hold on!

209
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,166
Run.

210
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,791
Hamazura, please.

211
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,416
It's the only way now.

212
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,916
[HAMAZURA]
Huh?

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,166
[TAKITSUBO] If we continue
like this, we'll both be caught,

214
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,875
so just go.

215
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,291
[TAKITSUBO]
Hamazura.

216
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,375
[HAMAZURA]
Be quiet.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,125
Someone's coming.

218
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,666
I hear something.

219
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,750
[gasps]

220
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,125
Everything will be fine.
Please go.

221
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,375
At least this way I can
buy you some time.

222
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,875
You can't be serious!

223
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,333
[rumbling]

224
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,083
[HAMAZURA]
Please, somebody please find us.

225
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,541
Some kind of hero.

226
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,833
Just show up out of
nowhere and save her life.

227
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,916
Please!

228
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,541
Hey, looks like we made it!

229
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,875
I have no idea who
stepped in to help us,

230
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,541
but we survived this!

231
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,916
[laughing]

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,375
[MUGINO]
Hamazura.

233
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,041
[footsteps]

234
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,250
It can't be...

235
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,458
[MUGINO] Don't you dare let
these two-bit bastards

236
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,250
come in here and take your life.

237
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,458
That would be so unfair,
don't you think?

238
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,375
Besides, I've already decided
that I deserve the honor

239
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,250
of tearing you limb from limb!

240
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,791
[AIWASS]
Why do you look so mystified?

241
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,541
I don't believe my
sudden appearance

242
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,666
could really be that
incomprehensible to you.

243
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,958
It would help if you
tell me what you are

244
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,666
and why the hell you
would wrap yourself up

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,708
in a codename like "DRAGON." 

246
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
[AIWASS] This is where I'm
going to have to attempt

247
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,583
an explanation, isn't it?

248
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,250
My identity is not
that big of a deal.

249
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm an insignificant being
and nothing more.

250
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Huh?

251
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,958
[AIWASS]
Oh, dear.

252
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,500
It appears I'm not able to
express that great a degree

253
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,458
of meaning in this world.

254
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,416
Are you perhaps
familiar with the phrase

255
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,166
"Fuse= KAZAKIRI?" 

256
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,166
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,833
[AIWASS sighs]

258
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,708
Well, it is a being that is
known as an artificial angel.

259
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,625
A mass of AIM dispersion fields.

260
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,916
It is also something
of a production line

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,791
used to give me
this form as Aiwass.

262
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,041
Just appearing for the
fun of it is fine and all,

263
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,083
but now what do I do?

264
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,166
What would you like to do?

265
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,833
Would you like to upset
Aleister's aspirations

266
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,083
based on the information
only I can give you?

267
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,666
Why do I feel like you're
just jerking my chain?

268
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
[AIWASS]
I don't know.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,625
I will not be the
one who is upset

270
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,916
if Aleister's plan is derailed.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,875
Whether it takes
ten thousand years,

272
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,541
or even one hundred thousand.

273
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,875
I'll just wait for another
opportunity to manifest.

274
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,666
Pardon me, "emerge." 

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, and just so you know.

276
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,958
The plan that Aleister
is undertaking?

277
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,333
It's already starting
to come apart.

278
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
Meaning...?

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,125
[AIWASS] Meaning the fractures
are slowly starting to widen.

280
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,291
And if it keeps up,
the keystone of his plan,

281
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,416
Last Order, is certain to
disintegrate sooner or later.

282
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,916
[ACCELERATOR]
How dare you!

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,541
I don't care if you are a
mass of AIM dispersion fields

284
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,000
or some kind of dragon-angel
or whatever.

285
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,416
If you maliciously intend
to do harm to that kid,

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
I promise I will
show you no mercy!

287
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,250
[coughing, grunting]

288
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,541
[AIWASS]
Oh, no.

289
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,791
That was my mistake, I'm afraid.

290
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Aleister, you messed with that
structural virus, didn't you?

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
What a pity.

292
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,458
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

293
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,166
If you want to kill me,

294
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,541
you will first have to deal
with these glowing wings

295
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,458
before you have
a hope of success.

296
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,375
[ACCELERATOR] I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

297
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,791
[AIWASS] Let's see,
"Do what thou wilt,

298
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,875
shall be the whole
of the Law."

299
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,250
Is that right?

300
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,666
[ACCELERATOR yells]

301
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,750
[AIWASS]
Is that all you have left?

302
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,333
I tried to draw you out
by explicitly mentioning

303
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,125
Last Order, but alas.

304
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,083
[ACCELERATOR]
I get it now.

305
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,625
What was it you said?

306
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,708
You appear by using
AIM diffusion fields,

307
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,875
isn't that right?

308
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,083
And the only way you
were able to control them

309
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,416
is by having that kid become
infected with the virus

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,750
so you could create
that Fuse=KAZAKIRI crap.

311
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,666
I'm right, aren't I?

312
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,250
Then if that's the case...

313
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,250
[AIWASS]
Now you're using your head.

314
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,041
Looks like you've also
reset it to work on

315
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,500
the entire Misaka Network.

316
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,291
But do you realize
that in doing so,

317
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,666
you've also managed to
personally cut the lifeline

318
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,750
responsible for
keeping yourself alive.

319
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,166
Hey! I'm done with you!

320
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,541
[AIWASS]
I see.

321
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,916
Then why don't you
go ahead and show me...

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,041

but are you sure you should?

Ooh! What part should
I burn first?

Aw. I'd love to see
this precious face sizzle.

[MUGINO] Why are you trying
to play the tragic heroine?

I thought you were supposed to
be a simple, helpless princess.

What's wrong?

Now all of a sudden you don't
have the strength to fight?

If you're too afraid to
take the ability crystal,

340
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
you can run.

341
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,333

will be charred to death

350
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,750
What was that supposed
to be, Hamazura?

351
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,250
I'm so confused--who was it
that you were trying to protect?

352
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,375
Hey, if you prefer to finish
her off yourself, be my guest!

353
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
[HAMAZURA]
This is getting old.

354
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,208
But it looks like killing
you only once wasn't enough

355
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,916
to get you out of my life.

356
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,500
No! Of course it wasn't
enough, you idiot!

357
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,625
Once is never
enough for anything!

358
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:12,958
Come back!

359
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,916
Are you mocking me now?

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Smoke screen?
Think you're a ninja? [grunts]

361
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,125
[MUGINO gasps]

362
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,333
Wow. I did it.

363
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,458
I got her!

364
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,416
[laughs]

365
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,875
[MUGINO]
Hamazura.

366
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,333
[MUGINO] How could you
ever think some common

367
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,000
mass-produced weapons would
be anywhere near enough

368
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,041
to take down the
fourth-ranked Meltdowner?

369
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,500
Come on, Hamazura.

370
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,875
[HAMAZURA yells]

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,166
[HAMAZURA grunts]

372
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,833
[HAMAZURA] This looks like
an endurance testing room

373
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,125
for air racing.

374
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,375
Honestly, this is
getting ridiculous.

375
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,375
Neither Teitoku Kakine nor
I have been allowed to die.

376
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,541
It seems like the chairman
of the governing board

377
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,500
just wants to use us for
our Level Five abilities.

378
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,541
He wants it so badly,
he did all this to our bodies.

379
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
Tell me the truth, Hamazura.

380
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,791
How was it possible for me
to become this hideous

381
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,083
of a monster?

382
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,541
[HAMAZURA]
Mugino.

383
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
That's what you want
me to say, isn't it?

384
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,166
Tell me the truth!

385
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,291
[MUGINO laughs]

386
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,333
Why are you shaking
like a little leaf?

387
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,833
I know, while you're at it,

388
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,750
why don't you give me
one of those strange,

389
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,375
hilarious screams?

390
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,125
I'm going to coat you in
melted iron and let it cool,

391
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,375
and then turn you into a weird,
yet fascinating work of art!

392
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,416
[MUGINO]
Huh?

393
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,166
[ANNOUNCEMENT 17A]
This is a warning.

394
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,458
Experiment commencing.

395
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,708
What did you do, Hamazura?

396
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,333
Does that mean it's over?

397
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,291
[AIWASS] That Aleister is
such a worrywart.

398
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,125
He was taking more
precautions than usual.

399
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,500
He put up several robust
barriers against me

400
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,041
that I didn't know about.

401
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,041
So? Damn you.

402
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,458
[AIWASS] I hate to do this to
you after you've already put

403
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,791
so much effort into your fight.

404
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,666
But as it turns out...

405
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,041
I have the ability
to change form.

406
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,208
Hamazura! You're alive!

407
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,041
[crying]

408
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,666
[phone buzzes]

409
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,708
[KINUHATA]
Hamazura, listen to me.

410
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,500
Get ultra-away from there
right this instant!

411
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,916
[HAMAZURA]
Kinuhata?

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,666
[KINUHATA] There's a detached
force from Academy City

413
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,000
on its way.

414
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,458
Take Takitsubo and ultra-run
as fast as you can!

415
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,750
Okay, but where are
we supposed to run to?

416
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,333
[AIWASS]
Aleister, Tell the truth.

417
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,083
You wouldn't happen to
admire them, would you?

418
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,916
Those who follow the feelings
that spring up within them

419
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,666
without being
encouraged by anyone?

420
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,791
Those who keep moving forward?

421
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,791
Those who have committed
great mistakes in the past,

422
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,750
and even while struggling
with these sins,

423
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,583
continue to move
with good intentions?

424
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,750
Do you envy those who,
without being chosen,

425
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:40,458
and without being qualified,
can miraculously become a hero?

426
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,583
If only for the sake
of someone they love.

427
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,000
Each of these are people
who may get beaten down

428
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,041
quite often, but they
always search for a way

429
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,500
to get back up on their feet.

430
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,166
They seem to be well-equipped
with something you do not have.

431
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,291
It appears that in
your time of struggle,

432
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,958
all you could manage to do
was crumble and lament.

433
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,875
As such, it is only natural
for you to wish you were

434
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,041
more like them.

435
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,125
[ALEISTER] Aiwass, I will
make use of anything I can

436
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,583
to survive.

437
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,291
Even if that manifests
in my using you.

438
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,291
Allow me to say
something to you as well.

439
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,458
Indeed, you have an advantage,

440
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,125
but there are no guarantees
that your advantage is absolute,

441
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,333
or that it will last forever.

442
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,166
[AIWASS]
The girl is a different matter.

443
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,250
She will most certainly
perish at some point.

444
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,500
If you don't want
to mourn her later,

445
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,708
you should proceed down
a path other than the one

446
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,083
you are currently on.

447
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,791
Go to Russia.

448
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:49,041
Specifically, the Elizalina
Alliance of Independent Nations.

449
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:55,041
Remember the term "Index
Librorum Prohibitorum."

450
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,875
There will be an important
item pertaining to it.

451
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,708
--[ACCELERATOR gasps]
--[crash]

452
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,500
[ACCELERATOR]
Russia.

453
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,416
Is something wrong, or...?

454
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,041
No, I'm fine, really.

455
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,250
Please don't ever leave me.

456
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,833
You have my word.

457
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,125
Like I would leave you.

458
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,125
Damn it!

459
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm never gonna
leave you, all right?

460
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,166
[KAMIJO]
Just you wait.

461
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,666
[KAMIJO]
Academy City and Russia.

462
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,166
Everything becomes
embroiled and it begins.

463
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,500
As for what,
that much is obvious.

464
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,833
World War III.

465
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,250
Next time, "The Alliance
of Independent Nations."

466
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,125
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
