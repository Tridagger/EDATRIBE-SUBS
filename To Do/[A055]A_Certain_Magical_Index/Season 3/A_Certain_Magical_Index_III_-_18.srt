with their own interests

that's about to take place.

351
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,291
So tell me if this makes sense.

352
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,208
Under these circumstances,
could a powerful sorcerer

353
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,333
sit idly by in hiding?

354
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,833
[SASHA yelling]

355
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,416
That's Sasha Kruezhev!

356
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,208
Today must be my lucky day.

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,375
[SASHA grunts]

358
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,583
[FIAMMA] I never thought
it would be possible.

359
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,208
How was it so easy to
achieve both objectives?

360
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,125
[FIAMMA]
There's a familiar face.

361
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,333
[VENTO] I'm not particularly
obliged to help these people

362
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,750
in any way.

363
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,208
However, you need to
quit disrupting the

364
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,833
Roman Orthodox Church!

365
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,125
I think enough is enough,
don't you?

366
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,208
Too bad I happen to know
you aren't able to use

367
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,125
your trademark
Divine Retribution.

368
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,125
And for some reason
you think that's all it takes

369
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,375
for me to quit?

370
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,333
Of course.

371
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,583
They went and got attacked
before I could get here.

372
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,000
But who'd level a
military base like this?

373
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,208
Looks like it's been
thoroughly wiped.

374
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,208
[chuckles]
That's an easy riddle to solve.

375
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,500
Academy City, obviously.

376
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,250
Is this what they were after?

377
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,708
What's in there that's
worth dying for?

378
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,791
How interesting.

379
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,958
So this is an operation
on the same level

380
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,791
as my recovery mission.

381
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,083
I'm not seeing a lot
of results just yet,

382
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,833
but maybe this has
something to do with that

383
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,333
"other set of laws."

384
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,083
Or whatever that son of a bitch
Aiwass was talking about.

385
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,458
That cryptic freak didn't
exactly give me much to go on.

386
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,958
[FRENCH SORCERER 18K]
Freeze!

387
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,208
[ACCELERATOR]
Hmm?

388
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,791
[FRENCH SORCERER 18K]
You from Academy City?

389
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,000
[ACCELERATOR]
I don't believe we've met.

390
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,000
You must be the ones who
attacked the military base,

391
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,041
right?

392
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,708
Never mind, don't care.

393
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,750
I'll take you all out quickly.

394
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,500
[ACCELERATOR]
You don't mind, do you?

395
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,666
[PILOT 18A] Now approaching
the slated assault zone.

396
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,791
Russian Airbase 740.

397
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,916
[CONTROL TOWER 18A]
Copy.

398
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,583
What's your drop status?

399
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,791
[PILOT 18A]
Ready to release.

400
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,875
[MISAKA WORST]
Yoo-hoo, I'm here to kill you.

401
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,208
First Ranked.

402
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,041
[KAMIJO] The Third Season
has been unleashed.

403
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,666
An expression of 10,031
people's vengeance,

404
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,375
condemnation, and hatred.

405
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,750
Retribution arrives
in the worst of forms.

406
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,666
Next time, "Misaka Worst."

407
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,500
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
