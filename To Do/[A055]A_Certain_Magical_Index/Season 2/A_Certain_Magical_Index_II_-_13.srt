00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,416
Even if the Cross is
activated outside the borders,

175
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
all of Academy City
will still be affected.

176
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,083
Damn, we've been tricked.
Oriana was a decoy.

177
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,958
[LIDVIA] It is a shame
that she was defeated,

178
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,958
but some sacrifices
are necessary

179
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,583
on the path to righteousness.

180
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,833
All will turn out as
it should in the end.

181
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,208
What truly matters right
now is that, at long last,

182
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,083
science will be forced
to bow to religion.

183
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,416
By denying science's power
and demonstrating our own,

184
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,250
we can restore the authority
of the Lord to this wanton land.

185
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,458
[STIYL] We need to
find her and stop this.

186
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,458
But, at this point,
we can't ask Tsuchimikado

187
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,125
to use his magic again.

188
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,000
[KAMIJO] Damn! What the
hell are we supposed to do?

189
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,458
[LIDVIA] It is not
as if our mission is

190
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,291
the destruction of Academy City.

191
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,500
Once you've renounced science
and its attendant heresy,

192
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,833
we'll gladly embrace you as our
beloved friends and comrades.

193
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,416
[STIYL]
Get Tsuchimikado on the phone.

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,250
We'll use his divination circle
to determine Lidvia's location.

195
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,416
Then use my communication
magic to contact

196
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,916
our forces outside the city.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,666
[LIDVIA] You do
not have time for that.

198
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,708
The Cross's conversion of
the world will begin very soon.

199
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,541
In one hundred
and seven seconds.

200
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,500
Checkmate, gentlemen.

201
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,791
Isn't there something
else we can do?

202
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,791
Maybe another
trick up our sleeve?

203
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,625
Or a final trump
card we can play?

204
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,250
The cross uses constellations
from the night sky.

205
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,208
It's here on the ground when it
collects the starlight, though.

206
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,708
[beeping]

207
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,041
[ringing]

208
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,083
Tsuchimikado. There's something
that I need to ask you.

209
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,166
Where outside the city
could the Croce di Pietro

210
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,375
be placed and
still affect everything?

211
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,833
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Why, what's up?

212
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,125
Just answer, okay? Better
yet, with those conditions,

213
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,000
what would the
farthest point be?

214
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,291
[TSUCHIMIKADO] I'd say Academy
City's northern perimeter,

215
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
by about seventeen
hundred meters.

216
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,916
Why do you need to know?

217
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:04,333
[beeping]

218
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,125
[KAMIJO] Let's see.
In twenty seconds.

219
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,458
[LIDVIA] It is over my son.

220
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:25,125
[KAMIJO] Yes. It's over, all
right. I have lost this fight.

221
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,375
And the Roman Orthodox
Church has triumphed.

222
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,750
[KAMIJO] So how
does it feel, Lidvia?

223
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,166
You know what bugs me most
about this whole situation?

224
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,625
That I couldn't keep a
promise to my classmate.

225
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,500
[LIDVIA]
Huh? What is happening?

226
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,333
[gasps]

227
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
[LIDVIA] How?

228
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,541
You scheduled the Cross to be
activated at exactly 6:30pm.

229
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,583
Shoulda done your research.

230
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,791
Because that's also the time
when the night parade begins.

231
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
With this much
light in the sky,

232
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,916
I'm guessing the stars will
be pretty well blotted out.

233
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,708
[KAMIJO] It doesn't matter
that we didn't find you.

234
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,500
[KAMIJO] You've been
defeated by the people who

235
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,666
came together to celebrate
the Daihasei Festival.

236
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,750
It was no contest, really.
They outshine you by far.

237
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,250
You can't hold a
candle to their faith.

238
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,583
So, what d'you say?
Let's make a deal.

239
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,166
First, you promise to
destroy the Croce di Pietro.

240
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,791
[KAMIJO] Then you assure
me that you'll never again

241
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,625
mess with Academy City.

242
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,125
And in return,
I'll let you go in peace.

243
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,833
[LIDVIA] You cannot be serious.
Have you forgotten that

244
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,750
I am a devout believer of
the Roman Orthodox Church?

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
[KAMIJO] I see.

246
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,458
[KAMIJO]
All right. In that case...

247
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:01,125
This field day, I guess we'll
just have to keep playing tag.

248
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,291
Until I catch you.

249
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,458
So, to sum up...
you got beat black and blue

250
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,208
by a female magician. While you
were fighting her for access

251
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,958
to a relic that would determine
the fate of the entire planet.

252
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,875
You got yourself pummeled
while saving the world

253
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,666
and did it all
without a word to me.

254
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,041
Can you blame
me for worrying?

255
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,041
Whenever magic is involved,
you just walk right into

256
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,833
the situation without
stopping to think first.

257
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,083
[INDEX] The way you say
that makes me sound like

258
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,250
some kind of foolish
child. I don't like it!

259
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,625
Pffft.

260
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,458
You should be able to
admit that you're impetuous.

261
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,791
The fact you can't
makes you seem really--

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, dear, look at this.

263
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,875
[KUROKO] You two seem
to get physical a lot,

264
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,875
if you know what I mean.

265
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
[INDEX] We were in the middle
of a serious discussion,

266
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,500
so get out of here, short-hair!

267
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,333
[MIKOTO] Kuroko.

268
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,750
There's no rule against
an ordinary citizen helping

269
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,458
a member of judgment fulfill
her security duties, is there?

270
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,541
[KUROKO] Not here, Sissy.
We're inside a hospital.

271
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,916
We don't want
to endanger anybody.

272
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,041
Damn. Okay, fine. I'll stop.

273
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,416
Did you see the
final results, though?

274
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,208
It's no surprise that our
school easily surpassed yours

275
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,083
to come out on
top in the festival.

276
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,458
[MIKOTO] I hope you
haven't forgotten about

277
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,791
the terms of our bet.

278
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,125
No, I haven't forgotten.

279
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,750
But I can't really do much
in my current condition.

280
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,666
The doctor says I'm
very fragile, you know.

281
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,833
Oh? Well...

282
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,791
[MIKOTO] We'll see about that.

283
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,958
[cuckles]

284
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,875
Poor Oriana, I certainly
do not envy her fate.

285
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,708
However, we all have our parts
to play in the Lord's plan.

286
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,708
Hers may be over, but
mine is just beginning.

287
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,333
[LAURA] Excuse me.
Attention, please.

288
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,916
This is Laura Stuart, archbishop
of the English Puritan Church.

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,958
Now, I do hope you have
enjoyed the flight so far

290
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,625
because I am afraid
you are about to hit

291
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,416
some turbulence, Lidvia.

292
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,666
[LIDVIA] What did you do?
This is a private jet.

293
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,583
[LAURA] Hm-hmmm. You made
a stop to refuel, remember?

294
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,833
I had something pasted to
the wall of your fuselage.

295
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,416
[LAURA] You're as
unbalanced as ever, I see.

296
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
The more cornered you feel,
the louder that cackle

297
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,666
of yours gets. It's
actually rather creepy.

298
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,041
I wonder if there's anything
to be done about that.

[LIDVIA] The more
difficult the situation is,

the greater the joy I feel when
I break free of it and triumph.

301

of giving thanks to the Lord.

[LAURA] What you just said.

306
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,708
That the greater the
obstacle before you,

307
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,083
the more intense the thrill
is when you overcome it.

308
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,125
[LAURA] I couldn't help
but think how appropriate

309
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,750

agree to kiss my feet

and renounce your
Roman Catholic faith,

315
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,000
I will save you from
falling to your death.

My life is nothing
compared to my soul.

317

[LAURA] I see. Then you
and the Cross will be

I should be able to save it.

I have to. There is no
acceptable alternative.
