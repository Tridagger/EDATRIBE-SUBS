1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,583
[KOMABA] If we're so weak,
then maybe you should

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,125
take it easier on us...
little esper girl.

3
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,416
Ritoku Komaba.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,666
[MUSUJIME] It looks
like I accidentally

5
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,708
ran into the target first.

6
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,291
We split all our money up to
avoid this sort of thing...

7
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,916
Yet here you are, tryin'
to make off with our stash...

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,875
Thanks to you, that's a whole
lot of hard work up in smoke.

9
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,083
It isn't personal, you
know, I'm like a weapon--

10
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,791
I just shoot
where I'm aimed...

11
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,375
And your secret
war chest just happens

12
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,291
to be what I'm
aimed at right now.

13
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,375
Your ability
is Move Point ...?

14
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,125
That's an annoying little power.

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,666
I think you'll find
that "annoying" doesn't

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,000
do it justice.

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,583
[KOMABA] Yeah... You might
be right about that...

18
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,125
Maybe it's more "despicable"
than "annoying."

19
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,250
[MUSUJIME] Either way,
you're going to end up with

20
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,208
a corkscrew between the eyes.

21
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,416
[grunts]

22
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,625
[KOMABA] You're too slow.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,041
I came to this fight with
some tricks of my own.

24
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,833
[MUSUJIME] Ah!

25
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,541
It's not smart to play
by the rules when fighting

26
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,708
a monster like you...
I brought some extra

27
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,958
equipment to even
the playing field a bit.

28
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,750
Ugh!

29
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,625
[KOMABA] Nope. Missed me.

30
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,416
[beeping]

31
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,375
[MUSUJIME] You've got
some serious moves.

32
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,041
So, what's your secret?
Some of that tape

33
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,875
they use on
mechanical powersuits?

34
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,458
[chuckles]

35
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,916
It's actually special military
sonic elastic taping, but close.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,291
Acquiring it wasn't
easy, let me tell ya.

37
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,166
I hear that stuff is
defective, and you're using it

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,333
on your own body...?

39
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,208
That could do some
long-term damage.

40
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,041
That should tell you
how far I'm prepared to go.

41
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,458
Do you think we
could stop chatting

42
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,416
and get this over with already?

43
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,041
I'm a very busy man...
My boys and I still have

44
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,458
a lot to do when I'm done here.

45
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,750
Don't make me laugh.

46
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,708
[KOMABA] Really, a flimsy
piece of metal...?

47
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,166
You think that's going
to be enough to stop me?!

48
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,166
[KOMABA] Didn't
even break a sweat.

49
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,625
[ACCELERATOR]
This place is a mess...


50
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,250
Looks like Musujime's
met her quota


51
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,833
for this mission... My turn.


52
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,958
So many better ways
I could spend my time.

53
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,500
[KOMABA] Then why don't we
get this over with quickly?

54
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,083
[ACCELERATOR] What?

55
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,125
You're Accelerator,
aren't ya?

56
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,250
And you're Ritoku Komaba...

57
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,708
Just out of curiosity, why
the hell are you doing this?

58
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,958
You're asking me why
Skill Out goes after espers

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,416
like you and your buddy...?

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,708
We have our motives, but I
doubt you'd understand them.

61
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,041
Heh! So your big
plan is to throw the city

62
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,291
into chaos by attacking
indiscriminately?

63
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,875
No, not indiscriminately...

64
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,291
We have reasons to
picking the people we do.

65
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,458
[ACCELERATOR] You
seem pretty confident,

66
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,791
given the situation...

67
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,250
You do know what I
came for, don't you?

68
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,458
Girl's already dead.

69
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,083
[KOMABA] I've heard stories,
but you're different than

70
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,291
what I expected...
Outcasts like you are

71
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,416
usually more reckless
in their attacks.

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,250
[ACCELERATOR] They are, huh?
You know, it's funny...

73
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,583
scumbags like you are
usually more respectful...

74
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,166
But that's before I
turn them into mincemeat.

75
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,500
That device
you've got there...

76
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,791
it's a transmitter
for some kind of

77
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,875
electrical information, right?

78
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,250
[chuckles]

79
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
What the hell...?
What's happening?

80
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,708
It's called Chaff Seed...

81
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,833
It's used to disrupt
electromagnetic waves.

82
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,916
Uh--Ugh!

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,416
[groans]

84
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,500
Bastard!

85
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,875
[KOMABA] Mine's a lot bigger.

86
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,666
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

87
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,625
[yells]

88
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,375
[KOMABA]
It's over. Stop fighting.

89
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,583
I'll give you one
courtesy, though...

90
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,083
You can choose where in
this alley you'd like to die.

91
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,166
[grunts]

92
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,916
[ACCELERATOR] You're unhappy
with your miserable life,

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
so you've decided
to make up for it

94
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,666
by ruining the lives
of innocent people?

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm not gonna let
that happen this time!

96
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,416
You dirty bastard!

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,083
[gunshot]

98
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:43,875
[KOMABA] How...? Your
Reflection... it came back...

99
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,333
I don't... get it.

100
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,166
[ACCELERATOR]
You're as dumb as you look.

101
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,416
You used Chaff Seed.

102
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Don't you even know the
basics of how it works?

103
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,208
You scatter metal
foil through the air,

104
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,916
creating EM interference...

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,500
Which makes things simple...

106
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,250
All I had to do was shift
the foil out of the way...

107
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,583
perhaps by...
getting the air moving...

108
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,916
[grunts]

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,916
[ACCELERATOR]
Now... where were we?

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,416
Yeah, that's right.
We were going to see

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,791
how things turn out when a
Level 0 challenges a Level 5.

112
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,166
I'm just on pins and
needles over here, aren't you?

113
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,916
Didn't get there fast enough!

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,625
[KOMABA groans]

115
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,791
[ACCELERATOR] What's
that you said before?

116
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,791
"It's over. Stop fighting."

117
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,291
[ACCELERATOR] When are you
losers gonna realize that people

118
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,291
don't hate you just
'cause of your Level?

119
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,583
[ACCELERATOR] Wake up already...
The reason Zeroes are treated

120
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,750
like crap is because
you clowns in Skill Out

121
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,125
go around making
trouble for everybody.

122
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,000
You think you're
protecting your rights...?

123
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,000
Guaranteeing your safety...?
You're all idiots...

124
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,166
You're basically
doing the opposite.

125
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,083
These stunts of yours
as good as put nooses

126
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,041
around your esper-hating necks.

127
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,583
You think our whole
purpose is to go around

128
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,625
[KOMABA] causing trouble...?
Think for a second.

129
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,708
Espers are espers
because of their abilities,

130
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,625
not 'cause they're
such good people...

131
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,291
You end up with
some ugly specimens

132
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,125
of humanity wielding
some serious power.

133
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,375
So, what's to stop espers
like that from attacking

134
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,791
powerless Level Zeros just
'cause they feel like it?

135
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,791
I'll tell you.
The answer is an armed group

136
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,666
like Skill Out...
That's the reason we exist.

137
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,583
Hmph.

138
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,291
[KOMABA] There's always
a price for being a leader.

139
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,333
I knew I'd have
to pay it eventually.

140
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,166
What do you want,
sympathy? Tch.

141
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,958
[KOMABA] From you? No.

142
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,125
It is sort of
interesting, though...

143
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,916
I feel like you and
I have more in common

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,958
than I would've thought.

145
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,750
So here's a gift...

146
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,250
A pathetic sight to
burn into your mind...

147
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,250
something to remember me by.

148
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,083
[gunshot]

149
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,125
[UNABARA] Excellent work.
Your part is done.

150
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,708
We'll see to
disposing of the body

151
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,625
and destroying any evidence...

152
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,708
I'll send the garbage
truck your way...

153
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,541
It'll be your ride back.

154
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,291
Nah. I can find
my own way back.

155
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,833
[UNABARA] It makes
no difference to me.

156
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,083
Just avoid contact
with anybody you know...

157
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,708
It's important
that Group remains a--

158
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,333
You might as
well come out now...

159
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,625
I know he didn't kill you.

160
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,000
Nice fight. I started
watching about halfway through.

161
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,625
So, when did I
give myself away?

162
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,958
Please... Did you think
no one would notice...?

163
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,041
That stunt of yours
was pretty obvious.

164
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
[MUSUJIME giggles]

165
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,083
Hey, now... Is that any
way to talk to the person

166
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,416
who saved your life
just a few minutes ago?

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,083
You really think I
needed your help...?

168
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,500
Keep telling yourself that...

169
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,791
You leaving...?
Our ride'll be here soon.

170
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
Yeah? Well don't
worry about it...

171
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,333
It's just some overtime.

172
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,833
[beeping]

173
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,833
[ACCELERATOR] Something
I need to take care of.

174
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,666
[ACCELERATOR] Ugh...

175
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,916
That ended up taking a
lot longer than I expected.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,708
Tch.

177
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,916
[ACCELERATOR] I need coffee.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,625
The convenience store
should be open.

179
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,541
[moan]

180
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,500
Ugh... I'm not
feeling so good...

181
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,458
[ACCELERATOR] Mm?
That woman's face...

182
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,041
It's like I've seen
it somewhere before...

183
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,916
[chuckles]

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,625
[ACCELERATOR] Who is this lady?

185
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,750
Huh?

186
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,708
Uh.

187
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,041
W'ello there...!
I'MisuzuMisaka.

188
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,583
Nice a meet you--Uuuhhh...

189
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,458
[thud]

190
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,916
Hey... get off me!

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I like long walks on
the beach at sunset...

192
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,333
and getting
caught in the rain...

193
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,458
and have you seen my boobs,

194
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,000
'cause they're really big...

195
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,375
Oh, I forgot. I'm married...

196
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,666
I really shouldn't say
stuff like that, huh?

197
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
[MISUZU] That's right.
Hands off, buddy.

198
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,250
My husband wouldn't
like this at all.

199
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,083
Hey... I'm looking
for Dangai University's

200
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,250
Database Center.
Do you know where it is...?

201
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,833
If you could tell me
that would be a big help.

202
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,708
[MISUZU] Hey...!
Don't walk away from me.

203
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,375
That isn't nice!

204
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,875
[MISUZU] You don't get it?!

205
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,041
That's where I
have to go now...!

206
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,000
It's really important
'cause that's where they do

207
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,125
all the studying
and stuff, you know?

208
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,666
[laughs]

209
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,125
Here's an idea.
How about you get off me

210
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,625
and pour yourself into a taxi?

211
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,291
Don't tell anybody,
but I've got a thing

212
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,291
for younger men. I could
just kiss you all over,

213
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,625
you young stud, you! Ahhh...

214
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,875
[ACCELERATOR] Come on, lady. For
both of our sakes, stop talking!

215
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,666
[KAMIJO] Fine,
if I have to choose...

216
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,166
I'd say the croquettes were
my favorite part of the meal.

217
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,541
I mean, little breaded
patties that you fry in oil...

218
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,333
What's not to love about that?

219
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,083
They are tasty.
It's a lot of work to

220
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,958
fry them yourself, though. Ah!

221
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,166
[INDEX] I know! Next time we
go to a restaurant like that,

222
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,583
I'll have you fry
them for me instead!

223
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,833
Then it won't
be any work at all,

224
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,958
and they'll taste much better!

225
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,166
[MISUZU] Hey! Kid!
Don't I know you?

226
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,500
[KAMIJO] Are you okay?

227
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,250
[MISUZU] I'm just fine.
It's getting late, though.

228
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,750
Time for bed, isn't it?

229
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,083
Mhm.

230
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,333
Oh... wait a sec...
I haven't washed my face or

231
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,666
put on any moisturizing cream.
That's unacceptable...

232
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,291
[MISUZU] You skip just
one day, and that's when

233
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,750
the wrinkles start to show...

234
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,125
Uh-oh... I'm gonna puke.

235
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,916
[KAMIJO] Uh... Can I... Huh?

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,166
[MISUZU] Ahhh...!

237
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh yeah...! Hands off,
ladies! He's mine...!

238
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,666
Wait, what are you
doing wandering around

239
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,958
at this late hour...?

240
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,458
And where's my daughter?
Where's Mikoto? Ahhh!

241
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,375
[KAMIJO] Ack! Please!
Do something! Help me, Index!

242
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,958
I know you...! What was
your name again, little girl?

243
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,291
[SPHINX meows]

244
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,791
Humph...! As if I would
give personal information

245
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,541
to someone behaving
like you are now!

246
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,958
Oh yeah, you little
brat, I'll show you.

247
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,958
Ah! Okay, it's Index...!
My name is Index!

248
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,083
Thank you... Now,
if you could just point me

249
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,666
towards the Dangai
University's Database Center?

250
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,083
[KAMIJO] Huh?

251
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,458
You see, I'm writing a
report for this class I'm in,

252
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,083
and the materials I
need for it can only be

253
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,708
found in Academy City...

254
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,958
So I had no choice but to drag
myself back to this place.

255
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,583
[KAMIJO] Ah... gotcha.

256
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,666
[gasp] I know...!
I'll get your contact info

257
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,875
and we can stay in touch!

258
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,000
Uh, I don't know...

259
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,500
We're gonna be
such good friends.

260
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,708
I can already tell!

261
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,500
I'll call you as soon
as I get home, okay?

262
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,708
[ACCELERATOR] Her name was
Misaka... A coincidence...? No.

263
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,166
She's got something to
do with the kid. But what?

264
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,500
[beep]

265
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,208
[phone rings]

266
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,625
[SHADOWY MAN]
Hello, Accelerator...

267
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,083
Did you need something?

268
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,333
[ACCELERATOR] Tch...
They've tapped my phone, huh?

269
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,083
[ACCELERATOR]
You're a sneaky bastard...

270
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,083
Is this Group's
mysterious leader?

271
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,208
[SHADOWY MAN] You picked
up your phone because

272
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,500
you had a question.

273
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,208
[ACCELERATOR]
It's nothing important...

274
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,625
I'll figure it
out on my own, thanks.

275
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,666
[SHADOWY MAN] If that's what
you want, suit yourself...

276
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,041
I don't really care...

277
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,333
There is a certain
matter I would like

278
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,625
to discuss with you, though.

279
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,791
Huh?

280
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,791
[SHADOWY MAN] This
should work out well...

281
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,291
The timing is almost perfect.

282
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,208
Oh yeah?

283
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,291
[rumble]

284
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,166
[SHADOWY MAN] That woman
you just ran into...

285
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,250
She recently submitted
a request to use

286
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,875
the Dangai University
Database Center.

287
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,166
So that's where the
attack is taking place.

288
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,541
An attack ordered by you?

289
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,625
[SHADOWY MAN] Yes.

290
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,333
And who exactly
is this Misaka woman?

291
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,500
[SHADOWY MAN] Her full
name is Misuzu Misaka...

292
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,916
She is the mother
of one Mikoto Misaka.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,875
Are you familiar with
the "retrieval campaign"?

294
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,000
Sure. It's the thing where
parents are getting their kids

295
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,041
away from Academy
City before war breaks out.

296
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,583
[SHADOWY MAN] That's correct...
and if too many students

297
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,916
leave Academy City, it will
create any number of problems...

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,458
Misuzu currently
occupies a leadership role

299
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,625
among the retrieval
campaign parents...

300
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,791
So... the decision has
been made to remove her.

301
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,291
Would you be willing
to assist with said removal?

302
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,750
[ACCELERATOR]
Why do you want my help?

303
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,291
[SHADOWY MAN] The assignment
has actually been given to

304
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,625
members of Skill Out... but
they lack a certain... finesse.

305
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,583
Things would go more smoothly
if you were to assist...

306
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,375
I don't think so.

307
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,000
[ACCELERATOR] It's my life.
I still call my own shots...

308
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,375
This mission
doesn't interest me,

309
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,708
so thanks,
but I'm going to pass.

310
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,166
[SHADOWY MAN] Very well, then...

311
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,000
In that case,
please hurry back...

312
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,083
Your ability will be restored
to you upon your return.

313
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,416
[beep]

314
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,875
What...? You bastard...!

315
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,625
What did you do
to my electrode?

316
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,791
[SHADOWY MAN] I'm afraid I'm
going to have to let you go...

317
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,083
Goodbye for now...
I'm sure I'll see you soon.

318
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,541
Tch.

319
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,958
[ACCELERATOR] Misuzu Misaka...
you're in luck...

320
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm gonna go rescue you...

321
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,125
That oughta piss off
the mystery boss man.

322
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,833
[KAMIJO panting]

323
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,666
[gasp]

324
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,291
[growls]

325
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,083
[ACCELERATOR]
That bastard again?!

326
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,166
Tch... No time now.
Deal with it later.

327
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,791
[ACCELERATOR]
Well... here we go...

328
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,125
I'm gonna make
this the bloodiest

329
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,541
rescue operation ever...

330
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,958
They're gonna need
to hose the place down

331
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,833
[ACCELERATOR] by the
time this is over.

332
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,125
[SKILL OUT A] What
is this, amateur hour?

333
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,208
Which of you idiots
forgot the security key?

334
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,000
[SKILL OUT B] Forget
about it. We don't have time.

335
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,291
Let's just find the woman.

336
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,666
[MISUZU] Uh...
What's going on here?

337
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,125
I know I dialed Antiskill,
so why can't I get through?

338
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,708
[gasps]
[distant footsteps]

339
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,791
[beeping]
[distant footsteps]

340
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,833
[beeping]

341
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,875
From the sound of it,
they're probably with Skill Out.

342
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,416
[MISUZU] What's Skill Out?

343
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,166
[KAMIJO] They're basically a
gang made up of Level Zeroes.

344
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,541
They tend to be armed.

345
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,416
[MISUZU] But why
would they be after me?

346
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,666
As to that, I have no idea.

347
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,416
Miss Misaka... Have you tried
giving your daughter a call?

348
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Huh?

349
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,541
[KAMIJO] The fighting skills of
a Level 5 could come in handy

350
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,541
right now... If she's
still in the cit--

351
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,458
No way! Keep
Mikoto out of this...

352
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,208
[MISUZU] I'm her mother. I
won't drag her into my problems.

353
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,583
Please... I can't...

354
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,375
I'd never be able to
look her in the eye again.

355
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,583
[KAMIJO] I understand.

356
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,291
[KAMIJO] Then stay put.
I'll be right there.

357
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,583
[MISUZU] Huh? I can't
ask you to risk--

358
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,125
[beep]

359
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,083
Haven't any of you
morons found her?

360
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,333
[SKILL OUT] Huh?

361
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,375
[MAN] I asked you guys
a question, damn it...!

362
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,083
Answer me!

363
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah... Komaba got off easy...

364
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,666
Nobody expects anything
from a dead man...

365
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,958
but what the hell are the
rest of us supposed to do?

366
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,625
[MISUZU gaps]

367
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,708
[chuckles]

368
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,500
Hamazura here...
I've located the target...

369
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,125
We can take care of her...
Do you copy me?

370
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,166
[SKILL OUT C] Hey! Back off!

371
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,208
[gunshots]

372
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,458
Antiskill's there?

373
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,708
[ACCELERATOR] Sorry...!
Your friend had to go...

374
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,875
If it'll make you feel better,
I can stay on the line

375
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,625
and keep chatting
with you instead...

376
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,666
I've got a few things to
wrap up here before I come

377
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,458
and kill the rest
of you scumbags.

378
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,625
[gunshots]

379
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,000
[KAMIJO] Five of them... And,
sure enough, they all have guns.

380
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,916
[KAMIJO]
This is bulletproof... Right?

381
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,208
[MISUZU] Huh?

382
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,291
[SKILL OUT gasps]

383
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,333
[KAMIJO] Why not
just point and shout?

384
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,083
[KAMIJO] Damn... I need to make
a move before they regroup...

385
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
If I could reach the
bag with the gun in it...

386
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:45,875
Shoot him!

387
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,291
You're kidding me, right?

388
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,708
[KAMIJO] Here we go!

389
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,375
Ah!

390
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,458
[MISUZU and
SKILL OUT D grunting]

391
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,458
Damn you!

392
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,958
Uhhh...

393
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,583
[SKILL OUT A groans]

394
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,041
[SKILL OUT B] Another one?!

395
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,041
[KAMIJO] I'll untie you
and then we're out of here.

396
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,208
Ready to run?

397
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,666
[KAMIJO] Hurry up!

398
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,875
Heh.

399
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,458
Quite the diligent one,
aren't you...?

400
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,333
Carrying out your duty
in spite of adversity,

401
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,958
like a good little soldier.

402
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,291
[SKILL OUT D]
This way! Come on!

403
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,750
Ugh!

404
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,583
[KAMIJO] Good, we're out...
Let's keep going...

405
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,333
We'll go somewhere more crowded.

406
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,083
[HAMAZURA] What's going on here?

407
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,000
Who are you? Why are
you doing this...?

408
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,958
Are we being set up or
something, is that it?

409
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,708
Was the job just
a sham all along?

410
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,291
What did you say?

411
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,500
[HAMAZURA] That bastard Komaba
went and got himself killed...

412
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,708
We knew the ones
who did it were bound

413
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,541
to come after the
rest of us soon...

414
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,083
So we agreed we would
do whatever they asked us.

415
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,250
Damn...! They were
planning to screw us over

416
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,500
from the beginning!

417
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,875
I'm not with those guys...

418
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,291
I'm here because
this woman called me.

419
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,083
[chuckles]

420
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,708
That's almost funny.

421
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,333
[HAMAZURA] I totally screwed the
pooch on this one, didn't I...?

422
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,416
There's no one to
blame for it but me...!

423
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,458
It wasn't some big conspiracy...

424
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,208
We weren't double-crossed
by some strategic genius.

425
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,666
[chuckles]

426
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,041
My life is worthless now...!

427
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,625
If somebody's gonna kill
me... might as well be you.

428
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,833
Just stay back!

429
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,375
[grunts]

430
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,416
[KAMIJO groans]

431
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,166
Hey, wait... If you're not
with them, that means...

432
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,541
I might still have a chance
to get out of this alive...

433
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,250
I just need to bring
them the target's body...

434
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,666
That'll show 'em that I'm
not completely worthless.

435
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,458
[chuckles]

436
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,083
[KAMIJO] By all means,
you go right ahead and try!

437
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,833
[HAMAZURA groans]

438
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,041
[groans]

439
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,625
What's wrong with you?

440
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
How can you treat a person's
life as if it's nothing?!

441
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,208
What choice did I have...?!

442
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,750
How are Level Zeroes
like us supposed to

443
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,500
survive if we can't
prove ourselves?!

444
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,333
[KAMIJO] I don't
need to prove myself.

445
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,916
What?

446
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,541
[KAMIJO] Don't lump all Level
Zeroes in with criminal bastards

447
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,833
like you and your group.

448
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,000
You're one, too...

449
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,958
This whole time,
you didn't use an ability.

450
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,041
[KAMIJO] There are plenty of
Level Zeroes in this city...

451
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,208
and most of them
aren't in stupid gangs...

452
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,833
They go to school
every day and do their

453
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,708
homework and make friends
just like everyone else does...

454
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,291
They live perfectly
normal lives.

455
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,083
You're the ones making
Level Zeroes look like

456
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,708
a bunch of idiots!

457
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,250
You're really a Level Zero...
You're just like me.

458
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,375
[KAMIJO]
I am nothing like you...

459
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,458
No, I don't have
an ability, either...

460
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,041
but I also have no intention
of becoming cruel...

461
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,416
I won't hurt people to
make myself feel better!

462
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,625
You call us cruel...?

463
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,541
Take a closer
look at this city...

464
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,375
The people with power
keep it for themselves,

465
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,291
with nothing for
the rest of us...

466
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,875
They're a hundred
times more cruel than

467
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,666
Skill Out could ever hope to be!

468
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,500
Will you accept
no responsibility?

469
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,916
You ever try asking for help?
Or just lashing out?

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,291
Huh?

471
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,333
[KAMIJO] If you had
dedicated half as much time to

472
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,958
helping others as you
have to fighting espers...

473
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,541
There's a good chance
that the people of

474
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,541
this city would
have accepted you.

475
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,166
And your lives would
be a lot different now.

476
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,083
Screw you! Did you
ever hear about Komaba...?

477
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,625
He was the leader of Skill Out,
and he was a good person...

478
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,958
He did the things you said...
and he's dead now...!

479
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,875
He was killed
protecting the weak!

480
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,583
Sounds like he
was a good guy...

481
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,041
So why don't you try
following his example...?

482
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,250
He fought against injustice
until the very end, didn't he?

483
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,708
[KAMIJO] Did he
fight to protect...

484
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,583
or to indiscriminately harm?

485
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,500
You don't know anything...!

486
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,375
You're just a
Level Zero, like me...

487
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,875
You're nothing! You don't
have any power in this city!

488
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,541
Don't look down on us like
you're something special!

489
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,333
[KAMIJO] The reason people
look down on you has nothing

490
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,833
to do with power...
or your lack of it.

491
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,958
That's just an illusion,

492
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,208
a lie you tell yourself...

493
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,958
At some point you'll
need to let it go...

494
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,625
How about right now?

495
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,875
[sirens]

496
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,625
[MISUZU] Want to know
why I'm really here?

497
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,791
I came to take Mikoto home,
far away from the city.

498
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,916
But I don't think I
need to worry anymore...

499
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,708
Not as long as there
are still people around

500
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,125
like you and that other boy...

501
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,375
If you're watching out for her,
I know she'll be fine.

502
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,750
I'm sorry... "Other boy"?

503
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:09,208
[footsteps]

504
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,916
[ACCELERATOR] Were you told
to track me down and punish me

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,375
for disobeying orders?

506
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,375
So melodramatic!

507
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,625
The Misaka situation
has been resolved...

508
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,416
She seems to have
lost the desire to

509
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,625
remove her daughter
from Academy City.

510
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,666
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Her death
is no longer necessary.

511
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,250
Is that the kind
of conclusion our boss

512
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,916
is likely to be okay with?

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
I doubt he'll object...

514
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,208
Mainly because Unabara here
has been working so hard.

515
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,666
Oh... I'm just pleased
that young Kamijo

516
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,916
has kept his promise...

517
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,625
He has continued
to look after the girl

518
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,833
[UNABARA] that I care very
much about and protect the

519
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,958
fragile world
in which she lives.

520
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,208
In fact, his valiant
actions inspired me

521
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,875
to try a little bit
harder, myself...

522
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,375
My only hope is that,
in the end,

523
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,291
everything turns out
for the best, you know?

524
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,333
Don't worry.
We don't really know

525
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,500
what he's talking
about, either.

526
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,625
He just keeps saying
vague stuff like that...

527
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,041
Personally I'm betting
that whatever he was

528
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,791
up to must have
been pretty ugly.

529
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,916
Anyway, that's that...

530
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,208
Good work on
your assignment...

531
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,750
That goes for
the overtime, too.

532
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,333
Damn you people.

533
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,958
Remember... you can't
play by the rules here...

534
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,250
if you do, you'll
never win this game...

535
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,125
We're all in the
same boat, you know...

536
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,666
We're not here by choice.

537
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,458
[TSUCHIMIKADO] For whatever
reason, the people upstairs

538
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,583
seem to consider you
a precious commodity...

539
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,916
We could all work together...

540
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,416
What do you say?

541
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,291
[ACCELERATOR] Okay, sure. Why
not? One thing, though...

542
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,083
If you guys slow me down,
I'll leave you behind

543
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,708
without so much
as a second thought.

544
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,333
Ha... there's plenty of
fight left in this one...

545
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,875
Let's go guys...

546
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,208
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Time to strike
back at the powers that be.

547
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,666
[grunts]

548
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,333
[ACCELERATOR]
This should be fun...

549
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,666
It's always nice to
have a goal in life...

550
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,500
and this one I can get behind.

551
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,625
[MIKOTO] Come on!

552
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,166
I mean, really!
How long has it been

553
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,000
since I sent that text...?

554
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,541
I at least deserve
some kind of response.

555
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,125
No matter how much
we try, the mountain of

556
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,916
paperwork isn't
getting any smaller.

557
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,541
There's nobody
else to do it...

558
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,791
All the rest of them
were knocked unconscious...

559
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,541
We've got another
few days of this, easy.

560
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,083
It's best if you
just accept that.

561
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,625
[screaming]

562
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,041
[KOMOE] Wow! You're going
to be a booth bunny

563
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,333
at a weapons show?
That sounds exciting!

564
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,791
Let's not make too
big a deal of it.

565
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,125
They're just doing powered
suit demonstrations.

566
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,250
So in other words,
what you're saying is...

567
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,500
you'll be their mascot.

568
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,625
Well... I don't know if
I'd put it that way...

569
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,000
[sighs]

570
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,208
This pudding is great...!

571
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,750
Especially considering
it was purchased

572
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,125
from a convenience store.

573
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,291
You should be careful
eating sweets late at night.

574
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,041
You'll get fat.

575
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,375
"He's not here. Where is he?"

576
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,083
asks Misaka Misaka
right after she wakes up.

577
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:53,166
Don't worry he'll be
back soon... I promise.

578
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,625
"Misaka can't wait
to see him... Soon,"

579
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,750
repeats Misaka Misaka,
hoping you're right.

580
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,416
Hm.

581
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Just rest now.

582
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,041
[panting]

583
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,708
[panting]

584
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,166
Toma!

585
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,083
[INDEX] There you go again...!

586
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,750
Wandering off by yourself
and ending up hurt!

587
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,416
You have no sense
at all, do you?

588
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,125
How can one person wind
up in the hospital so much?

589
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:26,041
Well... you know...
It's a funny story...

590
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,166
Remember that woman
we ran into...?

591
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,250
[growling]

592
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,500
Uh...

593
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,541
[SPHINX meows]

594
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:38,125
[KAMIJO] Damn my rotten luck!
