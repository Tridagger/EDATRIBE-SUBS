whether it is true?

[MISAKA 10032] "There may have
been more to it than that,

174
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,416
but now I cannot take my
eyes off these little frogs,"

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,333
gushes Misaka while
inspecting the Original's bag.

176
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,750
[MIKOTO] Hands off!

177
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,875
Your bogus explanation
isn't working on me.

How did you end up
down here, and why do you

way about my chickens,"

says Misaka in a
reasonable tone of voice.

have a look, can't I?

looking for relevant
background information.

We made a bet during the

obviously I was the winner.

with me as his punishment.

not the right word--

after analyzing the data.

have to hide from him?

A strong reaction.

Interesting. Misaka will
try a more direct approach

full analysis of the message

she left on the
answering machine

248

and we came up
with some frequencies

249

that were pretty distinct.

250
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,458
They indicate that
she's in Area U,

251

means the underground mall.

or sweet with you,

the line when it comes

to showing her any
kindness on your part.

267
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,000
[YOMIKAWA] I think it's because

completely understand where
you're coming from, is it?

give you much of a choice.

I thought you would.

And, sure, maybe it doesn't
even compare to your situation.

is that we're both indebted.

quite a lot to pay back

hope to rest easily.

At least you have
power to work with.

options than I've got.

to stop the experiments?

keep them from rushing

hanging on to that kind of crap

make good on our debts.

Save your crying for
somebody who cares.

511
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,458
What've you've been up to?

512
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,166
Uh... "Playing
with somebody I just met.

513
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,208
It was fun!" says Misaka
Misaka, answering honestly.

514
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,375
[sighs]

515
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,708
Huh?

516
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,583
[INDEX] Finally! There you are!

517
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
I've been looking
for you everywhere!

518
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,416
I bet I can guess why.
You were hungry, weren't you?

519
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,125
[INDEX] Actually,
I was starving!

520
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,333
But it turned
out all right because

521
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,375
I ran into that
guy and he helped me.

522
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,333
[KAMIJO] Yeah? What guy is that?

523
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,916
[LAST ORDER] Accelerator!

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,125
Huh?

525
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,375
You better hurry or
you'll be left behind!

526
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,125
Pipe down ya' dirty brat.

527
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:36,083
♪ [Ending Song] ♪

528
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,125
[KAMIJO] A man from a
familiar family appears,

529
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,333
and the city has
a scent of danger.

530
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,125
Then, as if things
weren't bad enough,

531
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,916
the Right Seat of
God enters the fray.

532
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,666
Next time, "The Researcher."

533
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,708
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
