but do you know how

345
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,166
he was actually killed, Kami?

346
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,958
[KAMIJO] You mean it
wasn't... the crucifixion?

347
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,625
He was speared
to death by a Roman.

348
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO] The Stab
Sword distills the religious

349
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,041
significance of the crucifixion
and spearing and amplifies,

350
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,500
condenses, and focuses it
to an extreme degree of power.

351
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
It would have
little effect on

352
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,458
a normal, everyday person.

353
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,083
But for a saint,
things are different.

354
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,208
A single strike from
it, and she's dead.

355
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,250
Obviously, it's
no ordinary weapon.

356
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,541
What are the
magicians planning for

357
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,000
to need something like that.

Stocking up their
arsenal for a war.

359
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,458
In the magical world,
saints are basically living,

360
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,291
breathing tactical weapons.

361
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,666
Yeah, okay. But there are
still plenty of magicians

362
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,458
who aren't
saints though, right?

363
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
I get the feeling you
guys could hold your own

364
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,750
even without Kanzaki.

365
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,916
[TSUCHIMIKADO] That isn't
the real issue here, though.

366
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
Huh?

367
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,458
[TSUCHIMIKADO] It's not about
which side will actually win.

368
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,666
It's about the illusion of
one side having the advantage.

369
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,166
That's when wars
are likely to break out.

370
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,708
[KAMIJO] But, if the
problem is this serious,

371
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,375

Unfortunately, we can't use

[KAMIJO] But why?

378
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,708
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Because outside magicians

379
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,291

their search on her,

380
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,750
thinking that if
anything is happening,

381
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,541
she must be at
the center of it.

382
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,208
If she so much
as lifts a finger,

383
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,083
she'll be swarmed
by magicians.

384
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,208
They'll descend on her like a
plague of malnourished locusts.

385
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,458
Basically, we have
to do everything we can

386
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,541
to keep her from
noticing what's happening.

387
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,166
Great, because that
shouldn't be difficult at all.

517
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,791
You know that oh-so-helpful
spell you used on me?

518
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,333
Well, it appears that
it's no longer working.

519
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,500
[LIDVIA] Why? What happened?

520
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,916
I'm not sure,
but you know...

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,958
I'm feeling sort of naked now.

522
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,625
[LIDVIA] I'm not interested
in your lewd observations.

523
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,916
What will you do?

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,416
Give me a sec.
Before I do anything else,

525
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,791
I'll need to find
a way to give this boy

526
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
who's following me the slip.

527
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:36,000
♪ [Ending Song] ♪

528
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,041
[KAMIJO] A game of cat and
mouse, but which one is which?

529
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,250
Catching Oriana is so
important that Stiyl is

530
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,583
willing to risk his life.
But will we succeed?

531
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,541
Next time, "Route Disturb."

532
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,791
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
