179
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,583
Um, okay.

180
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
If it's not too much
trouble, I would be grateful

181
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,666
if you would personally
place it around my neck.

182
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,958
Yeah. I suppose I could.

183
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:06,166
[shaky breathing]

184
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,041
What is it? Is
something the matter?

185
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,208
No! Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

186
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,958
[KAMIJO breathing heavily]

187
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,541
So what's your story, anyway?

188
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,583
From what I've
heard, you know how

189
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,375
to read "The Book of the Law."

190
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,791
Oh. It's not so much
that I can "read" it.

191
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,916
Rather, I can decipher
its cryptography--

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,208
[gasps]

193
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, no, sorry! I was
really just wondering why

194
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,791
you would want to be involved
with a book like that at all.

195
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,708
[KAMIJO] I hear it's
actually pretty dangerous.

196
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,833
It began as a desire
for power. As much as

197
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,958
I'd like to, that is something
about my motives I cannot deny.

198
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,875
But the power of a
grimoire is tainted.

199
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,833
It is something that can never
bring happiness to anybody.

200
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,791
It causes only conflict.

201
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,000
[ORSOLA] In its wake is a
trail of destruction and death.

202
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,458
Why did I learn
how to decode it?

203
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,333
Because by investigating
its inner workings,

204
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,625
I hoped I would find a
way to destroy the grimoire.

205
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,208
[distant rumble]

206
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,250
[KAMIJO] Stiyl!

207
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,416
[STIYL groan]

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,791
Wha-What are you doing?

209
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
[STIYL] Hurry and get out--

210
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,625
[MAN chuckles]

211
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,750
Why are you lounging
around in the dirt?

212
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,541
Is that just how you
English Puritans fight?

213
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,666
Well, come on.
Get back up on your feet,

214
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,666
and let's see what
you're capable of. Do it now.

215
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,291
Nobody denies Saiji
Tatemiya of the Amakusa.

216
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,583
[TATEMIYA] A nice try but
not especially impressive.

217
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,791
You can't even defend
one small girl, huh?

218
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,625
[gasps]

219
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,291
Hey, Stiyl, you want to
tell me what's going on here?

220
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,583
It appears that
you know more than I do.

221
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,708
Looks as if you've managed
to take custody of Orsola,

222
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,916
and, like always,
it's difficult to judge

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,125
whether your luck is
a blessing or a curse.

224
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,250
[TATEMIYA] I've told you this
over and over again, Orsola.

225
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,958
Why won't you
hear what I'm saying?

226
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,250
We are not the enemy.

227
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,375
We do not intend to
harm a hair on your head.

228
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,875
I hear you. I understand
what you've told me

229
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,000
so many times now, and I
think you may even believe it.

230
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,625
[ORSOLA] Unfortunately.
I have a hard time believing

231
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,333
that a man's
intentions are peaceful

232
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,458
when he is
brandishing a weapon.

233
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,166
Well, that's a real shame.

234
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,833
I guess you'll have
to run back into the arms

235
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,333
of Mother Church
then, won't you?

236
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,333
What? An unarmed kid now?

237
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,000
[TATEMIYA] That looks
like Uragami's sword.

238
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,041
Did you take it from her?

239
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,791
You mean the girl who
attacked me, she's over there.

240
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,208
[KAMIJO] Don't worry. She's
not dead. Only unconscious.

241
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,958
Still breathing or not,
you harmed one of my people.

242
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,333
I want her returned safely!

243
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,708
[KAMIJO] You must
not be too bad a guy.

244
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,208
not if you care so much about
one of your subordinates.

245
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,000
Why don't you
put your sword away?

246
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,541
It'll be for the best.

247
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,583
I'd rather not fight somebody
who I could maybe respect.

248
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,958
[TATEMIYA] Trust me,
I'm not excited about

249
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,458
having to fight you either.

250
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,333
After all, our true enemy
is the Roman Orthodox Church.

251
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
but since it appears that
you are in league with them,

252
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,083
I guess I'll have
to take on all of

253
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,833
the English Puritans, as well.

254
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,583
You won't find it
easy, but you can try.

255
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,250
You've got attitude
and confidence.

256
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,791
Under different conditions,
maybe we'd be friends.

257
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,250
Unfortunately, today, I'm
going to have to fight you.

258
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,541
[TATEMIYA] This will
be your last day to live.

259
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,625
[grunts]

260
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,541
Ahhh!

261
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,958
[KAMIJO] How did he--?

262
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,291
Ha!

263
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,083
Magic, is it? Okay.

264
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,041
No, Toma! Don't
charge him like that!

265
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,500
[INDEX] It isn't just magic!

266
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,750
Index! Get back, now!

267
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,583
Oh, primordial flame.
Bestower of light.

268
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,625
Lend me the strength
of your blade.

269
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,375
With its power to
protect and give judgment.

270
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,291
[KAMIJO] He did it again?
That has to be magic!

271
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,250
[groans]

272
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,541
[INDEX] Toma!

273
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Do it now!

274
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,500
We can take him
together! Let's go!

275
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:34,916
Heh.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,291
[grunts]

277
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,375
[TATEMIYA] This
shouldn't be difficult.

278
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,375
My basic protections
are all in place.

279
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,916
I need only be wary
of the flame sword.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,583
Now, to compose
my counterattack.

281
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,375
[grunts]

282
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
Ahhh!

283
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,833
[grunts]

284
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:21,791
[quiet chatter]

285
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,250
[exhales]

286
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,416
That was a close
one! Are you okay?

287
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,041
Does anything hurt?
Are you injured anywhere?

288
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,166
No. Not really.

289
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,083
You're sure? Absolutely
no injuries at all?

290
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,958
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean
it. Nothing's wrong!

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,708
Okay, that's good to hear.

292
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,791
[INDEX] Know why?

293
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,875
Uh...?

294
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,333
Because now I can
chomp on your head

295
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,666
as punishment
for your stupidity.

296
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,583
[KAMIJO screams]

297
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,000
[KAMIJO] Okay, okay, geez!
This isn't necessary!

298
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,166
I admit that I was wrong.

299
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,625
I should've listened
to you, all right!

300
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,541
I know that now!
Please just get off of me!

301
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,791
Fine, I'm done.

302
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,500
You're still an idiot,
though. Reckless, too.

303
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,625
Yes. I know.
But, Index, I'm... uh...

304
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,666
Sure is quiet, huh?

305
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,833
I mean, it's hard to believe
how crazy things were

306
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,291
just a little
while ago, isn't it?

307
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,375
You're right. It is.

308
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,791
[TATEMIYA] Hey.

309
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,541
I hate to interrupt
but could you please

310
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,083
take these things off?
I can't leave Orsola

311
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,666
undefended like this.
I have to do something!

312
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,041
Huh? You want
to defend her?

313
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,166
Oh, you don't
know, do you?

314
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,958
You really don't have
any idea what they're

315
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,791
going to do to her once they've
got her in their clutches?

316
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,666
Uh?

317
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,125
No. Don't
listen to him, Toma.

318
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,416
He's trying
to confuse you.

319
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,541
This is a man who
uses words as weapons.

320
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,041
She's gonna die,
do you hear me?

321
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,666
They're gonna kill her!

322
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,375
[TATEMIYA] Listen to me.
You must not hand her over

323
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,708
to the Catholic nuns
who came with you tonight.

324
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,416
The Roman Orthodox Church wants
to see her captured and killed.

325
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,791
You and your people were
the ones who kidnapped her

326
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,125
along with stealing
"The Book of the Law."

327
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,500
Wrong and wrong again.

328
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,875
The Amakusa didn't steal
"The Book of the Law."

329
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,208
[KAMIJO] What?

330
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,208
[TATEMIYA] You have heard
the consequences, right?

331
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,500
The day that the book's
power is used will be the day

332
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,000
that the church of
the cross comes to an end.

333
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,541
Think about
it for a moment.

334
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,041
The members of the Amakusa
Church go to great pains

335
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,291
to remain hidden. So why,
then, would we want to

336
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,750
exploit such a
conspicuous power?

337
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,250
[TATEMIYA] The Roman Catholics,
on the other hand,

338
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,958
would have no such qualms.

339
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,041
And as the largest sect
of the church of the cross,

340
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,291
they have an obvious
incentive to make sure

341
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,791
the Book is never used.

342
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,791
Church authorities
have given secret orders

343
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,916
to have Orsola
Aquinas eliminated.

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,625
She found out about these
orders and she sought out

345
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,375
the Amakusa to ask for
our help and protection.

346
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,208
Do you get it yet? The theft of
"The Book of the Law" is just

347
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,333
a fiction that the Roman
Orthodox Church has fed you.

348
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,791
