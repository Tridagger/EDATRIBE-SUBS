1
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,041
[ACCELERATOR] I'm down to
sixty seconds of control time.


2
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,291
But as long as I kill
this guy, it'll all be over.

3
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,958
Redemption is always going
to be out of my reach.

4
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,375
And if I'm going to
be stuck in darkness

5
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,708
then I might as well take
this guy to hell with me!

6
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:21,750
[laughs]

7
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,208
[grunts]

8
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,041
[AMATA] Why are
you even fighting?

9
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,541
Haven't you figured it out yet?

10
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,208
You'll never get the best of me!

11
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,250
Having an off day, huh?

12
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,500
Aren't you motivated?

13
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,625
I thought you came
to save the girl.

14
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,583
Go to hell.

15
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,125
Do I have it wrong?

16
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,916
Maybe you came 'cause
fighting me will make you

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,125
seem like the hero
you're never gonna be.

18
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,958
[AMATA] Here you are, standing
in the face of a powerful evil

19
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,666
dashing in to rescue a helpless
girl from an uncertain fate.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,166
Do you really think that's
going to make up for all

21
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,791
the horrible things you've done
during your miserable life?

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,375
[AMATA laughs]

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,666
You'll never be more
than what you are now.

24
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,291
[ACCELERATOR] Shut up, damn you.
I already know that.

25
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,125
I know there are some
debts I can never repay.

26
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,541
A hero's trophy isn't
what I came here for.

27
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,083
You and I are
going to hell.

28
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,166
There's no question about that.

29
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,000
But don't even
think about dragging

30
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,666
the kid down with us!

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,250
You dirty, twisted bastard!

32
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,750
[beep]

33
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,375
[ACCELERATOR] Uh.

34
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:33,958
[laughs]

35
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
Ha!

36
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,291
[KAMIJO grunts]

37
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,750
Ah!

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,416
[coughing]

39
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,250
I have to say, you're really
starting to annoy me.

40
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,250
[VENTO] Swinging around
that right hand of yours.

41
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,541
Protecting that despicable
thing over there.

42
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,375
How much longer do we
have to play this game

43
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,125
before you admit defeat?

44
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm really sick of
listening to you.

45
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,000
[KAMIJO] So set in your
beliefs, you think anyone who

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,916
doesn't agree with you is wrong.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,666
Why can't you accept that
there are people out there

48
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,541
who may see the world
differently than you do?

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,791
[VENTO] Science is something
I'll never accept!

50
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,875
I detest science!

51
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,291
[KAMIJO yells]

52
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,750
[VENTO] Science and scientists
have never brought me

53
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,500
anything but grief.

54
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,083
[KAMIJO grunts]

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,791
Science is the reason that
my brother isn't here anymore.

56
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,875
Science let him die!

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
[KAMIJO grunts]

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,125
[KAMIJO] Oh no!

59
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,583
Hey!

60
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,375
Kazakiri!

61
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,916
This is the kind of
mess scientists make,

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,416
and you're proud of
being on their side?

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,625
How can you not find
everything they do disgusting?

64
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,791
[AMATA] Ha! When your battery
dies, you're useless,

65
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,541
just a broken toy that can't
move on its own anymore.

66
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,791
[thud]

67
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,250
Huh?

68
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,708
[wheezes]

69
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
[distorted]
It's almost hard to believe.

70
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,125
You managed to fight off
quite a few of my guys earlier

71
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,083
[AMATA distrorted] and yet here
you are seemingly helpless.

72
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,541
[gasps]

73
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,083
[KAMIJO] How could you?

74
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,250
[VENTO laughs]

75
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,708
Hm?

76
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,791
What's going... on?

77
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,916
[grunts]

78
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,500
[KAMIJO] Kazakiri...

79
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:37,250
Damn. You little hypocrite!
What are you trying to pull?

80
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,791
[laughs]

81
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,208
I can't help but laugh.

82
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,166
Just about every day
I'm alive, I curse my luck.

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,708
But compare it to
something like this,

84
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,041
and I'm pretty
damn lucky. Right?

85
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,958
Uh, you lost me there.

86
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,333
What are you even
talking about, freak?

87
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,916
Hang in there, okay?
You'll be fine. I promise.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,958
Index is gonna figure out
a way to put a stop to this.

89
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,791
[KAMIJO] You know
you can count on her.

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
Because she's your friend.

91
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,458
She's going to come
through for you.

92
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,791
So just hold on.

93
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,291
In the meantime, I'm here.
You'll be safe with me.

94
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,708
[KAMIJO] I won't
let her hurt you!

95
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,083
[ACCELERATOR wheezes]

96
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,625
Tch. Enough! This ends now!

97
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,833
Say goodbye, you gimpy bastard!

98
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,291
[AMATA] Aw, damn!

99
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,250
[AMATA screams]

100
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,041
[chuckles]

101
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,541
[AMATA] Ahhh! You've
lost it! You're crazy!

102
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,500
[chuckles]

103
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
[AMATA grunts]

104
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
[wheezes]

105
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,500
[grunts]

106
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,875
Stay the hell
away from me! Uh!

107
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,208
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

108
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,250
[AMATA] Damn it! Let me go!

109
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,666
[AMATA] Crap! I forgot.

110
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,250
If he can't use his ability,
I'm screwed too.

111
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,708
My countermeasure won't
work against him anymore.

112
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,541
Damn it. He's willing to fight
to the death at this point,

113
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,375
but maybe if I can rob
that death of meaning.

114
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,708
And how the hell am
I supposed to do that?

115
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,041
[AMATA chuckles]

116
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,833
[chuckles]

117
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,583
Take a look. It's the
original script of the virus

118
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,000
[AMATA] that was input
into the girl's brain.

119
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,458
You need this.

120
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,000
Without it, there's no way
you'll be able to save her.

121
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,750
[grunts]

122
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,833
[laughs]

123
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,166
[AMATA] And now it's
gone! I destroyed it!

124
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,083
She's as good as dead!

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,375
With one squeeze of my hand,
I took away the only thing

126
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,916
in the world that
mattered to you.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,250
You hear that? It's over now!

128
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,750
[AMATA] No reason for you
to bother fighting anymore!

129
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,041
Oh, yeah. This is gonna
be the end for you.

130
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,750
[AMATA] You might want to start
preparing your last words.

131
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,875
Or praying that you'll somehow
avoid ending up in hell.

132
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,166
[chuckles]

133
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,166
Huh?

134
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
[footsteps]

135
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,291
Whew!

136
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
[INDEX] There she is!

137
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,125
[yells]

138
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,083
[yells]

139
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,708
[VENTO] Uhhh!

140
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,250
[KAMIJO] I've got it! When I
moved to grab the hammer

141
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,791
with my right hand,
she made sure I missed.

142
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:03,166
Which means, I can cancel
the thing out. Alright.

143
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,166
I guess fighting you
up close and personal

144
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,541
isn't gonna gain
me any advantage.

145
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
It's kinda nice having
an angel on my side.

146
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,125
It makes a guy feel
pretty invincible.

147
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,916
[VENTO] Ha! The way you're
going on, you almost make it

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,750
sound like that
monster is helping you!

149
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,791
[KAMIJO] It's more than that.
Kazakiri is really helping me!

150
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,250
[VENTO] Yeah, right!

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,458
Pathetic! Is that
the best you can do?

152
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,750
[VENTO] I am with the Right Seat
of God! Do not underestimate me!

153
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,250
[VENTO yells]

154
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,708
[gasps]

155
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't see!

156
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,083
[grunts]

157
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,291
[VENTO coughs]

158
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,666
[groans]

159
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,666
Vento!

160
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,000
Heh, heh. Why waste your
energy pretending to be

161
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,875
concerned about me?
You've made it clear your

162
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,208
[VENTO] allegiance is
to the side of science.

163
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,791
Something else happened with
the appearance of the angel.

164
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,875
An anti-magic defense
was activated

165
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,000
in this entire
region of the city.

166
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,541
[VENTO] Quite effective.

167
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,916
It's causing what you might call
a magic circulatory failure.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,750
That Aleister has some dirty
tricks up his sleeve, all right.

169
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,958
[KAMIJO] So just give up!
Why do you keep fighting

170
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,375
if it's only going to kill you?

171
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,708
[VENTO] You obviously
don't understand

172
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,916
anything, science boy!

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
[KAMIJO] Crap.
I couldn't dodge that.

174
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,958
[clang]

175
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,416
[VENTO pained breathing]

176
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,291
[KAMIJO] Ha! It looks
like you're the one

177
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,666
who needs to be rescued.

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,000
Sorry, I'm actually a
little busy right now.

179
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,125
But I'll make sure someone comes
to take you to the hospital.

180
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,375
Don't you dare!
I have no desire to be

181
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,416
in the hands of
science ever again.

182
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,000
[VENTO] I've detested
science ever since

183
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,375
it killed my younger brother!

184
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,125
Huh?

185
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,583
[VENTO] It happened one day when
we were at an amusement park.

186
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,166
There was a glitch in
one of the attractions.

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,541
Riding it had no risks.

188
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,750
It was scientifically
proven to be sound.

189
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,250
It had multiple layers
of safeguards and

190
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,958
a fully-automated
speed control program.

191
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,708
We were scared, but
they made it sound like

192
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,875
the safest ride in the world.
Well, they were wrong!

193
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,666
[VENTO] They didn't
know anything!

194
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,250
Wait, you mean...?

195
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,833
[VENTO] At the hospital, it was
just one screw up after another.

196
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,458
They only had enough blood
to do one transfusion.

197
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,750
Which meant there
would be no way

198
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,833
for the doctors to save us both.

199
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,958
And do you know what
my little brother did?

200
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,625
He told the doctor,
"Please save my sister."

201
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,083
There you have it. That's
why I'm here and he's gone.

202
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,666
You look so surprised.
You don't think a member of

203
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,541
the Right Seat of God
should be fighting

204
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,291
for a reason like revenge?

205
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,458
[VENTO] Don't you see?
That's how much I hate science.

206
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,833
I'm willing to do
anything to bring

207
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,666
its practitioners
to their knees.

208
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
Science not only
blinds its followers

209
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,208
to that which is right,

210
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,583
it also tries to coerce the
faithful into doing wrong.

211
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,666
It takes what is pure and
overwrites it with blasphemy.

212
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,791
[VENTO] Don't you get it? That
is the very essence of science!

213
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,625
It defiles all it touches!
And that is why I'll fight

214
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,750
against it even with
my dying breath!

215
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,958
Your science is soulless.
Devoid of all spirituality.

216
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,291
Those who I fight beside
seek to replace it with

217
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,875
laws that can warm the
heart and bolster faith.

218
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,291
That's my duty! I owe
it to the world for

219
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,541
[VENTO] having ended
my brother's future!

220
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,041
[KAMIJO]
You've got to be kidding.

221
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,791
What?

222
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,083
[KAMIJO] It wasn't science
that killed your brother.

223
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,958
You can't actually
believe that the doctors

224
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,000
in the hospital
wanted him to die.

225
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,916
If there had been any
possibility of saving

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,625
both of you, they would have.

227
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,208
[KAMIJO] And the park attraction
where you guys got hurt?

228
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,166
It's not like their goal
was to harm children.

229
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,791
Exactly the opposite, in fact.

230
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,208
Shut the hell up!

231
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,166
[KAMIJO] Your brother
knew the situation, right?

232
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,250
The doctors explained
that one of you would die.

233
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:48,083
But he deliberately chose to
sacrifice himself and save you.

234
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,625
Think about him for a second.

235
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,000
Would somebody like that
want you wasting your life

236
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,083
trying to get
revenge on science?

237
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,458
[KAMIJO] My guess is,
more than anything,

238
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,791
he'd want you to be happy!

239
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,416
I told you once
already, shut up!

240
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,666
Why'd they let him
throw his life away?

241
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,666
They were adults, and he was
a child on the verge of death!

242
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,333
If there was only
enough blood for one,

243
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,333
they should have given
it to him, instead.

244
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,291
As far as I'm concerned,
they could have used

245
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875
[VENTO] my blood as
well if they needed to!

246
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,125
His life wasn't wasted.

247
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,625
[gasps]

248
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,083
[KAMIJO] He had the facts,
and he made a decision.

249
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,208
And it's because of that
decision that you're alive now.

250
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,666
You think that
doesn't have value?

251
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,916
I think you understand
the real value more than

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,666
anyone else ever could.

253
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,500
You know nothing! What do
your reassurances mean to me?

254
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,541
He was my brother and
I stole his future!

255
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,500
If somebody else was
in your situation,

256
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,666
would you tell them
the same thing?

257
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,666
Ah!

258
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,083
[KAMIJO]
You wouldn't, would you?

259
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,125
So stop saying it to yourself.

260
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,041
The life you're leading
is both pointless and wrong.

261
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,541
[KAMIJO] Your brother
made a choice.

262
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,000
His decision was incredibly
selfless and courageous.

263
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,208
Do you really want
to disgrace that?

264
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,291
Are you gonna spend the
precious time he's given you

265
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,833
being consumed by your anger
and hatred toward science?

266
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,333
Ha! Don't waste your breath.
I chose my path a long time ago.

267
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,583
And what are you?

268
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,583
A faithless idiot who
knows nothing about me.

269
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,541
You can twist my words
however you want,

270
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,666
it won't change what I must do.

[KAMIJO] Are you ready, Vento?

281
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,708
Compared to the sacrifice
your brother made,

282
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,958
this is nothing, but at least
it should help you a little.

283

This is your chance

What can you tell me about

that utilizes brainwaves?

308
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,625
Huh? Let me think. I guess
there is a possibility that

309
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,833
electricity-generating espers
could use identical brainwaves

310

Okay. Then let me ask

There's an AIM diffusion field

00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,041
By restricting her mind,
they're just twisting that power

to create the "angel." In which
case, that should mean...

Yes, that's it!

322

00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,750
considerate for once,
Accelerator.

348
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,875
I've been hoping for the
opportunity to punish you

349
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,583
for a long time. I'll enjoy
teaching you a lesson

350
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,500
with my fists
before killing you!

351
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,666
[yells]

352
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,708
[yells]

353
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,791
[AMATA] It takes more
than that to hurt me!

354
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,958
I'm having a good time,
how about you? Ha-ha!

355
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,083
What d'you say we shake things
up a bit, keep 'em interesting.

356
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,666
[AMATA] You're ready for
anything I throw at you, right?

357
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:49,208
[laughing]

358
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,208
Huh?

359
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,416
[AMATA] What's going on? You
shouldn't be this strong.

360
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,125
Why are there wings
growing out of your back?

361
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,083
[AMATA] You experimental freak!

362
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,583
Where is this sudden
strength coming from?

363
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,083
It seems that you've acquired
a new clearance. But how?

364
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,708
What value did you enter in
for your Personal Reality?

365
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,125
[AMATA] Wait!
This strange new power,

366
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,416
is it of the angel variety?

367
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,666
You monster. Do you even
realize what's behind you?

368
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,541
Kill, kill, kill, kill.
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

369
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,416
[AMATA grunts]

370
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,625
Kazakiri?

371
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,083
Hold on, I'm co--

372
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't touch her.
So what am I supposed to do?

373
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,833
I don't want to hurt the real
her along with the illusion.

374
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,333
[distant explosion]

375
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,166
[grunts]

376
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,750
[KAMIJO] Who are you?

377
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,000
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt,

378
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,500
but I have business
with this girl.

379
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,833
[KAMIJO] I asked you
who you are!

380
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,375
[MAN] I am Acqua of the Rear.
Like Vento of the Front.

381
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,291
I am a member of
the Right Seat of God.

382
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,000
[ACQUA] Hmph. I won't
interfere with you further.

383
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,458
This is the only business
that I have to conduct here.

384
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,291
[KAMIJO] Let her go!

385
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,666
Hm. Unfortunately, I don't
see that as an option.

386
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,125
If I left her here to be
captured by the side of science,

387
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,375
she would no doubt be executed.

388
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,916
[ACQUA] You can have
that if you wish.

389
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,500
It's been thoroughly
destroyed by your right hand.

390
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,958
It is nothing but junk now.

391
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,583
Vento can no longer
use Divine Retribution.

392
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,875
The people she neutralized

393
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,291
should soon make
complete recoveries.

394
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,791
Do not worry. You can
rest easy, knowing that

395
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,291
you have protected Academy
City from further harm.

396
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,416
You expect me
to accept that?

397
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,041
You would be well served
to watch your tone.

398
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,375
[ACQUA] I think you
should know I am a saint.

399
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,208
Do not seek a fight with me.

400
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,541
It will only shorten your life.

401
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,750
Hey, get back here!

402
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,791
[explosion]

403
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,000
[KAMIJO] One battle
has come to an end.

404
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,333
But the footsteps of another
greater battle can be heard

405
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,375
closing in on the city.
Is war approaching?

406
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,958
Next time, "Prewar."

407
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,541
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
