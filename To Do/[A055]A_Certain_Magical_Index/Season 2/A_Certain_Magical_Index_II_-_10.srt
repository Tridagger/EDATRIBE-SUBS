We're about to meet up with
my mom and dad for lunch.

just a little longer...

Then what is
bothering you?

358
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,625
You know why I changed clothes?

359
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,041
It was so I could stand in the
bleachers and cheer for you!

360
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
I was there, so why did I
have nobody to cheer for?!

361
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,750
Oh... about that... I was...

362
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,208
I worked so hard trying
to be close to you today,

363
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,375

What else should I have tried?

367

Oh, I'm sorry... Um...

368

were cranky because

wrong, you jerk!

I'm angry because you
never pay attention to me!

372
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,000
I certainly never get
cranky due to hunger!

373

I didn't mean to make
you mad, I promise!

Don't you usually
prefer to bite me?

Um... what I mean is...

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,750
You're acting a
little different today...

378
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,541
How could you say that?

379
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,541
[KAMIJO] Wha--?!
Wait...! I didn't mean it

380
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,666
in the way you think.
It wasn't an insult...

381
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,000
You do literally bite
me a lot, you know...

Come on, dear...

You don't know
anything!

408
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,958
Oh, lunch...?
No, we haven't.

In that case,
you're more than welcome

00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,083
to join us if
you would like...

the perfect place!

Really? You
wouldn't mind company?

00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,750
Sounds great. We'd love to!

Sorry, are
you all right?

Oh! I'm sorry... I hope
you can forgive me.

418
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,541
I'm not accustomed to
being around so many people.

were able to find this place.

Well... I admit, we
did have a little help

432
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,833
from our new friends.

433
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,500
[MISUZU] Hi, I'm Misaka.

434
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,625

It's nice to meet you...

435
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,625
and thanks a lot
for helping my folks.

436

Oh man... I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse!

437
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,458
[MIKOTO] Hey, what's
your problem, huh...?

438
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,250
We've known each other
a while now, right?

439
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,708
And after all this
time, you've still never

440
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,916
bothered to call me?

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,625
Oh, well... I
figured we'd naturally

442
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,000
end up stuck like this.

443
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,791
We're not "stuck"
like anything!

444
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,291
And "natural" is
the last word I'd use

445

something involving you!

You know, while we're at it,

there's another thing
I'd like you to explain...

448
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,416
Who's this girl
who's always with you,

449
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,916
and where
does she live?

450

Who is she?
Well, uh...

She's got a
point there, Toma...

be nice to know

Don't deny it! I saw you!
