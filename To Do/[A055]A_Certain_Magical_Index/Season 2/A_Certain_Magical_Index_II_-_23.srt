00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,625
[KAMIJO grunts]

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,041
[KAMIJO] Kazakiri!

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,250
Uh, Kazakiri!
Please wake up!

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,041
[KAZAKIRI whimpers]

5
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,916
[KAMIJO] Ah, thank goodness.

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,250
You had me worried...
Are you feeling okay?

7
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,625
[KAZAKIRI] The city...
Look at it!

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,458
[KAZAKIRI] The destruction...

9
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,375
How did things
end up like this...?

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,708
I know it must be
all because of me...

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,791
And yet here I am: apparently
the only one left untouched.

12
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,416
No matter what, I'll never
be like everybody else...

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,916
So why did I even have to
be born in the first place?

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,250
The power of the espers
changed things a little...

15
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,666
I was able to exist,
even if it was as a freak...

16
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
And then that girl came along...

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,208
She was kind enough
to call me her friend...

18
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,000
I thought maybe that made me at
least a little bit more human...

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,041
I'm so tired of this!

20
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,250
Will you please
just touch me

21
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,375
and put an end to all of it?

22
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,541
[KAZAKIRI gasps]

23
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,708
[KAZAKIRI] What is it?

24
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,083
Why are you smiling at me?

25
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,958
Because I'm
relieved you're okay.

26
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,083
[KAZAKIRI gasps]

27
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,083
I don't know why I have
this strange power

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,583
or where it
comes from. However...

29
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,833
If it meant obliterating one
of my friends with this hand...

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,458
I would chop it off...

31
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,791
That would be better than
losing someone I care about.

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,291
[KAZAKIRI] But... I...

33
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,375
You protected the others,
didn't you...?

34
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,583
You did what you could
to keep everyone safe.

35
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Can't you see, when
all is said and done,

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,541
that's what counts?

37
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,166
You can be proud.
Hold your head up high...

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,458
After fighting so hard for the
sake of complete strangers...

39
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,625
and managing to pull
everyone through...

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,625
You have absolutely
nothing to be ashamed of.

41
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,541
[KAZAKIRI sobs]

42
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,041
[KAMIJO] I'm going to look
around and see if there's anyone

43
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,208
out there who needs help.
And then, let's head home.

44
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,500
There's no telling when
you're going to vanish on us.

45
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,583
Before that happens,
you need to meet up with Index.

46
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,916
And don't go asking me why,
okay, I think it should be

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,333
pretty obvious by now.

48
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,458
It's because that's
what friends do.

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,750
Hey...! That was
crazy! You okay?

50
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,208
What was that stuff that
came out of your back...?

51
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,208
It looked a lot like telesma.

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,708
[MIKOTO] Hello...! Wanna tell
me what happened over there...?

53
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,416
Those freaky wings in the sky
seem to have disappeared...

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,875
I'm done here, so if you
need help, I can head your way.

55
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,791
[INDEX] I need to get a doctor
here as soon as possible!

56
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,000
[MIKOTO] Hey, hold on!

57
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,250
[departing footsteps]

58
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,250
[ACCELERATOR sighs]

59
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,000
[SHADOWY MAN] Accelerator...
I would like a word with you...

60
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Do you think you can manage?

61
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,333
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh? That was telepathy...

62
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,458
and I have a small amount
of computing power back, too.

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,791
[SHADOWY MAN] How observant...

64
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,500
I made arrangements for
several telepathic espers.

65
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,458
[ACCELERATOR] Whatever.
What do you want?

66
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,291
[SHADOWY MAN] I would like to
talk to you about the series

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,791
of disturbances you caused,
as well as the damage

68
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,791
Academy City has suffered
as a result of recent events.

69
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,000
[ACCELERATOR] Is my punishment
to be sliced and diced

70
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,375
for research purposes?

71
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,541
[SHADOWY MAN] That is
one route we could take.

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
But how do you like
this idea, instead...?

73
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
Come and work with us.

74
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,791
[ACCELERATOR] Is Academy
City preparing for

75
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
a war or something?

76
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,000
[SHADOWY MAN]
I cannot answer that.

77
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,625
[ACCELERATOR] You can't, huh...?
Then there's only one thing

78
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,416
I'm gonna say...
Screw you and your offer.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,875
[SHADOWY MAN] This is a critical
moment in the life of the city.

80
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,916
We want to ensure
the best outcome possible,

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,125
and for that, we would
like your assistance...

82
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,041
Imagine if Academy City
was completely wiped out...

83
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,250
Is there any other place
for espers like us to go...?

84
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,916
What would we do without
this scientific haven?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,875
[ACCELERATOR] Tch...
Will you tell me one thing?

86
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,041
[SHADOWY MAN] What is that?

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:49,916
[ACCELERATOR]
The name of the person

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,541
responsible for tonight...

89
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,125
I'm going to kill
whoever thought they could

90
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,916
get away with putting
the kid through this.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
[SHADOWY MAN] I don't
see how that could help...

92
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,000
He would be a scapegoat,
nothing more.

93
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,041
[ACCELERATOR] You don't say.

94
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,500
[SHADOWY MAN]
So... what will it be?

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,166
[ACCELERATOR] Suit yourself.

96
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
[SHADOWY MAN]
An excellent answer.

97
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,750
I look forward to
working with you...

98
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,333
Until then...

99
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,500
[gunshot]

100
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,208
[phone rings]

101
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,250
[phone beeps]

102
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,791
[ACQUA] That you, Terra?

103
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,208
[TERRA] Yes, Acqua of the Rear,
this is Terra of the Left...

104
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,125
Are you finished
with your current task?

105
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
[ACQUA] Vento is
out of commission...

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,166
I just recovered her and
ordered the detached squad

107
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,708
in Academy City's
outskirts to stand down.

108
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,666
[TERRA] That sounds
like a good night's work.

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,291
Can you tell me
our next move...?

110
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,291
I have no objections
to lopping off

111
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,041
the target's head if
it should be necessary.

112
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,083
[TERRA] Let's not
take that step yet...

113
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,166
It would be wiser at this point
to hear your entire report

114
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,000
and then reconsider
how best we can

115
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,666
bring about the
fall of Academy City.

116
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,083
[ACQUA] The fall of
Academy City? Heh.

117
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
[TERRA] You don't care
for that idea, Acqua?

118
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,166
Cheap tricks aren't my style...

119
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,416
I find that defeating
the enemy face-to-face

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,791
is the simpler and
more honorable method.

121
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,500
[TERRA] It's possible
some of the players on

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,583
the opposing side
may still be useful.

123
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,375
The fallen angel,
for example.

124
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,041
[ACQUA] I do not approve of
plundering the battlefield.

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,500
[TERRA] You knights pick
inconvenient times to get

126
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,625
prickly about your honor.

127
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,166
I am no knight...
You know quite well

128
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,333
I'm simply a
washed-up mercenary.

129
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,041
[TERRA] Call yourself
whatever you'd like,

130
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,208
it doesn't matter to me...

131
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
Just get Vento back
here immediately...

132
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,791
Those instructions
are courtesy of

133
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
Fiamma of the Right,
in case you were wondering.

134
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,375
Understood. I'm on it.

135
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,875
[phone beeps]

136
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,833
[ACQUA] Interesting... I wonder
if Academy City really is

137
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,916
as frail as you seem
to think, Terra...

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
I suppose we'll see, won't we?

139
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,333
[FROG DOCTOR]
Good morning, Aleister...

140
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
There's something I wish
to discuss with you,

141
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,791
and I hope you'll
take it seriously.

142
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,166
[ALEISTER] Yes, what is it?

143
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
[FROG DOCTOR] I want you
to stop treating my patients

144
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,333
like your playthings.

145
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,916
[ALEISTER] Hm... And if
I don't, what will you do?

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,625
[FROG DOCTOR] Those are my
patients and I am their doctor.

147
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,500
Do you understand the
importance of that...?

148
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,250
Do, you, Aleister?

149
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,666
I think you should,
considering that

150
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
I saved your life once.

151
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,583
[ALEISTER] Is that
something you regret?

152
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,208
That can't be a
serious question.

153
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,916
[ALEISTER] My plans
are in motion...

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,208
and I have no intention
of stopping them.

155
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,666
So, I am sorry...
my kind-hearted enemy...

156
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,583
but this is goodbye for us.

157
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,791
[bell rings]

158
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,958
[STUDENTS chattering]

159
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,083
[KAMIJO's stomach growls]

160
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,666
[KOMOE] Hey, stop!
You know better than that!

161
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,541
No running in the hallways!

162
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,416
[HIMEGAMI] Hello.

163
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,750
You look excited about
whatever you brought.

164
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,250
I'm guessing you've
probably got something

165
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,875
really tasty there, too.

166
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,041
I'm not sharing
my lunch for free.

167
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,333
If you want to try
some, we can trade.

168
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,958
Ya' know I've always
been impressed by how

169
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,791
you fix yourself such
great lunches every day.

170
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,041
Ah. Careful. Your broth is
leaking into your rice area.

171
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,708
Well... Actually,
I think the rice is better

172
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,416
when it's got some
broth on it like that.

173
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,708
Nice and soggy, huh?

174
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,541
No, it's not...! Here,
if you're going to doubt me,

175
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,666
give this a try!
Go on taste it!

176
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,875
Okay... I guess
it's not all that ba--

177
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,875
[KAMIJO] Uh...

00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,916
[HIMEGAMI grunts]

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,125
Uh... What's happening?
Are you okay?

[HIMEGAMI grunts]

181
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,500
You're saying... you want me
to rub your back, is that it?

182
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,750
[HIMEGAMI] Mm-Hm...

183
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,958
There you go...
Does that help?

[HIMEGAMI grunts]

185
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,500
[KAMIJO] Okay, should
I do it harder, then?

186
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,083

[HIMEGAMI gasps]

188
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:32,666
[KAMIJO] Huh?

[KAMIJO grunts]

190
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,208
[FUKIYOSE] What are
you doing down there?

191
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,166
[KAMIJO wearily]
Hi, Fukiyose.

192
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,333
Question... Why do you
eat that bread all the time?

193
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,875
It looks like it's
made of cardboard.

194
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,458
Whadaya' mean...?!
It looks just fine, thank you!

195
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,833
"Ability-boosting bread,
with twelve nutrients

196
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,833

up, and be the best you can be!"

[KAMIJO chuckles]

198
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,125
Well, would you like to
try some of my lunch?

199
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,750
Hmm... Just
so you know...

200
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,541
I'm wearing a bra that
hooks in the front today.

201
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
[BOY STUDENT 23A] Seriously?

202
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,625
[BOY STUDENT 23B] Yeah, and
they say we might not get to go

203
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,458
on field trips anymore
once they tighten security

204
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,958
in and out of the city.

205
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:18,916
[BOY STUDENT 23C]
I wonder if this'll affect

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,333
the Ichihanaran Festival.

207
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,750
Did you hear...? The teachers
are going to be so busy

208
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,541
making preparations we might
not have to take any midterms!

209
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,375
Isn't that great?

[FUKIYOSE]
Preparing for a war...

212
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,583
If it happens, it'll
change everything...

213
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,666
Know what I mean...?
Things'll get crazy around here.

214
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,291
Super early curfews. Maybe
even food rations, too...

215
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,583
Soon enough prices
everywhere will sky rocket.

218

[KAMIJO] Hm?

219
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,791
You're awfully quiet...
Are you daydreaming?

220
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,875
Oh... sorry...!
I heard what you said.

221
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,166
I was just thinking
maybe we should

222
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,333
have a nice meal now
while we still can.

223
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,541
You know, so we won't regret

224
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,791
not doing it later
on or anything...

225
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,916
Okay, I suppose
that we could...

You're going out for
dinner tonight, Kami?

great cheap restaurant!

00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,708
What's happening...?
When exactly did

236
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,958
the entire class decide to
go out for dinner tonight?

237
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,208
Is something wrong?

238
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,416
Yes!

It looks like she's
got her game face on!

240
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,791
Hey...! This party's
gonna need an organizer!

241
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,291
That's me, people,
so shut up and listen.

242

[YOMIKAWA] So, rumor has it
you've taken in another girl

243
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,291
in need of a home.
How's that going so far?

You know how I am!
I started to get really

246

lonely after Himegami
moved into the dorms...

247
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,916
Having Musujime around
really cheers me up!

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,166
How are things at your place?

249
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,083
It's looking like
I'm on my own again...

250
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,333
After the recent chaos,
my tenants decided

251
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,000
to move elsewhere.

[FUKIYOSE] It's decided!
Tonight, we are all officially

Ah! What are
they doing?!

I need to get these
wayward kids under control!

meaning of this, you hooligans?!

moment around here.

starting to pour in...

and more nervous about

the possibility of war
breaking out in Academy City...

for their kids to be

sent home before
things get ugly.

had gotten that serious yet.

what's wrong with you?

Could you possibly be
taking any longer to do that?

Huh?

Gaaaah!
I can't take it!

how it's done.

Have you taken a look at
the prices on the menu...?

They don't seem to have gone
up at all, war or no war.

[KAMIJO] Oh... thank you...

284
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,166
You know... just because
they haven't gone up

285
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,583
doesn't mean they won't.

286
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,125
I feel ya, man.

287
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,625
You're basically saying that
we should eat up while we can.

Don't mind if I do!

take all the meat!

[TSUCHIMIKADO] I know
what you're thinking...

300

That the war that's
about to break out

301
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,750
is because of you somehow...

302
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,333
But, you've got it wrong...

around you this entire time.

Well, maybe... yeah...

305
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,750
This war is happening
because the people

306

308
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,916
[KAMIJO] Yeah.

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
[TSUCHIMIKADO] It'll be
battle on a new scale...

From this point on...
getting through it

Yeah, I know what
you're saying...

313
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Really... it's a miracle
we've even made it this far...

pretty lucky.

been carrying me.

There've been too many
things I know nothing about...

all to other people...

anymore... Starting now...

nervous to learn about.

to pick one up before,

but you know how it goes...

330
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,583

but then there are

understand...

keep coddling me like that...

00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,458
Drill number
forty-two... Begin now.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,041
[FEMALE VOICE 23A]
Target ready...

344
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,458
Drill number
forty-three... Begin now.

345
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,916
[ACCELERATOR]
Did you want something?

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,041
Or were you just lurking?

347
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,208
Very impressive shooting.

348
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,833
I was trying to
be inconspicuous,

349
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,291
but clearly it didn't work.

350
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,083
It's okay... I still have
a lot to learn in that area.

351
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,750
Mitsuki Unabara, right...?

352
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,833
That's what they call you.

353
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,291
Yes, though the
name and the face

354
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,000
are both fakes, I'm afraid.

355
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,750
Have you decided
on a weapon yet?

356
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,708
[ACCELERATOR] None of them
feels quite right to me.

357
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
You could bring in guns
from all over the world,

358
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,666
and I still might not find one.

359
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,541
[UNABARA] What if you made
a list of gear compatible

360
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,750
with your ability?

361
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
That might help you
find the right weapon.

362
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,166
[ACCELERATOR] Stop acting
like such a know-it-all.

363
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,291
It's annoying. My problem is,
this thing is unreliable.

364
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,833
I've seen Group's engineering
report on that device...

365
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,416
They've extended your ability
usage time to thirty minutes.

366
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,416
That's a significant
improvement.

367
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,416
So... it's
called Group.

368
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you dissatisfied
with the tuning

369
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,250
of your electrode?

370
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,958
Ha...! The use time
could be thirty minutes

371
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,000
or three days...
Once a glitch comes up,

372
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,500
it's all over,
lights out...

373
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,916
A single malfunction means
that I can't fight anymore...

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and you don't survive
long like that.

375
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,416
Is that what you came
here to chat about?

376
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,208
Actually, I sought you
out because Group has

377
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,041
received an assignment
from the governing board

378
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,416
and its being given to you.

379
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,833
[footsteps]

380
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,916
[UNABARA] War is coming...
Academy City will soon be

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,250
pitting itself against
the Roman Orthodox Church.

382
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,000
Which means the city's
internal defenses

383
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,416
are being thinned out,

384
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,333
making us highly vulnerable
to attack from inside.

385
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,583
Our assignment is to
neutralize one group that

386
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,916
would seek to take advantage
of that vulnerability.

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,875
Heh. Man, I knew I was
being brought here so

388
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,375
I could fill in for that
useless bastard Kihara...

389
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,250
But I didn't realize
I'd be getting stuck with

390
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,333
jobs that were this
boring and trivial.

391
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,458
It matters very little
whether you like the job...

392
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,750
Besides, you came here on
your own. Nobody forced you.

393
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,458
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

394
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,708
Listen up, kid...

395
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,458
There's something
you really ought to know.

396
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,375
The human body is an
incredibly fragile thing.

397
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,416
Fragile enough that
a single touch from me

398
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,458
can do permanent damage.

399
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,041
So you might want to choose
your words more carefully.

400
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,541
Otherwise, I could
break something you

401
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,041
really don't want broken.

402
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,958
Yes, of course.

403
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,375
[ACCELERATOR] Tch.

404
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,875
[UNABARA] May I continue
briefing you on your assignment?

405
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,958
[ACCELERATOR]
Whatever. Go ahead.

406
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,125
[UNABARA] Your target
will be a group

407
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,750
that's known as Skill Out...

408
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,375
I'm not very
familiar with them.

409
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,666
Perhaps you
know more than I do.

410
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,875
Yeah, I know them...

411
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,125
They're an armed
gang made up of

412
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,333
a bunch of sad,
pathetic Level Zeros.

413
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,291
That's correct...
We're getting involved now

414
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,458
because it seems they've
found some new toys.

415
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
What kind of toys?

416
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
[UNABARA] They're rockets,
made of hollowed-out wood

417
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,791
that has been packed
with explosives...

418
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,458
If it helps you
form a mental picture,

419
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,458
think of them as
high-tech fire arrows.

420
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,041
Skill Out has been very busy
for the last few days...

421
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,041
getting ready to play with
their new toys, most likely.

422
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,750
They've been taking
abandoned bicycles

423
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,166
and placing them
along emergency routes.

424
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,041
And using piles of
garbage to block up

425
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,500
the sewage drains around
a few certain VIP facilities.

426
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,083
Not the kinds of things
that are considered

427
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,125
security problems
in and of themselves.

428
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,750
So this is what
Group does...?

429
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,208
Do they take on contracts to
stop children's pranks as well?

430
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,916
[UNABARA] As I was saying,
there have been more than

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,250
twenty thousand incidents.

432
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,166
That many will flood the
system, and before long,

433
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,375
the security network will start
classifying them as errors.

434
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,750
So, where do the fancy
fire arrows come in?

435
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,791
That number of erroneous
reports will cause

436
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,750
the server to crash,
and Skill Out will be able

437
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,666
to wreak havoc in the city
without Antiskill even knowing.

438
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,208
[ACCELERATOR] Can't they
just shut down the alerts

439
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,625
that will cause the errors?

440
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,375
[UNABARA] If we weren't
getting ready for a war, maybe.

441
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,750
[ACCELERATOR] Nothing but
enemies within and without...

442
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,583
Great. We're real popular
these days, huh...?

443
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,125
Is there anybody
out there who doesn't

444
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,000
have a beef with Academy City?

445
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,041
I couldn't say, but
right now your assignment is

446
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,041
to track down one of
the people who does.

447
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,916
Your target's name
is Ritoku Komaba.

448
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,583
This is what he looks like.

449
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,500
He is currently the
leader of Skill Out...

450
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,208
and he's the brains, too.
Dispose of him quickly...

451
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,125
Our goal is to derail
Skill Out's plans

452
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,458
before they can
proceed any further.

453
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,875
[ACCELERATOR] Any reason
we're taking a garbage truck?

454
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,791
[UNABARA] You'd be surprised
how handy they are...

455
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,583
It'll be great for
getting rid of the body.

456
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,250
A garbage truck
going around picking up

457
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,625
the bodies of scumbags...

458
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,166
Well, that's one way
to take out the trash.

459
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,166
[UNABARA] He will return for
recovery in twenty minutes,

460
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,833
as planned... Be careful.

461
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,166
[phone beeps]

462
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
[ACCELERATOR sighs]

463
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,166
So no matter how this goes down,

464
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,875
I'm stuck riding
in that thing...

465
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,541
Though whether it'll be
in the front or the back,

466
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,166
I don't know yet.

467
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,541
[ACCELERATOR] Hiding
from security robots...

468
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,125
And using little
tricks to escape

469
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,291
the gaze of
observation satellites.

470
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,250
Well, it's nothing
I'm not used to.

471
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,375
[phone buzzes]

472
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,333
[phone beeps]

473
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,166
That you, Tsuchimikado?

474
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] I figured
your first mission

475
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,833
would be starting soon...

476
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
I just wanted a quick
word before it did.

477
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,791
Let me guess:
a warning...? Yeah...?

478
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,666
Some advice for the
new guy...? What'll it be?

479
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Whatever
you do... don't trust us.

480
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,875
[ACCELERATOR] Huh?

481
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Group is an
organization that can only

482
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,208
function in the shadows.

483
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,208
If word of our
existence got out,

484
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,666
there would be trouble...

485
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,750
We have no inspiring
mission statement

486
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
and no noble or lofty goals.

487
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,375
[ACCELERATOR] Did you think
that I would be expecting

488
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,791
some kind of reward
for my service?

489
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] If you do
nothing but play by the rules

490
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,375
established by
the governing board,

491
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,541
you'll never get the
upper hand in this game...

492
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,958
I'm saying there's
one question

493
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,708
you should be asking yourself...

494
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,375
"What do I need to do to win?"

495
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,333
You and I have
something in common...

496
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,000
We both have things to protect.

497
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,208
Was there anything
else you wanted to say?

498
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Finish up
quickly and get back here...

499
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
Musujime's got
a job in that area

500
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
and she'll be getting
started pretty soon.

501
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,916
Another Group member?

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,041
[rumbling]

503
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,958
No one mentioned anything
about this being a contest.

504
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] The target she
was assigned isn't a person;

505
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,000
it's money.

506
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,375
[ACCELERATOR] Musujime, huh...?

507
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,583
I'm surprised she's
fit to take on a job.

508
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] You and
she are ranked the same...

509
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,791
She's been upgraded.

510
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,458
[ACCELERATOR] Oh, has she...?
That's great to hear.

511
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,958
[phone beeps]

512
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,625
What am I waiting for?

513
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,000
Might as well get
started on this job.

514
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,166
[beep]

515
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,708
[ACCELERATOR] It's cleanup time.

516
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,916
I should have this
wrapped up in ten minutes.

517
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,333
[clang]

518
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,208
[SKILL OUT yell]

519
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,625
[MUSUJIME chuckles]

520
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,583
That makes nine...

521
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,333
These guys could
stand to toughen up.

522
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,208
[KOMABA] If we're so weak,
then maybe you should

523
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,333
take it easier on us...
little esper girl.

524
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,708
[MUSUJIME] Heh.
Ritoku Komaba.

525
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,291
This could get sticky.

526
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,083
It looks like I accidentally
ran into the target first.

527
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,541
[KAMIJO] Members of Group
and Skill Out clash...

528
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,166
Misaka's mom gets caught
in the middle of the chaos...

529
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,166
and Accelerator
and I meet once again.

530
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,875
Next time, "Skill Out."

531
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,875
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
