1
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
Great... nosebleed.

2
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,750
There's a good reason
why I'm sleeping

3
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,875
in the bathroom every
night lately.

4
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,166
Ow!

5
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,958
Tissue...

6
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,541
My bed, where I
should be sleeping,

7
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,541
is currently occupied
by someone else:

8
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,416
my rather odd houseguest.

9
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,708
I miss my soft,
comfortable bed...

10
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,041
but mostly I try not to
think about it too much.

11
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,416
Toma...?

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,041
Oh, sorry...

13
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,708
Did I wake you up?

14
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,333
Yes, you did...

15
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,833
So, tell me...

16
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,083
what're you doing here, near
the bed where I'm sleeping,

17
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,666
instead of where
you're supposed to be?

18
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,541
What am I doing here?

19
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,708
Well, I just...
Had a nosebleed...

20
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,625
Wait...! Don't get
the wrong idea here.

21
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,000
Arousal only causes
nosebleeds in manga!

22
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,916
Toma!

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,666
I want you to swear
on our Father,

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,208
who art in Heaven...

25
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,958
Did you feel nothing when you
gazed upon my sleeping face?

26
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,666
Whoa, what are
you talking about?

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,958
You were just laying
there, sleeping.

28
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,291
Of course I didn't
feel anythi--

29
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,208
What do you mean, you
didn't feel anything? !

30
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,375
I may be a nun, but I'm
still a girl, you jerk!

31
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,041
I refuse to believe that
the sight of me in the bed

32
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,041
didn't affect you at
least a little bit.

33
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,750
-Just admit it!
-Yes, I admit it!

34
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,416
I solemnly swear that my heart
began to race when I saw you.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,958
There, are you happy now?

36
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,708
Oh, no. After your
earlier reaction,

37
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,166
you're going to have to
do a lot more than that

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,416
to convince me!

39
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,291
I feel like there's something
I might be forgetting....

40
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,375
There are only twenty-four hours
of summer vacation left...

41
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,083
The teachers always assign
homework over the break,

42
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,000
just to make sure you
can't actually relax.

43
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,500
And... I'm fairly certain...

44
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,583
I didn't do any of it.

45
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,083
Rotten luck.

46
00:02:52,916 --> 00:03:04,875
[Music]

47
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,083
The very last day of
summer vacation is here!

48
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,916
Misaka! Misaka!

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,250
You don't seem up to much.

50
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,208
Are you being lazy?

51
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,541
Yeah, of course...

52
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
I'm on summer vacation.

53
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,291
But you're studying
to be a maid.

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,000
Shouldn't you avoid
chit-chatting?

55
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,291
Hey, if you're
going to the store,

56
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,125
do you think you could
pick up a manga for me?

57
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,916
I like ones that have
romance in them,

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,833
but don't get too
steamy, you know?

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,875
So, basically...

60
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,708
you're looking for
a romantic comedy?

61
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
Yeah, boy meets girl,
boy loses girl,

62
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,833
boy gets girl back, and everyone
lives happily ever after!

63
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,375
Yeah, okay.

64
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,375
Hey. Good morning.

65
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,833
How lucky that I ran
into you, Misaka...

66
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,625
So, where are
you headed to?

67
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,125
I would be more than
happy to walk with you

68
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,625
part of the way if you
don't mind some company.

69
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,666
Oh, Unabara...

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Good morning.

71
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,875
Huh? You look
a little pale.

72
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,291
Do you think you might be
coming down with something?

73
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,125
Oh...

74
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,791
No.

75
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,208
What's wrong with
this guy...?

76
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,583
He hasn't left me alone a
single day this week.

77
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,208
I know this great little
seafood restaurant

78
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,791
that's just around
the corner.

79
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,875
Maybe we could grab
a bite to eat there.

80
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,333
I just had breakfast and
he's inviting me to lunch?

81
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,125
Oh... ...

82
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,083
I appreciate the
invitation and all,

83
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,416
but I have some
errands I need to run.

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,958
Okay, I'll come with you.

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,166
Well... I'm actually going
to buy some lingerie,

86
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,125
and that's kind of an awkward
place to bring a guy,

87
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,291
so goodbye.

88
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,625
I don't mind at all.

89
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,791
Now what do I do...?

90
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,208
I can't tell him I'm
going to the store

91
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,791
to look at comic books.

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,166
Please! I'm begging you!

93
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,875
Sorry, Kami, no way...

94
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,833
I've got a private lesson
scheduled with Miss Komoe,

95
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,916
and I'm not gonna miss it.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,541
It's just that helping
you out with your homework

97
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,250
isn't gonna get
us any action...

98
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,708
If there were chicks involved,
it would be different.

99
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,041
That's it. I'll pretend I was
waiting for someone else!

100
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,125
Oh, hey...!
Been waiting long?

101
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,166
Of course that's
all we care about!

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,125
Tall girls, short girls,
thin girls, fat girls,

103
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,291
blonde girls, stupid
girls, smart girls,

104
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,458
girls with curly hair,
girls with straight hair,

105
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,125
I said, "Been
waiting long?"...

106
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,666
Stop ignoring me!

107
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,541
Damn... Ow...

108
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,875
Who the--?

109
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
Oh, Zapper? !

110
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,708
I beg you. Just play along.

111
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,625
Anyway, so sorry
I'm late...

112
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,875
Let me make it
up to you, okay?

113
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,375
Today, lunch
will be my treat!

114
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,875
Sound good?

115
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,958
Lunch?

116
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,416
How interesting...

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,125
a secret rendezvous in
front of the girls' dorm.

118
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,333
Hooking up with a boy and not
telling me first, Sissy?

119
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,791
That's unacceptable!

120
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,833
Hey, what's the
big idea...?

121
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,708
Dragging me away from my friends
without bothering t--

122
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,625
-Shut up!
-What?

123
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
Please, just stop talking

124
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,416
and give me a second to
collect myself, all right?

125
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,750
So, basically,
this Unabara guy

126
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,375
has been following
you around the whole week

127
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,625
and you're sick of it?

128
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,291
That's pretty much it...

129
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,583
Apparently, he's the grandson
of our school's director,

130
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
so I can't just
blow him off.

131
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,458
So... you needed somebody to
pretend to be your boyfriend,

132
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,750
and I just
happened to be around?

133
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,250
What choice did I have...?

134
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,708
You were passing by.

135
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,916
I seized the opportunity.

136
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,250
Well, you've gotten
away from him for now,

137
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,583
haven't you...?

138
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,166
So there's no real reason
we need to keep up

139
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,000
this act anymore.

140
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,833
Well... I'd really
like to make sure

141
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,958
that he thought
I was off-limits

142
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,500
and never
bothered me again,

143
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,458
but that would mean...

144
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,083
That would mean
what, exactly?

145
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,291
You're going to have to stick
by my side all day today...

146
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,708
We need as many people
as possible to see us.

147
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,333
That should convince Unabara--

148
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,583
What's wrong with you?

149
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,625
Just my luck.

150
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,708
Well... if you have
a better idea,

151
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,541
I'd like to hear it.

152
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,625
A better idea, huh...?

153
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,125
Yeah, I've got one.

154
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,625
Why don't you try wiping
the mustard off your face?

155
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,208
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,708
Are you all right?

157
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,583
I-I'm fine.

158
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
Why do you ask?

159
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,583
Hey... Which one's yours
and which one's mine?

160
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,958
Well, um... I think
maybe this one is--

161
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,208
Let me look at it!

162
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,041
Huh?

163
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,083
You figure it out yet?

164
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,333
-I said
-No, they look exactly the same!

165
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,750
Here, you take this one.

166
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
We'll just have
to hope it's right.

167
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,250
Honestly...! Are you
always this careless...?

168
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,333
Freaking idiot!

169
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,958
Hey, it's not like
it's my fault

170
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,583
you ordered both of
us the same thing.

171
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,958
Uh... what's
bothering you now...?

172
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,583
I've never seen you
this quiet before.

173
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,875
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

174
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,416
So... what's our
next move gonna be?

175
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,708
Huh? ...

176
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,333
What do you mean, "move?"

177
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,666
You know what I mean...

178
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,791
How do we make
everybody believe

179
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,625
that we're the real deal?

180
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,833
So, now that the
experiment is over,

181
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,000
fewer than ten of the Sisters

182
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,000
are still living
in Academy City.

183
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,916
Most of them are staying
in an institution

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,958
to have their
bodies readjusted.

185
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,250
What a relief.
It sounds like

186
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,666
everything turned out for
the best in the end...

187
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,208
I'm glad to hear
they're okay.

188
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,708
Uh-huh...

189
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,875
I'm guessing this isn't what
couples normally talk about.

190
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,875
Yeah... you're probably
right about that.

191
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,666
Oh, perfect...

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,708
Instead of paying
attention to me,

193
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,291
you're going to study...

194
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,500
That totally makes it look
like we're a happy couple.

195
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,833
What more do you
want from me?

196
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,291
I need to get this
homework done...

197
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
I have to turn it in in
less than twenty-four hours.

198
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,333
Homework, huh...?

199
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,958
Yeah... I've heard
of that before.

200
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,833
Wait... Does your school
not give out homework?

201
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,500
Come on... let me see
what you're doing.

202
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,541
Uh... all right...

203
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,791
Oh, okay.

204
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,000
So this is just a basic
math review, then.

205
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,041
Wow... how do you
know all that?

206
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,875
How do you not
know all this?

207
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,625
Hey! Hey...!

208
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,250
How about we just take a little
breather and get a soda...?

209
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll go pick us
up some, 'kay?

210
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,958
No, no...
I'll do it.

211
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,250
I said I was going to
pick them up, so I will...

212
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,750
When I've made up my mind,
it's not good to disagree.

213
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,416
Pleased to meet you...

214
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,708
uh...

215
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,166
Oh, I'm Toma Kamijo.

216
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,958
My name's Mitsuki Unabara.

217
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,958
So... what can I do for ya?

218
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,958
Uh... Well, I was
just wondering

219
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,416
if you were a
friend of Misaka's.

220
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,083
That a problem?

221
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,083
Sort of...

222
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,625
I'm not really
crazy about guys

223
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,083
being friends
with the girl I like.

224
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,833
I guess I just wish
she'd be more clear about

225
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,708
who she likes and
who she doesn't...

226
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,791
That's not asking too
much, is it...?

227
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,250
Oh, the answer to that
question is three.

228
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,583
Really...? I always found
she's pretty upfront

229
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,291
about her feelings.

230
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,333
Lucky you...

231
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,583
When I talk to her
I get the sense

232
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,875
she isn't telling me
the complete truth

233
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,500
about how she feels...

234
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,041
Oh, and, the answer
to that one is four.

235
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,458
They put the two
there to trick you.

236
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,625
Uh... yeah, I think
you're right. Thank you.

237
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,041
Not a problem.
I'm happy to help.

238
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,875
What's the
matter with you?

239
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,333
Can I speak with
you for a moment?

240
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,625
It's not gonna
do me any good

241
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,916
if you're just gonna
make friends with him...!

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,208
Remember... as of
today you're my boy...

243
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,666
You're pretending
to be my boyfriend

244
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,250
so we can get mister Unabara
to leave me alone for good.

245
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,458
It's not like its rocket
science or anything!

246
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,708
-I can't.
-Huh?

247
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,833
Well, he's actually
a really nice guy...

248
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,583
and I think he's
serious about you.

249
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,666
What do you mean?

250
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,208
I don't get what it is you
don't like about him...

251
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,750
Well... I guess
it's your choice;

252
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,875
you can always
tell him 'no'.

253
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,333
Listen, you...!

254
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,250
You're right...

255
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,000
Just forget about it.

256
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,125
So... what do we do now...?

257
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,666
Are we keeping
this up still?

258
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,583
-Or maybe you...
-No!

259
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,375
You can stop pretending
to be my boyfriend

260
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,333
but let me treat you
to one last thing.

261
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,291
What do you feel like?

262
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,916
We're already
eating again?

263
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,125
Everywhere looks full.

264
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,166
How about there...?
That'll work...

265
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,416
Stay here, I'll
get us something.

266
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,041
Misaka, hold up!

267
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,208
What's this...?
Are you alone?

268
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,208
Did you get all your
homework finished up?

269
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:19,375
Yeah... If you're looking
for Misaka, she's in there.

270
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,875
What? Is there
something wrong?

271
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,500
You wouldn't happen
to have a twin brother,

272
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,750
by any chance would you?

273
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,541
No... No brothers or sisters.

274
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,041
That's weird...

275
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,041
Someone who looks like you
just ran into the restaurant.

276
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,166
Whew...! It's so hot!

277
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,500
Hey what are you doing?

278
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,250
You have to get
out of here!

279
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,250
Sorry, you said someone
who looks similar to me

280
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
just went into
that restaurant?

281
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,500
Not "similar."
This guy looked like

282
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,583
he could be your
identical twin.

283
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,708
There are espers who can
alter their appearance

284
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,708
to look like other people...

285
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,333
One could've made
himself look like me

286
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,375
to get close to Misaka.

287
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,333
Huh... I didn't realize
she was such a celebrity.

288
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,333
Would you mind
checking it out...?

289
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,291
I'd go, but I think
I upset her earlier.

290
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,666
Uh... sure...

291
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,916
You wait here.

292
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,708
I guess there is a
flaw in every plan...

293
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,375
How inconvenient for me.

294
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,833
I didn't think the real
Unabara could escape.

295
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,416
You mean you're not him?

296
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,791
That was magic!

297
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,666
Damn it!

298
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,875
Okay, I get it...

299
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,000
So this TV show
"Magical Powered Kanamin"

300
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,250
is about a girl who can fool

301
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,250
the Roman Orthodox
Witch Hunter Crusaders

302
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
by simply disguising
herself as a student.

303
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,541
But why does she need a
rainbow-colored wand to do that?

304
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,583
Yes, hello?

305
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,875
Is everything
all right there?

306
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,041
I think we've got
another sorcerer in town.

307
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,291
What's wrong...?

308
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,708
It sounds like you're
running from someone!

309
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,666
Yeah!

310
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,916
Can you describe him?

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,791
His clothes,
weapons, behavior?

312
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,875
The knife he carries
is made of obsidian...

313
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,541
I know it...
I think it might be

314
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,583
The Spear of
Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli.

315
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,333
Tlah... What?!

316
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,875
An Aztec god.

317
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,166
His name means Lord
of the House of Dawn...

318
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,791
The spear is said
to kill anyone

319
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,750
who is bathed in
the light of Venus.

320
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,958
Never mind the background,

321
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,375
just tell me
what I should do!

322
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,875
I just need to know

323
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,666
how I'm supposed to
get rid of this guy!

324
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,500
Quickly!

325
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,625
The sorcerer just has
a replica of the spear.

326
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,250
It's probably a mirror.

327
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
He'll attack by reflecting
the light from Venus

328
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,041
in the spear's
obsidian blade.

329
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,333
I think the best
thing for you to do

330
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,041
is to try blocking it
with your right hand.

331
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,791
Okay.

332
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,875
Is he using this Aztec magic
to disguise himself as Unabara?

333
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,875
Aztec priests would
flay the skin

334
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,958
of a human sacrifice
and then wear it.

335
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,916
I'm guessing
this is analogous.

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,166
Wait--they do what
with the skin?

337
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,125
First they'd strip it
off with a knife...

338
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,875
and then they'd wear it.

339
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,500
If he's just using
it as a disguise,

340
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,083
it's possible he took only
a small portion of skin

341
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,041
and used it to
change his appearance.

342
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,250
Man, these sorcerers
are twisted! Hmph...

343
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,583
Toma!

344
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,416
Time to say your prayers!

345
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,625
Impossible...!

346
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,500
I'm sure the knife was
positioned perfectly!

347
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,541
Cement dust?

348
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,708
Damn it!

349
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,833
Now then...

350
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,250
I have a question.

351
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,833
Why did you pick Unabara's
body as your disguise...?

352
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,625
To get close to Misaka...?

353
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,208
Why her? She has nothing
to do with magic.

354
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,000
Hah...! You're not joking.

355
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,541
You really don't
get it, do you?

356
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,750
What?

357
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,083
You have access to the

358
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,250
one hundred and three
thousand grimoires...

359
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,791
And as if that
wasn't enough,

360
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,250
you've made friends with some
interesting people lately...

361
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,416
Among them are a few
sorcerers and a Level 5 esper.

362
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,958
You're forming a
group of supporters

363
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,541
being referred to as
The Kamijo Forces.

364
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,875
The what?

365
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,875
Dude... You're
not making sense.

366
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,291
Your friends...

367
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,625
Together, their
power threatens

368
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,375
to upset the balance
between the two worlds.

369
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,458
You're not the only one I'm
targeting for extermination...

370
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,416
I want every member
of the Kamijo Forces.

371
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,166
My plan was to use the faces
of people familiar to you

372
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,958
to erode your trust and
destroy you from the inside out.

373
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,375
Sneaky punk.

374
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,625
Unfortunately, Mitsuki
Unabara's identity

375
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,625
is useless to me now.

376
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,583
I'll have to use somebody
else's body as my disguise.

377
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,958
You don't mean...

378
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,333
You were going
to use Misaka?

379
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,708
-You...!
-Oh, no.

380
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,250
I think your face will
suit my purposes perfectly.

381
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,250
I liked you...

382
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,416
I actually thought that
we could be friends.

383
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,958
Really...?

384
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,625
Because I never thought
anything like that about you.

385
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,583
You could've fooled me...

386
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,375
and what about all that stuff
you said about liking Misaka...?

387
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,625
You were probably just
faking that, too, weren't you?

388
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,083
Don't judge me for what
you can't understand.

389
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,000
I am a fake, but that
doesn't change the fact

390
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,083
that I wanted
to protect Misaka.

391
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,708
This stupid stunt wasn't
my plan to begin with!

392
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,750
But then...
my superiors determined

393
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,916
that the Kamijo Forces
were too dangerous!

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,166
Then you...

395
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,083
If you had just been
less troublesome...

396
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,625
If you had just backed down

397
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,958
and made it possible
for me to report

398
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,541
that you weren't a threat...

399
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,708
we wouldn't be here,

400
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,833
and I wouldn't have
had to trick Misaka!

401
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,333
Wow...

402
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,250
You're actually in love
with her, aren't you?

403
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,291
Yes... but you're
her friend,

404
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,666
and now I'm your enemy.

405
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,083
I don't have a choice.

406
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,666
That face isn't yours.

407
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,875
It's an illusion that
I'm gonna destroy!

408
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,083
Move, quick!

409
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,375
It looks like...

410
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,375
I've lost this fight.

411
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,708
Yes, you have.

412
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,000
I won't be the last one

413
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,791
they send after you
and your group.

414
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,083
Like it or not,

415
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
you and Misaka will
still be targets...

416
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,000
Will you protect
her for me...?

417
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,250
Will you keep her safe?

418
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,875
No matter where she is
or what she's doing...

419
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,375
swear to me you'll
be there for her...

420
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,375
Please, will you
make me that promise?

421
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,416
For cryin' out loud.

422
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,458
Worst possible answer.

423
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,250
Yeah, he is the kinda guy

424
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,666
who would say something like
that without thinking...

425
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,083
I know I'm nobody
special or anything.

426
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,958
I'm not going to take
his words the wrong way.

427
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,500
But he makes it
really difficult...

428
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,000
the idiot!

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,958
[Music]

430
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,291
A mysterious girl introduces
herself to Accelerator,

431
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,583
revealing a shocking truth

432
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,625
and forcing him to
make a tough choice.

433
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,500
Next time, "Last Order."

434
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,208
When science and
magic cross paths,

435
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,666
a story is born.
