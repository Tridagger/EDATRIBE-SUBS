1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
I finally learned
that those books Index

2
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,375
is always talking about are
actually stored in her memory...

3
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,750
Somehow I managed to escape
from the sorcerer with Index,

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,416
but her injuries
are severe.

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,375
She says magic can
be used to heal her,

6
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,125
but apparently, none of
the students in this city

7
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,041
can use this magic stuff.

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,166
So, I decided to bring
Index to Miss Komoe

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,000
and ask her for help.

10
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:57,083
[Music]

11
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,875
What time is it?

12
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,708
I need the exact minute
in Japan Standard Time...

13
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,166
Also, can you please
tell me what the date is?

14
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,166
Today is the
twentieth of July...

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,041
and the time is now
half past eight o'clock.

16
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,083
You didn't look at a
clock before answering...

17
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,458
How can you be so certain
it is 8:30 precisely?

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,500
I couldn't have
checked a clock

19
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,791
because there
aren't any here.

20
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,125
I don't need them...

21
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,208
But I promise, the time
I gave you was precise.

22
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,458
My internal clock is accurate
down to the second...

23
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,166
My eating habits,
exercise rhythms,

24
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,083
and sleep patterns
are so regulated

25
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,958
that my body always
knows what time it is.

26
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,833
Judging by the
position of the stars

27
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,333
and the phase of the moon,

28
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,750
your estimation is correct
within a .083 margin of error.

29
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,500
I can therefore
confirm it...

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,208
Today is July 20th and it is
8:30 p.m. Japan Standard Time...

31
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,125
Is that calculation consistent
with your internal clock?

32
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,166
Yes... Not for very
much longer, though.

33
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,208
We actually just passed
the fifty-three second mark.

34
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,750
You're injured!
You shouldn't move!

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,833
Don't be concerned...

36
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,666
My body can regenerate.

37
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,500
The cusp of Cancer.

38
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,708
The hour is between eight p.m.
and twelve midnight.

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,208
The direction,
westward facing...

40
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,958
Invoking the
protection of Undine...

41
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,708
We will require the
aid of an angel.

42
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,500
Uh... what is it
that you're doing?

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,166
It's magic.

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,500
From this point forward,

45
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,916
I will need your
assistance...

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,083
I must borrow your body.

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,041
Please follow my
instructions exactly...

48
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,291
If you do, we will accomplish
this without injury...

49
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,000
Your participation in
this will be appreciated.

50
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,833
Why don't you lie
back down instead?

51
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,458
We'll wait for
the ambulance...

52
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's see... I must
have bandages somewhere.

53
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,708
Common first-aid
will do no good...

54
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,333
Unfortunately,
nothing you can do

55
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,291
will suffice to close
my wounds completely.

56
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,625
Nor is there any reason to
call for additional help...

57
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,916
Any attempt
will be useless

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,666
unless it can heal
my injuries entirely

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,125
and restore my life force
to the necessary levels

60
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,958
within the next few minutes.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,000
So... what do you
want me to do...?

62
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,458
I don't know
anything about magic.

63
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,375
I didn't think it
was real 'til now.

64
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,250
I deeply appreciate
your cooperation.

65
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,708
Now, to begin...

66
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,750
Tell me what that is...

67
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,041
The black item over there.

68
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a memory card.

69
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,750
You haven't
seen one before?

70
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,500
It will do. Please place it in
the center of the coffee table.

71
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,083
It's really more
of a tea table.

72
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,833
What's this...?

73
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,083
It looks like you've built
a miniature of the room.

74
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,875
The materials used
are irrelevant.

75
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,916
What is important is to
recreate the placement of items

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,041
as they appear in the room.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,333
What are those?

78
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,458
They represent
the beer cans....

79
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,666
As we move forward,

80
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,166
it is vital that you
follow any instruction

81
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,958
I give down
to the letter.

82
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,083
A single misstep
could be disastrous...

83
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,791
A mistake as small as
a misdirected thought

84
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,708
could permanently damage
your nervous system...

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,750
understood?

86
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,541
Complete failure
would result

87
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,208
in the destruction of
your body and death.

88
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,041
I thought you should
be aware of the risks.

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,500
We will call an angel
and create a temple...

90
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,750
I will begin the
chanting now.

91
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,333
Please follow my example.

92
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,583
Link established.

93
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,958
What link?

94
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,791
We created a temple
on this table.

95
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,458
We have now established a
link between it and the room.

96
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,625
Whatever happens
in the room

97
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,958
will also happen
on the table.

98
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,916
And whatever
happens on the table

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
will also happen
in the room.

100
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,708
Now you must visualize!

101
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,833
What?!

102
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,375
Picture a golden angel...

103
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,958
It should have two wings...
and the body of a child.

104
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,500
See the form of a
beautiful angel!

105
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,791
An angel?

106
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,791
It won't work...

107
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,583
How am I supposed
to summon an angel?

108
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,000
Uh-oh.

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,958
You are not actually
summoning the angel itself.

110
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,500
Rather, as
the spellcaster,

111
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,375
you are using your will to
create the form of an angel.

112
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,791
Oh-okay.

113
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,708
A beautiful angel...

114
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,583
A beautiful angel...

115
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,791
A beautiful angel...

116
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,625
A beautiful angel...

117
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,583
A beautiful angel...

118
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,583
A beautiful angel...

119
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,625
A beautiful angel...

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
Incredible! I thought you said

121
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,250
I wasn't summoning
a real angel...

122
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,458
That looks real!

123
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,458
A form stabilization failure.

124
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,875
So long as the temple is
protected by the blue of Undine,

125
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
it is no matter.

126
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,916
We can continue
our work...

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,166
Let us chant.

128
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
A beautiful... angel...

129
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
A beautiful... angel...

130
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,208
A beautiful... angel...

131
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,083
A beautiful... angel...

132
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,166
A beautiful... angel...

133
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,083
A beautiful... angel...

134
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,083
A beautiful... angel...

135
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,125
A beautiful... angel...

136
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,375
Life force replenishment
underway...

137
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,583
Now confirming that mortal
peril has been avoided...

138
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,416
John's Pen is
returning to dormancy.

139
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,833
Are you sure
that you're okay?

140
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,208
Yes...

141
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,291
I just need some time
to recover my strength...

142
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,500
The wound is closed now,
so I should be fine.

143
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,083
Thank goodness...

144
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,541
Toma won't have
to pay for this.

145
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,250
Pay for it...? Like how?

146
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,541
It's difficult to explain,
but if I had died here,

147
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,708
the consequences he would've
faced might've been terrible.

148
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,583
It sounds like...

149
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,166
you're more concerned
about Kamijo

150
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,791
instead of your
own injuries.

151
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,625
I know it's strange.

152
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,083
After all...

153
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,583
I only just met him...

154
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,541
but still...

155
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,875
Explain this.

156
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
Miss Komoe is an
Academy City teacher.

157
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,583
She's a bona fide beer-drinking,
chain-smoking adult...

158
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,666
How is it that her
PJ's even fit you?

159
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,666
I mean, the age
difference must be huge.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,291
It's rude to talk
down to people.

161
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,166
And anyway, they
don't fit that well.

162
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,916
The chest area is
way too tight on me.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,291
Hey! After what I did,
you're making fun of me?

164
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
What...? I wasn't.

165
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,625
-I just...
-You just what? Huh?

166
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,500
No, it's nothing.

167
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,500
I am an adult,
thank you very much!

168
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,875
And as for you, Kamijo...!

169
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,666
It's time you answered
some questions.

170
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,166
Who is this girl to you?

171
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,083
My younger sister.

172
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,583
You are the worst liar
ever! Look at her!

173
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,958
She's got silver
hair and blue eyes.

174
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,666
You are clearly
not related to her!

175
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,208
-I'm so sorry!
-Tell... the... truth!

176
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,333
Miss Komoe...? May I please
ask a question first?

177
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,000
Fine.

178
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,333
If I do tell the
truth to you...

179
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,333
Are you gonna report it all to
Academy City's governing board?

180
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,750
Yes...

181
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,916
I'm not sure
what kind of trouble

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,250
you've gotten
yourself involved in,

183
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,291
but I can tell that
it's something serious.

184
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,791
And now that I
know about it,

185
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,291
it is my duty as a faculty
member and a responsible adult

186
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,041
to report it to
the authorities.

187
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,625
Whatever's going on,

188
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,000
it seems like you've gotten
in over your head, Kamijo...

189
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,250
How can I stand
back and do nothing

190
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,833
when one of my
students is in danger?

191
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,166
If you were a stranger,

192
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,166
I wouldn't hesitate to
involve you in this...

193
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,000
but you've already
done so much to help...

194
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,625
I don't want
you to get hurt.

195
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,458
That may have been a
fancy little speech,

196
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,333
but I can't just
leave it at that...

197
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,291
You aren't going to get out
of this that easily, you know.

198
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,166
Uh... where're you going?

199
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,375
I'm giving you
time to think...

200
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,583
There are a few groceries
I need from the supermarket.

201
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,916
You are going
to stay here...

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,958
I expect you to give
serious consideration

203
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,083
to what you're
going to tell me...

204
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,250
I'll be gone for a bit.

205
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,458
You should have more
than enough time...

206
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,416
Oh, and...

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,916
Yes ma'am?

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,583
There's always a chance I'll
get caught up in my shopping

209
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,083
and forget
about this...

210
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,666
But I still expect you
to explain yourself

211
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,125
once I get back...

212
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,666
I don't want you trying to
weasel your way out of it,

213
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,041
do you understand?

214
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
She's a nice person.

215
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,958
Are you talking
about Miss Komoe?

216
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,291
We should keep her from
getting further involved, huh?

217
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,666
That's right...

218
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,833
It wouldn't be safe for
her to use any more magic.

219
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,750
The grimoires are
really dangerous...

220
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,500
They're full of
unconventional ideas

221
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,166
that alter basic
laws of nature.

222
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,208
It's like there are
two different worlds:

223
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,250
this one and the one
within the grimoires.

224
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,791
And the other
one is toxic.

225
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,958
Like... poison?

226
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,875
When people of this world
who aren't sorcerers

227
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,166
read what is written
in the grimoires,

228
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,833
it damages their brains.

229
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,083
Normal humans
were never meant

230
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,833
to read such poisonous
ideas, you see.

231
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
That's horrible...

232
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,791
Is that what magic is?

233
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,041
It sounds evil.

234
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,708
You wanna know?

235
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,666
You want me to tell
you about it...?

236
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,041
The poison I carry?

237
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,291
You look so serious...

238
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,791
Hands clasped
and head bowed,

239
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,708
almost like you're
talking to a priest.

240
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,458
Yeah, you're right...

241
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,500
It kinda feels like you're
taking my confession.

242
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,541
There used to be only
one church of the cross.

243
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,041
Do you know why there are
so many divisions of it now?

244
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,000
Hmm...

245
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,458
Let me think...

246
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,791
People began to mix their
politics with religion...

247
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,125
When that happened,

248
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,416
the church fractured
into separate factions,

249
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,291
each one wanting to
follow a different path...

250
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,833
Even though they all
still shared a common God.

251
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,500
Each group evolved
in its own way,

252
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,208
developing a character
suited to its beliefs.

253
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,833
Character. Sure.

254
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,541
I belong to a branch of
the English Puritan Church.

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,458
England is a
country of magic,

256
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,500
so anti-sorcery practices like
witch hunts and inquisitions

257
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,791
became increasingly commonplace
over the centuries.

258
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,083
The English Puritan Church

259
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,083
created a special
branch for such things.

260
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,416
This branch
investigates magic

261
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,083
and develops countermeasures
against sorcerers...

262
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
It's called the Church
of Necessary Evil,

263
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,291
or Necessarius.

264
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
And you're part
of this sect?

265
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,583
You see... understanding
an impure enemy that way

266
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,833
taints the mind,

267
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,083
just as coming
into contact

268
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,125
with the unclean
taints the body...

269
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,083
but still... we continue to
stand against this impurity...

270
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,166
the epitome of which...

271
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,125
...is the library you carry
around in your head.

272
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,208
A piece of magic is a lot
like a formula in some ways...

273
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,083
If you understand its
components well enough,

274
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,583
you can figure out
how to neutralize

275
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,208
your opponent's attack.

276
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,708
That means that
if you understand

277
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,125
all the magic
in the world,

278
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,958
you should be able to neutralize
the power entirely...

279
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,916
That's why I memorized
the grimoires.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,750
Why they were
drilled into you.

281
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,041
Okay...

282
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,458
If they're as
dangerous as you say,

283
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,000
you could just burn them
without reading them... right?

284
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,333
It's not the
books that matter.

285
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,166
It's what's written
inside them.

286
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,833
Even if the original
works were destroyed,

287
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,875
their contents could've
been passed on...

288
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,208
Besides, humans
wouldn't be able

289
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,625
to dispose of
the originals.

290
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,875
Destroying that
kind of magic

291
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,333
isn't something the
human mind can bear...

292
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,041
And since the information
can't be destroyed,

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,958
they had no choice but
to seal it in a safe place.

294
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,250
So, basically...

295
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,791
It's like there's a
bomb inside your head

296
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,833
and some evil people want
to get their hands on it.

297
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,958
Anyone who could use all

298
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,333
one-hundred-and-three-thousand
volumes

299
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,916
would have the power
to warp the entire world.

300
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,250
How could you?

301
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,458
This is major stuff,

302
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,750
and you waited until
now to tell me?!

303
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,000
You're such a skeptic

304
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,541
I didn't think you were
going to believe me,

305
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,833
and I didn't want to
frighten you off...

306
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,166
and also...

307
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,583
well... I didn't want
you to stop liking me.

308
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,666
That's why you
kept it from me?!

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,000
Well I deserve better!

310
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,583
Church of Necessary Evil?!

311
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,083
Magic robes?!

312
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,041
A whole library
of evil books?!

313
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
Yeah, it is a crazy story,

314
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,541
and I still have a
hard time buying it...

315
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,375
But that's it, right...?

316
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,583
No more surprises?

317
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,500
You owe me an apology.

318
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
Did you actually think
I wouldn't like you

319
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,291
just because you happened to
memorize a bunch of old books?

320
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,791
You just assumed I was
that petty and shallow...?

321
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't leap straight
into judgment.

322
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,166
Have some faith!

323
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,666
Cheer up... Sorcerers
are no match for me.

324
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,708
Not while I've got
this right hand.

325
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,375
Except... didn't you say

326
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,375
they're making you take
remedial classes at school?

327
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,916
Did I say that?

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,166
You certainly did.

329
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,458
Well, forget about it.

330
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
It doesn't matter.

331
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,291
If it doesn't matter...

332
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,583
then why did you say anything
about it in the first place?

333
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Was that just an excuse?

334
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,666
Did you want to
get away from me?

335
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,291
Am I cramping your style?

336
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,916
Well, are you
gonna answer me?

337
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,291
How is Index?

338
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,791
Still alive.

339
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,583
I've been looking into
the identity of that boy

340
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,375
she's got with her.

341
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,333
Good... Did you find out
anything about his hand?

342
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,541
Whatever he is...

343
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,666
he certainly doesn't
appear to be an esper...

344
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,958
or a sorcerer.

345
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,166
So, what, then...?

346
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,875
I hope you're not
trying to convince me

347
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,833
he's just an ordinary
high-school student.

348
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,833
There's no way...

349
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,083
A rank amateur with no power at
all repelling Innocentius...?

350
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,291
Not in this life time...

351
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,666
He's not a normal kid.

352
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,541
Normal...? No...

353
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,208
In fact, he is distinctly below
average--by all appearances,

354
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,375
a hopeless student who's
quick to get into a fight.

355
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,791
He must be concealing his
true status somehow...

356
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,166
..Right?

357
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,000
But there's something
troubling me even more...

358
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,583
Index was healed
using magic...

359
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,041
what do you think?

360
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,583
Is there another
magic cabal

361
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,541
we don't know of here
in the Far East?

362
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,791
If they were operating
out of the Academy City

363
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,208
the governing board would've
picked up on them by now.

364
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,208
Even so we wouldn't
know their number...

365
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,666
plus we don't have
any reinforcements.

366
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,000
She's happy, huh?

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,750
She really seems to
be having fun here.

368
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,541
She always makes the
best of what she has.

369
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,250
I wonder...

370
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,833
How much longer are
we going to have

371
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,416
to keep tearing that apart?

372
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,916
You're starting to
get sentimental...

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,166
You wouldn't be having
second thoughts, would you?

374
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
I know what
needs to be done.

375
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,333
Eventually, Miss Komoe
returned from her shopping...

376
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,916
She invited us to
stay at her place,

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and she didn't say a word about
our earlier conversation.

378
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,583
Maybe she got distracted
with her errands

379
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,041
and forgot about it...

380
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,291
Or maybe she just
pretended to forget...

381
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,166
I wasn't about to ask.

382
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,458
Bath time...! Bath time!

383
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,333
I love bath time!

384
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,208
Bath time...!
Bath time...!

385
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,083
I... love... bath time!

386
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,000
Toma! Toma!

387
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,208
Toma! Toma! Toma!

388
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,791
It's nothing...!

389
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,708
I just thought it was funny to
say your name a bunch of times

390
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,291
for no good reason.

391
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,541
Now that I think
about it...

392
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,208
there is something
I wanna ask you.

393
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,750
Something Komoe told me.

394
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,416
Listen, this is
very important.

395
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,083
Japanese bathhouses have
something called coffee milk.

396
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,208
Do this...
Then this...

397
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
And then with your
hand on your hip,

398
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,875
you drink it all!

399
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,583
I've never heard of something
called coffee milk...

400
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,625
Is it like a latte
or cappuccino?

401
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,083
You won't find anything as fancy
as that in a bathhouse...

402
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,333
but don't be too
disappointed.

403
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,875
I bet you'll get a kick
out of the bathtubs;

404
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
they're gigantic!

405
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,000
In England you mostly have
tight, narrow tubs, don't you?

406
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,541
Actually, I have no
idea what they're like.

407
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,875
You don't? Why?

408
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,166
Well, because...

409
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,541
the first memory I have
is of being here...

410
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,708
I don't really know much about
what life is like in England.

411
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,500
I was wondering how you
seemed to fit in so easily here.

412
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,500
I don't think you
understand what I mean.

413
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,541
I'm not from here
I'm European.

414
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,708
I was born in
England--London, actually

415
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,208
apparently I was raised
in St. George's Cathedral.

416
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,041
I only arrived in
Japan about a year ago,

417
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,000
or so I'm told, anyway.

418
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,125
So you're told?

419
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,166
Uh-huh...

420
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,041
Apparently I lost
my memory somehow.

421
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,875
It was strange...

422
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,958
When I first
opened my eyes,

423
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,208
I didn't even
know who I was.

424
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,875
I couldn't remember
what I'd eaten for dinner

425
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,375
the day before...

426
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,500
but I still knew all about
sorcerers, the grimoires,

427
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,291
Necessarius...

428
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,416
all that knowledge just
spinning around in my head.

429
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,166
It was really scary.

430
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,083
So you're telling me that
you lost your memory

431
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,625
and you have no idea
how it happened?

432
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,833
That's crazy!

433
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,125
Yeah.

434
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,333
What is it?
Are you angry again?

435
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,916
No, I'm not angry.

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,333
You sure...? If I've done
something wrong, say so...

437
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,333
Really...!

438
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,625
You shouldn't
act so immature...

439
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,250
It isn't attractive.

440
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,208
You're just about the
last person in the world

441
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,416
who should be lecturing
me about immaturity...

442
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,458
little girl.

443
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,875
Hey... Who're you
calling "little?"

444
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,916
I'm serious.
You really look angry...

445
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,750
Or is it just that annoying
thing you like to do

446
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,083
where you get all upset

447
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,041
because you know
it'll get under my skin?

448
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,250
That's one of the things
I don't like about you.

449
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,416
Oh, come on...

450
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,166
Are you really gonna
give me that crap

451
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,375
when you never liked
me to begin with...?

452
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,125
This isn't some
romantic comedy

453
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,458
where the two main characters

454
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,791
start off hating each other
until... suddenly...

455
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,916
Index? What's with
the puppy-dog eyes?

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,250
I was just joking
around with you...

457
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,458
Okay?

458
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,500
Toma...

459
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,125
You... suck!

460
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,875
Ow... Just great...

461
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,333
I'm covered in bite marks,

462
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,333
and she's off in the city
somewhere, all alone.

463
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,666
That's weird.

464
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,666
There's no one here...

465
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,000
What's happening?

466
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,041
Runes.

467
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,958
I engraved them
around this spot

468
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,708
so we could have
a little privacy.

469
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,416
And who the hell are you?

470
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,083
Kaori Kanzaki...

471
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,833
and I already
know who you are.

472
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:32,041
[Music]

473
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,041
It looks like there's
another sorcerer in town...

474
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,583
I wonder if she's the
one who attacked Index.

475
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,416
What kind of person would
do something like that?

476
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,541
Next time,
"Perfect Memory Ability.

477
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,250
"When science and
magic cross paths,

478
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,916
a story is born.
