2
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,916
That's my rotten
luck for you!

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,750
Get back here,
you scrawny punk!

4
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,708
Running won't
save you kid!

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,250
My name is Toma Kamijo...

6
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,666
And this little chase scene

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,083
is just another event
in an adolescence riddled

8
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,583
with nothing but
rotten luck.

10
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,083
It was July 19th...

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,583
I entered the restaurant,

12
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,166
excited that summer break
was beginning the next day...

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,916
I intended to order
myself a nice big meal

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,291
to celebrate the start
of the vacation...

15
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,250
but that's when I saw it.

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,291
I could tell that sleazebag
was up to no good...

17
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,125
I had to step in and
help the poor girl...

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,458
What else could
I do, really?

19
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,916
Well, honey...?
Let's go.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,083
Excuse me...

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,958
You should go...

22
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,916
You're bothering
the young lady.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,125
-I'm starving.
-Tell me about it.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,583
Want something, kid?

25
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,875
A beating, maybe...?

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,500
Well?

27
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,291
Man, what was I thinking...?

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,583
With my luck, I should've
known this would happen!

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,291
Finally...! They got
tired of running.

30
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,625
What was all that about?

31
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,583
Playing the hero by protecting
some dimwitted thugs...?

32
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,083
What, are you a
teacher or something?

33
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,708
So they only stopped
running after me because...

34
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,916
You got it...

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,208
They were starting
to annoy me,

36
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,708
so I dealt with them.

37
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,125
Yeah, it figures.

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,416
Hey, hero...

39
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,583
you ever heard of...

40
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,000
a railgun?

41
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,375
Railgun...? Um...

42
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,500
A super-electromagnetic
gun...

43
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,333
It's an application of Fleming's
kinetic momentum theory...

44
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,833
You use it to
launch projectiles

45
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,541
with a little extra oomph.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,916
Allow me to demonstrate
it for you...

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,125
Catch!

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,875
When it's launched at three
times the speed of sound...

49
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,250
Even something small
packs a big punch.

50
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,291
Is that what you used to
take care of those guys?

51
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,916
Don't be such a moron.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,125
There are easier ways

53
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,000
to take care of a bunch
of level zeroes...

54
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,583
And I know them all.

55
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,125
Yep. As it turned out,

56
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,416
it wasn't her
that needed saving...

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,708
It was those poor saps

58
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,000
who were careless enough
to get on her bad side.

59
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,833
So, you're one of the seven
Level 5 espers in Academy City.

60
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,666
Tell me, are the
other six this rude,

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,416
or are you just special?

62
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,416
You could stand to be
less condescending...

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,166
Humility's a
virtue you know.

64
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,708
Y' must be good...

65
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,833
or you wouldn't
talk to me that way.

66
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:55,875
Wa-wa-wa-wait...!

67
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,458
I'm just a Level Zero.

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,541
So... If you're really a
Level Zero like you say...

69
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,250
Explain how you don't
have a scratch on you.

70
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,916
I don't know
what to tell you.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,208
Maybe it's coincidence...

72
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,500
or just plain bad luck.

73
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,625
Either way...

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,416
this really
isn't your night.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
Last night's lightning
caused a power outage...

76
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,375
which turned my place into
a sweltering cesspool.

77
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,666
Hot...

78
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,416
It also meant that
everything in my refrigerator

79
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,125
had become toxic.

80
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,833
On top of that, I lost
my emergency rations

81
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,916
when they fell
in the sink...

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,083
I crushed my cash card

83
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,583
when I was looking
for my wallet...

84
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,208
And then someone
called to inform me

85
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,250
that I'm such an idiot,

86
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,291
I need to take
a remedial class.

87
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,250
Just my luck.

88
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,708
All right, it's a
nice day outside...

89
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,458
Maybe airing the mattress
out will improve my mood.

90
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,708
Yep, my future might
be dark and gloomy...

91
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,875
but at least it's a
beautiful, sunny day!

92
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,583
Then again...

93
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,041
now that I said that, it'll
probably start pouring rain.

94
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,500
Huh?

95
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,583
I already hung
something...?

96
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,791
That's strange...

97
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,416
That's... a girl...

98
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,041
What's she doing
on my balcony?

99
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,083
That clothing...

100
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,375
she looks like a Sister!

101
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,750
I'm guessing she's not
from around here....

102
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm so...

103
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,458
I'm so very... hungry.

104
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,333
Very, very hungry.

105
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,541
What was that?

106
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,791
I said I'm hungry.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,083
What... the...

108
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,291
Are you listening to me?

109
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,333
I told you, I'm hungry.

110
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,083
So, uh...
just out of curiosity...

111
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,875
Is this something
you make a habit of?

112
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,916
Randomly appearing draped
over people's balconies?

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,833
It's also called
curb-croaking.

114
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,375
So... Do you have
any food in there?

115
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,625
I'm really starving...

116
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,125
Please feed me!

117
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,000
I think she'd be
better off some place

118
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,666
far, far away from here.

119
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,250
Do you think this'll
do the trick?

120
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,416
Yes, thank you...!

121
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,208
Sandwiches are my favorite!

122
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,625
Wonderful...! This
tastes fantastic!

123
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,083
Oh... Really, it does?

124
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,583
That's a surprise,

125
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,666
considering it's a stir-fry
made of spoiled ingredients

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,333
from a dead refrigerator.

127
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,333
I know what it is...!

128
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,750
There's some
sour flavor in here

129
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,500
that's really
waking up my taste buds.

130
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,416
What a great idea!

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,791
It's sour?

132
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,750
Don't feel like you
have to eat it all...

133
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,916
It's bachelor
cooking--nothing exciting.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,916
You don't need
to be so modest...

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,625
It was very kind of you
to go to the trouble

136
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,416
of making it
for me at all...

137
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,791
So I'm going to finish
every last morsel!

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,958
I give!
I can't do it!

139
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,833
So, uh... Do you
mind telling me

140
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,791
why you were hanging
out on my balcony?

141
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,250
Oh, I fell...

142
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,750
What I was actually
trying to do

143
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,125
was jump from one roof
onto the next over.

144
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,583
Huh...? But this building
is eight stories high!

145
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,416
I didn't exactly
have many options...

146
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
I was being pursued...

147
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,083
Whoops, I never
introduced myself, did I?

148
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,583
Well, how rude of me...!

149
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,750
I'm Index. Nice to meet you!

150
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
Index? That's your name?

151
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,083
That sounds like
an alias to me...

152
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,458
You can't tell me you're
named after part of a book.

153
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,416
Yes the Index Librorum
Prohibitorum...

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,583
Oh... and my magic name is
Dedicatus Five-Four-Five...

155
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,750
It translates as
"the consecrated lamb

156
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,458
who safeguards the
wisdom of the mighty."

157
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,875
Okay, Index, why exactly
would somebody be chasing

158
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,000
a Sister like you?

159
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,208
I believe they seek

160
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,916
the one hundred and
three thousand grimoires

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,291
that I carry with me.

162
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,250
Grim... wha?

163
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,583
Well...

164
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,833
The Book of Eibon...

165
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,208
The Lemegeton...

166
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,625
The Book of the Dead...

167
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,375
Those are a just few typical
examples of grimoires.

168
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,541
So where are they...?

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,833
It's hard to believe

170
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,333
you're hiding a whole
library under that dress.

171
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,958
I'm carrying all one hundred
and three thousand volumes!

172
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,083
That's more books than
I've even seen before...

173
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,166
What...? Y'mean you got a key
to a warehouse or something?

174
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,250
Mm-mm.

175
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,750
Is this some
kind of joke...?

176
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,791
Next, are you gonna say,

177
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,750
"Well, stupid people
can't see them."

178
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,875
It isn't just stupid
people who can't...

179
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,083
The whole point is for
them not to be visible.

180
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,583
Okay, so who is it
that's chasing you?

181
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,416
A sorcery society.

182
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,416
Huh...? Sorcery?

183
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,708
Surely you've heard
of sorcerers before...

184
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,916
People who do magic...

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,125
a magic cabal.

186
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,666
Uh, do you belong
to one of those

187
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,291
new-age religions
or something?

188
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,583
Wait, are you
making fun of me?

189
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,958
You are, aren't you?

190
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,458
You're making fun of me!

191
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,583
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,916
It's too much.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,875
I know there are plenty
of unusual powers

194
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,416
being used out
in the world.

195
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,958
but I just can't buy magic.

196
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,458
This is Academy City...

197
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,791
Supernatural abilities

198
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,083
aren't really anything new
and different here...

199
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,208
Anybody can develop them if
they use science, not magic.

200
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,458
You believe in supernatural,
psychic powers,

201
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,250
but the idea of sorcery
is "too much" for you?

202
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,250
Well, okay...

203
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,958
Explain what
sorcery is, then...

204
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,500
Or maybe show
me an example.

205
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,458
I can't do that. I don't
possess any magical power.

206
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,083
If you can't use it,

207
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,416
then how are you so convinced
that it actually exists?

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,833
Because it does!

209
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,708
Sorcery does exist!

210
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,000
To tell you the truth
I was born

211
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,916
with a kind of strange,
inexplicable power myself.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,375
What kind of power?

213
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,250
It's something in
my right hand...

214
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,791
When it comes in contact
with any unusual ability,

215
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,166
my hand cancels it out.

216
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,375
Who knows? It may even
work on divine miracles.

217
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,541
Well?

218
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,125
What's with the face?

219
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,083
You look like you're listening
to a used car salesman.

220
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,916
Can you blame me?

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,416
I'm guessing you probably
don't even believe in God...

222
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,583
and you're telling me your
super-special right hand

223
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,041
has the power to
cancel a miracle!

224
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,583
What a joke...

225
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,208
You still like to
play make-believe,

226
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,750
and you're the one
making fun of me?!

227
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,083
Magic's not make-believe!

228
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,916
Then why not show me
something magical...

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,500
and when you see my
right hand negate it,

230
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,583
then you'll have
no other choice

231
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,208
but to believe
what I said.

232
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,833
Okay...! I can show
you something...

233
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,666
My robes...
They're magic.

234
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,500
These are known as
the Walking Church...

235
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,916
They create an impenetrable
protective barrier.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,083
The Walking Church...?

237
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,250
What does that even mean?

238
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,416
You keep throwing
out these terms

239
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,166
like I'm supposed
to understand.

240
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,583
Well, sorry, but I don't.

241
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,041
Maybe a little experiment

242
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,291
will get it through
your thick head.

243
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,083
Take this knife and
try to stab me with it!

244
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,541
Wha... are you crazy?

245
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,291
Do I have to
explain everything?

246
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,666
These robes have
been sanctified

247
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,791
the same way as a church.

248
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,875
That means
they're as strong as

249
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,250
if they were an
actual building.

250
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,083
So while I'm wearing them,
you can take a stab at me

251
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,916
with this knife and it
won't injure me one bit.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,666
Yeah, well... that's
interesting and all,

253
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,750
but I'm still not gonna
stab you with that thing.

254
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,458
Are you even
listening to me...?!

255
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,041
I am wearing an
exact replica

256
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,375
of the Shroud of Turin.

257
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,541
Its divine power to protect
is unquestionable...

258
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,916
It wards off and absorbs

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,875
any attack that's
made against me...

260
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,250
physical or magical.

261
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,666
Oh, I see...

262
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,833
From what you're saying...

263
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:10,916
if those robes of yours

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,750
really do have
supernatural powers...

265
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,000
then all I would
have to do is

266
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,333
touch them with
my right hand...

267
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,791
and that would be that.

268
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,166
That's assuming
that your power

269
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,375
actually works
the way you say.

270
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,250
All right then,
fine with me!

271
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,791
When it's over,
just remember...

272
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,750
You asked me to do this!

273
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,208
Okay... that's strange.

274
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,458
Well, what a surprise.

275
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,916
Nothing's happening.

276
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,041
What's wrong?

277
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Oh... it's nothing...

278
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,541
Look at this...

279
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,833
You must've bitten
me a hundred times.

280
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,583
You're like a really big,
really angry mosquito.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,041
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,250
Maybe we should just
forget about it...

283
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,416
That way...

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,083
You really expect me to forget
something like this...?

285
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,375
How much of an insensitive
jerk can you be?

286
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,166
Well, uh... I...

287
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,208
I thought it would be
easier not to talk about it.

288
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,416
I guess I'm pretty embarrassed
about what happened, too.

289
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,833
You're still a jerk.

290
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,583
She wasn't lying, then.

291
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,083
Her habit blew apart
when I touched it...

292
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,166
She must be involved
with supernatural powers

293
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,958
somehow or another.

294
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,125
All done!

295
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,083
Nice job... You look
like a pin cushion.

296
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:04,500
Who knows, maybe I'll
start a fashion trend.

297
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,708
Oh, crap... My class!

298
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,750
Sorry... I'm running late
for my remedial class...

299
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,458
What're you gonna do?

300
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,416
I can give you a key
if you wanna stay.

301
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,125
No... that's okay.

302
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,625
It's better if
I move on...

303
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,625
Otherwise, those people
will track me down here...

304
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,791
And I'm guessing
you'd prefer it

305
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,541
if your place didn't
get blown up.

306
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,333
Hey... wait!

307
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,500
Just a sec!

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,750
You wanna know
what I think?

309
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,833
About your power...

310
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,208
that right hand
of yours...

311
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,250
I think it cancels
out the grace of God

312
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,625
and everything that
goes along with it.

313
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,041
Your hand opposes the divine,

314
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,416
and without God's grace,

315
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,583
you're bound to meet with
ill fortune at every turn.

316
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,250
Rotten luck...

317
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,583
Well, if ya ask me...

318
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,041
being born with
that power of yours

319
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,583
is pretty much the most rotten
luck a person could have.

320
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250
Index...

321
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,708
What now...?

322
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,750
Is there anywhere safe you
can go after you leave here?

323
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,125
If I stay in one place,
they're gonna find me.

324
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,833
-But how?
-Like I showed you before,

325
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,666
my habit is imbued
with magic...

326
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,916
and because of that magic,

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,833
they're able to
track my location...

328
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,166
It'll be okay, though...

329
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,708
If I can just make
it to the church,

330
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,250
they will offer me sanctuary.

331
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,041
Why didn't you tell me...?

332
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,083
Knowing all that, how can
I let you leave here?

333
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,166
Come, now...

334
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,750
Do you really wanna
be dragged down

335
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,458
into the depths
of hell with me?

336
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,458
Goodbye.

337
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,083
If you run into
any more trouble,

338
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,500
you know where
you can find me!

339
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,583
Yep...! I'll come back
when I'm hungry again.

340
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,791
What are these things?
Agathions?

341
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,458
Oh, crap... my class!

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Academy City is pretty much
what it sounds like....

343
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
A city packed with colleges,
high schools, middle schools,

344
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,125
and elementary schools.

345
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,208
With a population of two
point three million,

346
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,958
it's one third the
size of Tokyo.

347
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,041
About 80% of the people
living here are students...

348
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,791
It's an unusual place
filled with unusual sights...

349
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,541
Like those cleaning robots
outside my place earlier...

350
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,916
Never a dull moment here.

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,291
All right everybody,
it's time to begin...

352
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,916
Welcome to remedial class!

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,416
I had a little spare time,

354
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,833
so I thought I'd write a pop
quiz for you to take today.

355
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,750
You'll want to do your
very best on it...

356
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,958
If your grade is poor,

357
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,791
you'll be playing a
game of no-eyed poker.

358
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,541
Oh yeah, I think I
remember that one...

359
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,958
She makes you play poker
with a blindfold on, right?

360
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,500
That's it. With
the added bonus

361
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,041
that you can't leave 'til you've
won ten hands in a row.

362
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,250
Ah, jeez...

363
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,583
The last time she
made us play that,

364
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,583
we were stuck here
almost until morning.

365
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,041
You're the exception
today, Kamijo.

366
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,875
You don't have enough
development points...

367
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,958
So you'll be
playing the game

368
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,666
whether you do well or not.

369
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,916
Our sweet teacher has totally
got a thing for you, man.

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,416
Are you too
blind to see it?

371
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,750
Shut up...

372
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,291
I don't think giving me
a lot of extra work to do

373
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,666
means she likes me.

374
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
Didn't you hear? She's
gonna keep you after school

375
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,458
to punish you...

376
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,416
You can't tell me that
doesn't sound kinda hot.

377
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,291
So you're a pervert
and a masochist...

378
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,208
a real stand-up guy.

379
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,750
There's a whole wide world of
lovely women out there...

380
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,708
Why would I wanna
limit myself?

381
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,916
You freak.

382
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,583
Quiet back there...!

383
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,333
Another word and you'll get
more than no-eyed poker...

384
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,500
There are some even
better games I know.

385
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,166
Do we understand
each other?

386
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,166
Rotten luck.

387
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,041
I wonder how
Index is doing.

388
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,041
She left her head dress
thing at my place.

389
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,083
And what was that
other thing she said...

390
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,125
something about a hundred
and three thousand books...

391
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,708
I didn't see a
single volume.

392
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,833
Weird... She swore she
was carrying them, but...

393
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,458
I bet she'll be back for
her stuff before long.

394
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,666
Teacher!

395
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,666
Kamijo is watching the
girls' tennis team

396
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,750
instead of paying
attention to you!

397
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,875
You made her cry...

398
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,750
You made her cry...

399
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,708
You made her cry...

400
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,458
You made her cry...

401
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,041
It is now past
student curfew...

402
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,666
All students, please return
to your homes immediately.

403
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,333
It is now past
student curfew...

404
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
Unbelievable.

405
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,208
I was stuck after
class that late...?

406
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,333
Stupid luck.

407
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,625
Ah...! There he is!

408
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,500
I found you,
and this time...

409
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,583
Come back here!

410
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,750
Listen! I'm talking to you...!

411
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,625
Stop walking already!

412
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,500
Oh, well. If it isn't
the little bug zapper.

413
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,708
Don't call me that!

414
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,708
I have a proper name,
thank you very much,

415
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,375
and it's Mikoto Misaka!

416
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll bet you've been
calling me bug zapper

417
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,583
behind my back ever since
we first met, haven't you?

418
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,208
Why are you here,
Zapper...?

419
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,541
You in remedial, too?

420
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,125
Remedial class? Never...!

421
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,416
I'm here to shock you full
of so much electricity

422
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,375
you'll twitch like a
frog struck by lightning!

423
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,166
If you have any last words,
say them now!

424
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll pass.

425
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,166
I don't think so!

426
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,333
Well, now...
How ya doin'...

427
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,333
did that wake
you up a bit?

428
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,625
You ready to fight me?

429
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,000
Give it a rest...!

430
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,916
Thanks to your little
lightning storm yesterday,

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,250
all my electrical
appliances are fried...

432
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,166
I've got a fridge
full of rotten food!

433
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,083
It's your own fault
for pissing me off!

434
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,416
What could I
possibly have done

435
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,208
to make you this
mad at me...?

436
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,833
I didn't so much as
lay a finger on you,

437
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,333
even after you
attacked me!

438
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,250
Exactly...! You haven't
hit me a single time...!

439
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,208
With no points scored on
either side, this is a draw.

440
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,625
Huh?

441
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,500
Okay, whatever.
You win already.

442
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Don't "whatever" me!

443
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,916
You should be taking
this seriously!

444
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh...

445
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,625
you want me to take
this seriously?

446
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,416
Is this day over yet...?

447
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,666
First a fake sorceress,

448
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,833
and now a
trigger-happy esper.

449
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,250
A sorceress?

450
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
Message... Message.

451
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,416
Aggressive EM
discharge detected...

452
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,958
System malfunction identified.

453
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,083
You idiot!

454
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,583
What were you thinking
zapping stuff around here?

455
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,000
Shut up!

456
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,041
Hurry, we need to
get out of here!

457
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,291
The cleaning robots?

458
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,083
What now...?

459
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,375
There shouldn't be anything to
clean in front of my place.

460
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,916
That's just my luck...

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,083
I should've known.

462
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,208
Hey, Index....

463
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,375
What're you
doing out here?

464
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,791
You can't sleep there.

465
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,500
No way...

466
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,625
This looks...
like blood.

467
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,666
Please just stay
with me, Index!

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,083
What happened...?!

469
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,416
Why are you here...?

470
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,791
Who did this to you?

471
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,583
Oh... that was us...

472
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,500
as in sorcerers.

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,958
[Music]

474
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:57,916
Stiyl Magnus...

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,916
That's the dirty
sorcerer's name...

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,250
Who are these people...?

477
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,500
What do they want?

478
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,750
Next time, "Innocentius.

479
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,500
"When science and
magic cross paths,

480
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,166
a story is born.
