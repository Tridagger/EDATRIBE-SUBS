1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,666
On a mission to rescue
the girl Aisa Himegami,

2
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,500
otherwise known
as Deep Blood,

3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,833
I accompanied a sorcerer

4
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,583
on a raid of the
Misawa Prep School...

5
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,500
Inside, the alchemist
Aureolus Izzard awaited us,

6
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,250
with a power
beyond imagining.

7
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,083
As if things weren't
complicated enough,

8
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,541
now it looks like
Index is in there...!

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,750
What's going on?

10
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:57,083
[Music]

11
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,791
Are you sure? Do you
really have some idea

12
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,250
where this bastard is hiding?

13
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,000
Of course. Do you think
I would just wander

14
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,041
through the hallways
of this place

15
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,666
with no clue
where I was going?

16
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,541
I have to admit,
it's scary...

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,333
If this guy can really bend
reality to fit his words...

18
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,500
Damn... How are we supposed
to get Himegami out...?

19
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,541
and for all we know, Index
is in here somewhere now, too.

20
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,250
Even supposing she did wander
in here for some reason,

21
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,833
he's not going to
launch an attack on her

22
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,125
like he did us...

23
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,583
I know that much.

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,875
Hold on!

25
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,833
What is it now?!

26
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,000
That's what it is...!
Why didn't I see it!

27
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,875
He's been in hiding
for three years now...

28
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,791
There are some
developments

29
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,958
that he wouldn't know about.

30
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,250
We live in a world of faith
and magic and alchemy...

31
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,250
Yet despite this, injustices
still go unpunished...

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,791
Sometimes justice can
only be found outside

33
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,166
the realm of men.

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,666
What do you mean?

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,750
Patience... In time,
you too will be released

36
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,791
from your earthly sorrows.

37
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,041
Soon, perhaps.

38
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,791
Now you must use the
sweet aroma of your blood

39
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,500
to call them.

40
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,958
Do what you were made for,

41
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,416
and call the vampires here
from their faraway darkness.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,041
My power will not
be used to hurt...

43
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
Not anymore.

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,625
Himegami!

45
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,875
Index!

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,583
Damn!

47
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,041
I have some bad news
for you, alchemist...

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,416
Your plan will
never succeed.

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,041
Oh... so you've
finally realized

50
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,875
what my intentions here are.

51
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,958
In that case, I expect you
will howl at your own impotence

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,583
when I achieve
what I mean to do.

53
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,666
A year ago I'd've done anything
to see your plan succeed...

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,291
but I tell you again...

55
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,875
nothing you do now will
help you to save her...

56
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,416
You can't do
anything for Index.

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,958
Index?

58
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,375
You speak out of jealousy

59
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,708
because you have failed
her in this... Not I...

60
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,041
I will not fail.

61
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,833
I will save her...

62
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,791
My Index.

63
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,583
She took the weight
of all the grimoires

64
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,791
upon her fragile shoulders...

65
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
She could never hope
to escape the spell

66
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,208
that was cast upon her.

67
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,916
But she has stayed strong.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,875
She accepts the fate
decreed by the church......

69
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,666
hoping her own curse would
be a blessing for others.

70
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,041
Hold on... this
guy knew Index?

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,625
You see...
the alchemist here

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,000
was once Index's
partner as well.

73
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,708
This year you
have that honor...

74
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,250
Last year it was me,
and three years ago...

75
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,291
It was this man...

76
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,083
Aurelous Izzard.

77
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,541
Index's survival

78
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,000
is contingent upon the
annual erasure of her memory.

79
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,208
Without that process,
she will die.

80
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,166
An inescapable fate...

81
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,791
one that her human
body couldn't fight...

82
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,000
However... If her
body was not human,

83
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,500
then things might
be different.

84
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,333
Vampires are unique in that
they are immortal beings...

85
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,666
They store the memories
of innumerable lifetimes

86
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,541
within their brains.

87
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,291
And all those memories
do not kill them...

88
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,416
No matter how many things
they have to remember,

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,833
their brains never lose
the power to function.

90
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,833
That's the plan, then...?

91
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,250
You want the vampires

92
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,791
to teach you how they
manage what Index cannot.

93
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,708
Just out of curiosity...

94
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,000
What if it turns out

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,375
their technique doesn't
work for humans?

96
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,041
Obviously...
for it to work,

97
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,125
I'll have to remove
Index from her body.

98
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,833
So you're going to turn
her into a vampire.

99
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,125
Is he crazy?

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,625
He's using magic
against esper students.

101
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,291
Bending Himegami to
his twisted will.

102
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,708
And now he's
planning this...?!

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,458
To turn Index
into a vampire?!

104
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,625
I must.

105
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,916
It may not be ideal,

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,291
but it's the only
way to save Index.

107
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,333
Of all people, you
should understand.

108
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,791
You have witnessed what is
done to her every year...

109
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,291
and you know the pain and
horror of that damned ritual.

110
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,583
Just before it happened,

111
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,750
she told me that she
didn't want to forget...

112
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,625
She said even if it meant
going against the church

113
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,958
and her own death,

114
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,125
she didn't want
the memories

115
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,500
she carried in her
heart to vanish...

116
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,791
She was in so much pain
she could barely move.

117
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,375
But she smiled and she told
me she wanted to remember!

118
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,625
Then, nothing I've said so far
has changed your mind... huh?

119
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,958
Well, in that case...

120
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,333
Would you like
to do the honors,

121
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,000
as her current partner...?

122
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,000
Why don't you tell
this misinformed hack

123
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,958
about the recent
change in Index?

124
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,416
Alchemist... you have no idea
what you're talking about.

125
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,791
What's that?
Don't you see yet?

126
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,333
You can't do anything because
she's already been saved...

127
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,708
and not by you.

128
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,875
The title of 'savior'
belongs to Toma Kamijo here.

129
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,041
He's already accomplished

130
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,541
what neither you nor
I were able to do...

131
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,583
but of course, you
couldn't have known that...

132
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,291
having turned your
back on the Church

133
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,208
and spent three years
in hiding underground.

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,166
Impossible. There's no way...

135
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,375
Not like this...
with that body...

136
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,500
Not by him...

137
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,166
This boy is no sorcerer...

138
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,583
He's no alchemist to
possess such power!

139
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,291
What could someone
like him do?!

140
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,625
It's an unfortunate fact.

141
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,583
And an unsavory topic for
a member of Necessarius

142
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,041
so I won't speak
at length...

143
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,625
but essentially...

144
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,083
his right hand is something
known as Imagine Breaker...

145
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,375
Despite his appearance,

146
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
he possesses
significant power.

147
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,083
If what you say
is true, then...

148
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,958
That's right. All of your
efforts and sacrifices

149
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,916
have come to nothing
in the end...

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,791
but that shouldn't
matter to you...

151
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,250
Index is living a
very happy life now.

152
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,250
A happy life with the
partner who saved her.

153
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,000
It's what you always
wanted her to have.

154
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,583
Toma...

155
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,458
To... ma...

156
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,250
I'm here, Index!

157
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,833
Toma...

158
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,333
I'm really hungry.

159
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,916
An apple...

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,708
A juicy, red apple...

161
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,333
sounds tasty...

162
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,583
Perfect timing.

163
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,208
You will fall to the
floor, intruders!

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,166
You come in here and
trample my emotions.

165
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,625
You sneer at my travails.

166
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,708
Very well...

167
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,375
You will pay for
this humiliation...

168
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,208
You will pay with
your pathetic lives!

169
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,250
Stop, now!

170
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,041
Himegami! Careful!

171
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,833
I get it... I do...

172
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,708
I know what
you're feeling.

173
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,708
He'll hurt you...

174
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,041
he...

175
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,458
But this is wrong...

176
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,583
You cannot do this.

177
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,583
He... doesn't need you.

178
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,083
You cannot...
Just think...

179
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,083
It isn't you.

180
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,583
And I know the real you.

181
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,875
Die.

182
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
Himegami!

183
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,250
I wanted magic.

184
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,916
My foolishness
called them.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,375
I'm sorry,
my sweet Aisa...

186
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,125
I'm so sorry!

187
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,041
And then before my eyes...

188
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,083
They all...

189
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,291
just disappeared.

190
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,291
They're all dead...

191
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,250
They are dead
because of me.

192
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,625
I didn't want to hurt
people anymore...

193
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,166
never again.

194
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,916
Is it true?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,250
Can you really use my
blood to save someone...?

196
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,625
And no one will get hurt
because of me again?

197
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,333
There wasn't so much as the
hint of a lie in his smile.

198
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,666
No malice...

199
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,041
Just a simple wish...

200
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,375
to save somebody
he deeply loved.

201
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,458
And so...

202
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,416
I helped him.

203
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,791
Himegami!

204
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,000
Her existence is no
longer necessary.

205
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,958
And as you can see, I've
even kept my promise to her...

206
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,708
As she wished, I
have set the girl free

207
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
from the misfortune
of her sweet blood.

208
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,750
What?... You've somehow
managed to negate my Ars Magna?

209
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
Impossible...

210
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Her death should've
been irreversible...

211
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
What kind of sacred
power do you have

212
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,916
embedded in that
hand of yours?

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,875
Stop your deranged
babbling...

214
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,750
You've clearly
been defeated.

215
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,583
It's time to give up.

216
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,875
But...

217
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,208
If you insist on believing

218
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,666
that you can
manipulate reality...

219
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,791
then I guess it's up to me

220
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,333
to show you how
wrong you are!

221
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,916
This floor is really cold.

222
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,375
You will choke.

223
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,041
Electrocute.

224
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,833
Be crushed.

225
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,583
It works... It
nullifies every attack.

226
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,083
So it is true...

227
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,750
Your hand's the
genuine article.

228
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,875
It is consistently able to
cancel out my Ars Magna attacks.

229
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,208
In which case, all I have
to do is use an attack

230
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,375
that your hand
cannot touch

231
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,916
and therefore
cannot nullify.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,916
In my hand, a
gun will appear.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,416
It will be loaded
with magic bullets,

234
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,666
any one of which may
carry your death inside it.

235
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,000
The bullets will travel faster
than the human eye can see.

236
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,750
The shooting will
now commence.

237
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,958
Did you think I'd let
you die so easily?

238
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,791
I'd like to see you
squirm a bit longer.

239
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,791
Magnify previous order!

240
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,958
Ten pistols, with
simultaneous fire!

241
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,916
I told you, I wasn't
done toying with you yet.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,958
Damn.

243
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,250
That was practice ...

244
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,333
Now I'll show you what
my pistols can really do.

245
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,083
Well, what do you know?

246
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,041
You do seem to be
able to use words

247
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,250
to manipulate reality
in any way you wish.

248
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,791
Obviously... Ars Magna
is the strongest power

249
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,875
an alchemist can have...

250
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
I can do anything I...

251
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,583
Oh, really?

252
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,166
If so... what could you
possibly need Deep Blood for?

253
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,666
Why would you need her to
attract vampires for you...?

254
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,291
Couldn't you just create
them, without using her?

255
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,000
All it would take is a
few words from you, right?

256
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,625
So why didn't you
do it, alchemist...?

257
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,875
Why didn't you create vampires
using your Ars Magna...?

258
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,375
For that matter,

259
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,833
why would you even need
them at all if you could...

260
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,083
Into the air, you
meddling sorcerer!

261
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,875
Stiyl no!!

262
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,291
I'm wondering...

263
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,416
if there might be
limitations to your power.

264
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,541
Your skin will be
torn from your body!

265
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,041
That's it...!

266
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,208
I see what
Stiyl was doing.

267
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,833
If Izzard can make anything
he wishes become reality...

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,875
Then why the
elaborate plan?

269
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,333
Why didn't he use his
power to save Index?

270
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,083
I'm bored with
this game...

271
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,458
I believe I'll
switch weapons.

272
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,000
He didn't do it because
he didn't believe he could.

273
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,833
I'll destroy you
with a sword instead.

274
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,291
He didn't believe, so he
couldn't say the words.

275
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,541
Obviously...

276
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,750
the source of your
self-assurance

277
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,041
is your right hand,

278
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,833
which is also the only
weapon you have.

279
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,791
I think I understand now.

280
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,541
It's quite clear that my
first course of action

281
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,625
must be chopping
off your right arm.

282
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,375
His power to manipulate reality
with words isn't absolute...

283
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,750
It can be undermined.

284
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,041
For this last attack...

285
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,166
my spinning sword
will sever your arm.

286
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,916
He's... laughing?!

287
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,375
What's going on?

288
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,666
Who is this person?

289
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,625
I have a pistol.

290
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,041
It is combined
with a sword.

291
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
It will remove the
head of my opponent.

292
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Commence second
spinning blade attack!

293
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,000
No...! Repeat the attack!

294
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,291
Multiplying spinning
blade ten-fold!

295
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,541
An endless array of
executioner's blades.

296
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
Dismember his
body immediately!

297
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,125
No...! Impossible...!

298
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,041
He's a mere human...
not even a sorcerer!

299
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,583
Hey, I have a
question, alchemist...

300
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
Honestly...

301
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,000
did you think you were
going to win...?

302
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
Did you really expect to
defeat Imagine Breaker

303
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,416
with an attack as
pathetic as that one?

304
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,291
You can't work your alchemy

305
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,583
without using those
needles, can you...?

306
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,541
You rely on them to keep any
stray thoughts from interfering.

307
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,958
Is something wrong...?

308
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,666
Come on now, use your words.

309
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,250
-Stay back!
-Why aren't you fighting...?

310
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
Can't you control me?

311
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,041
Stay... back!...!

312
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,291
No!

313
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,041
This cannot be...!

314
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,750
My Ars Magna is failing me
when I need it most!

315
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,458
Stop it! Don't think that!

316
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,958
You cannot think that!

317
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,333
No... don't question...!

318
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,333
Believe...! With the power I
have, they can't beat me!

319
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,041
I can defeat them!

320
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,000
You're no match
for me, alchemist.

321
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,583
I've figured it out...

322
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,625
I know the secret
of Ars Magna...

323
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,333
Your power is not making
your words into reality.

324
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
This boy is a monster!

325
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,208
No, your power is making
what you believe into reality,

326
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,791
and now that I know that,
I will crush you!

327
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,875
I'm impressed that it
reattached so cleanly.

328
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,125
Your body must be
fantastically adaptable.

329
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,250
Don't look at me, Doc,

330
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,083
you're the one
who reattached it.

331
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,708
You've been urgently
hospitalized twice

332
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,458
in only ten days...

333
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,000
What is it? Do you have
a thing for the nurses?

334
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,583
What are you
talking about...?

335
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,291
Do you really think I
would cut off my own arm

336
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,708
just to flirt
with some girls?

337
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,375
Oh... for a moment there

338
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,291
I thought we might have
something in common...

339
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,416
Never mind.

340
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,458
Yeah...

341
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,333
What a cliché...

342
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,541
He became a doctor because
of the cute nurses?

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,291
He's a better doctor
than you'd think

344
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,625
from looking at him.

345
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,875
Yeah, I guess.

346
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,166
I'm not trying to get
all cozy or anything.

347
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,416
But I thought maybe I should
come see how you were.

348
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh... sure.

349
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,666
What is it?

350
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:07,958
The dragon?

351
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,375
It's nothing...

352
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,416
Just the manifestation
of the desperate terror

353
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,041
Aureolus felt
at the time.

354
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,083
What happened to the
alchemist, anyway?

355
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,666
Well, for starters he's
lost all of his memories...

356
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,291
and the ability
to use magic.

357
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,708
I didn't want his death
on my conscience...

358
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,875
so I changed
his appearance

359
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,916
and turned him
loose outside...

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,250
It was pretty tricky
getting him out

361
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,958
without the Knights
seeing him, though.

362
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,458
Oh, okay.

363
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,000
Word is that Misawa Prep
School has been shut down...

364
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,291
I was going to say
thanks for everything...

365
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,208
but now it seems kind
of absurd, you know...?

366
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,000
After all, in the end
you merely got Aureolus

367
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,000
to bring ruin
down on himself.

368
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,875
If anything, you
should be thanking me

369
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
for my superb
acting talent.

370
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,208
It wasn't easy though...

371
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,583
Surely even you have
to admit that much...

372
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,750
My arm was cut off,

373
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,250
and I had to act like
it hadn't happened

374
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
to keep our bluff going.

375
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,166
The pain must've
been intense enough

376
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,458
to put you in a
state of shock.

377
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,958
Thanks to that, you could just
do what needed to be done,

378
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,958
kind of like Aureolus
and his needles.

379
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,583
Do not compare me
to that psycho!

380
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,958
I mean, how crazy can
one guy possibly be?

381
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,750
He comes up with
some twisted magic...

382
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,208
And then tries to
conjure up vampires...

383
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,708
because he wanted
to save her...

384
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,000
to save Index.

385
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,000
So... he was her partner
three years ago, huh?

386
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,166
Toma!

387
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
Toma!

388
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
I know what you were up to.

389
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,666
-Up to?
-That's right.

390
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,375
I know you risked your life
in a fight to save Aisa.

391
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,083
Aisa...?

392
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,833
Oh, you're talking about that
freaky pseudo-magician girl...?

393
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,083
Wait a second,
who did you hear that from?

394
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,625
I'd think it
would be obvious.

395
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,666
That was rude...
I'm no freak.

396
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,958
Oh, hi, Himegami...

397
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,458
I, uh, didn't expect to
see you here with Index.

398
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
It's not like I wanted
her to come with me

399
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,000
to visit you in
your sick bed.

400
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,375
But she kept saying
over and over

401
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,583
how desperate she
was to thank you.

402
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,958
Why did you do it?

403
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,166
You helped me...
I don't know why...

404
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,666
You could've died...
for some stranger.

405
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,166
I'm just some random girl

406
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,541
you met one day in a
fast food restaurant.

407
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,166
I don't see why I need a
reason to help somebody.

408
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,208
So anyway...
here's the deal...

409
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,791
Quit talking with
your mouth full.

410
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,041
And do you think you could
get off my lap already?

411
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,166
Listen to me.

412
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,541
After a lot of discussion,

413
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,083
it looks like the Church has
decided to take in Aisa.

414
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,083
Hey, hold on...

415
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,208
Are you talking about
the actual church

416
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,708
or your crazy Walking
Church robes?

417
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,000
I can never tell with you.

418
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,166
Sphinx! Where are
you running off to?

419
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,333
You can't bring a cat
with you to the hospital!

420
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,750
I told her she
would be better off

421
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,041
just leaving him
at the apartment.

422
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,583
Hey, by the way
you're talking

423
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,541
it sounds like you've
already been to my place!

424
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,875
Come back!

425
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,833
You come back here right
this minute, Sphinx!

426
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,250
Could we have some
peace and quiet in here?!

427
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,208
What are you doing?
Are you insane...?

428
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,416
Oh, geez, look what
he's done to the wall...!

429
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,958
You never should have
brought him here!

430
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,958
Damn, rotten luck!!

431
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:32,041
[Music]

432
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,125
Something seems off when I run
into this girl named Misaka

433
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,541
and her identical sister...

434
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,125
There's some strange guy
following the sister around...

435
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,375
What? He's a Level 5 esper?!

436
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,166
Next time, "Mikoto Misaka."

437
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,791
When science and
magic cross paths,

438
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,291
a story is born.
