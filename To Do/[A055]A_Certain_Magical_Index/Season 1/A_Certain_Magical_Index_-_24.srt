1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,916
I'm okay with
being a monster...

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,458
It's because I'm a monster
that I didn't die,

3
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,041
even after everything that
stone creature did to me.

4
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,208
And it's because
I'm a monster

5
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,125
that I'm able to stand
up to that giant

6
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,416
and take another
beating if I have to.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,583
I will do it...

8
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,375
I will protect the
people I care about,

9
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,583
no matter what.

10
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,958
That's why I've made
peace with it all...

11
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,250
That's why I'm glad
to be a monster.

12
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,083
Damn it...! I'm not
gonna let it happen!

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,583
Wha...!

14
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,958
Kazakiri!!

15
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,958
She won't come to
such a senseless end.

16
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,208
I'm gonna do something!

17
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:20,000
[Music]

18
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,750
If you're looking for Ellis,
I sent him on ahead.

19
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,083
And unless I miss my guess,

20
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,333
he should be arriving
at his target right now.

21
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,791
Of course, maybe...

22
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,375
he's already taken care
of what I sent him to do.

23
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,708
Damn you...

24
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,166
Good, you're angry...

25
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,416
You can stay here
and fight me, then...

26
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,208
I let the girl
go on her way.

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,000
You mean Kazakiri?

28
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,041
You can defeat Ellis,

29
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,125
but you won't do
so well against me.

30
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,750
Simple. Because
I want to start a war.

31
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,375
So why are you so intent
upon stirring up trouble?

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,541
Science and magic are evenly
balanced at the moment,

33
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,541
aren't they...?

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,458
Why do this now?!

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,000
Espers can't use magic
without consequences.

36
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,458
When they do, it
destroys their bodies...

37
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,750
Were you aware of
that, I wonder?

38
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,250
I am.

39
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,375
Didn't you ever wonder
how we first found out

40
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,625
about that particular little
wrench in the works?

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,083
Twenty years ago,

42
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,666
the dual use of power was
attempted for the first time ...

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
A certain movement arose.

44
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,125
Its members were curious

45
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,583
about what would happen
if science and magic

46
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,541
were used together.

47
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,750
They tried to give
rise to a new crafter,

48
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,083
one who could combine
sorcery and psychic powers...

49
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,958
Can you guess the result?

50
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,000
Ellis has been my
companion for a long time.

51
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,250
He was an esper who was
brought to Academy City

52
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,541
by one of the factions

53
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,291
who wanted to experiment
with science and magic.

54
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,208
I'd been in charge of
teaching him spells,

55
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,541
and thanks to them,
he had become a mess.

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,250
Knights came to bring
down the facility

57
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,583
where we were working.

58
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,875
Ellis tried to buy
me time to escape...

59
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,916
He was struck by
a mace and died.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,541
Our two kinds should've
remained segregated!

61
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,083
Magicians with magicians.

62
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,291
Scientists with scientists!

63
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,208
If we don't maintain
our separate domains,

64
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,625
the same thing will
happen again and again.

65
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,833
We'll lose more lives!

66
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,958
Please...! You're talking
at cross-purposes, here...

67
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,541
If what you want
is to save lives,

68
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,208
then why the hell are
you starting a war?!

69
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,125
No... that's not what you're
really trying to do, is it?

70
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,250
You just need to give
them a good scare.

71
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,291
For your purposes, all
you have to do is make it

72
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,791
so that a war
almost breaks out.

73
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,416
I suppose now you think you
have the right to judge me?

74
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,625
I won't take it from you.

75
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,958
Wipe that look
off your face!

76
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,458
The ground itself
is my ally...

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,083
And here we are, in a tunnel,
trapped beneath the earth.

78
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,500
This is my territory!

79
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,875
No! She's bringing
the whole place down?

80
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,208
Let it all crumble.

81
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,708
Let the earth rain down!

82
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,458
Damn...! What now?

83
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,875
If you know so
much, Toma...

84
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,333
When performing the ceremony

85
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,958
to create a Telesmatic Image

86
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,333
to be used as an idol for the
English Church of the Cross,

87
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
what role is played
by the direction

88
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,708
and the position
of the caster?

89
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,750
-That's it!
-Swallow up the fool!

90
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,625
Mix him into the mud!

91
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,250
The circles on the
walls and ceiling

92
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,625
are designed
to bury me alive.

93
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,791
I will crush you until your
body is no more than a memory!

94
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,250
Which means...

95
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,583
The circles on the ground
have a different purpose.

96
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,125
This circle...
isn't made to attack!

97
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,083
It's there to keep
her protected!

98
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,041
What?!

99
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,166
He stopped it?

100
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,958
Damn...

101
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,208
Damn you.

102
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,250
I have work to do...

103
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,250
I have to set the stage
for a war between the sides.

104
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,458
Academy City's guard has
grown lax in recent years...

105
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,500
Even the English Puritan Church
has become presumptuous

106
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,291
enough to allow their grimoire
index to be held elsewhere...

107
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,375
The stage is set just
as it was for Ellis.

108
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,125
His tragedy was because
of a situation like this.

109
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,500
If this blindness grows
to where it encompasses

110
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
all of Academy City along
with the entire Church...

111
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,208
What crap.

112
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,791
I get that you're angry...

113
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,541
I get that
you're grieving.

114
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,083
But even so...

115
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,833
What has Kazakiri
ever done to you?

116
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,416
Or Index, for that matter?!

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,125
How do you think you're
gonna make anything better

118
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,416
by having innocent people
pay for what's happened?

119
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,083
You don't understand.

120
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,750
Damn it...

121
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,000
it would be easier

122
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,708
to just kill all the
sorcerers and scientists.

123
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,958
But it's more
complicated than that...!

124
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,041
If I had a choice,
I wouldn't want the two sides

125
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,041
fighting each other
any more than you do!

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,416
But from the
very beginning...

127
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,083
all of this had
me so conflicted!

128
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,250
I'm torn in so
many directions...

129
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,125
I don't know
which to choose.

130
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,375
Then why complicate it...?

131
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
You've always had
one true conviction.

132
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,166
Your direction hasn't
changed at all.

133
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,541
At your core...
everything you did

134
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,000
was because you regretted
the loss of your friend.

135
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,583
Did you ever stop to look at
my relationship with Index?

136
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,541
We're from separate
sides, you know.

137
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,250
Did you think our
friendship was doomed

138
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,291
because we didn't preserve
our own territories?

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,291
We could live
together forever

140
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,125
and nothing like
that would happen.

141
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,375
Ask yourself...

142
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,208
What gives you the right
to take my friend away?!

143
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,541
Intimus 115!

144
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,708
What?!

145
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,333
I was right.

146
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,916
You told me how conflicted
you were for a reason.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,041
You'll see, esper.

148
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm going to destroy you!

149
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,250
I understand what
you're doing now.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,125
Somewhere inside, what
you desperately want...

151
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
is for somebody to stop you!

152
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,208
This isn't good...

153
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,208
He switched from
remote to self-control.

154
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,875
I can't intercept anymore!

155
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,291
Nothing...

156
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,041
Can... reach my
dear Ellis now.

157
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,333
Ellis...

158
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,333
Kazakiri...

159
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,208
Index...!

160
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,875
Toma...

161
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,958
Hyoka?!

162
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,458
What's... that?

163
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,166
Run!

164
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,625
Hurry and get
out of here...

165
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,666
It's too dangerous...

166
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,083
You have to go.

167
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,291
The golem is out
of control...

168
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,666
He may not be able to
manage his regeneration.

169
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,625
Come on! Let's get
out of here, Hyoka!

170
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,708
I need to stay...

171
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,916
You get out of here.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,333
What do you mean stay...?

173
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,916
What are you
planning to do?

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,625
I... have to
stop the monster.

175
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,375
No you can't...!

176
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
You don't seriously believe
you can defeat that thing,

177
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,666
do you Hyoka?

178
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,000
If you fight it head on,
there's no way you'll survive!

179
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,250
It's all right...

180
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,250
I'm no more human than
this stone monster.

181
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,708
I'm really sorry...

182
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,291
for not telling you
about it 'til now.

183
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,916
Hyoka!

184
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,250
To fight a monster,
you have to send a monster...

185
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,666
I accept that now.

186
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,958
I can never go back to
that place in time...

187
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,416
I'm so glad it happened,

188
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,875
but it isn't where I belong.

189
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,958
But even so...

190
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,166
I won't sacrifice the
memory without a fight!

191
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,250
Hyoka!

192
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,416
I have to...

193
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,541
Index is my friend!

194
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,833
Kazakiri!!

195
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,500
Toma!

196
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,958
I told you.

197
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,625
I told you I was
gonna prove that

198
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,791
it didn't matter
if you're human.

199
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,125
You're still our friend!

200
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,041
And I won't let
it end like this!

201
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,583
It's over...

202
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,000
The illusion is done...

203
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,083
but it was so nice
while it lasted.

204
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
Whoa... what a mess!

205
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,083
What in the world
went on here?

206
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,416
Oh, let me guess...

207
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,708
This is your doing.

208
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,625
I suppose I should be
getting used to it,

209
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,208
but I'm still curious...

210
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,000
how much trouble
are you in this time?

211
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,083
Is... is something wrong?

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,625
Oh, Sissy, I've
been so worried.

213
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,458
Where have you...

214
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,791
This is quite a mess...

215
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,166
Are you responsible?

216
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,708
No, of course not!

217
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,083
Given the state
of this place,

218
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,500
Judgment or Antiskill
will be here before long...

219
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,375
Let's go before
there's any trouble...

220
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,458
Did you hear me?!

221
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,916
I told you,
I didn't have anything...

222
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,208
I knew all along...

223
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,000
I knew that things
would turn out this way.

224
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,125
I mean, I'd have to
be an idiot not to...

225
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,166
How else could I expect
other people to respond

226
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,041
when they found out
what I really am?

227
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,250
It isn't what I wanted,
you know, not at all...

228
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,208
but what other choice
could I have made?

229
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,833
She's my friend...

230
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,708
the only person who has ever
called me their friend before...

231
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,291
so I wanted to save her.

232
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,916
But I wish...

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,541
I wish I didn't have to
lose her now, that's all.

234
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,583
I wish... she didn't
have to be afraid of me.

235
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,458
I... I had to...

236
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,791
I had to...!

237
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,000
I couldn't stand to see
my friend get hurt...

238
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,666
so I showed her
that I'm a monster.

239
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,333
There was no other way.

240
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,500
I just stood up to that
giant with all I could.

241
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,750
I wanted us to be
friends forever...

242
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,833
We got along so well,
I was so sure we could be...

243
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,333
but now...

244
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,250
Now that obviously isn't
going to happen, huh...?

245
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,666
I made that sacrifice...

246
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,125
I had to save her...

247
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,541
Even if she hates me...

248
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,583
I couldn't stand
by and let her die!

249
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,416
Does it hurt?

250
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,250
Are you sad?

251
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,208
If that's the case...

252
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,833
then you're no
monster at all.

253
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,166
As far as I know,

254
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,916
monsters don't experience
any emotions...

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,875
You're just as
human as I am...

256
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,291
and you can quote me on that.

257
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,916
And one more thing.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,125
Some friendships don't
go away that easily.

259
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,791
She's here?

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,916
But how...?
There's no way...

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,750
This must just be
another illusion.

262
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,125
I'm just a thing,
a creature.

263
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,125
How can she be looking
at me like that...?

264
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,833
That's the kind of
way you look at someone

265
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,416
you really care about...

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,833
You don't get
that angry...

267
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,250
unless you're a friend...

268
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,041
Unless you know
you'll make up.

269
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,625
So maybe you're a
little strange...

270
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,958
Your body's put
together differently

271
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,500
than other peoples' are...

272
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,750
and you can do some things
the rest of us can't...

273
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,833
So what?

274
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,458
Hyoka!

275
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,333
We're all weird
in our own way...

276
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,541
And it looks to me like
you're still Index's friend...

277
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,875
wouldn't you say?

278
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,125
Are you happy
with yourself?

279
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,416
You are now even closer
to the completion of a key

280
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,541
to controlling the Imaginary
Number School District's

281
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,166
Five-Element Agency.

282
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,666
Honestly, sometimes I wonder

283
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,916
just what exactly
you're up to.

284
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,458
You figured out that the
Imaginary Number School District

285
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,041
was actually an
AIM diffusion field.

286
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,333
Who would dream that up?

287
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,375
Then you take it
a step further

288
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,958
and plant a sense of self into
the key to help it materialize?

289
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,541
Are you crazy or a genius...?

290
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,875
I'd really like to know what
you're thinking, Aleister.

291
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,208
Hold on...

292
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,958
The Imaginary Number
School District

293
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,375
is an accumulation of power

294
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,000
that exists in a different
realm than humanity.

295
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,916
The life that is formed as
the result of that power...

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,916
Such a life...

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,333
can only be
called one thing.

298
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,166
An angel.

299
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,458
And if there is a whole city

300
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,375
like the Imaginary
Number School district

301
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,041
populated by beings
like Kazakiri...

302
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,416
beings who can only be
referred to as angels...

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,125
that means...

304
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,000
So that's what you're
doing, you old schemer.

305
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,708
You're creating an artificial
Heaven, aren't you?!

306
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,875
You'll find that I have no
comment on such topics

307
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,708
as Heaven and angels.

308
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,041
Oh, that's rich...

309
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,166
There's no one who knows
more about it than you do.

310
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,000
So don't even try,
Crowley the Sorcerer.

311
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,125
This incident's been designed

312
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,000
to gradually derail the
stability of the world...

313
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,250
You lured a member of the
English Puritan Church here,

314
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,541
and then saw to it that
she was gotten rid of.

315
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,750
I don't pretend to know
your ultimate plan.

316
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,375
However...

317
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,166
If you're going to keep using
Imagine Breaker, be prepared.

318
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,000
He doesn't like people who
go against his convictions,

319
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,875
and that right hand could devour
your world with its power.

320
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,416
Regrettably...

321
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,750
the world that I believed in
fell apart a very long time ago.

322
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,250
That's right,
take a good look.

323
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,791
I didn't even have to be
hospitalized this time...!

324
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,708
Man, am I awesome or what...?

325
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,000
I think this shows that
I've made some progress...

326
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,125
Don't you agree?

327
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,333
Enough gloating...!

328
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,041
You really have no
grasp on reality!

329
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,291
Do you have any idea

330
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,125
how much trouble you
cause for other people

331
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,458
when you get yourself into
these scrapes Kamijo?!

332
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,958
Bothering Antiskill with
your antics is a new low,

333
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,208
even for you!

334
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,166
I believe I told you to be
careful around Hyoka Kazakiri...

335
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,625
How explicit do
I have to be?

336
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
You seem to perpetually
get into trouble

337
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,833
whenever you're
around girls...

338
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,375
Perhaps you should consider
a psychological evaluation

339
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,375
at some point.

340
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,791
Um, Doctor...

341
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,458
I feel that my life is being
threatened at the moment.

342
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,416
Perhaps I could
check myself in...?

343
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,916
You know, with orders for
peace and quiet and no visitors?

344
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,833
Um, Index...

345
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,416
Your skirt is kind of...

346
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,541
Aren't you
going to fix it?

347
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,041
Does it really
look that weird?

348
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,416
Yes, it is
sort of weird...

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,791
It's very weird,
in fact...

350
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,250
It was strange
when I first saw it...

351
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,541
but now I think
it's even more strange.

352
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,000
You're saying
I look strange.

353
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,291
That was strange...

354
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,375
Hyoka...?

355
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,458
Yeah.

356
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,958
The best way I can explain

357
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,041
is that my body is like a
big mass of psychic energy.

358
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291
Nothing I do will
change the fact

359
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,250
that I'm an unstable being.

360
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,625
That's just the
way I was created.

361
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,083
Is that why you couldn't
touch Toma's right hand?

362
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,166
Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,833
I couldn't come in
contact with it at all...

364
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,458
After even a
second-long touch

365
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,291
I would've vanished
without a trace.

366
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, there's
something else.

367
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,625
I did notice something
about his power...

368
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,416
I don't think I know how to
put it into words, exactly...

369
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,583
But I know there's
something more to it

370
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,083
than just esper ability.

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,458
All right, then.

372
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,458
Hyoka...?

373
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,458
Sorry, Index...

374
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,666
I have to go now.

375
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,375
Don't go!

376
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,166
Come on, there's
nothing to worry about.

377
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,791
Don't forget that my
body is composed

378
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,166
of the combined powers
of many different people.

379
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,750
I may disappear
for a while.

380
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,375
But it's not
like I'm dying...

381
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,458
It just means that you
won't be able to see me.

382
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,541
But even though you
might not know it...

383
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,375
I'll always be
by your side...

384
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,000
no matter what happens.

385
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,958
Hyoka!

386
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,916
Promise me...

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,250
We'll have fun
together again.

388
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,125
Of course!

389
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:22,166
[Music]

390
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,333
The thing is I'm really busy
during second term you know?

391
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,958
But what am I supposed to do?

392
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,750
I'm dying of
boredom, here!

393
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,666
Toma's all busy and not
paying attention to me, jerk!

394
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,083
So you see this
is what people mean

395
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,875
when they say
someone is magic...

396
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,541
Pretty sexy,
don't you think?

397
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,000
Right, Hime, you can be
sexy like that, can't you?

398
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,666
I see... like this?

399
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,166
All right, kids!

400
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,333
Let's get class started
without further delay!

401
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,041
Huh? Where's Tsuchimikado
this morning?

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,375
Yeah, that's right...

403
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,500
Don't worry about it.

404
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm on it.

405
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,791
So my job is to look
after these two?

406
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,166
Please. I would appreciate that.

407
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,541
Oh... How careless of me...!

408
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,041
My ribbon's drifting
into the shower,

409
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,375
right where Sissy is!

410
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,166
Kuroko!

411
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,541
There is a situation

412
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:56,166
which requires the assistance
of the grimoire index.

413
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,791
Have her "manager"
come as well, please.

414
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,750
"Manager,"... sure...

415
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,416
I'll see that it's done...

416
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,708
Kanzaki and I should
be able to leave soon.

417
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,958
About that...

418
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,958
We've been unable
to reach Kanzaki.

419
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,500
What do you mean, Archbishop...?

420
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,125
Is she out of touch?

421
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,166
Mmm... Given the
way I am attired,

422
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,875
you needn't
address me as such.

423
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,958
We can forego the title.

424
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,916
My name is Laura Stewart...

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
For now, I think
that will suffice.

426
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,666
Um... hello?

427
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,500
You still alive there?

428
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,958
Just barely...

429
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,583
You forgot that the refrigerator
was a desolate wasteland,

430
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,375
didn't you, Toma?

431
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:48,083
And you were going to eat that
sandwich all by yourself, eh?

432
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,791
No, no, this isn't what
it looks like at all!

433
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,250
Oh? Because it looks like
you have food and I don't!

434
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,208
I'm hungry,
do you hear me?!

435
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,125
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

436
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,708
Stupid luck!
