1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,500
The first day
of summer vacation

2
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,750
turned out to be
an eventful one...

3
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,583
A young sister
calling herself Index

4
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,458
showed up hanging
from my balcony railing.

5
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,833
She said she
was being chased

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,666
by some sort of
magical society.

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,666
But that's absurd...

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,791
This is Academy City,

9
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,166
a town of science,
not magic!

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,541
[Music]

11
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:05,333
Innocentius
The Witch Hunter King

12
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,708
No way...

13
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,875
This looks like...
like blood.

14
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,250
Please just stay
with me, Index!

15
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,583
What happened...?!
Why are you here...?

16
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,000
Who did this to you?

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,291
Oh... that was us...

18
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,500
as in sorcerers.

19
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,708
And it looks like they've
done a really ugly number

20
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,541
-on her again.
-But why?

21
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,208
First ask what her reason
was for returning ...

22
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,333
Perhaps she came back here

23
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,166
because she left
something behind.

24
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
She was wearing a
hood yesterday...

25
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, where could that
have gone, I wonder?

26
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,041
They tracked the magical
power of the hood

27
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,000
back to my place.

28
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,041
Come now...

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,541
Do you really
wanna be dragged down

30
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,750
into the depths
of hell with me?

31
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,625
She risked her own life to
come back here for the hood...

32
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,000
just to keep
a total stranger

33
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
from getting caught
up in her trouble.

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,291
How could she
be so foolish?

35
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,333
Oh, calm down...

36
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,458
There's no need
to look at me

37
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,291
like I'm some
kind of a monster.

38
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,708
I'm not the one who
carved her up like that...

39
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,958
and I'm fairly certain
that Kanzaki didn't mean

40
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,458
to make such a bloody
mess of her flesh, either.

41
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,250
Her habit is a
Walking Church.

42
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,958
It should provide
absolute defense.

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,250
And yet somehow
it got all torn up.

44
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,958
How could you?

45
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,541
Magic has never
seemed like any more

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,416
than a fairy tale to me...

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,916
and I don't put
much stock in the idea

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,791
of a magical society.

49
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,041
But you... You
look human enough.

50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,166
Don't you know the difference
between right and wrong?

51
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,041
A little girl comes
here for her hood...

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,208
You and your friends
hunt her down like a dog...

53
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,791
and do this to her...

54
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,916
Is your soul so utterly
corrupt you can't understand

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,208
how wrong what
you've done is?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you're finished
with your lecture,

57
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,958
could you please step aside...?

58
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,041
I'm here for that.

59
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,375
For...

60
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,500
"that?"

61
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,166
Well... "those"
to be accurate...

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,458
The grimoires...

63
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,291
The hundred and three
thousand very important

64
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,916
volumes young Index
carries with her everywhere.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,750
You really should
be more careful...

66
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,000
Those books can be
extremely dangerous...

67
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,833
Reading so much
as a single volume

68
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,791
would cripple a boy
such as yourself.

69
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,875
Look... I'm tired of
being screwed with...

70
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,916
Where are these
supposed books?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,500
They're right there...
next to you...

72
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,333
Inside her head.

73
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,791
Index is one of the few people
with a photographic memory...

74
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,833
She only has to
see something once

75
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,916
and it's memorized
word-for-word inside her head.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,875
Essentially, her
brain's a library...

77
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,708
The grimoires
are locked safely

78
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,041
in places around the world...

79
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,250
but she's read them all

80
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,083
and stored their
contents in her mind.

81
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,083
But as she herself
doesn't have the power

82
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,375
to conjure magic
she remains harmless.

83
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,875
As I have already
told you though,

84
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,750
the volumes that she carries
are a bit dangerous...

85
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,416
So, I'm here...
We had to locate her

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,625
so we could take charge
of the grimoires.

87
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,291
We wouldn't want them to
fall into the wrong hands.

88
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,208
Take... charge...?

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,375
That's right...

90
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm here... to take her...

91
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,250
get it...?

92
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,000
It doesn't matter how
honest and loyal she is.

93
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,916
Anyone can be broken if
tortured for long enough.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,833
Think of this poor girl
in the hands of people

95
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,958
who'd do anything
to know what she knows.

96
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,916
Breaks your
heart, doesn't it?

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,583
Why, you...! Who do
you think you are? !

98
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,500
I'm Stiyl Magnus...

99
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,333
At least, that's
one of my names...

100
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,708
but for our
current purposes,

101
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,875
I am Fortis
Nine Three One.

102
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,291
The former actually
translates to "mighty one."...

103
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,458
but... its etymology
doesn't matter.

104
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,208
I've said my magic name.

105
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,291
Do you know
what that means?

106
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,583
We sorcerers
don't generally

107
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,291
give out our magic names...

108
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,750
Those names serve to
limit our power...

109
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,250
but when they're
spoken to another,

110
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,541
that limitation vanishes.

111
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,000
I spoke my name to you...

112
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,125
Now you understand the
significance of that...

113
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,166
Among my kind,
they're known as...

114
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,541
killer names... so...

115
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,416
Flames!

116
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,291
Impossible...

117
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,833
is this magic?

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,458
It's so strong...

119
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,375
Will my power work against
something like this?

120
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,333
I know it can cancel out
supernatural esper powers...

121
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,166
but this?

122
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,500
I've never seen anything
like it before...

123
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,791
Who knows what
will happen.

124
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,791
Here, I've brought a little
parting gift for you.

125
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,666
I may have overdone
it a little bit...

126
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,666
Not my cleanest work...

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,041
One thing's
certain, though...

128
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,458
There's no chance he
survived an attack like that.

129
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,541
Oh, really?

130
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,666
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

131
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
Here I am.

132
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,750
Impossible!

133
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,708
Jeez... I'm an idiot.

134
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,750
There was no reason
to be scared...

135
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,375
I have seen it work
on magic before this...

136
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,083
My right hand
destroyed her robes.

137
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,083
Damn you!

138
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
All right...

139
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,875
I understand it now.

140
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,041
You did it. You were the one who
destroyed the Walking Church.

141
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,958
One of the five elements
that make up the known world.

142
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,625
The first light that
pierced the darkness.

143
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,666
The light whose presence
can provide comfort and warmth.

144
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,333
And whose judgment brings
the destruction of the wicked.

145
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,500
It has the power to give
life and to take it away.

146
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,500
It is fierce...

147
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,708
It is hungry...

148
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,000
It is cruel.

149
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,625
I call upon fire...

150
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,916
to serve as my sword...

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,333
Manifest thyself
and feed upon me

152
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,500
that thou shall gain power!

153
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,708
This is the Witch
Hunter King, Innocentius...

154
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,416
Also known as...

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,041
Absolute destruction.

156
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,916
Take this!

157
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,916
Why isn't my hand
working against it?

158
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,750
These flames....

159
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
They keep coming back as
soon as I snuff them out.

160
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,916
Runes.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,541
Magic words...

162
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,083
They have been used
by Germanic tribes

163
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,750
since the second century...

164
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,333
There are twenty-four
letters...

165
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,291
They signify arcane mysticism
and secret knowledge...

166
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,958
and are the roots
of Old English.

167
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,833
Attacking Innocentius
will have no effect...

168
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,458
The walls... the floor...

169
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,250
the ceiling.

170
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,625
As long as the rune seals
engraved nearby remain intact,

171
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,250
he will continue
to regenerate.

172
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,291
Index...! Is that you?

173
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,791
That is correct...

174
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,041
I am the
library of grimoires

175
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,750
belonging to Necessarius.

176
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,666
Also known
as the zeroth parish

177
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
of the English Puritan Church...

178
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,500
My formal name is Index
Librorum Prohibitorum...

179
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,791
but if you prefer,
you may shorten that

180
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,666
and refer to me
merely as Index.

181
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,208
I am currently invoking
an automatic program

182
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,958
known as John's Pen.

183
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,166
You're out of luck.

184
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,125
Eliminating all the runes
that have been engraved

185
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,208
on this building
will be impossible...

186
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,125
There's no point in
even attempting it.

187
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,833
Ashes to ashes...

188
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,791
And dust to dust!

189
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,000
Prepare for
the wrath of...

190
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,791
Squeamish Blood Rood!

191
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,583
Damn!

192
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,875
This is it. I'm
going to... die.

193
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,458
Okay, maybe
I'm not dead yet.

194
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,541
What the... What are those?

195
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,708
I think they're
rune engravings!

196
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm dead!

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,833
Damn!

198
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,083
Why did it stop
following me?

199
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,416
I get it... It's the runes...

200
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,125
they're only
posted in the dorm.

201
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,041
I should probably
call someone.

202
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,166
There's gotta be a
phone around here.

203
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,166
I have to go for help...

204
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,458
I am not running away.

205
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,791
Do you really
wanna be dragged down

206
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,833
into the depths
of hell with me?

207
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,000
I've gotten myself
into a huge mess...

208
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,708
all for a girl I just
met this morning.

209
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,375
What am I thinking?

210
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,375
So foolish...

211
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,208
Does he really think this
will extinguish Innocentius?

212
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,625
I'm soaking wet
because he decided

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,000
he wanted to play firefighter.

214
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,666
What happened
to Innocentius?

215
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
Wow, man... You
almost had me...

216
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,083
It was a real
close call...

217
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,708
Lucky for me you didn't
carve those runes

218
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,333
with a knife or anything...

219
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,875
I wouldn't have
stood a chance then.

220
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,333
You idiot...

221
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,416
Innocentius' fire burns
at three thousand degrees...

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,416
This little shower won't
put out his flames.

223
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
Yeah... I know...

224
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,666
that wasn't the
idea, though.

225
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, it's
rude to plaster stuff

226
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,916
on other peoples' homes.

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,541
That's a nice try.

228
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,500
But you didn't think it
through well enough...

229
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,208
It's not like those runes
were written on toilet paper.

230
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,791
A little water's not
going to dissolve them...

231
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
Now, I think it's
time for you to admit

232
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,833
you're out of your league.

233
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,916
Kill him.

234
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,166
This doesn't make sense...!

235
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,000
My runes should still be
working at full strength.

236
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,333
The ink.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,708
Of course the paper
didn't dissolve...

238
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,250
The ink's your problem...

239
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,000
It tends to run
when it gets wet.

240
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,083
I have to find
Innocentius.

241
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,500
Innocentius!

242
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,250
Now then, sorcerer...

243
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
Ashes to ashes...

244
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,916
And dust to dust...

245
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,500
I call on the power of
Squeamish Blood Rood.

246
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,791
All right, Index,
I've made my decision.

247
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,833
I don't wanna be
dragged into hell.

248
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,916
So that leaves
me one choice.

249
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,083
I'll free you
from its clutches.

250
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,666
Using this!

251
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,958
There you are!

252
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,500
Oh, finally! I've been looking
for you everywhere!

253
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,083
I knew there was no way
you were kept late

254
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,166
for remedial class, and
sure enough, here you are,

255
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,291
out enjoying all the pleasures
the night has to offer!

256
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,875
Gimme a break, Kuroko.

257
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,000
Exactly what part of
this makes it look like

258
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,291
I'm out for a leisurely
night on the town?

259
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,958
Oh, I can answer
that easily...

260
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,958
This place isn't on your
way home from school.

261
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:57,958
The fact that you're
here at all means

262
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,583
you took a detour
for some reason.

263
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,500
Well... I had to run an errand
in this part of town...

264
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,166
And why are you
here, anyway?

265
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,458
Oh right... I'm here on
official business...

266
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,833
for Judgment ...

267
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,000
Something strange
happened tonight.

268
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,625
I came to investigate.

269
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,708
The fire wasn't natural...

270
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,166
It had to have
been cause by someone

271
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,375
with psychic abilities.

272
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,250
That should keep
them from using it as

273
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,083
some kind of magical
tracking device.

274
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,791
Before I do anything else,

275
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,000
I need to get
her to a hospital.

276
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,666
And after that...
then what...?

277
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,208
I doubt she has any
kind of ID on her...

278
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,750
A foreign nun with
no identification...

279
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,833
word will get
out in no time.

280
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,583
Still... I have no choice.

281
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,958
I can't just
leave her alone.

282
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,291
Toma...

283
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,791
Is something wrong...?
You look so tired and pale.

284
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,333
You're worried
about me...?!

285
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,458
We need to do something
about your injuries!

286
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,625
I'll be all right...
Really...

287
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not bad...

288
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,958
If we can just
stop the bleeding,

289
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,083
I... I've got you!

290
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,708
Hey... what about those
books you've got

291
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,375
crammed in your brain...?

292
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,041
Is there any magic in there
that can heal injuries?

293
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,416
Yes... there is.

294
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,708
Let's use it!

295
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,291
You couldn't perform it.

296
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,500
Even if I was able to
teach you the spell...

297
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,708
and even if you
performed it perfectly,

298
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,291
down to the last detail...

299
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,791
your power
would interfere.

300
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,416
Damn... Damn...!
Not again...!..

301
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,541
It always comes back
to my stupid hand!

302
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,500
It isn't because of
your right hand...

303
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,041
It's the esper power
that you have

304
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,958
that would interfere
with the spell.

305
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,083
Some espers are born with
their psychic abilities,

306
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,625
and some develop
them over time...

307
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,416
Magic isn't a power
one can be born with,

308
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,958
but something
that is learned.

309
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,083
It was created by people
who saw the espers

310
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,250
and desired power
of their own...

311
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,291
Magic and psychic ability
are mutually exclusive.

312
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,625
So... all of the
students who live here,

313
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,750
working to develop their
psychic abilities...

314
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,000
Right... they
can't use magic.

315
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,583
Damn it...!
That can't be right!

316
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,458
It seems so unfair...!

317
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,208
What do we do now?

318
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,416
We have a whole city
of talented students...

319
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,000
but they can't do magic.

320
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,166
The students can't do it...

321
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,708
But... Wait...

322
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,125
What about the others...?

323
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,166
Can people who don't have
any esper talent use magic?

324
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,125
It would be my rotten luck that
she's already gone to sleep.

325
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,125
I guess I'll have to
be more aggressive...

326
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,625
Here goes.

327
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,541
Yes, yes, I'm coming...

328
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,333
No use banging
like that...

329
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,541
If you haven't noticed yet,
it's a very sturdy door...

330
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,625
Useful for keeping
salesmen out.

331
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,250
Kamijo...! What
are you doing here?

332
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,791
You haven't taken a job as a
door-to-door salesman, have you?

333
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,625
What kind of salesman
carries a Sister

334
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,000
on his back when he's
out on his rounds...?

335
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,000
Listen, my friend and I
are in a bit of trouble...

336
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,500
Do you think we can
come inside...?

337
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,333
-Thank you. We'd appreciate it.
-Hey, hold on a second!

338
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,208
You can't just barge in
on a person like this!

339
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,416
I wasn't expecting
company tonight.

340
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
The place is a
bit of a mess...

341
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,875
We all have our
vices, you know?

342
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,750
Whoa...! What happened
here...? Poor thing!

343
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,500
I need your help... See--

344
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,208
What's going on?

345
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,625
Urgent warning...

346
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,708
Read from Chapter
2, Verse 6...

347
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,041
Excessive loss of
blood has resulted

348
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,416
in a significant depletion
of life force...

349
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
as a result...

350
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,916
John's Pen has been
auto-activated.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,750
I have run calculations
based on heart rate

352
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,291
and extent of blood loss.

353
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,000
The data indicates that
with no change in status,

354
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,708
I will have fifteen more
minutes before my body

355
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,958
loses its minimum
life force...

356
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,916
Should that occur,
I will perish.

357
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,416
I would appreciate it if you
would follow my instructions

358
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,583
and take the steps necessary
to ensure my survival.

359
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,916
Here's what we'll do...

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,291
Listen... I'll go call
an ambulance...

361
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,791
and you follow whatever
instructions she gives...

362
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,416
Please, Teacher We
have to save her....

363
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,041
don't let her lose
consciousness while I'm gone.

364
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,750
She's a Sister, and only
we can help her right now...

365
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,166
Will you?

366
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
Good... All right, Index...
It's settled.

367
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,250
Is there anything else
I can do to help you?

368
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,583
No, there is not...

369
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,750
Unfortunately, under
the circumstances

370
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,958
the only option is for you
to vacate this place entirely.

371
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
Your presence will
cause interference...

372
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,375
If you remain, your power
will cancel the recovery magic.

373
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,541
Um... did I hear her
right...?

374
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,083
Did... did the Sister really say
something about recovery magic?

375
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,958
She did.

376
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,750
Please, take
good care of her.

377
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,083
Kamijo! I have a
phone right there!

378
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,541
Unfortunately, under
the circumstances

379
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,583
the only option is for you to
vacate this place entirely.

380
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,916
Your presence will
cause interference...

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,416
If you remain, your power
will cancel the recovery magic.

382
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:38,250
[Music]

383
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:48,250
[Music]

384
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:58,250
[Music]

385
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:08,291
[Music]

386
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:18,291
[Music]

387
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:31,666
[Music]

388
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,083
Hold on...

389
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,708
They're gonna use magic
to call down an angel...?

390
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,250
Is that what it will
take to heal Index?

391
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,208
Next time, "Necessarius."

392
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,250
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
