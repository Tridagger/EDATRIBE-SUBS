1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,250
It turns out that Index's
photographic memory

2
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,708
is not actually a condition
that could lead to her death

3
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,583
without annual
memory erasure...

4
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,250
Does this mean the church has
been lying to Stiyl and Kanzaki?

5
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,916
Locating most
effective magic...

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,041
Desired combination
for intruder repulsion

7
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,333
has been successfully
acquired.

8
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,291
Now deploying
specified magic...

9
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,708
Employing Saint George's
Holy Sanctuary...

10
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,833
The intruder
will be destroyed.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,958
[Music]

12
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,708
There's something I've
thought didn't quite fit

13
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,708
since all of this
first started.

14
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,375
You're not an esper
like the students here.

15
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,500
Yet you told me you
weren't able to use magic.

16
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,458
That's impossible!

17
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,625
She told you the truth...

18
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,458
She can't use magic.

19
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,375
Don't you see
what's happening?!

20
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,875
The church has been lying
to you this entire time

21
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,125
about Index having
no magical ability.

22
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,875
Yeah, do you get it now...?

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,250
And that thing
about her dying

24
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,291
if her memory's
not erased every year,

25
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,208
that's another whopper.

26
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,916
The only thing
killing her right now

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
is whatever magic the
church planted in her.

28
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,291
We just have to find
a way to stop it...

29
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,375
After that's done, there won't
be any need to erase her memory.

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,875
Think about it this way...

31
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,500
The church made Index
memorize a bunch of evil books

32
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,166
without a second thought about
her safety or happiness.

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,125
That's the kind of
group they are...

34
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,291
Do you think they'd
be likely to share

35
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,791
their true plans
with low-level enforcers?

36
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,250
Not convinced...?

37
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,250
Why don't you ask Index
about it yourselves?

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,916
Saint George's Holy Sanctuary

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,916
is having no effect on
the intruder's opposition...

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,041
Now switching to a
more effective spell...

41
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,125
Attempt to destroy the
intruder will continue.

42
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,125
Fortis Nine-Three-One!

43
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,208
I'm not interested in hearing
your unproven theories...

44
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,333
What we know for
certain is this...

45
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,291
If we do this, then we
save her for the time being.

46
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,875
I'll do whatever it takes to
make sure that happens...

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,708
I'll kill you if I must...

48
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,458
That's what I decided...

49
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,833
long ago...

50
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,958
So give up.

51
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,250
"For the time being"?

52
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,000
That's not much
of a promise...

53
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,375
I'm talking about
saving her for good...

54
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,458
There's only one question you
need to ask yourself, sorcerer.

55
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,375
Do you want to help Index,
or are you too afraid to?

56
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,250
You guys have been
waiting for a long time...

57
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,666
You want a happy ending
for all this, don't you...?

58
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,583
One in which you don't have
to be Index's enemy...

59
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,208
You wanna be her
friends in truth

60
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,833
and not the people who
snatch her memories away

61
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,000
from her every year.

62
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,791
You never gave up
hope completely...

63
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,750
You never stopped trying...

64
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,166
Because you made a promise
to yourself not to abandon her.

65
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,791
Knowing what you
would have to do,

66
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,000
you made it your personal
mission to save this girl

67
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,791
who had been your friend
and companion.

68
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,458
You wanted to be the
heroes of this story...

69
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,583
So why content yourselves
with supporting roles now...?

70
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,166
You told me earlier you swore to
protect her with your lives,

71
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,083
no matter who or
what got in the way.

72
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,000
If so, your part
is far from over.

73
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,041
It's barely even begun.

74
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,916
Are you gonna give up
because Act One turned out

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,750
to be a little
on the long side?

76
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,708
If you help me instead
of fighting me...

77
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,750
then maybe you'll get
your happy ending...

78
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,166
Now let's do this!

79
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,000
Salvare Zero-Zero-Zero!

80
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,125
What are those... lights?

81
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,875
I know this...
It's Dragon's Breath...

82
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,041
Its power is equal to the
legendary dragon strike

83
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
of St. George.

84
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,500
If even one of those
touches you....

85
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,625
you're in big trouble.

86
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,666
Innocentius!

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,708
You're up...!
Move it, esper!

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,375
Urgent Warning.

89
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,000
Reading from
Chapter 6, Verse 13...

90
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,875
New opponent has
been identified....

91
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,500
Altering combat strategy.

92
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,750
Beginning a survey
of the battle scene...

93
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,125
Completed...

94
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,125
Prioritizing the
destruction of intruders.

95
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,916
Strongest threat, Toma Kamijo,
will be destroyed first.

96
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,958
Urgent Warning.

97
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,500
From Chapter 22...

98
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,541
begin Verse 1...

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,458
Successfully recalculated
for flame magic.

100
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,458
A distorted version of the
church of the cross spell

101
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,625
has been detected,

102
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,041
along with multiple runes.

103
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,500
Formulating counter-church
of the cross spell.

104
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,125
Saint George's
Holy Sanctuary...

105
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,916
activating stage two...

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,791
Eli, eli, lama,
sabachthani.

107
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
She's countering my flames!

108
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,250
God, they say you
are good and just...

109
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,500
If that's true,

110
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,583
then I will be able to
destroy this evil magic.

111
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,958
Are you good?

112
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,625
Will you do justice?

113
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,958
We'll find out right now!

114
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,291
Warning...

115
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,416
Last... Chapter...

116
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,458
Verse...

117
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,083
Verse...

118
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Zero.

119
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,166
Collar... has sustained...
critical... damage.

120
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,500
John's Pen ...

121
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,666
failing.

122
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,625
How odd...

123
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,583
Apparently, a
mysterious blast of light

124
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,500
tore through one of our
observation satellites.

125
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,166
Umm... You and your
two other companions...

126
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,250
It seems that all three
of you were in Academy City

127
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,458
without any form
of identification...

128
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,750
would you happen
to know anything

129
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,291
about this strange event?

130
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,791
No.

131
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,250
All right...
and that letter there...

132
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,416
It was sent by one of the
other foreigners, was it?

133
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,000
Whoa-whoa-whoa...!

134
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,458
I don't think it
was meant for you...

135
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,041
It was clearly
addressed to the boy;

136
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,333
it's for him to open.

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,583
He won't mind.

138
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,208
"Any salutation would sound
phony, so I'll just skip it."

139
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,125
You did a damn fine
job back there, esper...

140
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,833
I could probably say more,
but what's the point...?

141
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,083
Writing down what I felt

142
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,541
and what went through
my mind that night

143
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
would require a whole
rainforest worth of paper...

144
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,541
So I'll skip that, too.

145
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,708
Instead, as a token of my
gratitude for your help,

146
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,916
I'll tell you more
about our mutual friend

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,208
and the peculiar situation
she's found herself in.

148
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,375
The church wanted us to
bring her back immediately...

149
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,958
However, they
changed their minds

150
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,500
when we asked about those
lies you uncovered...

151
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,958
After that, they
told us to simply

152
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,083
"maintain the current status."

153
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,500
Which basically translates as
"wait and see what happens."...

154
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,500
Personally, I don't much
like the idea of her

155
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,125
being with you for a moment
longer than necessary.

156
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,083
I'm sure it will come as
no particular surprise

157
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,916
that I'm not
planning to give up

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,916
and turn her over
to you indefinitely.

159
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,541
We will be gathering
the necessary data,

160
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,916
and once we have all the
information we require,

161
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,041
we intend to come
back and reclaim her.

162
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,416
But you need not
fear another attack.

163
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,458
"For now, just wait
until I contact you again."

164
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,208
That's quite a mischievous
friend you've got there...

165
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,416
the letter must've
been dipped

166
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,458
in a liquid explosive
of some kind.

167
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,083
I know you're anxious
from waiting ...

168
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,416
You're eager to
see for yourself

169
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,125
how the boy is holding up...

170
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,916
It might do him good
to have a visitor.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,291
Still... if you seem
shocked by his condition,

172
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,708
it might frighten him...

173
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,166
So let me give you some
tips before going in.

174
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,708
May I have your
attention please...

175
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,916
We would like to remind
all friends and family

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,583
that visiting hours
will end at 9 p.m...

177
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,416
If you would like to remain at
the hospital later than this,

178
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,416
please see the information
desk for approval...

179
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,125
-Yes?
-The gift shop and the cafeteria

180
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,166
will remain open until 8 p.m.

181
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,958
Hi, Toma.

182
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,166
Excuse me...

183
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,666
I'm sorry...

184
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,666
but I think you might be
looking for a different room.

185
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,166
His memories haven't
just been lost...

186
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,666
They've been
completely obliterated.

187
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,833
What do you mean?

188
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,208
What's the difference?

189
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
It's not a normal
case of memory loss...

190
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,958
The brain cells that
managed his memories

191
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,833
have been physically
destroyed.

192
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,166
I'd be very surprised

193
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,833
if he remembered
anything from his past.

194
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,291
What happened to him...?

195
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,083
It's like his skull
was cracked open,

196
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,875
and his brain was
hit with a stun gun.

197
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,500
Um... Are you feeling
all right, miss...?

198
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,041
You look awfully pale...

199
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,333
Like you've had
a terrible shock.

200
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,875
Oh no, I'm fine.

201
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,625
Really. I'm just
fine, thank you.

202
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,791
Ya know...

203
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,875
you look familiar...

204
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,708
Have we maybe met before?

205
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,458
Of course...
don't you remember...?

206
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,833
We have met...

207
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,916
It was out on the balcony
of your student dormitory.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,291
I see...

209
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,916
I lived in a student dorm
before this happened.

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,208
That's right...

211
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,833
I showed up one day...

212
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,666
You gave me some food....

213
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,041
and you used your right hand
to destroy my Walking Church.

214
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,666
Did you say
"Walking Church"?

215
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,958
What's that...?

216
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,916
And why would I
destroy one of them?

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,166
Come on...

218
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,083
You have to remember...

219
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,625
Think, Toma...

220
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,833
How could you forget
fighting those two sorcerers

221
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,791
who had been chasing me?

222
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,166
You called me Toma...

223
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,000
Whose name is that?

224
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,500
It was yours...

225
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,583
but you don't remember.

226
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,625
My name is Index...

227
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,375
and I want you to know...

228
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,958
even though you don't
remember it, I loved you.

229
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,875
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,375
Index is a funny name...

231
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,750
It doesn't sound like something
a girl would be called...

232
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,208
Maybe... you're talking
about a pet I had?

233
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,500
Hah-hah! Gotcha!

234
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,000
Hook, line, and sinker!

235
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,125
Toma?

236
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,166
What, did I hurt
your feelings

237
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,208
by comparing you
to an animal?

238
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,666
Be a little adventurous...

239
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,125
We could get you
a nice collar...

240
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,583
Come on, it'll be fun...

241
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,958
Would you rather
be a dog or a cat?

242
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,375
I'm guessing cat ...

243
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,541
I, uh...

244
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,041
I'm confused...

245
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,125
I thought your brain cells
had been destroyed...

246
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,250
and your memory
was gone completely.

247
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,041
Hey, now... you almost
make it sound like

248
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,666
you wish I had
forgotten everything...

249
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,791
Well?

250
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,375
No... I don't...

251
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,666
So, according to the
doctor with the frog face...

252
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,583
my memory cells have been
utterly obliterated...

253
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,666
and because of that,
I should've forgotten everything

254
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,625
that's ever happened to me.

255
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,625
What do you mean...

256
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,833
you should have?

257
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,500
Well, here's the thing...

258
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,750
All that supposed damage was
inflicted by a magic spell...

259
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,958
That alone explains it
all, doesn't it...?

260
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,416
When I touched you on the head,
it was with my right hand...

261
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,708
That's all I needed to do.

262
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,041
Imagine Breaker took care
of the rest, no problem.

263
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,625
Imagine... Breaker?

264
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,250
Yeah, my right hand...

265
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,208
That's what the doctor
called it, anyway...

266
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,250
It neutralized the power
of the magic spell...

267
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,125
and since it never had the
chance to reach my brain,

268
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,416
I came out all right.

269
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,541
Man, the look on your
face was priceless...!

270
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,250
I mean, you're usually the one
going around saying crazy stuff

271
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,250
and messing with
people's heads.

272
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,125
I have to admit,
it was pretty fun

273
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
to turn the tables
on you this time.

274
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,041
Uh...

275
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,000
Uh oh...

276
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,541
You should see a doctor.

277
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,666
I'm dead...

278
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,208
She's gonna kill me.

279
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,541
Listen, son...

280
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,458
are you sure about
what you're doing?

281
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,833
You... you don't remember
anything, do you?

282
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,500
I told you what
happened...

283
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,708
every last detail

284
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,833
that those other two
gave me about the event.

285
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,416
No, I don't...

286
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,583
but for some reason
I can't explain...

287
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,041
the last thing in
the world I wanted was

288
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,416
to see that girl cry...

289
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,333
It must sound really
strange to you.

290
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm not really sure what
this feeling is exactly...

291
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,000
but it's there...

292
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
even if I never
remember the reason why.

293
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,166
And that's okay...

294
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,416
because I don't
wanna let it go.

295
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,875
So...

296
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,166
I guess one memory was
left to me after all, huh?

297
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,083
Your memories are dead.

298
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,541
They were destroyed
with your brain cells...

299
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,875
All past information was
blasted irreversibly

300
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
out of your brain.

301
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,625
So then ...

302
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,666
Where do you think
this remembered feeling

303
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
is coming from?

304
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,125
Where is it stored?

305
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,750
Well, doctor...

306
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,166
That should be obvious.

307
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,166
From my heart...

308
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,333
wouldn't you agree?

309
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,416
Two weeks have now passed

310
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,875
since a mysterious incident
caused us to lose contact

311
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,375
with our satellite Orihime I.

312
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,666
So far, all efforts to
reestablish contact have failed.

313
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,875
The governing board has
convened an emergency session

314
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,000
to hear further suggestions
from Academy City scientists.

315
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,041
Stiyl Magnus...

316
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,916
You are no different
from the others.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,500
Every person
who comes here

318
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:26,666
has the same reaction to my
rather unusual appearance.

319
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,000
But it makes sense to me...

320
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,750
If machines can
sustain my life,

321
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,208
why make my body do it.

322
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,916
Yes...

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,458
Director-General Aleister.

324
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,333
I believe you are already
aware of the reason

325
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
you have been called
back here from England.

326
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,083
A situation has developed.

327
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,583
If you mean Deep Blood,...

328
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,291
I know.

329
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,541
We have indeed
located a young girl

330
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,458
who possesses the ability
to kill a certain creature...

331
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,125
a creature that we aren't
even sure actually exists.

332
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,583
Here is where it
gets complicated...

333
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,291
Sorcerers aren't usually
allowed in the city...

334
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,708
and yet one has involved
himself in this.

335
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,416
In Academy City?

336
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,875
Crushing a sorcerer
is no problem...

337
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,458
If pressed we
could handle it ...

338
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,500
but of course, I would prefer
to avoid such a conflict...

339
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,833
Pitting members
of the scientific

340
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,666
and magical disciplines
against each other

341
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,625
is a dangerous game...
as you know.

342
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,541
Scientists and magicians...

343
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,416
each side with its own power,
its own exclusive knowledge...

344
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,916
The harmony of this division
keeps the world in balance.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,583
Academy City is
bursting with espers...

346
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,333
Suppose a sorcerer
was brought down

347
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,625
by someone with
psychic talent...

348
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,916
You can imagine the disquiet
that would cause... can't you?

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,375
I can, sir.

350
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,291
But you believe that the
problem can be solved

351
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,958
by sending a fellow member
of the magical community

352
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,458
to deal with this sorcerer?

353
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,375
That is my plan...

354
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,125
Additionally,
I have at my disposal

355
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,458
one of the natural
enemies of sorcery.

356
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,750
Do you mean...

357
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,208
Imagine Breaker?

358
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,875
But sir...

359
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,833
I thought the idea was to
avoid using espers at all.

360
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,541
That won't be an issue...

361
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,333
He's a Level Zero, with
no abilities to speak of.

362
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,291
He has no access to
privileged information...

363
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,875
So using him will not
risk a security breach...

364
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,166
Yet he will be helpful

365
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,583
in dealing with our
sorcerer friend.

366
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,166
Basically... you
brought me back here...

367
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
to team up with the boy.

368
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,000
He does not have the brains
to understand your magic...

369
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,958
nor does he possess the
power to recreate it.

370
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,041
You won't have to worry about

371
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,291
your magical secrets
being revealed.

372
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,291
I will do as you wish.

373
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,291
But, sir...

374
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
We've never seen the
power of Deep Blood...

375
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Can we even be certain
it truly exists...?

376
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,833
And if we learn
that it does,

377
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,583
think of the ramifications...

378
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,958
It would prove...

379
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,333
It would prove the existence
of dangerous creatures

380
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,791
that would need to be
hunted down and killed.

381
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,375
You speak of vampires.

382
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,291
That is more of a
question for your side.

383
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,916
I believe the occult is
your domain, not ours.

384
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,541
You know...

385
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,833
It seems we are presented

386
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,458
with an interesting
philosophical question...

387
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,458
if the existence of
Deep Blood proves

388
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,416
the existence of vampires...

389
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,125
what exactly does the
Imagine Breaker prove?

390
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,958
[Music]

391
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,750
The alchemist Aureolus Izzard

392
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,583
is holding something
called Deep Blood...

393
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,250
This power is being kept
in a school, and it is...

394
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,833
What...? It's a girl?

395
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,583
Next time,
"The Science Cult."

396
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,416
When science and
magic cross paths,

397
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,958
a story is born.
