00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,252
[WILLIAM]
HOW'S IT LOOK, AZAREA?

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,021
HE'S JUST KNELLING
THERE WILLIAM...

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,856
NO OTHER ENEMIES
ARE ON SIGHT.

4
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,457
[WILLIAM]
EXCELLENT!

5
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,160
[SHIROE] LET'S GET
THIS STARTED SHALL WE?!

6
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,299
(CHUCKLE)

7
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,074
LET'S GO.

8
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,412
[WILLIAM]
EVERYBODY REMEMBER THE PLAN?

9
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,681
(YELLING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS)
[TETORA] GOT IT!

10
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,583
CAREFUL OUT THERE, NAOTSUGU!

11
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,084
WHATEVER! I'VE GOT THIS!

12
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,553
[NAOTSUGU AND DINKURON]
MHMM!

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,127
[SHIROE]
NAOTSUGU... TWENTY METERS AWAY!

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,162
[NAOTSUGU]
GOT IT!

15
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,798
[NAOTSUGU]
CASTLE OF STONE!

16
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:10,971
[WILLIAM]
PERFECT! WELL DONE!

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,107
ALL RIGHT! THE TANK'S
GOT HIS ATTENTION!

18
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,842
(WAR CRY)

19
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,745
WAHHHHH!!!

20
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,981
[BOLOGNESE MASTER, VOICEOVER]
THE SKILL RUSEATO JUST USED,

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
"HARK! MOONLIT FUNERAL BELLS,"
[SASAMEYUKI] 11! 12! 13! 14! 15!

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,952
HAS A 90‐SECOND RECAST TIME.
[SASAMEYUKI] 16! 17!

23
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,320
[PROMETHEUS, VOICEOVER] THAT'S
NOT A LOT,

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,122
BUT WE CAN USE THAT TIME
TO GET INTO POSITION!

25
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,425
[WILLIAM, VOICEOVER]
THIS TIME, WE DO IT. LET'S GO!

26
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,689
[NAOTSUGU]
THERE YOU GO, FANCY PANTS!

27
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,757
JUST KEEP YOUR UGLY LITTLE
MUG POINTED AT ME!

28
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,727
[SASAMEYUKI] 23! 24! 25!
[WILLIAM] REAR GUARD! FALL BACK!

29
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,361
DAMAGE REPORT!

30
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,797
[SASAMEYUKI] 26! 27! 28! 29!
[SHIROE] HARDLY A SCRATCH!

31
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,532
WE NEED A BARRIER ON NAOTSUGU!

32
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,033
[SHIROE] KEEP IT STEADY GUYS!

33
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,267
WE NEED TO HIT IT
AT THE RIGHT TIME!

34
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,369
YAHHHH!!!!

35
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,806
[SHIROE] IF HE THROWS SOMETHING
AT YOU, DEFEND YOURSELF!

36
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,108
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T HIT RUSEATO UNLESS

37
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,443
YOU'RE THE ONE OF THE 9
DESIGNATED ATTACKERS!

38
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,679
WE NEED TO STICK TO THE PLAN!

39
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,616
[FEDERICO, VOICEOVER] HM?
SOMETHING'S CHANGED ABOUT HIM.

40
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,351
HE'S TALKING TO US MUCH
MORE THAN HE USED TO.

41
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,687
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
A LOT BETTER SINCE

42
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,489
WE WERE DEFEATED THE FIRST
TIME. WE'RE GROWING.

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,927
WE'VE BECOME TRUE
COMRADES‐IN‐ARMS.

44
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,163
AND I COULD NEVER FIGHT FOR
A MAN I DIDN'T RESPECT.

45
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,234
[DEMICAS]
LIGHTNING... STRAIGHT!

46
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,336
[FEDERICO, VOICEOVER] IN THE
END, ONE CANNOT AFFORD

47
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,772
TO HATE THEIR FELLOW WARRIORS.

48
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,615
[FEDERICO]
VIPER SLASH!

49
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,753
[FEDERICO, VOICEOVER] I'LL
ADMIT, SHIROE CAN BE WITHDRAWN

50
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,188
AND MAKE THINGS UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR EVERYONE SOMETIMES.

51
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,223
[SHIROE] NAOTSUGU, SWITCH
OUT WITH DINKURON!

52
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,092
[NAOTSUGU] AIGHT!
[DINKURON] GOT IT!

53
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,160
[DINKURON, VOICEOVER]
BUT IF WE'RE HONEST,

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,062
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS,

55
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,930
THAT'S A PRETTY MINOR PROBLEM.

56
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,365
[JUNZO, VOICEOVER] YEAH, WE'RE
ALL A BUNCH OF GAMERS

57
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,366
WITH BAD SOCIAL SKILLS.

58
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,001
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,370
(WAR CRY)

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,805
[HIGHLAND, VOICEOVER]
Y'KNOW, I STILL DON'T

61
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,206
WANT TO DIE OUT HERE.

62
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,908
[ELTON DISKA, VOICEOVER] EVERY
ONE OF US IS DOING THIS BECAUSE

63
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,409
WE CHOSE TO DO SO.

64
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,678
[MOLLUSCA TYPE @ AKIBA,
VOICEOVER] I'VE DIED MORE TIMES

65
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,813
THAN I CARE TO COUNT
IN THIS PLACE.

66
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,882
[UKIYO, VOICEOVER] AND EVERY
TIME, I ENDED UP STUCK IN THAT

67
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,585
HORRIBLE DREAM. BUT I'VE
NOTICED SOMETHING...

68
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,387
[TOKO, VOICEOVER] I'VE NEVER
SEEN A MEMBER OF SILVER SWORD

69
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,389
CAUGHT IN ONE OF THOSE DREAMS.

70
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,392
[PROROCCA, VOICEOVER]
YOU'RE RIGHT... NOT EVEN ONCE.

71
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,094
[PROMETHEUS, VOICEOVER] I'VE
NEVER HAD ANY REGRETS

72
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,862
CONCERNING ANY OF MY GUILDMATES!

73
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,297
[PIANISSISSIMO, VOICEOVER] THIS
IS WHAT IT MEANS

74
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,799
TO BELONG SOMEWHERE.

75
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,634
[FEDERICO, VOICEOVER] IT'S
DOWNRIGHT EMBARRASSING

76
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,269
FOR A MAN MY AGE TO
SAY THIS, BUT...

77
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,605
[BOLOGNESE MASTER, VOICEOVER]
I HAVE TO WONDER,

78
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,873
IF WE CAN CALL EACH
OTHER, "FRIENDS"

79
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,374
[ALL]
GAH!

80
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,076
[SHIROE]
RAGOMARU!

81
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,545
[RAGOMARU]
ON IT!

82
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,580
[RAGOMARU, VOICEOVER]
I WANT TO DO THIS!

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,281
[ENKARTANTO, VOICEOVER] I DON'T
CARE ANYMORE

84
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,883
ABOUT BEATING RAID BOSSES.

85
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,252
[KAWATARO, VOICEOVER] IT'S NOT
LIKE I WANT GLORY OR TREASURE...

86
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,422
[PROROCCA, VOICEOVER]
I JUST... WANT TO WIN!

87
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,524
[ELTON DISKA, VOICEOVER] THE
TIME WE'VE SPENT

88
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,858
HAS NOT BEEN A WASTE.

89
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,761
[ALL, VOICEOVER]
AND WE ARE GOING TO PROVE IT!

90
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,532
[RAGOMARU]
ZANTETSUKEN!

91
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,369
[SHIROE]
GET READY, WILLIAM!

92
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,771
[WILLIAM]
THIS IS IT!

93
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,674
SHIROE...! I NEED A
DISTRACTION FROM YOUR TEAM!

94
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,908
AAAAGH!!!

95
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,482
[DINKURON] REMEMBER, GUYS! BUILD
THEIR HATE AND LET 'EM HAVE IT!

96
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,284
DON'T LEAVE A SINGLE
ONE OF THEM ALIVE!

97
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,519
[ALL]
YEAH!

98
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,156
[VOINEN, THINKING] SHIROE'S
PLAN IS COMING TOGETHER.

99
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,625
LAST TIME, IBRA HABRA
AND TARTAURGA

100
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,261
DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL
AFTER THE GATES WENT UP.

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,730
AND NOW, THE GATES
ARE STILL CLOSED.

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,167
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MOVE.

103
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,669
THE SAME FOR RUSEATO!

104
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,838
WE'RE USING THE WEST
CORRIDOR THIS TIME AROUND!

105
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,574
THAT MEANS WE OUGHTA
BE ABLE TO DEAL

106
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,308
WITH IBRA HABRA ON
OUR OWN, RIGHT?!

107
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,143
YEAH, AND WE'RE ALREADY
CONFIRMED THAT THE GOAL

108
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,680
IS JUST PAST THE
HOLDING PEN AHEAD.

109
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,283
[VOINEN] OKAY, BUT WE STILL
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RUSEATO

110
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,285
BUSTING DOWN THE GATE
AND COMING AFTER US.

111
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,354
[FEDERICO]YEAH, AND IF TARTAURGA
DECIDES TO GO THE LONG WAY,

112
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,924
HE COULD ALSO COME AFTER
US TO AID IBRA HABRA.

113
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,093
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] EVEN IF WE DO
MANAGE TO BEAT IBRA HABRA...

114
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,460
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE'D HAVE

115
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,229
TO DEAL WITH MORE
RAID BOSSES AFTER THAT!

116
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,766
WELL, I GUESS I'M KINDA WORRIED
ABOUT THAT... BUT STILL...

117
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,136
I THINK I'M LIKING OUR CHANCES
BETTER THIS TIME AROUND.

118
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,470
[PROMETHEUS] YEAH!

119
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,106
[PROROCCA] I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S FIFTEEN PERCENT

120
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,440
OR FIVE PERCENT!

121
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,142
[ENKARTANTO] ALRIGHT EVERYBODY,
COME ON!

122
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,613
WE GOTTA GO FOR IT... WE MIGHT
NOT GET ANOTHER SHOT AT THIS!

123
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,380
[DEMICAS, THINKING] I'LL BE
DAMNED IF HE ISN'T RIGHT

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,751
ABOUT THIS... BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A GENIUS TO FIGURE IT OUT.

125
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,086
AND NO ONE OUT THERE GETS TO
PICK EXACTLY

126
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,888
HOW THEIR LIFE IS GONNA GO.

127
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,759
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT
WHEN I WOUND UP IN THIS WORLD.

128
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,661
I THOUGHT SINCE I WAS IN A GAME,

129
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,864
I COULD DO WHATEVER I WANTED,
WHENEVER THE HELL I WANTED.

130
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,099
I FIGURED I COULD MAKE
ANYTHING GO MY WAY,

131
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,469
AND I GOT SENT TO THE
CATHEDRAL FOR MY TROUBLE.

132
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,773
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS
GO AS PLANNED.

133
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,108
WHETHER IT'S HERE
OR THE REAL WORLD!

134
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,310
I HAD TO LEARN
THAT THE HARD WAY.

135
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,979
AND THEN, JUST WHEN I THOUGHT

136
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,414
I HAD EVERYTHING ABOUT
THIS WORLD FIGURED OUT,

137
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,916
IT THREW ME ANOTHER CURVE...

138
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,819
[UPASHI] UGH. YOU ARE SUCH
A SLOB! [DEMICAS] EH!? UH?

139
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,487
[UPASHI]
DON'T YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE?

140
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,856
[DEMICAS]
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

141
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,624
IF ALL YOU'RE GONNA
DO IS STAND THERE,

142
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,292
YOU'RE IN THE WAY!

143
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,727
SHUT UP, NPC!

144
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,864
YOU NEED TO KNOW
YOUR PLACE! UHUH?

145
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,902
HUMPH... DO YOU WANT THIS
HOUSE CLEANED UP OR NOT?

146
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,337
OTHERWISE WHY ARE YOU
KEEPING ME HERE?

147
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,708
[UPASHI] RELEASE ME,
KILL ME, OR MOVE IT!

148
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,577
I CAN'T CLEAN LIKE THIS!

149
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,012
UH... OKAY...

150
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,883
[DEMICAS, THINKING] THAT WAS
ANOTHER PLAN GONE WRONG.

151
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,452
AND, I LOST TO SILVER SWORD.

152
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,955
IT TORE MY GUILD APART.

153
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,626
THEN THOSE RAID BOSSES GOT ME.

154
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,962
I EVEN LOST TO WILLIAM
AS A GUILD MASTER!

155
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,499
HIS ENTIRE TEAM GOT THE
HELL BEAT OUT OF THEM

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,302
AND NO ONE IN HIS
GUILD LEFT HIS SIDE!

157
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,104
NOT A SINGLE DESERTER!

158
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,478
[TETORA] SHIROE, LOOK BEHIND
IBRA HABRA. IS THAT IT?

159
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,947
[SHIROE] THAT'S RIGHT.

160
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,482
OUR TARGET FOR THE RAID IS
JUST AT THE END OF THE HALL.

161
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,285
(HISSES AND SNARLS)

162
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,955
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAAAAUGH!

163
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,991
ANCHOR HOWL!

164
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,226
(ROAR)

165
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,531
[WILLIAM] CONCENTRATE
HEALING ON THE MAIN TANK!

166
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,666
[PIANISSISSIMO] I'M RAISING
HIS FIRE RESISTANCE.

167
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,967
[PROMETHEUS] LET HIM HAVE IT!

168
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,402
WITH ELEMENTAL ICE, WATER,
AND WIND ATTACKS!

169
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,405
[SHIROE] NAOTSUGU, WE NEED A
CLEAR SHOT THROUGH THE CORRIDOR!

170
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,174
GET HIM OFF THAT SOUTHWEST WALL!

171
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,175
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH!

172
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,177
FORTRESS STANCE!

173
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,180
I THINK I'M GONNA TEST OUT THESE
NEW WEAPONS

174
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,182
BY TAKING OFF YOUR HEAD!

175
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,658
[NAOTSUGU, VOICEOVER] FORTRESS
STANCE IS GREAT FOR DEFENSE,

176
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,561
BUT IT REALLY WREAKS HAVOC WITH
MY MOBILITY AND ACCURACY.

177
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,095
[DEMICAS]
GIMME A CRACK AT HIM!

178
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,063
[NAOTSUGU]
HUH?

179
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,297
[DEMICAS]
YAH!

180
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,635
[DEMICAS, THINKING] I'VE HAD
ABOUT ALL THE HUMILIATION

181
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,070
I CAN TAKE!

182
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,608
THAT ENCHANTER'S CASTING
KEEN EDGE ON ME AGAIN.

183
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,478
[SHIROE]
ISN'T THAT...?

184
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,146
EVERYBODY TAKE COVER NOW!

185
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,615
[WILLIAM]
SCATTER!

186
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,920
[DEMICAS]
NOT ON MY WATCH!

187
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,626
[FEDERICO]
(REACTION) WAIT, WHAT?

188
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,995
[TETORA]
IT'S LIKE A SAUNA!

189
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,130
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
COVERING...

190
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,365
IT'S A SKILL THAT ALLOWS A
PLAYER TO TAKE THE DAMAGE

191
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,934
FOR NEARBY TEAM MEMBERS.

192
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,270
[WILLIAM] THAT WAS A
GOOD MOVE, DEMICAS. NICE.

193
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,939
(GROWL)

194
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,274
[DEMICAS]
IT'S GETTIN' HOT OVER HERE!

195
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,210
[NAOTSUGU, VOICEOVER] MONKS HAVE
A HIGHER RESISTANCE

196
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,812
TO ELEMENTAL ATTACKS.

197
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,948
THEY ALSO HAVE HIGHER
OVERALL HIT POINTS.

198
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,084
IF WE KEEP SPLITTING THE DAMAGE,
I WON'T NEED TO SWAP OUT OF THE

199
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,355
FRONT LINE! IN OTHER WORDS,
I CAN KEEP THIS UP ALL DAY!

200
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,226
[WILLIAM] WELL DONE! KEEP
HITTING HIM ON HIS LEFT FLANK!

201
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,460
(ROAR)

202
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,530
[NAOTSUGU]
COME AND GET ME, UGLY!

203
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,532
THERE'S A LOT MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM!

204
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,835
[TETORA] (SQUEAL) NAOTSUGU, YOU
SURE ARE HYPED UP, AREN'TCHA?!

205
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,937
[NAOTSUGU]
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED!

206
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,772
(GIGGLE)

207
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,274
[TETORA]
WHOO...! IT'S MY TURN!

208
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,343
HANG ON EVERYBODY!

209
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:47,648
YOUR SUPER STARLET HEALER
IS HERE TO SAVE THE DAY!

210
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,583
AURORA HEAL!

211
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,718
[JUNZO] NOW THAT...
WAS GOOD TIMING.

212
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,788
AH YES, NOW WE'RE TALKIN'!
THAT FEELS GREAT!

213
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,022
[TETORA]
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME!

214
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,858
[NAOTSUGU] THAT GOT
'EM PERKED UP!

215
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,861
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT
FROM A GORGEOUS SPARKLY ANGEL?!

216
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,563
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THOSE GUYS?

217
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,565
THEY AREN'T VERY
SERIOUS, ARE THEY?

218
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,899
(LAUGHS)

219
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,401
BE HONEST, HAVE YOU
FALLEN FOR ME YET?!

220
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,636
THAT'D BE A "NO."

221
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,138
[TETORA]
(GIGGLES) AW, YOU'RE NO FUN!

222
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,940
OH, YEAH! I JUST REMEMBERED
THERE WAS SOMETHING

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,809
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TELL YOU!

224
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,079
[NAOTSUGU] EARTH TO SPACE CASE!
KINDA BUSY OVER HERE!

225
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,848
[TETORA] YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT! ARE YOU READY?

226
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,085
I'M JOINING LOG HORIZON!
WHADDYA THINK!

227
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,119
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT?!

228
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,487
(GIGGLE)

229
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,089
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

230
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,125
CAUSE I ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY
CAN'T KEEP MYSELF AWAY FROM YOU!

231
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,359
AND DON'T WORRY,

232
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,128
I GOT SHIROE'S PERMISSION FIRST!
BOOTY, BOOTY DANCE!

233
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,931
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE, BUDDY...
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

234
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,865
(ROAR)

235
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,701
[TETORA]
UH, THAT LOOKS KINDA BAD!

236
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,236
[WILLIAM]
FRONTLINE, PULL BACK! FEDERICO!

237
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,605
WE NEED FIRE RESISTANCE!

238
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,641
EVERYONE ELSE, GIVE ME
BARRIERS AND HEALING!

239
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,110
[AZAREA]
HUH? OH MY GOD!

240
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,377
(GASP)
(SNARL)

241
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,448
[SHIROE AND WILLIAM]
TARTAURGA?!

242
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,862
[ELTON DISKA]
IT'S TARTAURGA!

243
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,564
[HIGHLAND]
(SQUEAK) THERE HE IS!

244
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,332
[BOLOGNESE MASTER]
STEADY, EVERYONE!

245
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,399
[WILLIAM]
DINKURON!

246
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,068
[DINKURON]
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

247
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,803
I FELL BACK FROM
THE FRONT LINES,

248
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,072
JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAD A
SHOT TO FINISH YOU OFF!

249
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,508
[WILLIAM]
HEALERS, GET INTO FORMATION!

250
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,743
[ALL]
ROGER!

251
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,979
[DINKURON]
CASTLE OF STONE!

252
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,289
[SHIROE, THINKING]
IBRA HABRA AND TARTAURGA...

253
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,459
WE CAN'T REALLY EXPECT TO
BEAT BOTH OF THEM AT ONCE.

254
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,664
[WILLIAM] SO WHAT WAS IT YOU
SAID ABOUT

255
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,099
A FIFTEEN PERCENT
CHANCE OF VICTORY?

256
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,968
THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE...

257
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,237
BOTH IBRA HABRA AND TARTAURGA
ATTACKED US AT THE SAME TIME.

258
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,473
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
IF THAT HAPPENS AGAIN.

259
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,108
[WILLIAM]
YES, I WOULD AGREE.

260
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,843
[SHIROE] SO WHAT IF WE TOOK ONE
OF THEM OUT OF THE PICTURE?

261
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,812
[JUNZO]
WE COULD'VE WON THAT FIGHT...

262
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,682
[ORDISSO]
JUST WHAT IS HE GETTING AT...?

263
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,916
IF WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP THEM FROM

264
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,718
HAVING OVERLAPPING
ATTACK FIELDS,

265
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:05,919
WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE.

266
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,688
[WILLIAM]
HMM...

267
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,289
[SHIROE]
THE CAVERN IS THE RIGHT SIZE...

268
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,991
BUT SPACE WILL BE GETTING REALLY
TIGHT IN THERE

269
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,192
SO WATCH YOURSELVES.

270
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,428
WE'VE GOTTA KEEP
'EM BOTH APART.

271
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,032
I NEED NAOTSUGU TO DRAW IBRA
HABRA TO THE SOUTH‐WESTERN WALL.

272
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,602
DINKURON WILL KEEP TARTAURGA
AT THE ENTRANCE

273
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,270
OF THE NORTH‐EASTERN CORRIDOR.

274
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,438
NOW, WHATEVER YOU DO,

275
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,974
DON'T GET COMPLACENT ABOUT
STAYING IN ONE PLACE.

276
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,945
NAOTSUGU AND DINKURON ARE BOTH
GONNA NEED TWO HEALERS

277
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,881
DEDICATED TO KEEPING
THEIR HIT POINTS UP.

278
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,452
WE'LL REDEPLOY THE OTHER
HEALERS TO HELP EVERYONE ELSE.

279
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,021
SPACE IS THE ISSUE HERE.

280
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,757
TOO CLOSE AND YOU'RE
GETTING HIT ON ALL SIDES.

281
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,692
TOO FAR AWAY, AND THE REST OF
THE PARTY

282
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,561
CAN'T SUPPORT YOU WITH
HEALING AND BARRIERS.

283
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,664
EVERYONE IN THE REAR NEEDS TO
WATCH HOW THE RAID BOSSES MOVE,

284
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,499
SO YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR
INTERVAL SPACING.

285
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,603
WE'LL BE WALKING ON A
TIGHTROPE THE ENTIRE BATTLE.

286
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:01,107
A STRING IF YOU ASK ME...
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY TOUGH.

287
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,945
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, I LIKE IT!

288
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,383
FEDERICO, I NEED AN ATTACK RANGE
AND POWER DAMPENER OUT THERE!

289
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,885
[FEDERICO]
YOU GOT IT!

290
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,987
[SHIROE] I NEED MORE HEALING
POWER FROM YOU, TETORA!

291
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,456
[TETORA] I'M ALREADY GIVING
YOU EVERYTHING I GOT OKAY!

292
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,091
[SHIROE]
HANG ON!

293
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,764
[TETORA]
AWW! THAT'S REALLY CUTE!

294
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,498
[SHIROE]
FORCE STEP!

295
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,503
OH, WOW! I REALLY LOOK
LIKE A STARLET, NOW!

296
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,572
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] FORCE STEP
REDUCES A PLAYER'S RECAST

297
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,339
BY NEARLY HALF FOR
A FULL MINUTE.

298
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,976
THIS INCREASES A MAGIC
USER'S CASTING OPTIONS.

299
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,745
IT CUTS AURORA HEAL'S USUAL 600
SECOND RECAST TIME

300
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,114
DOWN TO 480 SECONDS.

301
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,716
AND IN A FIGHT LIKE THIS,

302
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,484
2 MINUTES IS A WORLD
OF DIFFERENCE.

303
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,652
SPEAKING OF...

304
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,588
[SHIROE]
MANA CHANNELING!

305
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,857
[SHIROE, THINKING] KNOWING THAT
SHE CAN CAST MORE SPELLS,

306
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,893
MEANS SHE'S ALSO
LOSING MAGIC POINTS.

307
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,928
MANA CHANNELING GIVES HER BACK
SOME OF THAT POWE

308
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,962
R WHEN I SHARE MY MANA.

309
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,231
THANKS, SHIROE! MWAH!

310
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:58,765
[SHIROE]
YEP!

311
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,833
UH... AH!

312
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,267
[VOINEN]
OVER HERE!

313
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,536
[SHIROE]
UH!

314
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,773
(SURPRISED)

315
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,709
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THE SEQUOIA OF LIFE.

316
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,612
A SUMMONING SPELL
USED BY DRUIDS.

317
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,213
ANY PARTY MEMBER TOUCHED BY

318
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,048
THE GLOW OF THE TREE
GETS PARTIAL HEALING.

319
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,318
AND RIGHT NOW, THEY NEED ALL
THE HIT POINTS THEY CAN GET.

320
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,553
[TETORA]
AWESOME!

321
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,487
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THAT TREE CAN GIVE 10 PLAYERS

322
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,591
UP TO THIRTY PERCENT
OF THEIR HEALTH BACK!

323
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,326
[SHIROE]
KARMA DRIVE!

324
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:32,365
(ROAR)

325
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,206
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
BASED ON OUR COUNTS,

326
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,242
IT LOOKS LIKE IBRA HABRA
CAN CAST MERCILESS BANQUET

327
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,045
IN PURGATORY ONCE
EVERY THREE MINUTES.

328
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,550
KNOWING THAT, I'M GONNA HAVE
VOINEN CAST MARSH RAIN

329
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,185
AND LIFE BURST AT THE SAME
TIME TO WARD IT OFF.

330
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,556
AND INCREASE IBRA HABRA'S
RECAST TIME TO 6 MINUTES.

331
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,625
ALSO, THAT'LL GIVE NAOTSUGU THAT
CHANCE

332
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,226
TO RECAST CASTLE OF STONE,

333
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,063
SO HE CAN STAY ON THE FRONT LINE
AND KEEP DOING DAMAGE TO HIM.

334
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,066
AND IN THOSE NINE MINUTES,
TETORA WILL BE ABLE TO RECAST

335
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,269
ANOTHER AURORA HEAL AND GET
EVERYONE'S HIT‐POINTS BACK UP.

336
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,138
ALSO, I JUST CAST KARMA DRIVE,

337
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,407
WHICH WILL ALLOW EVERYONE WHO
DEALS A CRITICAL HIT ON

338
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,777
IBRA HABRA TO REGAIN SOME
OF THEIR MAGIC POINTS BACK.

339
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,580
IF WE STICK TO THE PLAN, AND
THERE ARE NO MORE SURPRISES,

340
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,983
WE CAN FINISH HIM OFF IN
JUST UNDER TWELVE MINUTES.

341
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,151
AND AFTER THAT, WE
CAN FOCUS OUR ENERGY

342
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,320
TO PRESSING THE
ATTACK ON TARTAURGA!

343
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:29,389
THIS...

344
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,423
... WILL WORK!

345
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,125
[SHIROE] KEEP ON
ATTACKING HIM, YOU GUYS!

346
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,359
WE CAN WIN THIS
THING IN 12 MINUTES!

347
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,961
[WILLIAM]
YOU HEARD THE MAN!

348
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,063
THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES
SAYS WE CAN WIN THIS!

349
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,634
KEEP ON FIGHTING OUT THERE!
DON'T LET HIM RECOVER!

350
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,636
[ALL]
YEAH!

351
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,308
(SHOCKED)

352
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,176
[ENKARTANTO]
NO! NO WAY!

353
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,377
[AZAREA]
NOT NOW!

354
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,946
[UKIYO]
OH MAN, THIS ISN'T GOOD!

355
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,015
[TOKO]
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

356
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,083
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THE SHADOW VANGUARDS...

357
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,252
SO, WE'VE GOT AS MANY
VANGUARDS AS THERE WERE PLAYERS

358
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,588
WHO DID DAMAGE TO RUSEATO WHEN
HE WAS IN BLACK KNIGHT FORM.

359
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,758
PERHAPS THESE ARE SOME
WE DIDN'T GET EARLIER.

360
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,294
I COULD'VE SWORN WE TOOK
CARE OF ALL OF THEM

361
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,230
WHEN WE FOUGHT OUR WAY HERE.

362
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,266
THE OTHER THING IS,
EVEN IF HE SWITCHES

363
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,535
BACK TO BLACK KNIGHT FORM,

364
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,671
THERE'S NO ONE IN HIS
ZONE TO HURT HIM...

365
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,173
WAIT A MINUTE...! THAT'S CRAZY!

366
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,445
HE ATTACKED HIMSELF TO
MAKE MORE OF THOSE THINGS?!

367
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,015
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY
TIMES HE CAN DO THAT.

368
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,751
WAIT A MINUTE...

369
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,623
HE'S GONNA USE HIS BLACK KNIGHT
MODE TO KEEP INJURING HIMSELF

370
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,560
AND SENDING MORE OF THOSE
VANGUARDS AFTER US!

371
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,363
HOW MANY ARE THERE NOW?!

372
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,799
IF HE USES ALL HIS
HEALTH EVERY 200 SECONDS

373
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,202
TO SPAWN AS MANY VANGUARDS AS
HE CAN, HOW WILL THEY MULTIPLY?

374
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:54,174
31? 62? WHAT'RE WE FACING?

375
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,910
31 OF THEM WOULD STILL
GIVE US A FIGHTING CHANCE.

376
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,446
WE JUST NEED ANOTHER 10 MINUTES
TO FINISH OFF IBRA HABRA.

377
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,116
[SHIROE] FRONT LINE!
[SHIROE, THINKING] I NEED

378
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,551
SOMEONE TO LEAD THE
VANGUARDS OUTTA HERE.

379
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,253
SO THE REST OF US CAN
TAKE IBRA HABRA DOWN!

380
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,423
IF SOMEONE CAN JUST
GET THEIR ATTENTION!

381
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,258
SOMEONE KITE THE VANGUARDS!

382
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,794

402
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,670
BY SABOTAGING THE

403
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,172
WAIT A MINUTE. I THINK I SEE

404
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,775

406
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,380
[SHIROE, THINKING] I SUPPOSE IF
I CAN USE MYSELF

407
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,215
LIKE A CANNON
STRAPPED TO HIS BACK.

408
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,284
I CAN MAKE THIS WORK!

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,227
BUT...

426
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,231
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
HE'S REALLY UP TO.

427
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,202
THE FIRST TIME WE MET,
I COULDN'T STAND THE GUY...

428
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,137
I GUESS ACTING LIKE A
TOTAL JERK WAS HIS WAY OF

429
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,139
DEALING WITH BEING TRAPPED HERE.

430
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,142
IT'S NATURAL I GUESS...
HUMAN NATURE FOR SOME...

431
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,477
BUT I COULDN'T
ALLOW HIM TO DO IT.

"OTHER SIDE"?

00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,432
OH?
