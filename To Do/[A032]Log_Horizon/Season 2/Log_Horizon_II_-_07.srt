00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,806
LET ME SEE WHAT I
CAN FIND OUT HERE.

00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:14,341
I'LL CALL BACK SHORTLY.

[RIEZE]
I... I'M SORRY IT'S NOTHING.

8
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,652
I... I JUST KNOW THIS IS
A DESPERATE TIME FOR US.

00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:28,756

HIDE YOUR FEELINGS FROM US.

AH...

12
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,527
[HENRIETTA] LOOK, IF YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,

13
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:35,262
I DON'T MIND BEING HERE FOR
YOU, OKAY?

16
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:14,428
[HENRIETTA] MISA'S SCYTHE
WENT OUT OF CONTROL?!

17
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,698
AND WHAT? IT MADE KRUSTY
VANISH INTO THIN AIR?

18
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,868
[RIEZE] NONE OF US CAN GET OUT
TELEPATHIC CALLS TO GO THROUGH.

19
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,971
AND WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH
THIS SERIAL KILLER MENACE.

20
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,641
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE NEED TO
KEEP UNDER CONTROL, IT'S THAT

21
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,876
WE DON'T WANT ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS TO GET OUT.

22
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:32,212
YES, YOU MIGHT WANNA KEEP THIS
FROM THE ROUND TABLE.

23
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:33,814
THE TIMING WOULD NOT BE IDEAL.

24
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:36,651
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO
MINAMI'S SPIES ARE.

25
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,418
I'M WONDERING
IF WE SHOULD

26
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,454
INFORM PRINCESS
RAYNESHIA OR NOT.

27
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,689
DEFINITELY.

28
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,291
AND IF I KNOW KRUSTY
LIKE YOU DO, RIEZE,

29
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:48,462
HE'LL WALTZ RIGHT BACK TO US
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL.

30
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:50,097

00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,537
WHAT'S GOING ON MIKAKAGE?

34
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,072
[MIKAKAGE]
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG

35
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,273
WITH THE FLAVOR TEXTS!

37
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,983
[RIEZE] THINGS ARE LITERALLY
BECOMING THEIR DESCRIPTIONS?

38
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,318
[MIKAKAGE] YEAH. EVEN THOUGH
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE

39
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:12,687
JUST TO ADD AMBIANCE
AND INTRIGUE.

40
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,189
BUT NOW, ANYTHING WRITTEN
IN THE FLAVOR TEXT

41
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,857
IS BECOMING TRUE TO LIFE.

42
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,293
WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE'LL NEED TO PAY MUCH CLOSER

43
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:22,129
ATTENTION TO ALL THE ITEM
DESCRIPTIONS FROM NOW ON.

44
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,733
IT COULD START CAUSING ALL KINDS
OF TROUBLE FOR US IF WE DON'T.

MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON MISA'S
WEAPON ATTACKED HER AND KRUSTY.

48
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,576
TO COMPLICATE MATTERS...

49
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:38,078
[RIEZE] THE KILLER IS IN
POSSESSION OF BYAKUMARU.

THE FLAVOR TEXT OF THAT

00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:45,319
THAT SWORD CAN DO AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE ON IT'S OWN.

53
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,422
NOW IT'S IN THE HANDS OF
SOMEONE IN ROYAL GUARD ARMOR.

IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

55
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,893
YOU GET BYAKUMARU AS
AN ITEM DROP IN A QUEST.

56
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,762
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S

IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

DOES THE FLAVOR TEXT

ON LUGRIUS HAVE TO SAY?

63
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,409
[RIEZE] IT TALKS
ABOUT THE LEGEND

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,812
OF LUGRIUS AND HOW HE
TURNED INTO A DEMON.

65
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:15,049
LUGRIUS ORIGINALLY FOUGHT AS
THE HERO OF THE ICY WALLS

66
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:18,218
ALONG SIDE THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.

KEEPING THE EVIL GIANTS AT BAY.

IN AN UNFORESEEN

HOW TO USE "HYPERION EYE."

BUT NOT NECESSARILY MASTER IT.

TO DETERMINED WHAT

IT'S HIT POINTS AND STATUS ARE.

161
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,849
SO IF YOU WERE ABLE TO
MASTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

162
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,483
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
MANY HIT POINTS THE GUYS

163
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,753
BEHIND YOU HAVE AND FIGURE
OUT IF THEY'RE A THREAT.

IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SWEET!

165
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,155

167
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,491
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WE
KNOW WHO CAN USE IT.

168
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:52,727
[AKATSUKI] UH...?

169
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,261
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
YOU CAN MASTER IT.

170
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,863
EVEN IF YOU LEARN
THE FIRST LEVEL.

171
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,264
(EXHALES)

172
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:00,835
I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET!
PLEASE HELP ME!

173
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,302
(FIGHTING NOISES)
[BOTH] HYAH!

174
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,305
[AKATSUKI]
UH!

175
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:06,240
UH?!

176
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,007
(GROAN)

177
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,709
[YUTA] MM.
[KOZARU] HWAH.

178
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,144
(STRUGGLING)

179
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,212
[AKATSUKI]
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN!

180
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,447
UH?

181
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,551
MMM... (SIGH)

182
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:22,389
(LUNCH CHATTER)

183
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,627
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] ORAL ARTS.

184
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,996
PLEASE SHOW ME
SOME SORT OF CLUE.

185
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,565
[MIKAKAGE]
HEY, AKATSUKI!

186
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,465
HUH?

187
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,902
I MADE SOMETHING FOR
YOU... IT'S SPECIAL.

188
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,871
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S SPECIAL?

189
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,338
(BOTH GIGGLE)

190
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,175
[AKATSUKI]
HUH?

191
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:47,915
OH‐UH, UH... (PLEASANT SIGH)

192
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,686
[HENRIETTA] OUR KILLER IS A
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GUARD.

193
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:55,422
HE IS A PERSON OF THE LAND IN
POSSESSION OF MOVABLE ARMOR...

194
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:58,659
AND HE IS ARMED WITH THE SWORD
OF THE COLD, BYAKUMARU.

195
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,062
IT'S USUAL ATTACK IS BLIZZARD
AND FREEZE AND IT CAN INFLICT

196
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,131
ITS DAMAGE AT GREAT
RANGE ON ITS TARGET.

197
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,067
I REMEMBER HIM. WASN'T
LUGRIUS A RAID BOSS?

198
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,237
YES. AND KNOWING THAT
SHOULD HELP US DEFEAT HIM.

199
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,673
ASSUMING THE FLAVOR TEXT
HOLDS TRUE FOR BOTH,

200
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,374
IT SHOULD ENLIGHTEN
US IN THREE WAYS.

201
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:16,744
FIRST, THE SWORD
WILL USE BLIZZARD

202
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:18,646
TO INFLICT THE FREEZE
STATUS EFFECT.

203
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,348
SECOND, IT WILL INCREASE ALL OF
THE STATS OF THE PERSON

204
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,618
WITH THE SWORD, MULTIPLIED
BY HIS OPPOSITION.

205
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:27,555
EVERY OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE
STATISTIC FOR BYAKUMARU'S MASTER

206
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:31,726
WILL GO UP FOR EVERY PLAYER THAT
OPPOSES HIM WITHIN FIFTY METERS.

207
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,493
AHHH... (SIGH)

208
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:37,097
MEANING THAT OVERWHELMING HIM
WITH NUMBERS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

209
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:40,568
THAT'S WHERE OUR STRATEGY COMES
IN. IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO USE

210
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,403
A RAID PARTY IN THIS SITUATION,
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT TACTIC.

211
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:47,074
WE STILL USE OUR TWENTY‐FOUR,
WITH THE USUAL SIX SPLIT IN TWO

212
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:50,110
OR THREE, BUT SCATTERED ACROSS
THE CITY LIKE A NET.

213
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,513
YOU WANT TO HOLD A FULL
RAID INSIDE THE CITY.

214
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,149
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
PRETTY AMAZING, RIEZE.

215
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:57,518
YOU CAN TELL SHE'S IN CHARGE OF
THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING

216
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,520
SQUADRON IN KRUSTY'S GUILD.

217
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,422
SHE'S SHOWING NO SIGNS OF
WILTING OR BACKING DOWN

218
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,324
IN THE FACE OF ALL
THE GRAND WARRIORS.

219
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,662
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE
SPREADING YOUR TEAM OUT TOO FAR.

220
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,229
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO LEAD THEM?

221
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,031
WE'LL USE THE TELEPATHIC NETWORK

222
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,167
TO KEEP OUR CHAT UP AND
RUNNING DURING THE BATTLE.

223
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,736
ONCE ONE OF THE GROUPS MAKES
CONTACT, WE'LL HAVE THEM

224
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,573
DEPLOYED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE
OTHERS CAN GET TO THEM QUICKLY.

225
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,908
[WOODSTOCK] SO I'M GUESSING
BYAKUMARU'S THIRD AFFECT ISN'T

226
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,744
HARD TO GUESS, AM I RIGHT?
[SOJIRO] HUH?

227
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:27,214
RIGHT, LIKE A LOT OF MAGIC
SWORDS WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT.

228
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,584
THERE SHOULD BE A BASIC BOOST
TO HIS HIT‐POINTS...

229
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:32,653
OF COURSE WE STILL NEED TO DEAL
WITH HIS OPPOSITION INCREASE.

230
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,855
[WOODSTOCK] I SWEAR, I DON'T
KNOW WHO CAME UP WITH THAT,

231
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,123
BUT I'VE ALWAYS HATED IT.

232
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,058
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DEAL WITH IT?

233
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,260
WE NEED PERMISSION
FOR A CURFEW.

234
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,430
AND WE NEED IT FROM RIGHT NOW
UNTIL MIDNIGHT NEW YEAR'S DAY.

235
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:46,333
IT SHOULD COME FROM THE ROUND
TABLE TO ASK ALL THE PEOPLE OF

236
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,269
THE LAND TO STAY IN THEIR
HOMES FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.

237
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,472
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY
A START I GUESS...

238
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,710
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
FACE SOMETHING SO POWERFUL?

239
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,211
WOODSTOCK HAS A POINT.

240
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,514
IF THE KILLER HAS A
GUARDSMAN'S MOVEABLE ARMOR,

241
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,883
THEN HE CAN TELEPORT ANYWHERE
WITHIN THE CITY AT ANY TIME!

242
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,485
IT WILL ALL BE A WASTE
IF HE GETS AWAY!

243
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:10,390
WE HAVE A SOLUTION. BUT WE NEED
THE PRINCESS TO MAKE IT WORK!

244
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,358
HUH?

245
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,231
(GASP)

246
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,441
[RAYNESHIA] SO YOU'RE TELLING
ME, YOU WANT ME TO CUT THE POWER

247
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:31,045
TO AKIHABARA'S
MAGIC CIRCLE, RIGHT?

248
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,180
(UNCERTAIN BREATH)

249
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,516
[KINJO] WE CAN DEPRIVE
THE ARMOR OF ITS POWER

250
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,985
BY SHUTTING OFF THE MAGIC
TO THE CITY'S CIRCLE.

251
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,687
OF COURSE, THIS WOULD ALSO

252
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,722
NEUTRALIZE THE CITY'S
OTHER MAGICAL DEFENSES.

253
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:45,159
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STOPPING
MONSTERS FROM COMING IN.

254
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,063
WELL, IF YOU WERE TO TRY THIS?
COULDN'T YOU JUST RESTORE

255
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,665
THE CIRCLE RIGHT
AFTER HE'S ELIMINATED?

256
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,433
I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT THAT
SIMPLE, YOUR GRACE.

257
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,470
IT WOULD TAKE
DECADES TO RESTORE.

258
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:59,774
(EXHALE)

259
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,677
[RIEZE] I'M ALREADY AWARE
THIS PLAN HAS ITS RISKS.

260
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:07,414
LISTEN TO ME, RAYNESHIA. I KNOW
THIS CANNOT BE AN EASY DECISION.

261
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:10,217
BUT WITH YOUR BLESSING
WE DO HAVE A CHANCE.

262
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,521
NO! I KNOW IT WILL WORK!

263
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,156
SO ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS AS A
TASK OF MY OFFICIAL POSITION?

264
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,459
AS AN EMISSARY OF MY PEOPLE?

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,795
[HENRIETTA]
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

266
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,329
WE CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY.

267
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,564
(EXHALE)

268
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,400
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION,

269
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,736
NO MATTER WHICH CHOICE
YOU END UP MAKING.

270
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,137
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY!

271
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,172
NOTHING'LL CHANGE BETWEEN ANY OF
US NO MATTER WHAT.

272
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,675
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE DON'T
BE AFRAID OF THAT.

273
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,777
(EXHALE)

274
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,484
(SIGH)

275
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,654
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] IN THE
END, I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO

276
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,589
MAKE A DECISION RIGHT
THERE ON THE SPOT.

277
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,357
(GROANING)

278
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,026
I WANTED TO BE A FRIEND AND

279
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,361
GIVE THEM EVERYTHING
THEY ASKED OF ME.

280
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:58,899
BUT AS MY GRANDFATHER'S
AMBASSADOR...

281
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,136
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

282
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,077
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] OKAY, TIME
IS RUNNING SHORT,

283
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:12,379
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

284
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,148
[NYANTA]
HOW'S THE TRAINING GOING, MYAH?

285
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,550
OH...

286
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,719
SO WHEN'S THE BIG RAID
PARTY IN THE CITY, BABY?

287
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,821
NEW YEAR'S EVE.

288
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,456
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

289
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,625
TAKING CARE OF YOUR RESOLUTION
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR?

290
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:25,693
THAT'S COOL.

291
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:28,028
NOT SURE IF I'LL EVEN
MASTER AN ORAL ART,

292
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,698
IT'S LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY
GRASPING AT AIR.

293
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:33,300
I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT IS
THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO

294
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,570
TO MAYBE HELP YOU
OUT A LITTLE BIT?

295
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,105
[AKATSUKI] THANKS FOR ASKING,
CHIEF, BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.

296
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,608
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

297
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,409
I'M GETTING THE FEELING THAT
YOU'RE PUSHING YOURSELF

298
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,912
A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, Y'KNOW.

299
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,647
[AKATSUKI]
OH...?

300
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,117
MY LORD, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TAKING A BREAK FOR A WHILE?

301
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:54,955
I'M FINE, I NEED TO SQUEEZE IN
AS MUCH WORK AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

302
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,792
MAYBE, BUT DON'T OVERDO IT OKAY?

303
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,027
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME,

304
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:03,531
I'M WORKING HARD
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

305
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,733
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY MY
LORD PUSHES HIMSELF AS MUCH

306
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,535
AS HE DOES ALL THE TIME...

307
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,438
I MEAN I GUESS, HE'S TRYING TO
GET THE BEST OUT OF HIMSELF.

308
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,541
SO I WILL DO WITH
SAME THING FOR ME.

309
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,976
IF I WANT TO TAKE DOWN
AN ENEMY LIKE THIS,

310
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,145
I NEED TO TEST MY LIMITS.

311
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:21,616
IT'S ... IT'S JUST...
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

312
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,354
[NAZNA] COME ON YOU GUYS! KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE.

313
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,557
NOW! SLIP IN BEHIND YOUR ENEMY!

314
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:31,225
YOU NEED TO BE IN
A CONSTANT STATE

315
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,927
OF EVALUATING YOUR OPPONENT.

316
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,763
KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO AND BE
AWARE OF WHAT YOU CANNOT DO,

317
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,533
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU BY
SURPRISE IN THE FIGHT.

318
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,234
MM.

319
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:44,271
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I KNOW THAT I'M WEAK...

320
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,440
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I CAN ONLY LEARN

321
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,108
BY KNOWING WHAT
MY WEAKNESSES ARE.

322
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,544
(SCREAM)

323
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,546
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I'VE LEARNED FROM DEFEAT,

324
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,648
AND FOUND A PURPOSE
IN MY LACK OF TALENT.

325
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,015
(STRUGGLING)

326
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,383
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
BUT STILL,

327
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,819
I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING MY OWN...

328
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,756
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
USING THIS, AKATSUKI?!

329
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,758
IT REALLY HELPS YOU
BUILD UP YOUR DEFENSES

330
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,826
HUH?! THANKS A

[AKATSUKI] HUH?

340
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,748
THINK ABOUT HOW BIG HE IS.

341
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:29,349
IT'LL DRIVE HIM NUTS IF YOU
KEEP MOVING AROUND

342
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,151
AND HE CAN'T HIT YOU.

343
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,188
HE SHOULD HAVE A
TON OF BLIND SPOTS.

344
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,791
COME ON, THEN. GIVE IT A TRY.

00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,198
WAS ALWAYS WORKING AGAINST ME.

350
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,900
[RICHO] HWAH!
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] BUT I CAN

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,401
ALSO USE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE.

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,451

378
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,026
[MIKAKAGE] OH, YEAH! IT'S

379
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:47,895
[AOMORI] YOU NEED TO BE A
LITTLE MORE AWARE, OKAY?!

380
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:50,364
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA BE READY IN

381
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,032
[MIKAKAGE] AW, SORRY!

GO AHEAD.

396
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,313
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
MADE THAT ONE.

HUH? (MUNCH)

398
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,553

WELL I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT. HEH.

400
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,793
[RAYNESHIA]
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

401
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:56,263
I LOOKED AT YOU AS AN EASY
WAY OUT OF MY SITUATION.

402
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:57,565
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

403
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,366
THE OTHER DAY, WHEN
YOU WENT OUT ON YOUR OWN

404
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:02,136
AND ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OUT
THE SERIAL KILLER FOR ME.

405
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:05,005
I WAS THINKING FOR A MOMENT
THAT IF YOU THAT IF YOU...

406
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:08,008
THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE DEFEATED
HIM THAT NIGHT THEN...

407
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,344
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT

408
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:12,813
BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND YOURS.

409
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,517
I JUST WANTED TO CRY TO
MY GRANDFATHER

410
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,719
OR GET MASTER KRUSTY
TO HANDLE IT.

411
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:21,756
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING
TO BE THAT PERSON ANY MORE.

412
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:25,826
I'M NOT GOING TO AVOID
RESPONSIBILITY LIKE THE KUNIE

AT MY FEET A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

414
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,968
THAT SAID. I'M STILL
NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

415
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:36,036
AND I CAN'T DECIDE YET.

416
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:38,806
[AKATSUKI] IT MADE ME HAPPY
WHEN YOU SAID I WAS YOUR FRIEND.

417
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,875
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE NERVOUS.

418
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,343
YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF FRIENDS
HERE, WHO'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

419
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:48,182
PLUS ME, YOU KNOW... WE'RE STILL

420
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,784

00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,442
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK...? HAVE
YOU FIGURED ANYTHING OUT YET?

NN‐NMM

427
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,813

TO DISCOVER AN ORAL ART,

428
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,716
YOU MUST REALIZE YOU
DON'T ACTUALLY NEED IT.

429
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,818
[AKATSUKI] HWUUAAH? WHAT'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!

430
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,256
UH...

431
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:32,527
IF I HAD KNOWN...

432
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:40,835
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
SOLD IT TO HIM.

YOU COULD KNOW. IT'S FINE.

[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] I WILL NOT
RUN FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY...

IF I DO THINGS
THE WAY I USED TO,

00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:56,283

FIGHT MY BATTLES FOR ME,

437
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:57,818
I'LL BE SHOWING EVERYONE THAT

438
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,555
I CAN NEVER BE TRUSTED WITH
THE WORK THAT BEFITS MY TITLE.

439
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,023

WORTHY OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP!

[AKATSUKI, THINKING] IN THE END,

447
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,986

A SINGLE ORAL ART.
