ALL THE MEMBERS OF PARTY ONE

25
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,382
AND GIVE THEM AN EQUAL SHARE.

26
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,617
ALL THE SURPLUS MAGIC POINTS
SHOULD ACT LIKE A BEACON

27
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:52,987

OTHER PARTIES FREE TO ATTACK.

28
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,222
[RICHO] THERE THEY GO.

[SHIROE] OKAY, GUYS, REMEMBER

185
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:16,404
TO RESTORE YOUR HIT POINTS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR ATTACKS!

186
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:19,774
[TARICTON] SLUMBER,

HE'S REVVING UP TO
LAUNCH HIS ATTACK AGAIN!

HIS AGGRO LIST.

201
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,351
[NAZNA]
WHILE IT'S WAITING TO RECAST,

202
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,853
IT SELECTIVELY ATTACKS THE
PLAYER WHO RACK UP THE MOST.

203
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:08,489
IT'S A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEFENSE.

204
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,491
[RIEZE, THINKING]
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT,

205
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,360
AND HE MANAGED TO KEEP
TRACK OF ALL THE PLAYERS,

206
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,662
WHAT THEY CAST, AND
HOW HEALTHY THEY WERE?

207

308
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:28,916
IT'S... IT'S SOMETHING LIKE...
THE "ROUND CABLE CIRCUMFERENCE?"

00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,785
[SHIROE]
"ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE."

310

WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT
THAT, ANYWAYS?

311
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,191
ALSO, WHEN DID YOU
COME BACK TO THE GAME?

312
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,992

319
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:53,908
HEY, KANAMI! IT'S
ALL CLEAR OUT HERE!

320
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,876
[KANAMI] SO LIKE WE WERE ON THE
ROAD,

321
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,878
AND I STUMBLED ON
THIS OLD TV STATION.

322
00:14:57,978 --> 00:15:00,080
AND THIS THINGY
LOOKED KINDA COOL,

323

WITH IT AND GOT A CONNECTION!

324
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,385
[SHIROE]
I SEE YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED...

325
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,654
[KANAMI]
OH, BY THE WAY, SHIROE!

326
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:09,790
I HAVE A DAUGHTER, SHE'S
THREE YEARS OLD NOW.

327
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,259
UHH...

328
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,460
[MINORI]
HER "DAUGHTER"?

329
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,595
[AKATSUKI]
WAIT SO SHE HAS A CHILD?

330
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,198
[SHIROE]
I KNOW SHE IS.

331
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:20,935
I'M SORRY I NEVER
CONGRATULATED YOU.

332
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,738
[KANAMI] HMM? I DON'T
REMEMBER TELLING YOU.

333
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:27,575
[SHIROE] YOU DIDN'T,
BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT.

334
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,478
WELL ANYWAY... CONGRATULATIONS.

335
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:31,612
[KANAMI]
THANK YOU, SHIROE!

336
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,581
[LEONARDO]
A KID?! SERIOUSLY?!

337
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:36,517
[KANAMI]
ANYWAY, SHE IS SO SUPER CUTE!

338
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:39,019
SHE RUNS OVER AND SLAMS INTO
ME, AND WHEN I HUG HER

339
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,456
SHE JUST CLINGS ON WITH HER
TINY LITTLE HANDS

340
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,358
REALLY REALLY TIGHT!

341
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,993
[SHIROE]
THAT'S ADORABLE.

342
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:50,398
I GUESS, YOU REALLY NEED TO GO
BACK TO OUR WORLD, I MEAN.

343
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,100
[KANAMI]
YEAH? WHAT FOR?

344
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,034
[SHIROE]
HUH?

345
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,336
[KANAMI]
OH! SHIROE!

346
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:56,604
YOU KNOW WHAT?

347
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,473
I WANNA SHOW HER WHAT
THIS WORLD IS LIKE.

348
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,341
I THINK SHE'D LOVE IT!

349
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,376
[SHIROE]
HUH?

350
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,311
IT'S BIG AND MAJESTIC!

351
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,679
AND YOU KNOW THE BEST PART?

352
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,281
ALL OF MOMMY'S FRIENDS ARE HERE!

353
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,983
NOW YOU'VE GOTTA ADMIT THAT
IS REALLY SUPER FANTASTIC.

354
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,718
I WANT HER TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE

355
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,387
AND MEET PEOPLE FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD!

356
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,554
[SHIROE]
UH...

357
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,523
[KANAMI]
AND SHE LOVES HIGH PLACES.

358
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,692
I COULD TAKE HER ON A GRIFFON!

359
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,527
I WANT TO SHOW HER THE GREAT
FORESTS,

360
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,129
THE OCEANS, AND THE DESERTS!

361
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:22,497
I WANT TO TEACH HER THAT

362
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,699
THIS WORLD IS A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL PLACE!

363
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,469
(INHALE) HMPH.

364
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:33,040
[SHIROE]
OK... YEAH, SURE... I GUESS SO.

365
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:37,512
HONESTLY I DID GIVE THIS
SOME THOUGHT ALREADY...

366
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,981
BUT STILL I JUST ASSUMED IT
WASN'T POSSIBLE.

367
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,484
NOT JUST GOING
BACK TO OUR WORLD,

368
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:47,188
OR STAYING IN THIS WORLD,
FOR THAT MATTER...

369
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,690
BUT RATHER A THIRD OPTION.

370
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:53,060
THAT THIS WORLD AND
OUR OLD WORLD...

371
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,363
THAT WE COULD CONNECT THEM AND
MAKE IT POSSIBLE

372
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,332
TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THEM.

373
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,203
[HENRIETTA] IT SOUNDS
INCREDIBLE. BUT COULD WE DO IT?

374
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,905
[SHIROE] I THINK IT'S
WORTH A TRY, HENRIETTA.

375
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,607
[TETORA] YEAH... BUT
DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING

376
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,343
ABOUT THE PRESENCE
OF ADVENTURERS

377
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:11,479
POSSIBLY BEING THE CAUSE OF
ALL THE TROUBLE AROUND HERE?

378
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,047
[SHIROE] YES, I DID, BUT I DON'T
KNOW

379
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,283
IF LEAVING THINGS IS
THE BEST THING TO DO.

380
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:16,717
THAT'S MASTER SHIROE.

381
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:19,387
THAT'S MY LORD, WOULDN'T
EXPECT ANYTHING LESS!

382
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,688
[KANAMI] COME ON, SHIROE!

383
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:23,057
LET'S FIND OUT IF WE
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN!

384
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,725
[SHIROE]
YOU MEAN, LIKE A QUEST?

385
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,128
[KANAMI]
DEFINITELY! MAKE IT A QUEST!

386
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:27,962
[SHIROE]
WELL, SORTA.

387
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:30,131
[KANAMI]
HUUH?! AW, SHIROE!

388
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:34,068
LOOK KANAMI, IT'S JUST...
I FOUNDED A GUILD, SEE?

389
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:36,404
IT'S CALLED LOG HORIZON.

390
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,606
AND I MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

391
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,275
[KANAMI]
OH, YEAH?

392
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:45,045
SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THIS
QUEST, WE'RE ALL TAKING IT.

393
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,014
[KANAMI]
HUH?

394
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:48,249
THAT'S RIGHT,

395
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:51,018
WE'LL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE
HERE TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT...

396
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,421
AND SINCE WE'RE OLD
FRIENDS AND ALL...

397
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:57,692
IF YOU MAKE IT IN TIME, I'D
LOVE FOR YOU TO SEE IT TOO.

398
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,461
[KANAMI]
I'VE MISSED YOU.

399
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,897
[SHIROE] IT'S A SOLUTION THAT
DOESN'T ABANDON OUR OLD WORLD

400
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:05,133
OR MAKE US LEAVE THIS ONE.

401
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,868
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

402
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,405
FIND IT. PROMISE ME!

403
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:13,574
[SHIROE] WE'LL TAKE IT,
KANAMI... LOG HORIZON...

404
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,343
WILL COMPLETE THIS QUEST.

405
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:17,978
[KANAMI] I'D EXPECT NOTHING
LESS FROM MY TOUR GUIDE!

406
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:21,716
[SHIROE] HUH?! YOU JUST HAD TO
BRING THAT UP, DIDN'T YOU?

407
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,884
[KANAMI] OH, YEAH.
I ALMOST FORGOT,

408
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:26,086
YOUR LITTLE PAL KRUSTY
IS OVER HERE.

409
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,322
[SHIROE]
HUH?

410
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:28,823
WAIT KRUSTY'S IN CHINA?!

411
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,259
[RIEZE]
WHAT? Y'MEAN MY LORD?!

412
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,860
[ALL]
WHAT?!

413
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,262
[SHIROE] DID I HEAR YOU RIGHT?
(RIEZE IN SHOCK)

414
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,464
DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY KRUSTY'S
THERE WITH YOU?!

415
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:37,765
[KANAMI] YEAH! TOTALLY!

416
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,567
BUT YOU KNOW, KRUSTY,
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO‐

417
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,835
(EXPLOSION)
[SHIROE] D'AHHH!

418
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,737
[REGAN]
HMM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

419
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,505
I SWEAR I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

420
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,741
MPH...

421
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,378
[KANAMI] HEY? WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU THERE SHIROE?

422
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,046
[LEONARDO, STRUGGLING]
YOU ARE GOING TO BREAK IT.

423
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:55,683
[KRUSTY] WELL WELL, SHIROE'S
THE SAME AS HE EVER WAS.

424
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,051
[KRUSTY]
ALWAYS ENTERTAINING...

425
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,586
[LEONARDO]
"ENTERTAINING"?

426
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,920
[KRUSTY]
SO THEN...

427
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,322
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

428
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:04,125
WHICH ONE OF MY SECONDS
WILL BE COMING TO GET ME.

429
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,394
MISA OR RIEZE?

430
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:08,062
[LEONARDO] KANAMI IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR FRIENDS ARE

431
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,097
JUST AS SCREWED UP AS YOU ARE.

432
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,336
[RAYNESHIA]
UNBELIEVABLE.

433
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,804
COME ON, KRUSTY!

434
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,739
AT THE VERY LEAST YOU
COULD'VE BEEN HERE FOR THIS.

435
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,642
I SWEAR THE NEXT TIME I SEE THAT
MONSTER HE IS REALLY IN FOR IT.

436
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:24,945
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE HE'S
GONNA GET A PIECE OF MY MIND.

437
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,182
[INTIX] YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD

438
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,049
ADVISE THE WESTELANDE
ARISTOCRATS

439
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,319
TO STABILIZE RELATIONS
WITH EASTAL?

440
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,020
[KAZUHIKO] THE SWARMS OF ETERNAL
MOTHS

441
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,089
WERE A PRODUCT OF
THE GENIUSES, YES?

442
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,592
INFIGHTING WILL ONLY
WEAKEN US, INTIX.

443
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,394
[INTIX]
IF I UNDERSTAND YOU,

444
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:42,730
YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE ALLY
OURSELVES WITH THE ROUND TABLE.

445
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,499
[KAZUHIKO]
IF WE NEED TO, OF COURSE.

446
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,603
WITH THAT TRAITOROUS PIG?
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

447
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,705
WE'RE NOT ALIGNING
OURSELVES WITH HIM,

448
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,507
AND WE'RE NOT LETTING
HIM GO HOME.

449
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,875
[NUREHA]
AND I COMMAND THE SAME.

450
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:57,712
SUSPEND PLANS FOR GOING
TO WAR WITH EASTAL.

451
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,013
[INTIX]
WHAT'S THAT?

452
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:02,317
THAT'S CUTE, YOU'RE
GIVING ME ORDERS NOW?

453
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,220
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING,
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT FILTHY

454
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,322
SEWER RAT AND A MINDLESS PUPPET!

455
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,957
YOU'RE GIVING ME
COMMANDS?! HUHH...?

456
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:12,327
(BREATH) UNBELIEVABLE...

457
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,496
MY DEAR, DO I NEED TO
REMIND YOU... HEH...

458
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,600
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SASS ME?!

459
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,968
[KAZUHIKO]
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH, INTIX.

460
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,971
[INTIX]
(BREATH) UH...

461
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,407
[NUREHA] I'M THE ONE WHO
MADE THE PROMISE, INTIX.

462
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,609
YOU WILL NOT BE THE
ONE TO FACE SHIROE.

463
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,478
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, YES?

464
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,046
(ANGRY EXHALE)

465
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,682
[KR] THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE
WILL CONTACT US SOON ENOUGH.

466
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:38,052
I'M SURE HE'S GOING OVER A
HUNDRED SCENARIOS IN HIS MIND

467
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,622
FOR NEGOTIATING WITH US, HE'S
NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH!

468
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:43,158
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE...

469
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,793
I'M SURE HE'LL COME UP WITH
SOMETHING TO THROW AT US.

470
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,662
WHATCHA SAY, INTIX?

471
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,063
[INTIX]
MPH.

472
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,832
[KR] WHEN YOU STEP
BACK AND LOOK AT IT,

473
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,868
I'M NOT LIKE KANAMI
OR LEONARDO.

474
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:57,638
I'M MORE LIKE KAZUHIKO,
DESTINED FOR THE SIDELINES.

475
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:59,207
BUT WHILE THAT'S TRUE,

476
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,677
GIVING UP THIS CHANCE TO SHINE
ISN'T REALLY AN OPTION FOR ME.

477
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,812
IF I WANT TO SEE
THE BLUE SKY AFTER

478
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:06,814
THIS STORM FINALLY PASSES BY.

479
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:09,617
I NEED TO... I NEED
TO GET STRONGER.

480
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:18,226
[ROE2] PERHAPS MY BIG BROTHER
WILL HAVE SOME USE FOR THIS...

481
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:22,397
LITTLE SISTERS, BIG SIS
IS DOING HER BEST, TOO!

482
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,970
[TOYA]
(SIGH) I'M SO HUNGRY!

483
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,872
[RUDY]
AH! SO AM I!

484
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,208
[ISUZU] WE HAVEN'T EATEN
ANYTHING

485
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,942
SINCE YESTERDAY, AFTER ALL.

486
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,811
[SERARA]
I MISS MAYONNAISE.

487
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,313
[AKATSUKI] RED BEAN BUNS ARE
JUST THE THING

488
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,247

[MINORI]

490
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,017

BUNCHA HUNGRY GUILDMATES

491
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,652
TO FEED WHEN WE GET HOME.

493
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:49,924

497
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,668
[AKATSUKI]

501
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,144

505
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:04,192
[MINORI] DID THE FLAN
MAKE IT TO THE TABLE?

506
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,427
[NAOTSUGU] HANG ON. WHERE
DID OLD DUSTY‐BUTT GO?

507
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,596
[SHIROE] HE'S TRYING TO GET
THE TRANSMITTER RUNNING AGAIN.

508
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:11,166
[ISAMI] SO WE'RE JUST HERE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON MISTER REGAN?

509
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,733
[OLIVE]
I WANT TO TAKE A BATH!

510
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,635
[NAZNA]
OH, DON'T REMIND ME.

511
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:16,171
[SOJIRO] WELL WE HAVE SOME
TIME, WHY DON'T WE TRY

512
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:18,038

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,574
(MOOING)
[KURINON] HEY!

514
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,643
THAT STUPID OLD FART JUST RAN
OFF AND LEFT US ALL HERE!

515
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:25,213
[MINORI] THERE'S STILL
MORE MAPO TOFU LEFT!

516
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:28,416
[AKATSUKI] WHATEVER. MY LORD
NEEDS ANOTHER HELPING OF CURRY!

517
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:31,119
[SHIROE] LADIES, I REALLY
THINK I MIGHT PUKE.

518
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,853
[REGAN]
NOW THAT LOOKS SCRUMPTIOUS!

519
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:33,888
[ALL]
