00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:02,603
(STREET NOISES)

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,005
[MAN A]
KEEP IT MOVING!

3
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,240
[MAN B] EIGHTEEN MORE
CASES OF EXP POTIONS!

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,043
[MIZPHA] HUMPH! THE GREED
OF THESE ADVENTURERS.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,913
I HEARD NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO BUILD A FLYING MACHINE.

6
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,916
FOR GOD'S SAKE, HOW MUCH
MORE DO THESE PEOPLE WANT?

7
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,317
[LOREILE] ALLOW
ME TO REMIND YOU

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,286
THAT OUR OWN PRINCESS NUREHA
IS AN ADVENTURER

9
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,489
AND SHE'S LENT THIS VERY TRAIN
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

10
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,057
WORTH SOME CONSIDERATION.

11
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,592
[MIZPHA]
HMPH...

12
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,429
WHATEVER THE MASTER CAPTAIN
OF THE PALACE GUARD WISHES.

13
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,200
[KR] PULLING SECURITY AGAIN?

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,436
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK YOU
ACTUALLY LIKE THIS SCHLEP WORK.

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,670
SO WHERE'S THE PRINCESS?

16
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,939
[KAZUHIKO]
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,341
[KR]
STILL COOPED UP INSIDE, HUH?

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,943
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
INTIX HAS PLANNED

19
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,912
FOR OUR RELUCTANT NOBLEWOMAN?

20
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,080
[KAZUHIKO]
REPLACING KANAMI.

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,649
I'M NOT SO SURE JUST ANYONE
CAN FILL THOSE BIG SHOES

22
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,384
OF HERS YOU KNOW?

23
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,820
THAT'S TRUE.

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,388
[KAZUHIKO] IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS
SINCE THE TEA PARTY DISBANDED.

25
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,258
I'M NOT SO SURE SHE WAS ALL
THAT INTERESTED IN COMING BACK.

26
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,161
I DUNNO, YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHO GOT CAUGHT IN HERE.

27
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:00,962
HUH?!

28
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,430
UH‐HUH, THAT'S RIGHT.

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,765
I RAN INTO HER WHEN I
WENT TO THE CHINA SERVER.

30
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,000
[KAZUHIKO] (GASP)
WAIT A MINUTE...

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,436
SHE STARTED PLAYING
ELDER TALES AGAIN.

32
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:09,737
[KR] GUESS SO...

33
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,373
AND LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIEND
SHE WAS PRETTY TERRIFYING!

34
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,476
SHE HASN'T CHANGED ONE
BIT SINCE THE LAST TIME.

35
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,546
SHE'S RESTED UP AND
READY TO DO SOME DAMAGE.

36
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,076
[KR, VOICEOVER]
RIGHT AFTER WE ALL WOKE UP HERE,

37
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,245
I DECIDED TO TAKE A
TRIP TO MAINLAND CHINA

38
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,547
TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND
OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE.

39
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,851
I USED SOUL POSSESSION AND TOOK
COMMAND OF A HORSE'S BODY.

40
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,652
AND THEN, THERE THEY WERE...

41
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:08,089
[KANAMI]
(CLANG) OOOOHHHH!

42
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,357
THIS IS SO SWEET!

43
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,392
I HAVE STRUCK IT
RICH WITH ADVENTURE!

44
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,461
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL, FROGNARDO!

45
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,729
[LEONARDO]
IT'S LEONARDO, KANAMI! LEONARDO!

46
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,398
[KANAMI]

47
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:21,069
BANG! BOOM! POW! SLAM! WOOHOO!
(EXPLOSIONS)

48
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,105
[KR] 'COURSE, SHE WASN'T
ALL THAT DIFFICULT TO FIND.

49
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,246
[KANAMI]
WHOA! THEY JUST KEEP COMING!

50
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,681
[LEONARDO] YEAH, WELL
I TRIED TO WARN YOU!

51
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:34,983
THIS IS A RAID‐RANKED EVENT!

52
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,985
[COPPELIA] 2000 DAYLIGHT
SHADES IN THE AREA.

53
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,286
[KANAMI] SO DEATH WARPS AND
RETURN SPELLS

54
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,687
WON'T GET US OUTTA THIS ONE?

55
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,324
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUYS?
OH THIS IS SO EXCITING!

56
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,359
[ELIAS] UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T
KILL ANYTHING

57
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,128
BECAUSE I'M STILL UNDER
THE FAIRY EYE'S CURSE.

58
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,596
[LEONARDO]
KINDA LAME, MY MAN.

59
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,164
[COPPELIA] THERE'S AN
OPENING IN THE BATTLEFIELD.

60
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,967
(ALL SURPRISED)

61
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,168
[LEONARDO]
WHAT IS THAT?!

62
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,236
[KANAMI]
WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE,

63
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,938
HOP ALONG FROG‐BOY!

64
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,339
[LEONARDO]
MY NAME'S LEONARDO!

65
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,775
[ELIAS] WHY DO WE HAVE
TO GO ON FOOT ANYWAY?!

66
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,912
[KANAMI]
WHAT?! THAT'S REALLY YOU KR?

67
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,614
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE ONE OF US
MUST'VE SUMMONED A HORSEY!

68
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,682
[KR] I SEE YOU'RE
THE SAME AS EVER...

69
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,352
I THOUGHT YOU GAVE UP THE GAME
FOR GOOD WHEN YOU LEFT JAPAN.

70
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,954
SO WHAT'S UP? WHAT HAPPENED?

71
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,356
[KANAMI] THEY'VE GOT COMPUTERS
IN OTHER COUNTRIES, YOU KNOW!

72
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,325
[KANAMI] AND WELL,
HERE WE ALL ARE!

73
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,194
[KR] OKAY, SO WHAT'RE YOU
DOING OUT HERE IN CHINA?

74
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,363
[KANAMI]
ME? I'M ON MY WAY BACK TO JAPAN!

75
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,832
[KR] WHAT? WHY WOULD
YOU GO BACK THERE?!

76
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,466
[ELIAS] UH, JAPAN'S
THE OTHER WAY.

77
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,369
[KANAMI] I HEARD THAT OVER
ON THE YAMATO SERVER

78
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,239
THEY'RE CALLING THIS WHOLE
PREDICAMENT THE "APOCALYPSE"

79
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,673
I REALLY WANT TO FIND
OUT WHAT CAUSED US ALL

80
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,242
TO GET PULLED INSIDE HERE.

81
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,709
[LEONARDO] I THINK IT'S
SAFE TO SAY IT HAS

82
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,280
SOMETHING TO DO WITH
NOVASPHERE PIONEERS.

83
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,748
[KR, VOICEOVER] WHEN THE
DEVELOPERS CREATED

84
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,683
THE TWELFTH EXPANSION PACK,
YOU HAVE TO WONDER

85
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,653
IF THIS WAS ALL PLANNED OR SOME
SORT OF HUGE ACCIDENT.

86
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,521
I DON'T KNOW BUT...
GOD ONLY KNOWS

87
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,123
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE LOGGED IN

88
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,859
WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE
UPGRADE.

89
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,360
WHY SO MANY
JAPANESE?

90
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,028
[KR] YAMATO'S
FURTHEST TO THE EAST.

91
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,129
[KAZUHIKO]
WHAT?

92
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,330
THEY SCHEDULED
EVERY SERVER TO

93
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,833
COME BACK UP AT
MIDNIGHT ON MAY 3RD.

94
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,502
[KAZUHIKO] AH, SO THE REST OF
THE COUNTRIES DIDN'T COME UP

95
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,004
UNTIL EACH HOUR AFTERWARDS,

96
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,839
EXCEPT FOR INDIA AND KOREA.

97
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,140
[KR]
THERE YA GO.

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,675
EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,

99
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:09,343
SHE MANAGED TO PUT
A PARTY TOGETHER.

100
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,713
[LEONARDO] AHHH... MAN
I MISS MEGAMEAT PIZZAS.

101
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,349
[KR, VOICEOVER] LEONARDO, THEIR
ASSASSIN, WAS PULLED OUT OF

102
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,052
THE AMERICAN SERVER WHEN
HE USED A FAIRY RING.

103
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,587
NOW HE'S STUCK HERE, TOO.

104
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,555
HE HAD JUST JOINED THE
PARTY WHEN I FOUND HER.

105
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,424
[COPPELIA] WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE HEALED, LEONARDO?

106
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,593
[KR, VOICEOVER]
KANAMI MANAGED TO FIND COPPELIA,

107
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,829
THE CLERIC IN HER GROUP,
WHILE SNOOPING AROUND.

108
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,731
[LEONARDO] NOPE... I'M JUST
JONESIN' FOR A PIZZA PIE.

109
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,467
[KR, VOICEOVER] AND THEN THERE'S
THE SWORDSMAN ELIAS HACKBLADE.

110
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,270
[KAZUHIKO, VOICEOVER] WHAT? AS
IN THE ANCIENT ELIAS HACKBLADE?!

111
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,206
[KR, VOICEOVER] THERE
ARE 13 ORDER OF CHIVALRY

112
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,141

113
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,244
HE BELONGS TO THE KNIGHTS
OF THE RED BRANCH.

114
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,546
NOT ONLY IS THIS
GUY A BLADE‐MANCER,

115
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,449
HE'S ALSO A NOBLE OF
ANCIENT OF THE BLUE BLOOD.

116
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,819
I MEAN THIS GUY'S ON THE
COVER OF THE ELDER TALES

117
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,321
MANUAL FOR GOD'S SAKE!

118
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,957
DIDN'T WE COME TO AGREE THAT
ALL THE ANCIENTS WERE GONE?

119
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,659
AND NO ONE'S EVER SEEN THE
IZUMO KNIGHTS BACK IN YAMATO.

120
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,395
SO TELL ME THIS, WHAT
WOULD A GUY LIKE THAT

121
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,131
BE DOING RUNNING
AROUND WITH KANAMI?

122
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,599
[KR] WELL, IT IS KANAMI.
[KAZUHIKO] GOOD POINT.

123
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,903
ANYWAY, WE MOVED ON AND
CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY.

JUST NEEDED TO STOP
ALL THIS NONSENSE.

YOU NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE?

00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:35,523
AND THE NEXT THEY'RE ATTACKING
PEOPLE LIKE A RABID ANIMAL.

167
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,125
IT HAS EVERYONE SCARED TO DEATH.

168
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,593
THE VILLAGERS HAVE BEEN CALLING
THE SICKNESS "YIGUI,"

169
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,396
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
MAKING IT HAPPEN. (BOY SHUDDERS)

170
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,700
[KANAMI] IT'S ALL SO
MYSTERIOUS, YOU KNOW.

171
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,570
[SHIROE] WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN!
[KANAMI] HM?

172
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,939
[SHIROE] EVERYONE'S GOT TO PUT
IN THE WORK TO SEE

173
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,406
THAT NEW SUNRISE.

174
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,542
AND I KINDA GET THE FEELING YOU
REALLY WANT TO SEE IT,

175
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,545
DON'T YOU? (KANAMI
LETS OUT SMALL LAUGH)

176
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,213
[ELIAS] I HEARD YOU HAVE
MERCHANTS COMING

177
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,849
TO THE VILLAGE IN A FEW DAYS.

178
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,084
[COPPELIA] THEY MIGHT HAVE THE
CONSUMABLES WE NEED

179
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:04,752
AND POSSIBLY SOME INFORMATION.

180
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,455
[KR] WE SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT
FOR THE MERCHANTS TO GET HERE.

181
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,023
[KANAMI]
DEFINITELY.

182
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,460
(ANNOYED)

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,661
[BOY A]
HEY, MISTER!

184
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,229
[GIRL A]
WHAT'RE YOU ALL GREEN FOR?

185
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,298
[BOY B]
YEAH! YOU LOOK LIKE A BIG FROG!

186
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,133
[LEONARDO]
SURE! FROGS ARE HEROIC!

187
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,601
NINJA FROGS ARE WARRIORS ‐

188
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,437
AND THE ULTIMATE SYMBOL OF
BRAVERY ALL OVER THE WORLD!

189
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,939
[BOY D]
YOU LOOK FUNNY!

190
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,908
[BOY B] YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.
[BOY C] FROGGIES JUMP!

191
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:30,378
[LEONARDO] JESUS CHRIST, FORGOT
HOW MUCH I HATE FRICKIN' KIDS.

192
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,513
[LEONARDO, THINKING] I
BETTER HOLD IT TOGETHER.

193
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,082
IF I START WAILING ON A BUNCH
OF LITTLE CHILDREN

194
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,749
I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE A D‐BAG.

195
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,719
I JUST HEARD A MARE CAME
ONTO YOU IN THE BARN, KR!

196
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,321
[KR] (SHARP BREATH)
WHO TOLD YOU THAT!

197
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,523
[KANAMI] ARE YOU A STUDLY STUD?
[KR] OH SHUT UP!

198
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,358
[KANAMI] SO, HOW ARE
THINGS OVER IN JAPAN?

199
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,128
I BETCHA GOT A LOT OF
STORIES TO SHARE BY NOW!

200
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,065
[KANAMI]
HUH?! SHIROE DID WHAT?

201
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,467
[KR] APPARENTLY HE'S THE CENTRAL
FIGURE IN AN ORGANIZATION

202
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,904
KNOWN AS THE ROUND
TABLE CONFERENCE.

203
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,105
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON,

204
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,973
SOMEONE ELSE SERVES AS THE
OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE.

205
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,175
[KANAMI] (GIGGLE) LOOKS LIKE
MY TOUR GUIDE'S MOVING UP!

206
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,777
[SHIROE]
EHMMMM! (SHUDDERING)

207
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,612
IS EVERYTHING ALL
RIGHT, MY LORD?

208
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,580
I GUESS... IT JUST
KINDA FELT LIKE

209
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,182
SOMEONE DROPPED THE WEIGHT OF
THE ENTIRE WORLD

210
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,650
ON MY SHOULDERS.

211
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,819
(GRUNT)

212
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,720
[LEONARDO, THINKING]
BEFORE WE GOT PULLED IN HERE

213
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,322
I WAS NEVER ABLE TO
USE MORE THAN

214
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,990
ONE FIGHTING SKILL AT A TIME.

215
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,626
BUT NOW THAT I CAN ACTIVATE THE
SKILLS WITH MY OWN BODY,

216
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,430
I CAN QUEUE UP CONSECUTIVE
MOVES BEFORE I EVEN USE THEM!

217
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,799
[LEONARDO]
(PANTING) HEY COPPELIA.

218
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,868
[COPPELIA] LEONARDO, YOU
COULD USE SOME HEALING.

219
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:30,271
[LEONARDO] UH, NAH. I'M FINE.
(HEAVY BREATHS)

220
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:31,572
[LEONARDO] SO, TELL ME...

221
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,975
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE EXPANSION PACK?

222
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,743
[COPPELIA] THE ONLY THING
COPPELIA HAS HEARD IS

223
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:37,812
THAT IT WAS LAUNCHED
ON THE YAMATO SERVER.

224
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,580
[LEONARDO] OK, SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF GOING

225
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,649
OVER TO THE YAMATO SERVER?

226
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,217
MISTRESS KANAMI WOULD
LIKE TO GO THERE...

227
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,220
AND SO COPPELIA WILL BE MAKING
IT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

228
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,224
SO WHAT'S YOUR "MISTRESS
KANAMI'S" DEAL ANYWAY? UH?

229
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:55,096
[COPPELIA] COPPELIA'S
MISTRESS... IS LIKE... THE DAWN.

230
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,664
[LEONARDO]
HUH?

231
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,100
[COPPELIA] RIGHT NOW...
THE SUN IS RACING...

232
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,669
IT'S HIDING BEHIND THE SKY.

233
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,738
AND THERE IT HAS BEEN, ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD...

234
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,844
BUT TOMORROW AT 04:38, LIGHT
WILL FILL THE EASTERN SKY.

235
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:13,147
AT NIGHT, THE SKY IS
FILLED WITH DARKNESS.

236
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:18,286
A DARK PURPLE BEGINS TO COLOR
THE EAST ‐ SLOWLY, CALMLY.

237
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:21,755
NEXT, THE PURPLE
GRADUALLY LIFTS...

238
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,892
AND THEN, IT TURNS TO BLUE.

239
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:27,796
YET, THERE IS STILL NO LIGHT,
EVEN AS THE SHADES SPREAD.

240
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:31,866
IT CAN'T BE SEEN, BUT ITS
PRESENCE GUIDES US ALL.

241
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,236
AND IT IS THIS GLOWING BLUE
PROMISE OF DAWN

242
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:39,007
THAT KEEPS PEOPLE
FROM GIVING UP.

243
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:42,176
AND MY MISTRESS... IS
THAT GLOWING PROMISE.

244
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,313
(EXHALE)

245
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:48,016
[KR] NOW LET'S JUMP
AHEAD A FEW DAYS...

246
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:51,019
SURE ENOUGH, THE MERCHANT
CARAVAN STROLLED INTO TOWN.

247
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,086
HOWEVER...

248
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,088
[CHUNG LU]
YOU MAY REFER TO ME AS CHUNG LU.

249
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,157
I AM A PERSONAL BODYGUARD
AFFILIATED WITH

250
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,026
THE LELANG CANINE CAVALRY.

251
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:01,629
UNFORTUNATELY... WE WERE
AMBUSHED. I WAS ISOLATED...

252
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,198
AND I WAS UNABLE TO FEND
OFF THE ATTACKERS.

253
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,800
[KANAMI]
OH?

254
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,636
[ELIAS]
SO TELL US. WHAT HAPPENED?

255
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:12,740
[RASPHIA] INSIGNIFICANT PAWNS.

256
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,275
THEY'LL GET THE FATE
THEY DESERVE.

257
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:18,579
[PAPS] EVERY WORLD DEMANDS
WEAKLINGS FALL ASIDE.

258
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,689
[CHUNG LU]
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

259
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,491
NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE
ESCORTED THIS CARAVAN

260
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,226
SAFELY TO IT'S DESTINATION.

261
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,628
[KANAMI] OH NO, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. I THINK WE WERE ALL

262
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,198
HEADING IN THE SAME
DIRECTION, ANYWAY.

263
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,968
[CHUNG LU, THINKING] EVER SINCE
THE APOCALYPSE OCCURRED...

264
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,570
THE LELANG CANINE CAVALRY
HAS BEEN FINDING WORK

265
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,840
AS A BODYGUARD AGENCY
FOR TRAVELING NPCS.

266
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,341
[CHUNG LU]
I DO APOLOGIZE.

267
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,843
[JUHA]
NOBODY'S BLAMING YOU FOR IT!

268
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:50,344
YOU WERE OUTNUMBERED OUT THERE!

269
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,713
[CHUNG LU]
BUT I...

270
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:56,384
I MEAN... WE CAN ALWAYS
COME BACK TO LIFE!

271
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,152
WE'RE ADVENTURERS...

272
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,453
[LEONARDO]
OKAY, FINE,

273
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,622
SO A FEW NPCS BIT THE
DUST ALONG THE WAY.

274
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,958
THEY'RE DATA. NO BIGGIE.

275
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,794
[KR] DIDN'T YOU SAY THE
LELANG CANINE CAVALRY IS

276
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:07,796
GOING TO EXTERMINATE
A HORDE OF GNOLLS?

277
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,531
[CHUNG LU] RIGHT. THEY'RE
GOING IN WITH 96 PLAYERS.

278
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,034
A TRUE LEGION RAID. 4 PARTIES.

279
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,904
THE GNOLLS ARE IN THE PILLAR
RUINS OF TONE'S GRAVE.

280
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:19,073
AND THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY'S
HEADED. OVER 4000 STRONG.

281
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,542
[LEONARDO] HEY, AS LONG AS YOUR
GUYS ARE ALL LEVEL 90 OR BETTER,

282
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,444
THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM, RIGHT?

283
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:24,979
[KANAMI, THINKING]
GOD, I'M SO JEALOUS!

284
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,481
I WANNA BE IN A FIGHT LIKE THAT!

285
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,385
[RASPHIA] WE MUST NOT LEAVE
THE CORRIDOR TO HEAVEN AGAPE.

286
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,621
IT'S TOO MUCH FUN
TO SEE THEIR TORMENT

287
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,456
OF NOT KNOWING WHAT'S TO COME!

288
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,658
[PAPS] LET THEIR
DEATHS BE SWIFT!

289
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,928
(SURPRISED)

290
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:41,996
[LEONARDO]
THEY GOT WIPED OUT?!

291
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,099
[CHUNG LU] THE ENTIRE LEGION
WAS CUT DOWN LIKE DOGS.

292
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,169
ON TOP OF THAT, A NEW GROUP OF
MONSTERS WITH TWO STATUS BARS

293
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,704
WERE SPOTTED, ALONG
WITH A BLACK DRAGON.

294
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,874
[COPPELIA]
THE PARALLEL ONES...

295
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,508
[KR] KANAMI!
[ALL] HM?

296
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,277
[KR] A HORDE OF GNOLLS ARE
ADVANCING TOWARD THE NEXT ZONE.

297
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,347
SOMEWHERE AROUND 500 OF THEM!
(KANAMI GASPS)

298
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:00,949
[KR] AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,

299
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,984
THEY'RE GONNA END UP HITTING THE
VILLAGE WHERE WE JUST STAYED!

300
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:06,154
[LEONARDO] I THOUGHT GNOLLS ONLY
HUNG OUT IN CAVES AND RUINS.

301
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:07,755
[LEONARDO, THINKING] THEY'RE
ONLY SUPPOSED TO ATTACK

302
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:08,689
IF YOU MESS WITH 'EM!

303
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,191
[KR] YEAH, WELL!

304
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,360
SOMETHING'S GOT 'EM ALL RILED
UP AND LOOKING FOR DINNER!

305
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,662
[KANAMI]
AWESOME! AWESOME!

306
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,165
FIVE HUNDRED GUARDS MEANS
ONE HECK OF A TREASURE!

307
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,333
I COULD NEVER HAVE FUN LIKE
THIS IN THE REAL WORLD!

308
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,334
NOT EVEN CLOSE!

309
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,602
[LEONARDO]
WHAT?

310
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,371
NOW THIS IS THE FIGHT
I WAS LOOKING FOR!

311
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:24,839
I'VE STRUCK IT RICH IN COMBAT!

312
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,474
[LEONARDO]
WHAT?!

313
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:29,377
[KANAMI] THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PASS UP!

314
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,213
[KR] WAIT. YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING GOING DOWN

315
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,582
TO TONE'S GRAVE AND
TAKING ON 500 GNOLLS?!

316
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,051
[KANAMI] WAY TO GO, KR!
I'M GLAD YOU GET IT!

317
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,719
(KR WHINNIES)
[LEONARDO] ARE YOU CRAZY?!

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,088
[LEONARDO]
DIDN'T YOU JUST HEAR THAT

319
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,323
THE LEGION RAID GOT THEIR
ASSES HANDED TO 'EM?

320
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,926
[KANAMI] THAT'S BECAUSE THEY
WENT IN WITHOUT SCOUTING IT.

321
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:48,562
WE'RE GONNA GATHER INFO... AND
WE'RE NOT GONNA PICK A FIGHT.

322
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,864
AND WHEN THEY LEAVE,

323
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,699
WE'RE GONNA RUN INSIDE
AND KILL THE BIG BOSS!

324
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,167
IT'LL BE A PERFECT GAME!

325
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,136
WE'LL BE THE CHAMPIONS

00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:58,006
[LEONARDO] UH?
[KR] DO WE EVEN HAVE ANY INTEL?

327
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,508
[KANAMI] THINK ABOUT
EVERYTHING CHUNG LU TOLD US!

328
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,844
[KR] HUH? HOW IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO HELP?

329
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:05,213
[KANAMI] YOU'RE THE STRATEGIST,
KR. FIGURE IT OUT!

330
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:07,816
(WHINNY) [LEONARDO]
OH MAN. THERE IS NO WAY!

331
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,683
[KANAMI] LOOK, IT REALLY ISN'T A
MATTER OF WHETHER WE CAN

332
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,085
OR WHETHER WE CAN'T GET IT DONE.

333
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,954
[LEONARDO]
THEN WHAT IS IT?!

334
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,088
(GIGGLE)

335
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,990
[KANAMI]
WE JUST NEED TO BE THERE, OKAY?

336
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,159
[LEONARDO] AND WHY DO WE
"NEED" TO BE THERE?

337
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,762
[KANAMI] (INHALE) YOU ALREADY
KNOW. AND YOU DON'T NEED TO ASK.

338
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,564
[LEONARDO]
HUH?

339
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:28,369
WHY IN GOD'S NAME SHOULD WE RISK
OUR NECKS FOR A BUNCH OF NPCS?

340
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:31,472
[ELIAS] I'M WITH KANAMI ON THIS
ONE. [LEONARDO] UH...!

341
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,108
[ELIAS] I'M NOT SAYING THIS OUT
OF SOME SENSE OF DEBT TO HER.

342
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,210
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN ANCIENT.

346
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:45,987
[LEONARDO, THINKING] YEAH,

SOUPED‐UP PERSON OF THE LAND!

349
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,694
[ELIAS]
WHAT ABOUT THE VILLAGERS?

350
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,763
[KANAMI] CHUNG LU, CAN
YOU WARN THEM FOR US?

351
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,231
[CHUNG LU] I'M ON IT.

[COPPELIA] COPPELIA WILL ALSO

WE CAN'T BEAT 500

354
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,539
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU OWE THESE
PEOPLE ANYTHING, YOU KNOW! HUH?

355
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:11,412
COPPELIA IS NOT A PLAYER, BUT
STILL COMPELLED TO DO THIS.

356
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,615
[COPPELIA] A MONEY‐LAUNDERING

THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO ENRICH
THEIR MASTERS AND NOT CONSIDER

359
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,057

SUCH BOT.

363
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,173
[KR] I WAS KINDA CURIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING.

364
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,376
[KR] WHAT DID, UH, COPPELIA
HAVE TO SAY TO YOU?

365
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,714
[LEONARDO] (SIGH) THAT SHE
WAS CREATED IN THE GAME...

366
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,149
JUST A FARMING BOT.

367
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:51,719
SOMETHING THAT PLAYS THE
GAME FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

368
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,655
SHE'S JUST ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE.

369
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,424
[COPPELIA]
TODAY'S ACTIVITY.

370
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,427
COPPELIA SUMMARY: HEALED
A TOTAL OF 18 PEOPLE,

371
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,195
BLESSED ANOTHER 49.

372
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,665
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS HELPFUL
CANNOT BE OFFICIALLY DETERMINED.

373
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,835
COPPELIA DID RECEIVE VERBAL
INDICATION

374
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,602
FROM MANY OF THE ASSISTED.

375
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,839
COPPELIA WAS THANKED AND
APPRECIATED.

376
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,174
THIS OCCURRED 319 TIMES,

377
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,043
BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING.

378
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,146
DID ANY OF IT HELP...?
DID I HELP?

379
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:22,283
[LEONARDO, THINKING]
SO HOW WOULD "THEY" HANDLE THIS?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,469

WHY THE HECK WERE YOU A HORSE?
(KR CRACKING BONES)

392
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,682
IT'S A LITTLE TRANS‐POSITIONING
SPELL CALLED CASTLING.

393
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,251
SUMMONERS USUALLY USE
IT IN AN EMERGENCY

394
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,920
TO SWITCH PLACES WITH A BEAST

395
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,222
THAT'S BEEN SUMMONED
AS A COMPANION.

396
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:02,824
[LEONARDO] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

397
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,625
[KR] IT MEANS THAT I JUST
TRANSFERRED OVER TO

ONLY TO BE DESTROYED!

488
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,235
[ELIAS, THINKING]
THE FAIRIES, THEY AREN'T REAL.

489
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:10,805
AND THE ANCIENTS OR THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND... AH!

490
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,640
IT'S ALL A FANTASY...

491
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,543
[PAPS] AND AS SUCH, YOU ARE
MEANT TO BE FORGOTTEN

492
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,345
ONCE YOU ARE GONE.

493
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,849
YOU ARE BORN FROM NOTHING,
YOUR TIMELINE FROZEN,

494
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,284
YOU RETURN TO NOTHING!

495
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:28,056
[KANAMI] YEAH, WELL I
DON'T THINK SO! HWAH!

496
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,291
(ELIAS GASPS)
[KANAMI] DO YOU HEAR ME?!

497
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:33,261
ELI'S ALWAYS GONNA BE RIGHT HERE
WITH ME! YOU UNDERSTAND?!

498
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,796
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PLANS!

499
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,698
AND WE'RE GONNA BE IN THIS
TOGETHER FOR A LONG LONG TIME!

500
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,068
SO YOU CAN JUST KEEP YOUR
CREEPY LITTLE TENTACLES

501
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,503
OFF, YOU GOT ME?!

502
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,906
[KR, VOICEOVER] GRANTED, I'M NOT
QUITE SURE ABOUT THE DETAILS

503
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,540
OF HOW THEY GOT OUTTA THAT.

504
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,643
[KAZUHIKO] WORRYING ABOUT HER
IS A BIG WASTE OF TIME, ANYWAY.

505
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,913
GUESS SHE REALLY HASN'T
CHANGED AT ALL.

506
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:55,683
I TOLD YOU! SHE'S JUST AS
CRAZY AS SHE ALWAYS WAS.

507
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:57,085
(SURPRISED)
[MAN D] PRINCESS NUREHA!

508
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,187
(MURMURS)

509
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,454
[INTIX] GO AHEAD
AND GIVE THEM WHAT

510
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:02,056
THEY'RE ASKING FOR,
"YOUR MAJESTY."

511
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:04,292
[MAN E] WHOA! IT'S
REALLY THE PRINCESS!

512
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,127
[WOMAN C] PRINCESS NUREHA!

513
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,029
[INTIX, THINKING]
HMPH! JUST KEEP IT UP.

514
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,697
SMILE YOU'RE PRETTY
LITTLE SMILE AND

515
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:13,367
GIVE THE RABBLE SOME HOPE. AFTER
ALL, IT'S ALL THEY'RE GONNA GET.

516
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,904
[KAZUHIKO] HAVE YOU TOLD
INTIX ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

517
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,839
[KR] NUH‐UH. NO WAY.
FAR AS I KNOW,

518
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,008
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW KANAMI
STARTED PLAYING AGAIN.

519
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:20,909
(ANNOYED)

520
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,310
HMPH.

521
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,644
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHIN'

522
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,347
WHEN THEY FINALLY RUN
INTO EACH OTHER, HUH?

523
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,516
(SIGH)

524
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:32,286
(CHEERING)

525
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,722
[SORCERER A]
MAGIC CIRCLES ARE READY.

526
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:38,326
[SORCERER B] RAILWAY MODS ARE
SET. BY YOUR COMMAND, MILADY.

527
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,929
[MIZPHA]
IT'S TIME TO GO TO WAR PEOPLE.

528
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,631
AND IT BEGINS IN THE EAST!

529
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,091
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
IT IS AN OBJECT OF DESIRE

530
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,793
AMONG INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS.

531
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,930
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING CAN
FIT INSIDE "THE MAGIC BAG."

532
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,165
MINORI AND THE OTHER JUNIOR
MEMBERS ARE GOING ON

533
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,699
A QUEST TO CREATE THEIR OWN.

534
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,469
A NEW AND UNDISCOVERED WORLD
AWAITS THEM AS THEIR HEARTS

535
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,538
SWELL WITH FEAR AND
ANTICIPATION.

536
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:34,375
THEIR CARRIAGE IS PACKED
TIGHT, WITH HOPES AND DREAMS.

537
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:37,445
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES
ARE ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
