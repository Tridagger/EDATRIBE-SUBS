1
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,384
[NYANTA] I DOUBT THAT EVEN
SHIROE‐ECHHI COULD HAVE

2
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:11,522
ANTICIPATED A
PREDICAMENT LIKE THIS.

3
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,426
(SIGH) LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
NEED TO INTERVENE

4
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,962
A LITTLE MORE DIRECTLY
THAN I'D PLANNED.

5
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,566
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

6
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,465
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO DO IT RIGHT.

7
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,300
IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A TOWN OR VILLAGE,

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,637
YOU NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO GET THE CONFLICT

9
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:08,939
AWAY FROM THE POPULATION AS
QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.

10
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,643
I UNDERSTAND... IF YOU'RE
FIGHTING FOR YOUR HOME...

11
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:15,111
YOU WANT A HOME STANDING ONCE
THE FIGHTING'S DONE.

12
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,314
LEAVING THE STRUCTURES IN
TACT ONLY MAKES SENSE.

13
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,385
[SERARA] RIGHT! WE CAN'T
USE OUR TELEPATHIC LINK,

14
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,421
SO LEAVE YOUR PARTY‐CHAT ON
WHILE YOU GUYS GET OVER HERE!

15
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,157
ROGER THAT.

16
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,538
[MINORI, THINKING] NONE OF
THEM ARE ALL THAT POWERFUL.

17
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,874
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S SO MANY!

18
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:46,042
WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING!

19
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,478
[SERARA] YOU THINK MISS
ROE2'S OKAY BACK THERE?

20
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,414
[TOYA] C'MON! BIG SIS
CAN HANDLE HERSELF!

21
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,316
[MAN A] OVER HERE! HURRY!
(SERARA GASPS)

22
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,518
[MOTHER B] DON'T LET
GO OF MY HAND.

23
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,752
[MAN A] C'MON! KEEP MOVING!

24
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,487
[TOYA] SERARA? YOU OKAY?

25
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,656
IT'S AMAZING THEY'RE
ACTING SO CALM.

26
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,257
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

27
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,293
[ALL] UH...?

28
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,929
[MINORI] IT'S THE
ODYSSEY KNIGHTS!

29
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,131
[TOYA] SO THEY'RE
GONNA FIGHT 'EM!

30
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,235
[SERARA] THAT'S WHY THE
VILLAGERS AREN'T PANICKING!

31
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:13,970
[TOYA] WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING.

32
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,373
HEH. (HEAVY BREATHS)

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,281
(KNOCK, KNOCK)

34
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,584
(KNOCK, KNOCK)

35
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,554
[RUDY] MISS ISUZU?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

36
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:33,056
UH... (EXHALE)

37
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:42,232
MM?

38
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,203
UH... MM.

39
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,375
[ISUZU] DO YOU THINK... THAT
THE BATTLE'S ALREADY STARTED?

40
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,044
(EXHALES)

41
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:56,613
MISS ISUZU!

42
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:58,014
UH? WHAT NOW?

43
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,883
(GIGGLE)

44
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:03,687
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR!
RUNDELLHAUS KODE IS HERE!

45
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,022
SAPHIR VILLAGE
AND MISS ISUZU!

46
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,692
ALONG WITH MISS
MINORI AND SERARA!

47
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,762
YOU ARE SAFE WITH MY
PASSIONATE ORB OF LAVA

48
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,897
PROTECTING YOU FROM HARM! GAH!

49
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,733
RUDY! THIS IS NO TIME
TO GOOF AROUND! HM?

50
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,569
EHEHEHE...
MM?

51
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,803
PREPARE YOURSELF...

52
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,371
WHAT NOW, RUDY?

53
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:25,441
UH...? HUH?

54
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,977
WHA‐ WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

55
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:29,212
[RUDY] THIS IS CALLED
THE "BIRD SHOE."

56
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,382
YOU WON'T REALLY FLY LIKE
A BIRD OR ANYTHING PER SE.

57
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,952
BUT YOU WILL NOTICE BEING ABLE
TO GET AROUND MUCH MORE QUICKLY!

58
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,921
SO IT'S A SPELL TO
MAKE ME RUN FASTER?

59
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,755
EXACTLY.

60
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,257
OH! THIS IS AWESOME!

61
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,126
[RUDY] I TOLD YOU
I'M A GENIUS, RIGHT?!

62
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,930
EHEH! WHATEVER YOU
SAY RUDY. UH! HUH?

63
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:49,099
LET'S GO!

64
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,700

(BATTLE CRIES)

68
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,474
WHAT IS THIS...?

69
00:04:58,575 --> 00:04:59,910
(MORE BATTLE CRIES
AND CHUCKLING)

70
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:02,278
(MINORI INHALES)
[TOYA] THEY WANNA DIE...?

71
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:04,114
[KNIGHT A] COME AND GET ME,
COME AND GET ME!

72
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:05,849

I'M RIGHT HERE!

73
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:06,983
[KNIGHT C] GET HIM!

74
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,220
OH NO... WHAT'RE
THEY DOING?

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,221
UWHAHH!

76
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:14,090

[KNIGHT G]
SHUNICHI! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

82
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,436
[KNIGHT D] LET ME DIE WITH YOU!
[KNIGHT C] ME, TOO!

83
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,238
(SCREAM)

84
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:29,506
THEY HAVE NO...

85
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,808
STRATEGY... OR TEAMWORK.

86
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,276
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

87
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,812
THEY'RE MAKING THE
WYVERNS ATTACK THEM!

88
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:40,416
I DON'T GET IT! WHAT ARE
THEY DOING OUT THERE?

89
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,818
[SHUNICHI]
I'M RIGHT HERE!

90
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,821
DO IT! TAKE ME TO THE
OTHER SIDE! ARGHHH!

[KNIGHT H]
UGH, WHAT, I'M BACK ALREADY.

93
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:52,796
[KNIGHT F] SO QUICK.

94
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:53,930
[KNIGHT G] THAT WAS
MY THIRD TIME.

95
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,065
[KNIGHT H]
GO, GO, GO!

96
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,667
[KNIGHT I]
AH! LET'S DO IT AGAIN!

97
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:00,070
[TOYA] I WAS RIGHT...
THEY REALLY WANNA DIE!

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,139
[ROE2] IT'S A PRETTY INTERESTING
STRATEGY IF YOU ASK ME.

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,610
[ROE 2] THE SHRINE
IS RESPAWNING THEM.

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,078
IT'S JUST LIKE A CATHEDRAL.

101
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:09,179
ONLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE

102
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,614
THE WAIT TIME THEY
USUALLY WOULD.

103
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:11,615
(KNIGHT GRUNTING)

104
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:12,616
WHAT KIND OF INVENTOR COULD

105
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:13,584
COME UP WITH THAT...?

106
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,652
IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

107
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:16,887
BIG SIS ROE2?

108
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,590
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
INTERESTED, RIGHT, TOYA?

109
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,991
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

110
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,627
"INTERESTED?!" THAT MACHINE
IS DISGUSTING...!

111
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:24,928
TOTALLY WRONG!

112
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,130
NO... THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH IT.

113
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:28,799
IT'S JUST AN INVENTION

114
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,501
THAT USES THE LAWS
OF THIS WORLD.

115
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,135
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

116
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,870
[ROE2]
AND FROM WHERE I'M STANDING...

117
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,672
THOSE KNIGHTS ARE GIVING
UP THEIR EMPATHIUM

118
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,108
TO THE SYSTEM FREELY ENOUGH.
[SERARA] EH?

119
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,643
THE HARVESTING RATE IS EXCELLENT

120
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,144
CONSIDERING ALL THE
DYING THEY'RE DOING.

121
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,379
THE GENIUSES ARE DEFINITELY
BENEFITTING FROM IT.

122
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,349
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!
THEY'RE ALL DYING...!

123
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,118
WE GOTTA STOP THIS!

124
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,452
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

125
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:52,923
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO DIE OUT THERE.

126
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:54,290
[ROE2] NONE OF THEM
ARE SLOWING DOWN

127
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,526
OR STOPPING.

128
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,860
THEIR ACCELERATED TRIP THROUGH

129
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,962
THE SHRINE LET'S THEM
SEE THEIR FORMER LIVES,

130
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:00,296
AND THEY'RE ADDICTED TO IT!

131
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,199
OF COURSE, I NEVER
EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF.

LONDARK HERE, NO HOSTILE
CONTACTS HAVE BEEN SEEN.

134
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,088
THE MAGIC RAILS APPEAR TO
BE RUNNING SPLENDIDLY.

135
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,990
[SORCERER B] WE'VE RECEIVED
A REPORT FROM LORD LONDARK.

136
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,559
EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE WELL.

137
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,927
[MIZPHA] HE SCRAMBLES OUT OF
SUSUKINO LIKED A WHIPPED DOG,

138
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,596
AND STILL GETS
TREATED LIKE NOBILITY

139
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:33,964
BECAUSE HE'S AN ADVENTURER?!

140
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,431

144
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,006
HEH! LET THE FOOLS DIE.

145
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,576

00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,575

170
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,700
[MIZPHA] FASCINATING.

171
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,269

I WILL BEGIN ADMINISTERING

176
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,946
HUH? NO DON'T! IT'S DANGEROUS!

177
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,147
[SORCERER B] GENERAL MIZPHA,

178
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,749
SIR KAZUHIKO INSISTS WE REFRAIN

179
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,316
FROM ADMINISTERING THE POTIONS.

180
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,753
[MIZPHA] I'M SURE HE DOES,
HE'S A HYPOCRITE.

181
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:06,389
THE MAN'S AN ADVENTURER, AND
WE ARE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

182
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:09,993
IMMORTALS HAVE NO STAKE
WHATSOEVER IN OUR WAR.

183
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,564
WE ARE THE ONES WHO
TRULY MAKE SACRIFICES.

184
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,699
[KNIGHTS] UGH...
[MIZPHA] ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

185
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,067
[KNIGHT H] OHH...

186
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,002
[ROE2] TRUTH BE TOLD, I
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

187
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:20,637
THE SOCIETY YOU'RE DEVELOPING.

188
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:23,239
IT SEEMS QUITE
INEFFICIENT TO ME.

00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,341
[KNIGHT L] WHAT'RE THEY DOING?!
[TOYA] HUH?

[KNIGHTS] YEAH!

194
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,217
[ROE2] YOU JUST HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT

195
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,786
THE WORLD YOU DON'T SEE

196
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:38,088
IS BIGGER THAN THE

(DEATH CRIES) (BATTLE EXERTS)

198

[ROE2] OUR REALM
OF UNDERSTANDING

00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:43,860
IS INCREDIBLY SMALL
AND INCONSEQUENTIAL...

200
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,896
SO THE FACT THAT I CAN'T
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND

201
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:47,864
ANY OF THIS ISN'T SURPRISING.

YOU CAN BE ALIVE,
BUT DEAD INSIDE...

336
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:38,348
EVEN BACK IN OUR OLD WORLD.

337
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,450
SURE YOU CAN WALK AROUND
AND LIVE YOUR LIFE...

338
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,587
BUT IT'S MEANINGLESS IF
YOU DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

339
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,757
YOU KNOW IT TRUE!

340
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,992
[SHUNICHI]
HEH! TELL YA WHAT, KID.

341
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,594
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME,

342
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:53,764
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD TAKE IT
UP WITH THE SYSTEM OPERATOR.

343
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:58,769
THEN THEY CAN BOOT ME FROM THE
SERVER. AND THEN I'LL BE FREE!

344
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,174
OKAY... I KNOW
HOW HE FEELS...

345
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:08,444
I GET THAT HE WANTS TO GO
HOME AND ALL... BUT STILL.

346
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,815
MISS ISUZU...

347
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:12,983
OH...!

348
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,285
THE GUY OUT THERE.

349
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,554
I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT.

350
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,989
AH...

351
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,693
UGN. HE ISN'T RIGHT.

352
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:31,668
[ISUZU] EVERYONE... EVERYONE...
THEY'RE ALL REAL. HMM.

353
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,542
[MINORI, THINKING]
TOYA WAS ALWAYS SMILING

354
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:41,344
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS STUCK
IN THAT WHEELCHAIR.

355
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:44,114
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
HE UNDERSTOOD

356
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,550
THAT THE WORLD AROUND
HIM CHANGED,

357
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,385
AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE
COULD DO ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

358
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,788
THE WORLD GOT SO
BIG AND UNFAIR.

359
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,591
AND THERE WASN'T ANY
HOPE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT.

360
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,493
HE KEPT GOING, AND DOING WHAT
HE COULD WITH THAT HE HAD.

361
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,830
HE ACCEPTED HIS FATE!

362
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,066
(SNARL)

363
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,100
[SHUNICHI] HUAH!

364
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,636
[SHUNICHI] UWAH!
[TOYA] UGH!

365
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,638
[MINORI, THINKING] AND HE'S
DOING THE SAME THING NOW!

366
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,473
[ROE2] SO TOYA IS
PROTESTING FATE.

367
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:13,143
SERARA IS CASTING
HEARTBEAT HEALING ON ALL

368
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:16,479
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AFTER
SHE DRESSES THEIR WOUNDS.

369
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,849
ISUZU AND RUNDELLHAUS ARE
DEFENDING THE VILLAGERS

370
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,284
AS THEY'RE MAKING
THEIR WAY HERE.

371
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:22,853
(BATTLE EXERTS)

372
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,055
[ROE2] THE THING IS, THOUGH,
AS HARD AS THEY'RE FIGHTING.

373
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,256
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

374
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,592
(BATTLE EXERTS)

375
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,827
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON...

376
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,329
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE
ANSWER, DON'T YOU?

377
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,565
UH?

378
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,866
[ROE2] I MEAN I
COULD STAND HERE AND

379
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,535
ASK YOU THE SAME
QUESTIONS, COULDN'T I?

380
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,504
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

381
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,205
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

382
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,345
[ISUZU] SOMETHING'S BEEN ON
MY MIND EVER SINCE YESTERDAY.

383
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,581
UH...?

384
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,683
[ISUZU] I'VE BEEN
THINKING AND THINKING.

385
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,652
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY FIGURE
IT ALL OUT UNTIL JUST NOW.

386
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,689
I HAD TO FIGHT MY
OWN INSECURITIES...

387
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,825
I JUST COULDN'T FIND
MY INSPIRATION.

388
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,193
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

389
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:04,528
BUT YOU KNOW...?

390
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,329
I REALLY DID HAVE
IT GOOD BEFORE.

391
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,500
I HAD A GREAT DAD, WHO
LOVED ME AND CARED FOR ME.

392
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:14,004
AND WELL, LIFE
WAS FULL OF MUSIC!

393
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,573
WHEN I WAS SAD OR UPSET,

394
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:18,074
THERE WERE SO MANY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SONGS

395
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:19,876
I COULD LISTEN TO.

396
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,080
MUSIC ALWAYS HELPED ME
THROUGH, NO MATTER WHAT.

397
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,051
BUT THIS...
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

398
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,986
42 SONGS ISN'T ENOUGH...

399
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:31,321
NOT AT ALL!

400
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,656
IT'S JUST AWFUL

401
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:35,458
THAT YOU CAN'T SING
WHENEVER YOU'RE SAD,

402
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,727
WHENEVER YOU'RE HAPPY.

403
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,228
MISS ISUZU...

404
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,797
WHICH IS WHY...
(LUTE STRUMMING)

405
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,666
UH...! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?!

406
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,067
LET'S GO, RUDY!

407
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,136
UH! WHERE ARE WE GOING?!

408
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,906
[RUDY] SO UH...
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

409
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,442
[ISUZU] WE'RE GOING TO PICK A
FIGHT! [RUDY] A FIGHT?!

410
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,977
[ISUZU] WE'RE GOING OUT
THERE TO PICK A FIGHT

411
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,047
WITH THE GODS WHO ONLY CREATED
42 SONGS FOR THIS WORLD.

412
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:59,916
AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL
THEY START SINGING ALONG.

413
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,319
[RUDY] (HEAVY BREATHING)
DON'T GO WITHOUT ME, MISS ISUZU!

414
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,524
[MINORI, THINKING] THERE'S
SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HER.

415
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,692
BUT I'M...

416
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,293
I'M NOT SURE IF
I REALLY WANT

417
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:11,728
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

418
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,965
NO, THAT SHOULDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

419
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:19,870
NO MATTER WHO SHE IS, SHE IS
HERE WITH ME. AND MY FRIEND.

420
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,906
AND IN THE END.
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.

421
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,910
I MEAN, WHO AM I, REALLY?

422
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:29,613
WHERE AM I GOING?

423
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:31,582
SHE MAKES ME ASK...

424
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:33,717
... WHAT DO I WANT TO BE?

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,958
SHE'S SINGING...!

428
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,861
THAT'S HER DREAM.
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

429
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:48,164
YEAH, AND I HAVE A DREAM TOO...

430
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,037

TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF WE'RE WILLING TO TRY.

SHAME IT'D BE IF I SAID NO

TO RANK DETERMINISM.

WRONG WITH THAT...
