1
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:06,721
(SWORDS CLANGING,
SOLDIERS GRUNTING)

2
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,088
[KARASHIN] WOW! YOU'VE REALLY
GOTTEN

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,857
THEIR LEVELS UP, HAVEN'T YOU?
[ISAAC] UH?

4
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:11,559
[KARASHIN] THEN AGAIN I
SHOULDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING LESS

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,762
FROM THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS.
YOU'RE A BUNCH OF STUDS!

6
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,665
OF COURSE! THEY KNOW WHO
TO CALL TO GET THINGS DONE!

7
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:20,034
[ITHERUS] MISTER ISAAC YOU'RE
REALLY AMAZING AT THIS!

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,103
YOU JUST KEEP ONE MAKING
ALL OUR SOLDIERS TOUGH.

9
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,540
[ITHERUS] BOTH OF YOU ARE REALLY
HELPING MAIHAMA RIGHT NOW

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,108
WITH ALL YOUR HARD
WORK! THANK YOU.

11
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,411
[REZARICK] HAVING YOU SAY THAT
MAKES ALL THE TIME WE'RE

12
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,747
PUTTING IN WORTHWHILE,
MASTER ITHERUS.

13
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:35,383
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, MISTER ISAAC?
(ISAAC GROWLS)

14
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:37,051
[KARASHIN] I CAN TELL YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING PRETTY HARD

15
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,254
AT THIS, MISTER ISAAC!
(CHUCKLING)

16
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,989
[ISAAC] (SNARLING) YOU CALL
ME "MISTER" ONE MORE TIME,

17
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,759
AND I'LL CUT YOUR
STUPID HEADS OFF!

18
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,554
[RODERICK] NOW, ABOUT
THIS REQUEST OF YOURS,

19
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:23,224
TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION OF
A LUNAR COMMUNICATION DEVICE.

20
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:25,160
[SHIROE]
IT'S GONNA COST THIS MUCH?

21
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,961
[RODERICK]
THE PROBLEM'S THE SCALE...

22
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,763
IT'D TAKE MORE THAN THREE
YEARS OF WHAT WE SET ASIDE

23
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,798
FOR THE CITY'S OPERATING BUDGET.

24
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:32,867
[SHIROE]
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

25
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,602
[RODERICK]
THERE'S ANOTHER CAVEAT.

26
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,937
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE CAN MAKE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WORK

27
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,807
IN THE FIRST PLACE OR KEEP
IT RUNNING AFTER IT'S UP.

28
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,176
[SHIROE]
WELL, OF COURSE.

29
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:42,977
[RODERICK]
YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

30
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:45,480
TRYING TO FIND A
WAY TO GO BACK HOME?

31
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:50,951
[SHIROE] (EXHALE) I NEVER
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY.

32
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,387
[AKATSUKI] SO WHAT DID YOU TELL
EVERYONE

33
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:53,821
AT THE ROUND TABLE ANYWAY?

34
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,623
IF WE MAKE CONTACT
WITH THE MOON,

35
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,225
THE TRAVELLERS UP THERE

36
00:02:57,325 --> 00:03:00,261
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME
IDEA ABOUT HOW TO GET BACK HOME.

37
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,297
THAT BEING SAID, I
DIDN'T GO OUT OF MY WAY

38
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:05,200
TO RAISE ANYONE'S
EXPECTATIONS, EITHER.

39
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,067
(SIGH)

40
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:08,303
THE WAY THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW,

41
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:10,971
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'D APPROVE IT.

42
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:11,906
HUH?

43
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,575
UH... WHAT'RE YOU
DOING, AKATSUKI?

44
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:15,810
[AKATSUKI] REMEMBER
YOUR FOREHEAD.

45
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,112
YOU'RE GETTING OLD
MAN WRINKLES AGAIN.

46
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,548
I FORBID ANY MORE WRINKLES.

47
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,451
I'LL WORK ON IT.

48
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,093
[SERARA] IS WHAT MASTER SHIROE
SAID BEFORE IS ALL TRUE?

49
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,830
I REALLY WOULDN'T MIND
GOING BACK HOME, YOU KNOW?

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,133
[MINORI] A LOT OF WHAT HE
SAID IS STILL UNCONFIRMED,

51
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,368
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP
IT TO OURSELVES FOR NOW,

52
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:41,702
SINCE NOTHING'S SET.

53
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,238
[ISUZU] YEAH,
THAT WON'T BE EASY!

54
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,973
THAT'S NOT THE KINDA THING
YOU CAN KEEP SECRET FOR LONG.

55
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,543
SERIOUSLY, JUST THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT REALLY MEANS.

56
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:51,612
YEAH... IT'S COMPLICATED...

57
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:56,083
OH MAN, AS MUCH AS I WANT TO
SEE MY MOM AND DAD AGAIN...

58
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:57,818
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE
ALL THE PEOPLE

59
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,688
WHO'VE BEEN WITH ME
THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING.

60
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:02,490
THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO ME.

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,558
[MINORI]
OH, SERARA...

62
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:05,493
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

63
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:06,694
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL FRIENDS
AND

64
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:07,995
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH TOGETHER.

65
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,564
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MINORI?

66
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:12,200
HUH? WELL, I DON'T KNOW...

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,635
I HAVEN'T GIVEN IT
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

68
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,172
MPH?

69
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,773
(EXHALE)

70
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,107
I WOULD IF I COULD.

71
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,476
HUH?

72
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,644
[TOYA] I'M SURE MOST OF US
WOULD DO THE SAME THING...

73
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:26,981
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WOKE UP ONE DAY
AND SAID WE WANTED TO BE HERE.

74
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,550
[ISUZU] IT'S TRUE. WE'RE
ALL VICTIMS IN THIS.

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,353
NONE OF US HAD A CHOICE IN
THE MATTER; THAT'S FOR SURE.

76
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:34,589
BUT I ALSO WOULDN'T MIND
STAYING HERE EITHER.

77
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,057
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I'VE
MADE MYSELF USEFUL, Y'KNOW.

78
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,694
IN FACT, I THINK I'VE MANAGED
TO ACCOMPLISH MORE HERE

79
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:41,962
THAN I EVER DID BACK HOME.

80
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,901
OKAY, TOYA...

81
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,505
[RUDY] I UNDERSTAND WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM TOYA.

82
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,240
UH... RUDY...

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,476
IT'S NATURAL FOR EVERYONE
TO WANNA GO HOME...

84
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:59,880
AND SAYING GOODBYE...?
I'M READY FOR THAT.

85
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,549
[RUDY] WHATEVER TOYA WANTS,

86
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,984
AS LONG AS IT ISN'T
ANOTHER FORCED RELOCATION

87
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,754
AT THE HANDS OF SOME
UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES.

88
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,356
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

89
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:09,657
[ISUZU]
TOYA?

90
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,792
MISS ISUZU, IF YOU END UP
GOING BACK TO YOUR HOMELAND,

91
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,529
WON'T YOU BE ABLE TO PLAY
MUSIC WITH YOUR FATHER?

92
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,665
UH... IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE...

93
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,469
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A
RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER RUDY.

94
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:27,107
[SERARA] OH WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT?

95
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,209
MPH.

96
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,347
[ISAAC] THE CITY'S GETTIN' MORE
AND MORE LIKE THE OLD AKIHABARA,

97
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,948
ISN'T IT? [MAN] SHORT SLEEVED
T‐SHIRTS HALF OFF TODAY!

98
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,082
[REZARICK] I GUESS OUR
CULTURE'S RUBBING OFF

99
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:36,317
ON THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

100
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,052
MORE THAN WE COULD'VE EXPECTED.

101
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,655
[KARASHIN]
IT CERTAINLY HAS.

102
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,157
SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS?

103
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,359
[ITHERUS] I LOVE IT!
PEOPLE OF THE LAND NEED

104
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,362
TO EMBRACE ADVENTURER CULTURE
SO WE CAN KEEP GROWING!

105
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,398
MY GRANDFATHER SAYS THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR FUTURE.

106
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,301
[ISAAC] SPEAKING OF, HOW LONG'RE
YOU GONNA BE FOLLOWING ME?

107
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,536
[ITHERUS] AS LONG AS IT TAKES,
I'VE GOTTA GET TO KNOW

108
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,805
ADVENTURERS LIKE YOU THE SAME
WAY RAYNESHIA DID.

109
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,940
YOU'RE STUCK WITH
ME, MISTER ISAAC!

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,776
(ISAAC GROWLING)
[REZARICK] I DON'T SUPPOSE NOW'D

111
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,311
BE A GOOD TIME TO REMIND YOU

112
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,846
THAT PROTECTING THE YOUNG
MASTER'S ONE OF OUR DUTIES.

113
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,249
[ISAAC] HMPH. YEAH,
WHATEVER MAN.

114
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,852
[KARASHIN] THE BOY SEEMS
TO BE AWFULLY FOND OF YOU.

115
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,188
[ISAAC] IT'S NOT MY STYLE.

116
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:14,922
[KARASHIN] WELL MAYBE
IT SHOULD BE...

117
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:16,791
A FRIENDSHIP LIKE THIS
CAN MAKE THE TIES BETWEEN

118
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,993
MAIHAMA AND AKIHABARA STRONGER.

119
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,895
IT'S JUST THAT WE'VE GOT
ANOTHER ISSUE WE'RE

120
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:22,163
GOING TO NEED TO DEAL WITH.

121
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,232
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

122
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:25,733
[KARASHIN] COME ON. YOU'VE GOTTA
REMEMBER

123
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,967
THE LAST CONFERENCE MEETING.

124
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,370
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO
TALK TO THE MOON?

125
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,938
[ISAAC] YOU MEAN THAT THING THAT
MIGHT TELL US

126
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,507
HOW WE'RE GONNA GET BACK HOME?

127
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,909
[KARASHIN] EXACTLY. AND IT'S
PROBABLY GONNA THROW

128
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,212
A MONKEY WRENCH IN
THIS WORLD'S POLITICS.

129
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:39,147
COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT IT...

130
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,682
ESPECIALLY WHEN POLITICIANS
USE OTHER PEOPLE TO FIGHT.

131
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:44,819
REALLY? BUT THIS COULD HELP OUR
CHANCES OF GETTING BACK HOME.

132
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,656
I'M MORE OF A SIT AND WAIT KINDA
GUY INSTEAD OF A WORRY‐WART.

133
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,358
YEAH, I GUESS...

134
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,359
COME ON...

135
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,927
A HIGH PRICE TAG DOESN'T MEAN

136
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,729
THAT SWORD'S WORTH A DAMN.
[ITHERUS] HUH?

137
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,764
[ISAAC] REZARICK, YOU
SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

138
00:06:56,864 --> 00:07:00,501
MISTER ISAAC IS MUCH BETTER
JUDGE OF SWORDS THAN I AM.

139
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,470
GIMME A BREAK, WILLYA?

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,104
(EXHALE)

141
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,808
HERE... THIS'LL WORK.

142
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,978
AH... OH GOODNESS.

143
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:13,414
BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE, AND
IT'S LEVEL‐RATING IS

144
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,083
A LOT HIGHER THAN WHAT I
SHOULD BE USING RIGHT NOW.

145
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,586
I CAN'T USE IT YET... LET'S GO.

146
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,224
I WAS TRYING TO
HELP THE KID OUT.

147
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,593
KNOWING HIS OWN LIMITATIONS
IS A GOOD THING.

148
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:27,995
HE ACTS KINDA LIKE A
KID IN A LOT OF WAYS,

149
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:29,830
BUT THAT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

150
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,534
OKAY... WHATEVER. HUH?

151
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,069
HM?

152
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,438
[REZARICK]
IS SOMETHING... WRONG?

153
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,276
NOTHING... LET'S
GET OUTTA HERE.

154
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,680
[SERJIAD] HOW'S THE TRAINING FOR
THE SOLDIERS

155
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,215
COMING ALONG, MASTER ISAAC?

156
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:49,184
[ISAAC]
THEY'RE OKAY SO FAR.

157
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,153
THEY'RE LEVELING
UP QUICK ENOUGH.

158
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:54,021
THAT KIND OF NEWS
IS ENCOURAGING.

159
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:57,425
TIMES ARE SUCH THAT WE COULD BE
EMBROILED IN WAR AT ANY MOMENT.

160
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,760
DID YOU REALLY HAVE ME COME
OUT HERE TO DRINK TEA

161
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,029
AND MAKE SMALL TALK, OLD MAN?

162
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,965
(CLEARING THROAT)
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ITHERUS.

163
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,667
[ISAAC]
HUH?

164
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,904
WE'VE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING
TO HOLD A GRAND CEREMONY

165
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,440
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY IN A FEW DAYS.

166
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,075
IT WILL ALSO SERVE AS MY
OPPORTUNITY TO NAME HIM

167
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,445
AS THE PROPER HEIR
TO HOUSE COWEN.

168
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,047
THE "PROPER HEIR"?
THAT LITTLE BOY?

169
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:21,416
[SERJIAD]
HMMM.

170
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,118
I THOUGHT YOU
ALREADY HAD A SON

171
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,520
TO TAKE OVER WHEN YOU
DECIDE TO STEP DOWN.

172
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,088
[SERJIAD]
FERNELLE MARRIED INTO MY FAMILY.

173
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,391
HE'S A MAGNIFICENT
STATESMAN AND WARRIOR,

174
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:33,294
BUT THE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER
ACCEPT HIS ASCENSION.

175
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,263
THEY WANT MY SUCCESSOR TO HAVE

176
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,932
THE COWEN BLOOD FLOWING
IN THEIR VEINS.

177
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,834
MY DAUGHTER, SARARIYA,
AND FERNELLE

178
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,069
HAVE THREE CHILDREN TOGETHER.

179
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,372
THEIR ELDEST
DAUGHTER, RISSELTHEA,

180
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,307
THEIR SECOND
DAUGHTER, RAYNESHIA,

181
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,109
AND THEIR YOUNGEST OF
COURSE IS ITHERUS.

182
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,812
RISSELTHEA ABANDONED
HER RIGHT AS SUCCESSOR

183
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,948
BY MARRYING OUTSIDE NOBILITY..

184
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,417
LEAVING US WITH
RAYNESHIA AND ITHERUS.

185
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,786
[ISAAC] THAT'S RIGHT, I
FORGOT ABOUT HER, DIDN'T I?

186
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,523
I WAS BLINDED BY WHAT
I THOUGHT WAS RESOLVE.

187
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,792
FRANKLY, HER OUTBURST AT THE
LORDS

188
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:08,429
WAS A HARSH AWAKENING
AT MY FOOLISH OPTIMISM.

189
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,332
SHE WILL STILL HAVE A ROLE IN
OUR GOVERNMENT,

190
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:15,503
BUT YOU CAN BE SURE IT
WON'T BE HEAD OF STATE.

191
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,705
SO SHE ISN'T GONNA
BE RUNNING THINGS.

192
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,706
[SERJIAD] AND BESIDES,

193
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:21,376
A LORDSHIP REQUIRES
A MAN'S QUALITIES.

194
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,778
I'M SURE ITHERUS
WILL GROW INTO THIS.

195
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,813
[ISAAC] SO BASICALLY THIS
WHOLE SUCCESSION THING

196
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,383
HAS BEEN WEIGHING HEAVY
ON YOUR MIND, HUH, CHIEF?

197
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,619
[SERJIAD] (GRUNT) HENCEFORTH,
IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR A LORD

198
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,922
TO FOSTER UNDERSTANDING
WITH THE ADVENTURERS.

199
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:39,660
MASTER ISAAC, YOU KNOW AS WELL
AS I DO, ITHERUS IS JUST A BOY.

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,464
I ASK A FAVOR, PLEASE MENTOR HIM
WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

201
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:47,335
THEY'RE THINGS YOU KNOW,
WE CANNOT TEACH.

202
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,939
(SIGH)

203
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:58,078
I REALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT
ALL THIS, MAN... HM?

204
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,680
(MAID SOBBING)
[ITHERUS] NOW LOOK,

205
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,250
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU
NEED HELP WITH JUST LET ME KNOW.

206
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,186
I'LL TALK TO MY GRANDFATHER
AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO!

207
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:07,322
[MAID A] THANKS SO
MUCH, YOUNG MASTER!

208
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,859
[ITHERUS] I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
IF WE WIDENED THIS WATERWAY,

209
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,661
MORE SHIPS COULD PASS THROUGH.

210
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,996
THAT OUGHT TO HELP US
EXPAND OUR MARITIME

211
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,433
TRADE PROFITS MOVING FORWARD.

212
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,703
[ITHERUS] GREAT JOB!

213
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:25,606
THE STRAWBERRIES THIS
YEAR ARE SO YUMMY!

214
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,643
AHHHHHHHHH!

215
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:29,544
[ITHERUS] UGH!

216
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,579
(GRUNT)

217
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,283
[ITHERUS] ONE MORE TIME!

218
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,717
(PANTING)

219
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:41,622
HEH!

220
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,959
[ISAAC] I THOUGHT HE WAS
JUST A PAMPERED LITTLE SNOT,

221
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,928
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE
A LORD SOMEDAY... GO FIGURE.

222
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:50,665
[KARASHIN] MASTER ITHERUS
IS IN A KEY POSITION.

223
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:53,368
IT'S A CRITICAL TIME
FOR THE CITY RIGHT NOW.

224
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:56,537
WHAT WITH THINGS THREATENING
TO GET NASTY WITH WESTELANDE.

225
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:58,639
[ISAAC] AND I SUPPOSE THAT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT

226
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:01,376
THOSE JERKS IN MINAMI
ARE TRYING TO PULL.

227
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,978
[KARASHIN] WELL NOW! THAT WAS
PRETTY OBSERVANT OF YOU!

228
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,080
MISTER ISAAC'S A
POLITICIAN, NOW?

229
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,014
(GRUNTS)

230
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,616
I KNOW, TAKE IT EASY.

231
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:12,153
WELL, WESTELANDE AND MINAMI SEEM
TO BE RUBBING ELBOWS, RIGHT...

232
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,689
AND IT ALL COMES FROM WESTELANDE
LOOKING LIKE THEY WERE MAKING

233
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,859
A BIG PLAY FOR EASTAL. AND BY
A "BIG PLAY," I MEAN A BIG WAR.

234
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,328
ENLIGHTEN ME, PLEASE.

235
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,563
IN THEIR HISTORY, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE WHOLE ISLAND

236
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,399
OF YAMATO WAS GOVERNED BY WHAT
USED TO BE CALLED

237
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,168
THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY
OF WESTELANDE.

238
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:28,736
[KARASHIN] HOWEVER, AT SOME
POINT,

239
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:31,672
THE ENTIRE ISLAND WAS ENGULFED
IN A MASSIVE CIVIL WAR...

240
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,708
AND ONCE ALL THE
BATTLES HAD DIED DOWN,

241
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,611
THE DYNASTY FELL APART
UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT.

242
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:39,847
WHAT'S LEFT, DIVIDED THINGS INTO
THE HOLY EMPIRE OF WESTELANDE,

243
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,150
AND EASTAL'S LEAGUE
OF FREEDOM CITIES.

244
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,253
AND EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
WESTELANDE IS STILL CLAIMING

245
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,622
THEY HAVE SOME SOVEREIGNTY
OVER THE LAND.

246
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:50,958
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO PROFIT OFF
THE NAME OF AN OLD DYNASTY?

247
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,228
WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS... (GULP)

248
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,762
IF YOU GET ENOUGH PEOPLE
TOGETHER,

249
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,797
THERE'S BOUND TO BE
TROUBLE OF SOME KIND.

250
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:58,699
AND OF COURSE THAT "BUNCH
OF IDIOTS" ARE FOAMING

251
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,635
AT THE MOUTH TO GET
ALL OF US ADVENTURERS

252
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,204
INVOLVED IN THEIR MESS IF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

253
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,806
AND YOU KNOW WAY TOO MUCH!

254
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,610
INFORMATION IS A MERCHANT'S
GREATEST ASSET, YOU KNOW?

255
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,080
SPEAKING OF "INFO,"
HERE'S A LITTLE GIFT.

256
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,082
SO WHAT'S THIS THEN?

257
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,517
(CHUCKLES)

258
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,658
[ISAAC, THINKING]
HRUMPH... WHAT A MESS,

259
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,593
PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND THE
ADVENTURERS

260
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,962
ARE BOTH A PAIN IN THE ASS.

261
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,565
I ALWAYS TURNED A BLIND
EYE TO IT AND SAID,

262
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,967
"NOPE, THAT'S ABOVE
MY PAY GRADE."

263
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:40,741
I MEAN, I REALLY
CAN'T STAND IT...

264
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,981
(CHOMP)

265
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,686
[ISAAC, THINKING] BUT
SOMETIMES IT'S GOT IT'S PERKS.

266
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:58,526
[ITHERUS]
HWAH, HUAH, HA!

267
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,060
[ITHERUS]
UWAH!

268
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,364
(EXHALE)

269
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,600
[ISAAC] HEY...
[ITHERUS] UH?

270
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,136
[ISAAC] WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS?
[ITHERUS] UH?

271
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:12,106
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY MY SIZE,
JUNIOR. THAT'LL FIT YA BETTER.

272
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,474
GET YOUR BALANCE AND
FOOTWORK DOWN

273
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:14,875
AND THEN YOU OUGHTA
DO ALL RIGHT.

274
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:17,978
BUT THIS SWORD... IT WAS
EXPENSIVE, WASN'T IT?

275
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,149
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY...
IT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.

276
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:23,618
I DON'T THINK...

277
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,520
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY
UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS,

278
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,887
DO YOU, MISTER ISAAC?

279
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,023
WELL YOU CAN ALWAYS
GIVE IT BACK!

280
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,325
IT WAS A JOKE.

281
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:34,429
I APPRECIATE IT! THANK
YOU VERY KINDLY, SIR!

282
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,797
[TETORA]
MARIELLE...

283
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,666
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO
BE GOING OVER TO SUIFUU

284
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,401
TO SEE THE PRINCESS TODAY?

285
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,102
[MARIELLE] SHE SAID SHE'S GOING
BACK TO MAIHAMA

286
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,205
TO ATTEND HER LITTLE
BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

287
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,807
[HENRIETTA] RIEZE'S GONE WITH
HER TO PROVIDE SECURITY.

288
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,410
[TETORA] FRICKITY FRACK! BUT I
WANTED TO TALKED TO HER ABOUT

289
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,846
THE TWO OF US FORMING
A NEW UNIT TOGETHER!

290
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,514
[BOTH] WHAT KIND OF "NEW UNIT"?

291
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:54,615
[TETORA]
CHECK IT!

292
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:55,850
A GALAXY‐STYLE STARLET

293
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,153
PRINCESS SPECIAL UNIT.
IT'LL BE CALLED...

294
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,054
TETONESHIA!

295
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:02,923
CAN'T YOU JUST
SEE IT, YOU GUYS?!

296
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:06,026
TWO YOUNG SUPER‐HOTTIES MAKING
THEIR DEBUT TOGETHER ON STAGE!

297
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,163
AFTER ALL, I GOTTA
MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF

298
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,897
BEFORE WE ALL GO BACK HOME!

299
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,434
WE'LL MAKE OUR FIRST GIG, OUR
LAST GIG, THAT WOULD BE SO EPIC!

300
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,303
ALL WE'D HAVE TO DO
IS SHOW A LITTLE LEG...

301
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:17,905
YOU KNOW, HENRIETTA, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TELL THE PRINCESS

302
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:20,841
THAT WE MAY END UP
GOING BACK PRETTY SOON.

303
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:25,180
YEAH, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
AN EASY GOODBYE FOR ANY OF US.

304
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,085
[RAYNESHIA] RIEZE?
[RIEZE] HUH?

305
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,421
[RAYNESHIA] I'M SORRY TO
FORCE THIS REQUEST ON YOU.

306
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,456
I KNOW YOU'RE EXTREMELY
BUSY WITH YOUR DUTIES,

307
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:38,058
RUNNING YOUR GUILD.
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

308
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,528
[RIEZE] OH, PLEASE.
I'M DOING FINE, REALLY.

309
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,763
YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST,
A SECURITY DETAIL

310
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,699
LIKE THIS WOULD NORMALLY
BE GIVEN TO A MAN

311
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,402
OR AT LEAST SOMEONE IN THE
GUARD, WOULDN'T YOU THINK?

312
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,769
I MEAN, WHERE IS KRUSTY?

313
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,605
WHAT'S TAKING HIM SO LONG?
[RIEZE] UH... HM.

314
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:55,009
(STREET CHATTER)

315
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:08,156
[SERJIAD] I SUPPOSE FROM
AN ADVENTURER'S PERSPECTIVE

316
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:12,127
A GRAND DIPLOMATIC FUNCTION LIKE
THIS MUST SEEM A BIT TRIVIAL.

317
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,262
[ISAAC] NOT REALLY... WE'VE HAD
OUR SHARE OF PARTIES

318
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,063
BACK HOME AND HERE, TOO.

319
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,199
AND HONESTLY, SOME OF
US CAN GET PRETTY

320
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,000
GEEKED UP ABOUT BIRTHDAYS.

321
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,569
[SERJIAD]
SPLENDID.

322
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,672
MY GRANDSON IS AN
INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN...

323
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,674
HE UNDERSTANDS A GREAT DEAL.

324
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:30,978
BUT STILL, THE BOY'S JUST
TURNED NINE YEARS OLD.

325
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,714
[SERJIAD] I SOMETIMES WONDER IF
I GAVE HIM TOO MUCH

326
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:35,683
RESPONSIBILITY TOO QUICKLY.

327
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,785
[ISAAC] WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, OLD MAN?

328
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,019
YOU'VE BEEN SHOULDERING A LOT OF

329
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,756
THIS RESPONSIBILITY
YOURSELF, YOU KNOW?

330
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:45,025
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
HAVE ENOUGH GREY HAIR?

331
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:45,793
[SERJIAD]
HMMM...

332
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,395
[ISAAC]
OK, HE'S NINE.

333
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,897
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN YOU'VE
ALREADY MADE A MAN OUT OF HIM.

334
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,966
HE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY WELL.

335
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,436
IF HE WASN'T CAPABLE OF TAKING
IT HE WOULD'VE BROKEN ALREADY.

336
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,405
AND IF THINGS DO
GET HEAVY FOR HIM,

337
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,039
HE'S GOT PEOPLE
AROUND HIM TO HELP.

338
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,776
[SERJIAD] FOR ITHERUS'
SAKE I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

339
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,744
[ISAAC]
HE'S DEFINITELY OKAY BY ME,

340
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,213
THE LITTLE FELLA STILL HAS
THE NERVE TO

341
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:06,447
CALL ME "MISTER," AFTER ALL.

342
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,782
HUH?
(EXCITEMENT WELLING UP)

343
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,016
[NOBLEMAN A]
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA!

344
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:11,018
[NOBLEMAN B]
SO BEAUTIFUL, AS ALWAYS.

345
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,554
[RAYNESHIA] I'M SORRY EVERYONE,
I KNOW I'M LATE...

346
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:16,056
MY APOLOGIES TO EVERYONE HERE.

347
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:19,727
PLEASE EXCUSE MY
TARDINESS, GRANDFATHER.

348
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,763
[ITHERUS] BIG SISTER
RAYNESHIA, WELCOME BACK!

349
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,865
I'M SORRY I GOT HERE
SO LATE, ITHERUS.

350
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,634
I HOPE YOU'VE
BEEN DOING WELL.

351
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:27,968
[ITHERUS]
YEAH!

352
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,670
I SPENT THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE AWAY TRYING

353
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,639
TO MAKE MORE ADVENTURER
FRIENDS JUST LIKE YOU DID.

354
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,741
[RAYNESHIA]
UH‐HUA. YOU HAVE TO BE VIGILANT!

355
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,843
MAKING A FRIEND WITH AN
ADVENTURER ISN'T EASY.

356
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,212
AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL,

357
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,314
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND
OF PERSON THEY ARE.

358
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,648
THERE ARE MONSTERS AMONG
THEM,

359
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,317
NOT TO MENTION A FEW
VILLAINS AS WELL.

360
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,053
IN FACT, TO BE SAFE, JUST STAY
AWAY FROM THE ONES WITH GLASSES.

361
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,056
WELL IN THAT CASE, EVERYTHING
SHOULD BE JUST FINE.

362
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:51,792
LOOK. MASTER ISAAC
DOESN'T WEAR GLASSES.

363
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,060
[RAYNESHIA]
OH, THAT'S GOOD THEN.

364
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,095
[ITHERUS] I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE MY DEBUT...

365
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:58,199
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND
KEEP AN EYE ON ME, DEAR SISTER?

366
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,635
[RAYNESHIA] OF COURSE, I WILL.
[ITHERUS] MM!

367
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:04,639
(CHEERS AND CLAPPING)

368
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,191
[NOBLEMAN] MY LORD ITHERUS,

369
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,194
THIS JUICE IS MADE FROM THE
FRUIT GROWN IN OUR REGION.

370
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,796
IT IS OUR HUMBLE GIFT
TO YOU, YOUR GRACE.

371
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,331
[ITHERUS] AHH...

372
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,268
[NOBLEMAN] HMPH.

373
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,637
HEH HE HEH...

374
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,639
[ITHERUS]
UH?

375
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,007
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MISTER ISAAC?

376
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,577
THAT WAS A PRETTY SLOPPY
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT,

377
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:45,180
IF YOU ASK ME.
(DRINK POURING)

378
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,282
[MAID] WHAT? WHATEVER
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

379
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,617
[NOBLEMAN] NOW WAIT A MINUTE,
SIR. WE WOULD NEVER...

380
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:52,253
IT'S MERELY A GIFT
FOR THE NEW KING!

381
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:54,889
(CONCERNED CROWD)

382
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,924
YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON THE
ASSAULT ALERT EARRING

383
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:59,059
GIVEN TO ME BY THE
RODERICK'S CRAFTSMEN!

384
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,328
[ISAAC] OF COURSE, I WASN'T
EXPECTING IT

385
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:01,662
TO GO OFF THIS SOON,

386
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:02,597
BUT WHAT THE HELL.

387
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,199
[NOBLEMAN] UNGH.

388
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,701
UWA‐HAA!

389
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:07,902
[ISAAC] POISON! UWA!

390
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:09,304
(SCREAMS, DISORIENTED CROWD)

391
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,771
[ISAAC] DON'T BREATH, GOT IT?!

392
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:12,006
[MAID] GET OUTTA THE
WAY, ADVENTURER!

393
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,474
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU!

394
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:15,776
[NOBLEMAN] WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR THE PEACE OF YAMATO!

395
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,778
[ISAAC] HA.
[ITHERUS] WHOA!

396
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,047
[ISAAC] HEY REZARICK,
DISTRACTION!

397
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,750
HYAHHH!
(GLASS BREAKING)

398
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:26,020
(PANTING)

399
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,089
[ITHERUS] ARE YOU OKAY?

400
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,759
[ISAAC] I'M FINE.
JUST BURNS A LITTLE.

401
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,469
[ISAAC, THINKING] THEY'RE
PRETTY TOUGH FOR NPCS...

402
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,171
I WONDER IF THEY'RE
THE ONES WHO...

403
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:43,771
[ISAAC]
HUH...?

404
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,640
[MAID]
YAAAH!

405
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,074
(GRUNT)

406
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,176
UGH!

407
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:50,411
(SURPRISED)

408
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,879
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
ON SOMEONE

409
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,148
TWICE YOUR SIZE!

410
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,315
UWAH!

411
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,517
SWORD OF PAIN BLACK!

412
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:58,686
[ASSASSIN A]
A BINDING SPELL!

413
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,020
[ASSASSIN B]
NO! DAMMIT!

414
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,957
NOW YOU BASTARDS CAN'T
ATTACK ANYBODY BUT ME!

415
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,826
YOU'RE NOT PUTTIN' ANOTHER HAND
ON THE KID ANYMORE, YOU GOT ME?!

416
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,463
WELCOME TO MY LITTLE
ASS‐KICKIN' PARTY!

417
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,564
WAH!

418
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:10,631
NNNGH!

419
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:11,466
HWAHHH!

420
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,167
HA!

421
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,968
UWAHA!

422
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:14,535
HUWAH!

423
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:15,470
HA!

424
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,437
YAHH!

425
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:17,372
UWAH!

426
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,073
UUWAAHHH! UNGH!

427
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:19,907
HA!

428
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:21,376
UH...
(COLLAPSE)

429
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:25,012
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
SAYIN' YOU'RE GONNA KILL

430
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:26,814
A KID FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE!

431
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,549
[ISAAC] YOU COWARDS!

432
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,386
[KARASHIN] WOW, ISAAC,
YOU'RE DEFINITELY MY HERO NOW.

433
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:34,355
[REZARICK] HANG ON A SECOND
YOU COULD USE SOME HEALING.

434
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,723
[ISAAC] I'LL BE OKAY, MAN...

435
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,925
I MADE SURE I DIDN'T GET
A WHOLE LUNG FULL OF IT.

436
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,628
SERIOUSLY, WHY'RE
THESE GUYS SO JACKED?

437
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:44,365
[KARASHIN] MINAMI WAS SUPPOSEDLY
LEVELING UP PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

438
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:46,801
I GUESS I OWE YOU BIG TIME
FOR ALL THAT INFORMATION

439
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,903
YOU GAVE ME THE OTHER DAY.

440
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,171
LOOKS LIKE YOUR PRESENT

441
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:51,972
FROM RODERICK'S MERCHANT
GUILD HELPED.

442
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,741
I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT HOW YOU KNEW

443
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:56,076
WESTELANDE ASSASSINS
WOULD BE COMING?

444
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:57,945
I THINK I REMEMBER
SAYING INFORMATION

445
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,047
IS A MERCHANT'S BEST FRIEND.

446
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,082
WELL KARASHIN,

447
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,984
YOU'RE NOT AS MUCH OF
A WUSS AS I THOUGHT.

448
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,554
[KARASHIN] YEAH. AND I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ALL BRAWN

449
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:09,224
AND NO BRAINS.

450
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:13,261
[ISAAC] ITHERUS, YOU
SHOULD BE SAFE NOW.

451
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,195
[ITHERUS]
UH‐HUH.

452
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,296
DON'T YOU WORRY.

453
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,365
I'M NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE
LITTLE BUDDY 'O MINE!

454
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,434
YOU GOT THAT, SQUIRT....
[ITHERUS] OW...

455
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:22,603
[ITHERUS]
MM‐HM.

456
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:23,871
[ISAAC]
HEH...

457
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,942
[ITHERUS] THANK
YOU, MR. ISAAC.

458
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,319
[SHIROE] I SEE. PLEASE LET ME
KNOW IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS.

459
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,721
GOOD WORK, GO AHEAD AND STAY
ON TOP OF THINGS...

460
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,458
THANKS, KARASHIN.
(VOICE CHAT ENDING)

461
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:44,959
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I KNEW IT.

462
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,861
OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THROWING
ALL THE OTHER SOCIETIES

463
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:49,464
OUT OF BALANCE.

464
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,532
[SHIROE] WE'VE GOTTA FIND A
WAY TO GET BACK HOME?

465
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,301
(SIGH) (DOOR OPENING)

466
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:56,704
[REGAN] IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
HASN'T IT, MASTER SHIROE?

467
00:20:56,804 --> 00:21:00,074
[SHIROE] WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
LURKING AROUND LIKE A CREEP?

468
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,677
[REGAN] I FINALLY
MADE SOME HEADWAY

469
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,345
IN MY INVESTIGATION OF SUSUKINO.

470
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,447
I DO APOLOGIZE FOR
IT TAKING SO LONG.

471
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,749
[REGAN] WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR ABOUT IT?

472
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:10,218
[SHIROE] HOW'S
EVERYONE DOING THERE?

473
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:11,686
[REGAN] THEY'RE DOING
WELL, AND THEY MADE SURE

474
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,754
TO TELL ME TO SEND
YOU THEIR REGARDS.

475
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,190
[SHIROE] AND I SUPPOSE
THE SITUATION

476
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,991
WITH THE TRANSPORT
GATES IS THE SAME?

477
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,660
[REGAN] YES. AS I CONTINUED MY
RESEARCH,

478
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,995
I DISCOVERED THAT FAIRY RINGS

479
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,931
ARE INDEED AFFECTED
BY THE LUNAR CYCLES.

480
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:26,367
WHICH MAKES THE LEGEND OF
ANCIENT ALV RUINS

481
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,969
UP ON THE MOON ALL THE MORE
INTERESTING. (CHUCKLING)

482
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,671
[SHIROE, THINKING] THERE
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A CONTROL

483
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:34,041
BEACON ON THE MOON AFFECTING
THE TRANSPORT COORDINATES.

484
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:36,411
THE MOON'S DEFINITELY IT...

485
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:39,214
[SHIROE] WE'VE GOTTA FIND
A WAY TO TALK TO THEM.

486
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,548
[REGAN]
"TALK TO THEM"?

487
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:41,816
[SHIROE]
YEAH.

488
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,251
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE INVESTIGATING

489
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,953
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SEND
THE ADVENTURERS HOME.

490
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,855
AND AT THE MOMENT, COMMUNICATION
WITH THE MOON SEEMS

491
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,424
TO BE OUR BEST OPTION.

492
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:50,791
[REGAN]
AH. (MUNCHES)

493
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,327
[SHIROE] HOWEVER, THE
COST OF THE EQUIPMENT

494
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,129
TO DO IT HAS PROVEN
PROHIBITIVE.

495
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,563
[SHIROE] SO THINGS
AREN'T VERY PROMISING.

496
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:58,566
[REGAN] MASTER SHIROE,
SHIBUYA HAS AN ANTENNA.

497
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,967
[SHIROE]
I KNOW.

498
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,203
[SHIROE] SHIBUYA'S OLD
RADIO AND TV COMPLEX.

499
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,605
YAMATO'S ONLY
COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.

500
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:08,909
WE LOOKED INTO IT A WHILE BACK,
AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT WORKING.

501
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:11,846
I DUNNO WHEN I INVESTIGATED IT,
I GOT A SIGNAL,

502
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:13,481
FAINT, BUT THERE NONETHELESS.

503
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,850
PERHAPS THERE MIGHT
STILL BE A CHANCE?

504
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,585
YOU GOT A SIGNAL?

505
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:18,919
(VOICE CHAT PING)

506
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:20,221
[ISAAC, VOICE CHAT]
HEY, VILLAIN IN GLASSES!

507
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,822
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?!

508
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:23,891
NPCS'RE DROPPING LIKE FLIES!

509
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:25,326

510
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,462

511
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:28,463

515
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,968
[ALL]

516
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,638
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] THE PEOPLE
BEGIN MYSTERIOUSLY FALLING

517
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,939
INTO A DEEP SLEEP...

518
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,177
AS A BLACK SHADOW
ECLIPSES THE MOONLIT SKY.

519
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:26,314
SHIBUYA BECOMES A RAID ZONE,
AND IS OVERRUN BY MONSTERS.

520
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,316
WHO COULD BE TRYING TO STOP THE
ADVENTURERS

521
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,651
FROM RETURNING TO THE
WORLD THEY CAME FROM?

522
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:32,287
SHIROE DIVES INTO COMBAT,

523
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,355
CONCEALING THE UNCERTAINTY
WITHIN HIS HEART.

524
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:37,492
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES
ARE ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
