1
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,494
[DINKURON] ALL RIGHT!
LET'S GET THIS RAID STARTED!

2
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:09,061
[UKIYO]
YEAH, IT'S KINDA COOL TO THINK

3
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,398
WE'RE THE FIRST ADVENTURERS
TO BRAVE THIS CHALLENGE!

4
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:13,833
[JUNZO] DEFINITELY! BUT I'M
GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS!

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,168
[PIANISSISSIMO] UH...
I'M GONNA TRY THE BEST I CAN.

6
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,006
[ENKARTANTO] WE'LL BE FINE!
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

7
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,708
[WILLIAM]
OKAY, GUYS...

8
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:23,876
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

9
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:26,145
THIS ZONE BELONGS TO US...

10
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:29,015
WE SHALL TAKE IT AND
HOIST OUR FLAG HIGH!

11
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,710
[TOKO]
TWO GOT BY ME!

12
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,177
[DINKURON] I NEED A
RECOVERY SPELL OVER HERE!

13
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:06,779
[FEDERICO]
HIT THEIR FLANKS!

14
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,080
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THIS IS THE RAID ZONE,

15
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,583
AT THE VERY BOTTOM
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

16
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:14,821
IT'S KNOWN AS "THE PATH TO THE
ABYSS," THE "ABYSSAL SHAFT"

17
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,892
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A
TYPICAL RAID DUNGEON

18
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:22,295
IF WE WERE PLAYING IT IN A GAME.

19
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:25,732
A "RAID DUNGEON," ‐ A POWERED UP
VERSION OF A NORMAL DUNGEON.

20
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,000
EXTRA HALLWAYS, ROOMS,
TRAPS AND PUZZLES.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,503
IT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL
EXTENSIVE AREAS.

22
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:34,073
MORE PLACES TO GET HIT, GET
HURT, OR DIE FOR THAT MATTER.

23
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,475
YOU'VE GOTTA WATCH YOUR BACK

24
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,176
AND HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,

25
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:39,312
WHILE GOING AFTER YOUR
GOALS AND TREASURES,

26
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:41,881
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
FINDING THE EXIT.

27
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,522
[HIGHLAND]
ENEMY CONTACT, FOUR O'CLOCK!

28
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,823
[DINKURON]
DIG IN, YOU GUYS!

29
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,625
[TOKO]
THREE ORKS' JELLIES! RAID CLASS!

30
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:53,626
[SHIROE]
NAOTSUGU!

31
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,528
[NAOTSUGU]
RIGHT! ON IT!

32
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,764
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
A FULL RAID IS COMPOSED OF

33
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,266
FOUR NORMAL PARTIES OF SIX,

34
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,335
MAKING A "SUPER‐PARTY"
OF TWENTY‐FOUR PLAYERS.

35
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:05,238
WE'VE STARTED OUT WITH
A CLASSIC BATTLE FORMATION.

36
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:07,340
PARTY ONE ARE THE TANKS,
PURE FIGHTERS

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,642
BIG ON MUSCLE,
HIT POINTS AND ARMOR,

38
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,043
TANKS MAKE UP THE FRONT LINES,

39
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,646
ABSORBING AND DISHING OUT
MASSIVE PUNISHMENT.

40
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,550
IF THE TANKS FAIL, THE REST
OF US ARE SUNK. PERIOD.

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,653
I'VE GOT THREE MONSTERS IN SIGHT
JUST SOUTHWEST OF HERE.

42
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:21,854
[NAOTSUGU]
NO PROBLEM!

43
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,491
ANCHOR HOWL!

44
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,725
WUAAH! FUUU!

45
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:27,494
[DEMICAS]
WYVERN KICK!

46
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,863
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
PARTY TWO IS THE REAR ECHELON.

47
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,765
IF ANYTHING GETS PAST PARTY ONE,

48
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,467
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
USE THEIR MOBILITY

49
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,736
TO ENGAGE THE STRAGGLERS
AND KNOCK THEM OUT,

50
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,538
WHILE STILL
SUPPORTING PARTY ONE.

51
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,007
FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY
TO BEING IN PARTY TWO.

52
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,009
YOU CAN'T JUST
SIT STILL AND FIGHT.

53
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,844
[SHIROE] MORE JELLIES
ON OUR FLANKS, PEOPLE!

54
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,446
WE NEED BACKUP HERE AND QUICK!

55
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,416
I'VE GOT SIX OF THEM IN SIGHT!
PARTY FOUR, BLOCK THE EAST EXIT!

56
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,050
[WILLIAM]
RAPID FIRE!

57
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,388
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
PARTIES THREE AND FOUR

58
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,124
SPECIALIZE IN LONG‐RANGE
ATTACKS: ARCHERY AND SORCERY.

59
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,326
THEY'RE LIGHT ON ARMOR,

60
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,194
BUT HEAVY DAMAGE DEALERS
AT A DISTANCE.

61
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:03,730
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
TO STAY OUT OF THE FRAY.

62
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,232
HIT AND DON'T GET HIT.

63
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,499
PARTY THREE ATTACKS WHILE
PARTY FOUR WATCHES THEIR BACK.

64
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,268
[JUNZO] GET BACK!
[PIANISSISSIMO] OKAY!

65
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:10,002
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THAT'S THE
BEST‐CASE SCENARIO, ANYWAY.

66
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:12,439
AND HONESTLY,
IT NEARLY ALWAYS WORKS.

67
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,741
WILLIAM AND I AGREED
ON THIS FORMATION

68
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:16,209
AND THE ROLES FOR
THE MOBILE UNITS

69
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,478
ONCE WE STARTED ENGAGING
THE ENEMY'S FORCES.

70
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,614
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] "RAID CLASS"
MONSTERS ARE A LOT TOUGHER

71
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,850
THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS
OUTSIDE OF A RAID ZONE...

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,919
AND THEY HAVE EXTRA
POWERS AS WELL.

73
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,421
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE,

74
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,823
THE LEVEL CAP HAS GONE
FROM NINETY TO A HUNDRED.

75
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,726
THAT INCLUDES MONSTERS.

76
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:37,129
SO WE CAN'T ASSUME WE'RE MORE
POWERFUL THAN THEM ANYMORE.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,599
THIS RAID ZONE IS TOO FAR
FROM THE NEAREST CATHEDRAL,

78
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,235
SO IF WE DIE, WE COME BACK
TO LIFE AT THE FRONT DOORS.

79
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,604
[HIGHLAND]
HNGH... I BLEW IT THAT TIME...

80
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:47,240
[DEMICAS]
WYVERN KICK!

81
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,876
WATCH IT, MAN!
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN!

82
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,411
I CAN'T HEAL YOU FROM BACK HERE!

83
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:54,013
[DEMICAS]
EAT IT CHUMP! HAHAHA!

84
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:56,616
THESE GUYS'RE EASY!

85
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,752
HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

86
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,555
(GROWLS)

87
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,526
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THE UPSIDE
OF BATTLING RAID‐CLASS MONSTERS

88
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,596
ARE THE ITEMS THEY DROP.
THEY'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

89
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:10,863
[TETORA] HEAL! (LAUGHS)

90
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,064
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
YOU CAN EITHER MAKE

91
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:13,266
YOUR EXISTING WEAPONS
MORE POWERFUL,

92
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,534
OR BUILD SOMETHING
NEW FROM SCRATCH.

[TETORA]
ARE YOU OKAY, BIG GUY?

96
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,774
[NAOTSUGU] OF COURSE I AM!
JUST GIMME SOMETHING TO KILL!

97
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,644
HEY WAIT A SEC. ARE YOU
USING ME AS A SHIELD?! HUH?

98
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,513

PORTABLE FIRST AID UNIT,

99

100

AND THEN...

101
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,985
UH? I THINK THAT'S IT...

102
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,654
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
RAID ZONES HAVE AT LEAST FIVE,

103
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:38,925
AND POSSIBLY TEN SUPER MONSTERS
CALLED RAID BOSSES. BAD NEWS.

104
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,360
[PROMETHEUS]
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE VENDEMIAIRE

105
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,161
FROM THE FIRST PRISON RAID,
DOESN'T IT?

106
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,030
[ELTON DISKA] THE NINE
DUNGEONS OF HEILOS, HUH?

107

00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,069

GETS USED OVER AND OVER.

(SCREECHES)

RIGHT LEG FROM THE FRONT!

116
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,415

LEFT LEG FROM THE SIDE.

LEFT LEG FROM BEHIND!

118

FROM BEHIND! GET INTO POSITION!

AND KEEP ON CHIPPING AWAY...

AND ARMOR FORWARD,
SUPPORTED BY HEALERS

126

AND PLAYERS WHO CAN CAST
REINFORCEMENT SPELLS

127
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:26,273
AND ATTACK FROM A DISTANCE.

128
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:28,241
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
TANKS ATTACK AND GET ATTACKED,

129
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,710
WHILE HEALERS MAKE SURE
THEY STAY HEALTHY

THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THIS IS WHERE IT
REALLY PAYS OFF.

132
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,384
A TANK HAS TO KEEP ON INCREASING
A MONSTER'S "ATTRACT FIRE,"

133
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:39,886
IT KEEPS THE MONSTER
FOCUSED ON THE TANK

134
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,120
AND NOT THE OTHER PLAYERS.

135
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,389
[MOLLUSCA TYPE @ AKIBA]
WHAT'S IT DOING?

136
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,156

IS IT MOVING AWAY?

137
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:47,260

ON A SINGLE ATTACKER!

NOW! WE NEED A RESURRECTION!

TO WAIT FOR THOSE PANSIES!

[DEMICAS]
YAH! TIGER ECHO FIST!

152
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,127

ONE HANDED CROSS SLASH!

BLOWN OUT OF THE ZONE!

TO GET TO HIGHER GROUND!

00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,116
ITS ATTACKS BECOME
MORE INTENSE AND VARIED.

166
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,553
(HOWLS)

167
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:47,220
WOAH!

168
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,589
(SCREAMING)

169
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,992
IT DID NOT JUST CHANGE ITS
ELEMENTAL TYPE AND TIMING.

170
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,994
THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY ROUGH!

171
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,229
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

172
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,630
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH A RAID BOSS

173
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,132
THE SAME WAY YOU DID WHEN
IT WAS A NORMAL BATTLE.

174
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,335
[ORDISSO] AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
[RAGOMARU] AGGGHHH...!

175
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:04,103
[NAOTSUGU/TETORA]
AHHHHHH!

176
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,072
[SHIROE]
NAOTSUGU! TETORA! NO!

177
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,775
(SCREECH)

178
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,777
[SHIROE VOICEOVER]
YOU WON'T WIN A BATTLE LIKE THIS

179
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,779
SIMPLY BY GROUPING A BUNCH
OF STRONG PLAYERS EITHER.

180
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,515
[RAGOMARU]
UWH! DINKURON'S BEEN PETRIFIED!

181
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,950
[FEDERICO]
AAAGH! WE'VE LOST ALL OUR TANKS.

182
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,286
[JUNZO]
WHERE ARE THE HEALERS?

183
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,920
[RAGOMARU]
THEY'RE ALL GONE! WE GOTTA MOVE!

184
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,456
[SHIROE]
MASSACHUSETTS...! LET'S GO!

185
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:24,724
[WILLIAM]
OKAY, FINE...

186
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,561
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
FALL BACK, PEOPLE!

187
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:32,932
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
IN A CASE LIKE THIS,

188
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,368
A TEAM ENDS UP FALLING BACK
AND DYING SEVERAL TIMES

189
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:39,272
UNTIL IT FIGURES OUT THE
BEST SET OF TACTICS TO USE.

190
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,278
AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DID.

191
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:47,247
VENDEMIAIRE,
OF THE FIRST PRISON,

192
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:50,450
DEFEATED US SEVERAL TIMES
BEFORE WE EVEN HAD A CHANCE.

193
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,322
(ROAR)

194
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,461
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
HE NEVER COMPLETELY WIPED US OUT

195
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,596
BUT HE CAME AWFULLY CLOSE.

196
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:06,266
[HIGHLAND] I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

197
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,100
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
A RAID PARTY HAS TO LEARN

198
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,569
A RAID BOSS' PATTERNS
AND STRATEGIES

199
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:11,671
OR THEY'LL JUST KEEP DYING.

200
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:14,341
NOT ALL RAIDS ARE SIMPLE
IN‐AND‐OUT BATTLES.

201
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:16,543
SOME TAKE AS LONG AS
A MONTH TO FINISH,

202
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,011
IF YOU EVER
FINISH THEM AT ALL...

203
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,180
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
BUT EVENTUALLY...

204
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,216
[WILLIAM]
IT'S WHEN IT BLINKS.

205
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:24,484
[PROMETHEUS]
RIGHT AFTERWARDS.

206
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:25,852
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO'S FIGHTING IT,

207
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,320
IT PICKS TEN RANDOM PEOPLE.

208
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,357
IT PLACES STATUS‐EFFECTS OR
USES INSTANT DEATH SKILL.

209
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,758
[DINKURON] YEAH...

210
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,193
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT THE TIMING ON THAT.

211
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,394
[SHIROE]
TWENTY‐SIX SECONDS.

212
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:35,862
[ALL]
HUH?

213
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,998
GUYS, IT'S TWENTY‐SIX SECONDS.

214
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:42,702
(SCREECH)
[WILLIAM] TIME IT NOW!

215
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,471
[ELTON DISKA] ALL RIGHT, GUYS...
GET AROUND THE FRONT!

216
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,173
[SASAMEYUKI]
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

217
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,441
[PIANISSISSIMO]
HURRY AND GET INTO POSITION!

218
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,709
[SASAMEYUKI]
... SEVEN!

219
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,278
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
LIKE THE REST OF US,

220
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,313
RAID BOSSES HAVE RE‐CAST
AND COOL‐DOWN PERIODS.

221
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:54,614
TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

222
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,283
KNOW THE TIMING, EVADE,
THEN COUNTERATTACK.

223
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,218
THEN DOING DAMAGE
IS ALMOST EASY.

224
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,419
[SASAMEYUKI]
SIXTY! GO!

225
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,420
[SHIROE]
WILLIAM!

226
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,821
[WILLIAM]
YEAH!

227
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:04,023
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

228
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,359
(SCREECH)

229
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,895
[JUNZO] HEY! IT ISN'T
FLASHING THIS TIME!

230
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,864
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, NO MORE GETTING
TURNED INTO STATUES!

231
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,333
[TETORA] LET'S GO GET HIM!

232
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,535
[WILLIAM] ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS!

233
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,904
DO SOME REAL DAMAGE THIS TIME!

234
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,772
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
IF THE TEAM ATTACKS BASED ON

235
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,342
WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE
BOSS' STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES,

236
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,510
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

237
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,878
BEFORE IT GETS
THE VICTORY IT WANTS.

238
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,348
(EXPLOSION)

239
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,485
BEAT A RAID BOSS,
AND YOU PRETTY MUCH

240
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:35,788
GET SHOWERED WITH GOLD
AND EPIC‐CLASS ITEMS.

241
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:40,092
THE SECOND RAID BOSS WAS
EL RAIDA OF THE FIFTH PRISON.

242
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:43,296
HER SPECIALTY WAS RESETTING OUR
ACCUMULATED FOCAL HATRED

243
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,898
AND SUMMONING GUARDIAN BEASTS
TO DEAL WITH US.

244
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,066
IT WAS BRUTAL.

245
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,167
(HEAVY BREATHING)

246
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,736
HWYA!

247
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,444
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] HOWEVER,
WE FINALLY TOOK CARE OF IT

248
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:59,111
ON OUR ELEVENTH TRY.

249
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,513
WE'VE HAD A TOUGH GO OF IT,

250
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,949
BUT BY HITTING ALL THESE
RAID BOSSES ONE AT A TIME

251
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,150
EN ROUTE TO OUR GOAL,

252
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:06,353
SEEMS TO BE HAVING
THE EFFECT WE WANT.

253
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:09,556
NOW... THIS IS A
FULL RAID PARTY.

254
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,634
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] WE'RE NOW
THREE WEEKS INTO OUR ASSAULT

255
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,003
ON THE ABYSSAL SHAFT,
GIVE OR TAKE A DAY.

256
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,073
[FEDERICO] NOT AGAIN.
[VOINEN] THERE HE GOES...

257
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,409
[DEMICAS] I'LL SHOW YOU
THE WAY TO HELL, MONSTERS!

258
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:30,777
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, WAIT!

259
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,579
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD OFF
ON THE TAUNTS, MAN!

260
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,880
YOU'RE DRAWING TOO MUCH
ATTENTION, DEMI‐POO!

261
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,748
SHUT IT YOU POT‐BELLIED
STOVE, I'M GONNA‐!

262
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:38,518
[TETORA]
WAAUGH! LOOK OUT! BEHIND YOU!

263
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,323
UWH! WYVERN KICK!

264
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,525
DOES HE ENJOY
GETTING HIMSELF HURT?

265
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,760
GUESS WE HAVE TO
BACK THAT MANIAC UP.

266
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,061
(RASPY BREATH)

267
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,800
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THE DEEPER
AND FARTHER WE GOT IN,

268
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,902
THE MORE VICIOUS
THE DUNGEON BECAME.

269
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,404
(LABORED BREATHING)

270
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,206
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THE LEVELS OF THE MONSTERS GREW.

271
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,808
AND SO DID THE INTENSITY
OF THE BATTLES.

272
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,343
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
AND WE HAD TO FIGHT WITHOUT

273
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,312
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE
LAYOUT OF THE ZONE.

274
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,379
(GROANS)

275
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,414
[TETORA]
GET READY!

276
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:09,416
IT'S TIME TO HEAL!

277
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:12,385
NOW DON'T GO FALLING IN
LOVE WITH ME... OKAY?

278
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,153
CAST THE FREAKIN' SPELL ALREADY!

279
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,388
(GIGGLES)
OH. OH RIGHT!

280
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,923
HERE YOU GO!

281
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,694
OKAY! IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE
MORE PEP IN YOUR STEP!

282
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,397
AURORA HEAL!

283
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,599
[ALL] AHHHHHH....

284
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,435
[MOLLUSCA TYPE @ AKIBA]
OH, SPLENDID!

285
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:29,936
[SHIROE]
CONCENTRATE YOUR ATTACKS!

286
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:31,971
BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE!

287
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,373
[ALL]
RIGHT!

288
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,141
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
WE DEFEATED TWO RAID BOSSES,

289
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:38,478
BUT WE'RE WONDERING WHY WE
HAVEN'T SEEN A THIRD ONE YET.

290
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:41,981
AND A LITTLE SNOOPING AROUND
HASN'T HELPED US, EITHER.

291
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,917
AS IT STANDS,
WE'RE COMPLETELY STUCK.

292
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,120
[WILLIAM]
HOW MANY DO YOU THINK ARE LEFT?

293
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,556
[SHIROE]
YOU MEAN RAID BOSSES?

294
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,724
THERE HAS TO BE
AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR.

295
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:56,396
[WILLIAM] WE CAN'T DO THIS...
NOT IN TEN DAYS.

296
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,198
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
SUPPLIES AND LOGISTICS

297
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,532
ARE GETTING REALLY PROBLEMATIC.

298
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,800
WE GET RESURRECTED IF WE DIE,

299
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,069
BUT FIXING WORN OUT
EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY.

300
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,805
WE HAVE TO TAKE TIME OUT TO LET
THE PLAYERS WITH CRAFTING SKILLS

301
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,774
GET OUR WEAPONS AND
SHIELDS BACK INTO SHAPE.

302
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:11,544
OTHERWISE, WE CAN'T LAST LONG
ENOUGH TO DO ANY REAL DAMAGE.

303
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:12,945
AND WILLIAM ONLY HAS

304
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,448
A HANDFUL OF CRYSTAL COMET
ARROWS TO USE AT A TIME.

305
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,517
HE'S CONSTANTLY TAXING OUR
EPIC CRAFTSMEN

306
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:20,553
AND SUPPLIES TO
RESTOCK HIS QUIVER.

307
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:22,522
(HUMMING)

308
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,291
SO WE'RE RUNNING OUT?

309
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,126
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG
OUR PROVISIONS WILL LAST.

310
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:28,561
YEAH, AND THIS
FULL‐RAID PARTY

311
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,463
IS BEATING THE GEAR UP
PRETTY BADLY.

312
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:31,831
NOT TO MENTION YOU CAN'T GET

313
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,033
A LOT OF THESE WEAPONS
OUTSIDE OF A RAID.

314
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,135
SAME WITH THE MATERIALS
FOR THE REPAIR WORK.

315
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,639
WELL THAT'S WHY OTHER RAID
GUILDS GO ON LOWER‐LEVEL RAIDS;

316
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,040
TO GET MATERIALS THEY NEED

317
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,075
TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN
BETTER WEAPONS.

318
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,577
EASIER SAID THAN DONE...

319
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:47,480
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN HIT ALL
THE RAID ZONES ALL THE TIME.

320
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,181
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT, ISN'T IT.

321
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:52,319
WE'RE A MASTER RAID GUILD.
WE DON'T DO LESSER RAIDS.

322
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,622
AFTER ALL WE DO HAVE OUR PRIDE
TO THINK ABOUT, DON'T WE?

323
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,956
IT'S NOT JUST THAT!

324
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,891
WILLIAM WOULDN'T WASTE
OUR TIME ON SUCH THINGS.

325
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,227
GOT THAT RIGHT.

326
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:03,563
THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO STAY
WITH HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

327
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:05,765
HE HAS OUR
BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

328
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:09,269
I MANAGED TO GET SOME
PROVISIONS BEFORE WE LEFT.

329
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,238
HOW LONG WILL
THEY SUSTAIN US?

330
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,373
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING YOU
BROUGHT... TWENTY DAYS.

331
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,942
[WILLIAM]
HUH? TWENTY DAYS?

332
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,710
[SHIROE] I GUESS THAT
ISN'T MUCH HELP, IS IT?

333
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,812
[WILLIAM]
UH, NO...

334
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,514
NOT REALLY.

335
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,815
YEAH I KNOW...

336
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,484
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
SERIOUSLY?

337
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:26,853
LOG HORIZON HAS WHAT,
EIGHT PLAYERS IN IT?

338
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,788
NOT EXACTLY A "POWER GUILD"

339
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,724
HOW DID HE MANAGE TO GET ALL
OF THOSE SUPPLIES ON HIS OWN?

340
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:35,195
THIS GUY REALLY IS
SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T HE?

341
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,599
AFTER I TOLD THE ROUND TABLE
I WASN'T INTERESTED

342
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,033
IN THEIR ENDEAVORS,

343
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,603
I LEAD SILVER SWORD AROUND
TO THE VARIOUS RAID ZONES

344
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,439
UNTIL WE GOT TO SUSUKINO.

345
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,609
I DON'T REGRET ANY OF THE
DECISIONS I'VE MADE TO GET HERE.

346
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,612
I FEEL NO SHAME,

347
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,548
BUT ... NONETHELESS.

348
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,550
[GUY A]
LOOK, I'M DONE WITH THIS...

349
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,885
[GUY B]
GOOD LUCK. SEE YA LATER!

350
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,554
[GUY C]
IT WAS FUN, GUILD MASTER!

351
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,490
THEY EVEN KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE GOING?

352
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,592
LET 'EM STARVE
OUT THERE.

353
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,059
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
AND WELL, HERE WE ARE,

354
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,928
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T
BOTHER TO ASK SHIROE

355
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,630
WHAT THE HELL IT WAS
HE WAS LOOKING FOR

356
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,032
AND HOW MUCH TROUBLE
IT WAS GONNA BE.

357
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,135
THEY JUST FOLLOWED ME...

358
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,639
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING

359
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,508
OR THE WRONG THING OUT HERE.

360
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:24,411
OR WHAT TO TELL THEM
IF THEY ASK?

361
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:25,945
JESUS. I'M JUST A GAMER.

362
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:28,715
I'M NOT SOME GUY WHO JUMPED OFF
THE PAGES OF A COMIC BOOK,

363
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:32,319
FULL OF AMAZING FIGHTING SKILLS
AND BUILT‐IN LEADERSHIP.

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,588
BUT I MUST WONDER...

365
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:39,226
... WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT
MIND OF YOURS, SHIROE?

366
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:41,261
[SHIROE, THINKING] HAVING A
NICE QUIET PLACE TO READ,

367
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,896
KINDA WORKS IN MY FAVOR.

368
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:47,234
BUT HE'S SURE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M UP TO SOONER OR LATER.

369
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,769
AND EVEN IF SOMEONE FROM MINAMI
DOESN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS,

370
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,504
SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT BE AFTER US.

371
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,274
(ROCK BREAKING)
[BOTH] HM?

372
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,642
THAT LITTLE RAT!

373
00:15:55,742 --> 00:16:00,947
(GROWL) YOU LITTLE PUKE!
RAHHHH! (HEAVY BREATH)

374
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,716
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
DAMN YOU, SHIROE!

375
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:05,218
YEAH, THAT BIG MOUTH PUSSY CAT

376
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,054
AND THAT LOUD‐MOUTH KNUCKLEHEAD
I CAN DEAL WITH...

377
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:11,324
AT LEAST THEY GAVE ME A FIGHT.
I CAN RESPECT THAT.

378
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,526
(SNARL)

379
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:17,397
ALL HE DID WAS PLAY WITH HIS
GLASSES AND GIVE PEOPLE ORDERS!

380
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:21,601
AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
HE DISRESPECTED ME.

381
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,236
[SHIROE] SO WHICH ONE
OF YOU FUTURE DEAD GUYS

382
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:24,637
IS DEMI‐DOOFUS OR WHATEVER?

383
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:25,738
UWAH?

384
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,139
PARDON ME...
YOU'RE DOOFUS.

385
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,941
(ANGRY SCREAM)

386
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,711
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
WAIT,

387
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:34,781
MY EXTRA FIGHTING POWER
WAS HIM BUFFING ME.

388
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:38,785
HE USED KEEN EDGE
TO BOOST MY STRENGTH

389
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:43,390
AND MIND SHOCK TO MAKE SURE
THE MONSTER DIDN'T MOVE.

390
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,426
THAT LITTLE CREEP TOUCHED ME
WITH HIS MAGIC AGAIN!

391
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:50,029
THAT KID... SAVED MY LIFE?!

392
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,299
UWAHHHHARRGGH!

393
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,701
(ROCK SMASHING) AHHHH!

394
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,236
I DON'T SUPPOSE
HE'S NOTICING

395
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,137
THAT I GAVE HIM MORE
VEGETABLES THIS TIME AROUND?

396
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,039
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

397
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,809
[FEDERICO]
HUMPH! WHAT A DRAMA QUEEN.

398
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,712
[VOINEN] YOU SAID IT...
BUT I'M GLAD HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

399
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,580
YEAH, AT LEAST YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM

400
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,016
RUNNING AWAY IN A FIGHT.

401
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,588
[NAOTSUGU]
WOAH! THIS LOOKS AWESOME!

402
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,090
[BOTH]
THANK YOU FOR THE STEW YOU GUYS!

403
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,158
(LAUGH, MUNCH)

404
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,560
(BLOWING)

405
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,594
(CHEERFUL CRY)

406
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:25,832
(CHOMP) MMMMM!

407
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,868
OH WOW! THIS IS PRETTY GOOD!

408
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,103
HUH? YOU OKAY OVER THERE?

409
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,307
HMMM... SOMETHING'S UP WITH
SHIROE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.

410
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,276
YOU KNOW HIM
PRETTY WELL, HUH?

411
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:38,110
I KNOW HE'S GOT A LOT
ON HIS PLATE RIGHT NOW

412
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,213
AND HE'S LOOKING
PRETTY STRESSED.

413
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,316
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

414
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,819
HE ACTUALLY ENJOYS OVERWORKING
HIMSELF AND STAYING BUSY.

415
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,888
OF COURSE,
HE'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT,

416
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,658
SO IT'S HARD TO TELL IF
HE'S IN GOOD SPIRITS OR NOT.

417
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,159
BUT SOMETHING SEEMS OFF.

418
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,129
OKAY, SO HIS FRIEND CAN
SENSE THAT HE'S STRUGGLING.

419
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,898
YEAH.

420
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:01,033
YOU THINK HE NEEDS
A BEAUTIFUL STARLET?

421
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,169
YEAH MAYBE, BUT HE
DOESN'T NEED YOU.

422
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,305
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
SHOW HIM MY PANTIES?!

423
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,274
[NAOTSUGU]
WELL MAYBE IF I SAW 'EM FIRST‐

424
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,408
UWH‐WAHAHAHOHH!

425
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,610
HEY! YOU STAY OUT
OF THIS, PIP‐SQUEAK!

426
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,044
(SNEEZE)

427
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:15,315
LOOK, SHIROE'S HARDER
TO CHEER UP THAN I AM.

428
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,817
SO IF HE'S ALREADY DOWN
IN THE DUMPS ALL THE TIME,

429
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,719
WHY WOULD HE COME
TO THIS AWFUL PLACE?

430
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:21,854
UH... HMMM...

431
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,191
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

432
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,728
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I'D SAY
HE'S HERE TO PROTECT HIS HOME.

433
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:30,297
HIS HOME, YOU SAY?

434
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,032
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AN
ACTUAL HOUSE OR BUILDING.

435
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,934
IT'S MORE LIKE
WHAT OUR GUILD IS...

436
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,770
THE CITY... OR MAYBE
EVEN THE WORLD.

437
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,206
[TETORA] THE WORLD?
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, YEAH.

438
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:41,073
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
NEED TO EAT AND SLEEP.

439
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,242
AND DON'T FORGET OUR FRIENDS.

440
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,877
WE HAD FAMILY
WHERE WE CAME FROM.

441
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,613
I MEAN IN THIS WORLD, NOW...

442
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:48,515
OUR GUILD'S KINDA LIKE A FAMILY.

443
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:49,849
[TETORA] HMMM...

444
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,751
[NAOTSUGU] AND ALL THOSE
PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT

445
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:53,753
NEED A PLACE TO STAY. YOU KNOW?

446
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,688
SO LIKE, AKIHABARA IS

447
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,825
ESSENTIALLY THE HOME
FOR OUR HOME.

448
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,927
IF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY
CAN'T BE HAPPY,

449
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:03,863
THEN NONE OF THE GUILDS
REALLY HAVE A CHANCE.

450
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:06,233
IF YOU DON'T FEEL SECURE
ABOUT YOUR CITY,

451
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,268
THEN YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR GUILD.

452
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,003
AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
SHIROE WON'T THINK TWICE

453
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,773
ABOUT GOING NOSE TO NOSE
WITH AN ENTIRE CITY

454
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:16,409
OR EVEN THE WORLD ITSELF
TO PROTECT HIS HOME.

455
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,878
OKAY... WHERE'S HOME?

456
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,281
[NAOTSUGU] AKIHABARA.
[TETORA] HM?

457
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,083
[NAOTSUGU, THINKING] I REALLY
OUGHTA GIVE MARIELLE A CALL...

458
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,819
I GUESS IT'S STILL
A LITTLE EARLY...

459
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,721
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T...

460
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,891
AHHHEEEEEEEUAHHHHH...

461
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,194
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR
FACE, NAOTSUGU? (GIGGLE)

462
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,329
ACK! N‐NOTHING!
MY FACE IS JUST FINE, ALRIGHT!

463
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,231
MY FACE IS THE
BEST FACE EVER.

464
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,867
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR OWN STUPID FACE!

465
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,069
HM? (GIGGLE)

466
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,238
(MINORI HUMMING)

467
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,673
SO IS THERE EVEN A DIFFERENCE

468
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,775
BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND
SNOWFELL, ANYWAY?

469
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,343
SNOWFELL'S THE BIG
WINTER CELEBRATION

470
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:52,011
FOR THE PEOPLE OF
THE LAND, RIGHT?

471
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:53,145
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

472
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,781
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK...?

473
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,116
IS MASTER SHIROE GONNA MAKE IT
BACK IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS?

474
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,085
I DUNNO,
BUT I SURE HOPE SO.

475
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:00,152
HUH?

476
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:03,256
OH, MAN... I MISS THE
HOLIDAYS BACK HOME.

477
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,124
(SOBBING)

478
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:08,195
[LYCOPENE] AW, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, KATSUOMARU?

479
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,530
[KATSUOMARU] THIS IS THE
FIRST TIME I'VE SPENT CHRISTMAS

480
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,931
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY.

481
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,568
I... I'M... I JUST
FEEL LOST, YOU KNOW?!

482
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,136
[SMASH] (SNIFFLE) WHY'D YOU
HAVE TO BRING THAT UP?!

483
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,372
SO LET'S SPEND IT
TOGETHER THIS YEAR.

484
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,841
(CRYING TOGETHER)

485
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:23,175
[RUDY] SANTA CLAUS?

486
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,011
WE GET TOGETHER AND
EXCHANGE PRESENTS

487
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,579
AROUND SNOWFELL TIME, TOO.

488
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,182
[TOYA] AT CHRISTMAS, SANTA
DELIVERS PRESENTS TO EVERYONE.

489
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:32,385
RIGHT! HE RIDES ON A REINDEER.

490
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:34,787
(GIGGLE) NO THE REINDEER
PULL HIS SLEIGH.

491
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,556
[MINORI] OH YEAH...
[RUDY] I CAN'T WAIT!

492
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,858
I WONDER WHAT HE'LL
BRING US THIS YEAR.

493
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,493
TELL YOU WHAT!

494
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,795
IF HE'S GOT A SCROLL FOR ONE OF
THOSE ORAL ARTS, THEN I WANT IT!

495
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,064
DID SOMEONE SAY ORAL ART?

496
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,633
HOLY CRAP!

497
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,100
AKATSUKI, WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

498
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,069
YOU NEVER CEASE TO
AMAZE ME AKATSUKI!

499
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,705
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU...
COME ON DOWN!

500
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:54,106
CHIEF...

501
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,175
HMM, NOTHING LIKE COMING
HOME AFTER A HARD DAY.

502
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:59,078
HAVE YOURSELF SOME TEA
AND A SNACK, HMMM.

503
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,413
I APPRECIATE IT.

504
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:03,149
OKAY... WHAT'RE
THEY TALKING ABOUT?

505
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,484
UH... THE ORAL ARTS...

506
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,286
THEY'RE LIKE THE TALK
OF THE TOWN THESE DAYS.

507
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:08,855
I HEAD SOME TALK
ABOUT THAT MYSELF...

508
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,257
IT'S A NEW WAY FOR SOMEONE

509
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:13,092
TO GO OUT AND GET A NEW
SKILL RANK FOR THEMSELVES.

510
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,594
AS YOU ALREADY KNOW,

511
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,763
THE STRENGTH OF A FIGHTING SKILL
IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL

512
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,199
TO THE STRENGTH OF
THE PERSON USING IT.

513
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,367
[ISUZU] 'CAUSE THE NEW SKILLS

514
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,834
AREN'T PART OF YOUR
EXISTING SKILLS.

515
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,204
YOU GOT IT.
AND THEY WORK LIKE THIS:

516
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,139
INTRODUCTORY, MID‐CLASS,
MASTER, AND SECRET.

517
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,541
AS THE SKILL PROGRESSES,

518
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,110
IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY
HARD TO BEAT, Y'KNOW.

519
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,946
IT SAYS HERE YOU NEED TO GET
A SCROLL FROM AN ADVENTURER

520
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:36,048
IN YOUR CLASS TO
LEARN A MID‐CLASS.

521
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,317
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

522
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,286
YOU NEED A SCROLL THAT
USES RARE MATERIALS

523
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,821
IN ORDER TO LEARN A MASTER ART.

524
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,323
[NYANTA] THE SCROLLS
AND MATERIALS

525
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,925
ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN,
MYAH... HOWEVER...

526
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:49,095
IF YOU'RE DEAD SET ON GETTING
TO THE SECRET LEVEL OF YOUR ART,

527
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:50,930
YOU'LL NEED TO DO
SPECIAL QUESTS.

528
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,399
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PLAY CATCH UP.

529
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,667
IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANY
RAIDS YET, BABY.

530
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,269
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
RAIDS...

531
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,671
[RUDY]I'VE HEARD THAT ORAL ARTS
ARE SUPERIOR TO SECRET ARTS.

532
00:21:58,771 --> 00:21:59,839
IS THAT TRUE, CHIEF?

533
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,841
BUT THAT'S ONLY
A RUMOR, RIGHT?

534
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,843
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE
I'VE TALKED TO

535
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,345
THAT'VE ACTUALLY SEEN
ONE IN ACTION,

536
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,480
LET ALONE OBTAINED ONE
FOR THEMSELVES.

537
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,149
WELL BROTHER SHIROE
SAID THEY EXIST!

538
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,151
HUH? HE REALLY DID?

539
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,921
[TOYA] YEAH, HE SAID THEY'RE
TOTALLY LEGIT.

540
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:16,923
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO
MASTER JUST ONE OF THEM?

541
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:18,491
MHMMH!

542
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:20,560
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] BACK WHEN
WE WERE JUST PLAYING THIS,

543
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,430
ORAL ARTS WEREN'T AVAILABLE
FOR US TO MASTER.

544
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,565
BUT NOW...

545
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:27,099
COME GET YOUR CRISPY, JUICY
CHRISTMAS CHICKEN RIGHT HERE!

546
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,101
JUST SIX DAYS TILL
CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!

547
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:33,172
[NERURESU] HOW WEAK AND
SHALLOW CAN YOU FOOLS BE!

548
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:37,777
WE'RE NOT A PACK OF LAPDOGS
BEGGING AT YOUR FEET!

549
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:40,580
IT'S TIME YOU
LEARNED YOUR PLACE...

550
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,718
ADVENTURERS, YOU HAVE
WORN OUT YOUR WELCOME!

551
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:18,345
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] WHILE
SHIROE IS AWAY FROM AKIHABARA,

552
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,913
A WARRIOR TRIES TO
FIND HER OWN WAY.

553
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:22,749
WHY WAS SHE LEFT BEHIND?

554
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:25,885
IS IT INEXPERIENCE? WEAKNESS?

555
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:29,889
MEANWHILE, RAYNESHIA HAS
GIVEN HERSELF TO RESIGNATION.

556
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,225
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE
ADVENTURERS AND HER PEOPLE

557
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:34,261
WILL EVER AGREE.

558
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,430
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
