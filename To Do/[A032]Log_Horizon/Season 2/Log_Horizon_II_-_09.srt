1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,474
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] IT HAPPENED
ON CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT.

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,745
[NAOTSUGU] WHOA! I KNEW
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BIG,

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,146
BUT THAT IS RIDICULOUS!

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,149
[FEDERICO]
RUSEATO OF THE SEVENTH GARDEN...

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,151
[VOINEN]
IT'S JUST LIKE THE SCOUTS SAID,

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,221
HE'S THE SPITTING IMAGE OF
THE BOSS FROM THE HEILOS RAID!

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,422
[NAOTSUGU]
LET'S BREEZE THROUGH THIS

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,324
SO WE CAN CHOW DOWN
ON SOME CHICKEN.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,592
[SHIROE]
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,860
"BREEZE THROUGH" ANYTHING...

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,862
[WILLIAM] BUT WE MIGHT
KEEP OURSELVES ALIVE

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,163
IF WE STICK TO THE PLAN.

13
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,565
[TETORA]
UMM...

14
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,167
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OUR CHANCES ARE, STRATEGIST?

15
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,169
[SHIROE]
FIFTY... FIFTY!

16
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,940
[SHIROE] WE'RE LESS THAN
TWENTY METERS AWAY!

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,374
WATCH IT, YOU GUYS!

18
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,643
COME ON!

19
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,546
(GRUNT)

20
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,147
(YELL)

21
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,783
HEAL!

22
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,251
SHIELD'S UP!
GO FOR IT!

23
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,153
[DINKURON]
I GOT HIM WHERE I WANT HIM!

24
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,755
ANCHOR HOWL!
(ROAR)

25
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,958
[WILLIAM] ALL RIGHT RAIDERS!
LET'S DO THIS...

26
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,826
DROP HIM WHERE HE STANDS!

27
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,601
(GRUNT)
HWAH!

28
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,503
[WILLIAM]
PARTY 3 AND 4, KEEP HITTING HIM!

29
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,938
PARTY 2 LEAD ELEMENT,
BACK 'EM UP!

30
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,173
ANYONE NOT ATTACKING,

31
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,676
CAST HEALING BUFFS
ON PARTY ONE'S TANKS!

32
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,377
UH...? WATCH IT!

33
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,945
KEEP AN EYE ON RUSEATO!

34
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,681
THAT GLOW MEANS SOMETHING!

35
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:02,649
UWAHHHH!

36
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,619
[DEMICAS, STRUGGLING]
UWAHEHEH...

37
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,322
TWO ARE DEAD...! AND SEVERAL
MORE ARE CRITICALLY WOUNDED!

38
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,490
REINFORCE THE FRONTLINE'S BUFFS!

39
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,959
SASAMEYUKI,
GIMME A COUNT!

40
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,095
MM. 1! 2!

41
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,897
[WILLIAM] KEEP HITTING HIM
FROM A DISTANCE,

42
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,666
WHILE WE CAST THE HEALING
AND RESURRECTION SPELLS!

43
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,902
YOU SEE WHAT HE DID...?
THAT WAS CRAZY OUT THERE!

44
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,638
THE ORIGINAL WASN'T
ANYWHERE NEAR AS POWERFUL!

45
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,574
THAT ONE JUST CAME AND
HIT US WITHOUT ANY WARNING!

46
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,342
23! 24!

47
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,278
[ELTON DISKA] HE'S COMING!
[RAGOMARU] MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

48
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,581
[SHIROE] WAIT! HE'S DOING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME!

49
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,349
(YELL)

50
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,351
EACH ATTACK UNLEASHES
A TON OF DAMAGE!

51
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,854
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
SURVIVE ONE OF THOSE.

52
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,357
[SASAMEYUKI]
88! 89! 90!

53
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,159
[SHIROE] NOW!
[WILLIAM] SHIELDS, PEOPLE!

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,261
SACRED BARRIER!

55
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,462
SANCTUARY!

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,731
[HIGHLAND]
IF YOU LIVE THROUGH IT,

57
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,732
START DOING A COUNT!

58
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,800
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH! I HEAR YA ON THAT ONE!

59
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,335

60
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,838
(STRUGGLED GRUNTS)

61
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,208
[SHIROE] EVERYONE SURVIVED!
90 SECONDS TO RECAST!

62
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,276
[DEMICAS] I NEED A HEALING SPELL

63
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,278
[TETORA] I'M ON IT, DEMI‐POO!

64
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,413
LOOKS LIKE HE'S WIDE OPEN
AFTER USING HIS ATTACK.

65
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,516
IT'S TIME FOR US TO
GO ON THE OFFENSIVE!

66
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,819
[NAOTSUGU] SO EVERYONE MADE IT
THROUGH HIS SECOND ATTACK?

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,454
NOT TOO SHABBY GUYS!

68
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:18,024
[SHIROE] YEAH. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
ADAPTING PRETTY WELL OUT HERE.

69
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,261
(ROAR)

70
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,899
COME ON YOU GUYS!
DON'T LET UP ON ME!

00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,468
I NEED EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT!
NOW TAKE HIM DOWN.

00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,346
(ROAR)

78
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,515
YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH!

79
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,349
HE'S GOING TO REDIRECT HIS
ATTENTION!

80
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,851
YOU'RE GONNA END UP GETTING HIT!

81
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,922
UH? OH GOD! WHAT'S
GOING ON, I CAN'T MOVE?!

82
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,824
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] WHAT'S IS
THIS GUNK COMING OUT OF HIM!

83
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,959
[HIGHLAND] WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M STUCK IN IT!

84
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,529
[DINKURON] I'M LOSING HIT
POINTS! THIS CRAP IS POISONED!

85
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,964
[DINKURON] I CAN'T GET MY
ATTACK SPEED AND POWER UP!

86
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,566
I NEED A BUFF OUT HERE!

87
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,568
[SHIROE] I DON'T REMEMBER
THIS PATTERN IN HEILOS.

88
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,137
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO
INFLICT MUCH DAMAGE.

89
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,840
[DINKURON]
ANCHOR HOWL!

90
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,277
WHAT THA?! HE'S
JUST IGNORING IT?!

91
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,379
[NAOTSUGU] ANCHOR HOWL
DIDN'T WORK?

92
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,748
[WILLIAM] HE'S GOT US TRAPPED.

93
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,217
HE'S USING AN
IMMOBILIZING ATTACK!

94
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,585

I GOT SOMETHING FOR
YA. AND YOUR MOM!

122

LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO SWITCH
INTO A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION!

123
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,290
THIS WAS JUST A GIMMICK WHEN
WE FOUGHT IT IN HEILOS.

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,126
I GUESS THIS BOSS CAN
DO IT ANY TIME HE WANTS!

125
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,561
[VOINEN] GREAT!

126
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,496
SO NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH
"TRUE WHITE KNIGHT" MODE?

127
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,231
[SHIROE] THE FIGHT'S
JUST GETTING STARTED!

128
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,166
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

129
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,040
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] IT'S JUST
AS THE SCOUTS REPORTED!

130
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,476
ALL HIS BROKEN ARMOR
IS TURNING INTO MORE BEASTS!

131
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,912
[FEDERICO] I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER SEEN SO MANY.

132
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,014
CAN WE EVEN DO THIS?
IS IT POSSIBLE?

133
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,717
[DEMICAS] QUIT YER WHINING
SISSY PANTS! LET'S DO IT!

134
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,319
[WILLIAM] FRONT LINE DRAW THE

136
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,389
HYAHHHHHHHH!

137
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,658
AAAH!

00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,027
[DEMICAS]
YAHHH!

139
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,498
HUH? WHAT THE F...?

140
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,101
YOU KNOW? I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

141
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,972
[NAOTSUGU] HUH? OH, COME ON!
THEY'RE RESTORING HIS HEALTH?!

142
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,575
[SHIROE]
I GET IT NOW...

143
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,210
EVERY ONE WE BEAT GIVES RUSEATO
SOME OF HIS HEALTH BACK..

144
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,112
PRETTY CLEVER ACTUALLY.

145
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,816
LOOK, HE'S BACK IN
BLACK KNIGHT MODE!

146
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,552
DOESN'T THIS
GUY EVER QUIT?!

147
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,621
88! 89! 90!

148
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,923
WAIT, LOOK! HE'S
REGAINING HIS STRENGTH!

149
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,159
(SCREAM)

150
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,527
[WILLIAM]
IT DOESN'T MATTER

151
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,828
WHETHER HE'S GETTING HIS
STRENGTH BACK OR NOT!

152
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,630
IF WE HIT HIM FASTER
THAN HE CAN REGROUP,

153
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,231
THEN HE'LL NEVER CATCH UP.

154
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,099
YAHHHH!!!

155
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,973
[DEMICAS]
WHAT?! HE'S DOING IT AGAIN?!

156
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,876
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] THIS IS...
THIS IS PURE INSANITY!

157
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:56,843
AGGHHHHH!!!

158
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,144
HAHHHH!!!

159
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,785
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WORKING...

160
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,487
WE NEED TO BE GOING AFTER
THAT GIANT FREAKING KNIGHT!

161
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,756
WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE THE SHADOW
VANGUARD!

162
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,893
IF WE LET 'EM GET PAST US!
THEY'LL KILL OUR HEALERS!

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,960
WE CAN'T BREAK UP.

164
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,763
WE WON'T HAVE A PARTY LEFT
TO HIT THIS GUY!

165
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,565
[SHIROE]
IT'S A NUMBERS GAME...

166
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,801
[NAOTSUGU] MM?
[DEMICAS] HMM....

167
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,636
[SHIROE] THE NUMBER OF
SHADOW VANGUARD THAT APPEAR

168
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,505
IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

169
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,207
THAT CAUSE DAMAGE TO RUSEATO
IN BLACK KNIGHT MODE.

170
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,309
[NAOTSUGU]
OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO?

171
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,611
[SHIROE]
WE DO THIS...

172
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,746
WE ONLY LET OUR HEAVY
HITTERS TAKE HIM ON.

173
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,014
WE'LL TRAIN HIS FOCUS...

174
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,116
EVERYONE ELSE WILL
TAKE ON SUPPORT ROLES.

175
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,350
HYAH!

176
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,619
HWAH!

177
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,655
[SHIROE] THAT SHOULD CONTROL THE
NUMBER OF SHADOW VANGUARD,

178
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,924
ONLY RE‐SPAWNING TEN NEXT TIME.

179
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,594
[JUNZO] LET 'EM GET MAD,
BUT DON'T KILL 'EM THIS TIME!

180
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,763
[DEMICAS]
YEAH I KNOW! (GRUNT)

181
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,699
(GROWL)

182
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,200
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

183
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,504
BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
BEAT HIM LIKE I AM NOW.

184
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,241
NO. I CAN'T FORGIVE
HIM FOR WHAT HE DID.

185
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,109
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS.

186
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,279
EVERYONE'S GONNA SEE IT.
AND I'M GONNA LOVE IT.

187
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,614
I'M GONNA RIP HIS GLASSES OFF

188
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,382
AND SMASH THAT
SMUG FACE OF HIS...

189
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,953
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE NAP
AND CRUSH HIM ALL OVER AGAIN!

190
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,255
[ENKARTANTO] LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
GOT HIM DOWN TO HALF HIS HEALTH!

191
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,824
[TOKO] GREAT!
I THINK WE GOT THIS GUYS.

192
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,959
HEH...

193
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,594
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
I'M GONNA GET STRONGER.

194
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,863
AND GET EPIC ITEMS ON THIS RAID.

195
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:27,067
YOU JUST WAIT... YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURS, AND GET IT GOOD!

196
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,374
SHIROE, YOUR DAY IS
COMING, ENCHANTER!

197
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,677
YOU'RE GONNA PAY, BOY!

[ENKARTANTO]
IT'S IBRA HABRA!

208
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,001
[TOKO] THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT!
THIS IS RUSEATO'S ZONE!

00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,479
WHAT...? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
COME ON, MAN!

213
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,582
ANOTHER RAID BOSS?

214
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,751
THIS ISN'T GOOD...

215
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,853
THERE ARE THREE OF THEM?

216
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,056
[PROROCCA] THEY CAN'T DO THAT!
THEY CAN'T DO THAT!

217
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,225
THERE'S ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE RAID BOSS‐‐

218
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,459
ONLY ONE BOSS PER ZONE!

219
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,794
NO. THIS ISN'T FAIR.

AGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!

221
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,433
[WILLIAM] WHAT IS THIS...?

222
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,769
A QUEST THAT'S NOT MEANT
TO BE BEATEN?

223
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,872
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE...

00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,189

00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,190

LOOK OUT!

230
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,659
UWAH!

HUH? (SCREAM)

232
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,269
[SHIROE]
HUH?

233
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,806
ISN'T THIS...

234
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,475
... MY HOMETOWN?

235
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,746
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE.

236
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,783
HUH?

237
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,622
I CAN'T READ IT... IT WAS A
RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

238
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:07,160
OH, I GET IT. THIS IS WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO LOSE ONE OF MY MEMORIES.

239
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,368
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THAT'S RIGHT. I DIED.

240
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,609
IT'S NOT LIKE THE TOWN I GREW UP
IN WAS ALL THAT SPECIAL ANYWAY.

241
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,611
YOU COULD EAT AND
SLEEP AND WORK HERE,

242
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,446
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANTED
TO GET SOMETHING,

243
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,816
YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO SHIBUYA
OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT.

244
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,153
I'M A NORMAL GUY,
FROM A SMALL TOWN.

245
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,789
NOT MUCH MORE TO IT
THAN THAT, REALLY.

246
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,369
(DOOR OPENING)

247
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,504
[SHIROE]
UH?

248
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,939
(KEYS JINGLING, DOOR LOCKING)

249
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,547
THAT'S ME.

250
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,320
SINCE BOTH OF MY PARENTS WORKED,

251
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,556
I HAD A TENDENCY TO
SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE

252
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,025
AND WALK AROUND TOWN AT NIGHT.

253
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,395
EVEN WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED,

254
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,731
I WAS DEALING WITH DEPRESSION
AND BAD FEELINGS

255
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,800
WHEN I WAS BY MYSELF.

256
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,836
I WAS AFRAID OF GOING
DOWNTOWN...

257
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,971
SO INSTEAD...

258
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,912
I SPENT A LOT OF SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS ON THIS BENCH.

259
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,947
WHENEVER I FELT BAD
ABOUT SOMETHING,

260
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,248
SPENDING THE NIGHT OUT HERE

261
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,918
WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT HELPED ME FORGET.

262
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,453
[SHIROE]
WAIT! THAT'S IT!

263
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,556
NOW I KNOW WHY I CAME HERE.

264
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,160
I'M DEALING WITH
ANOTHER FAILURE AGAIN.

265
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,333
[SHIROE, THINKING]
ALL THE ADULTS I KNEW

266
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,368
COMPLIMENTED ME
ON BEING "GROWN‐UP."

267
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,238
YEAH, I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF
KEEPING QUIET

268
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,073
AND UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THEY SAID...

269
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,243
BUT WHAT DID I LOSE BY NOT BEING
LIKE THE OTHER KIDS AROUND ME;

270
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,912
ACTING HIGH AND
MIGHTY ALL THE TIME?

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,481
(SIGH)

272
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,853
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I'VE MADE SO MANY MISTAKES.

273
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,355
AND I PUSHED ALL MY
POTENTIAL FRIEND AWAY.

274
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,959
THEY OFFERED. I REFUSED, AND
CRAWLED FURTHER INTO MY SHELL.

275
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,528
AND I KEPT WALKING AWAY FROM
THE ONE PLACE

276
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,930
I NEEDED TO BE
PART OF THE GROUP.

277
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,032
MY FAMILY.

278
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,068
HOW HARD WAS IT ON MY PARENTS
TO WORK LIKE THEY DID

279
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,770
JUST TO HAVE A KID WHO WASN'T
REALLY THERE,

280
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,038
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T THERE?

281
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,275
I MADE A LOT OF LITTLE MISTAKES,

282
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,712
BUT PUNISHED MYSELF FOR THEM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

283
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,381
I'D COME HERE TO CRY EVERY TIME
I SCREWED UP IN SCHOOL.

284
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,385
I SWORE EVERY SINGLE TIME NOT TO
REPEAT MY MISTAKES...

285
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,554
AND I DID, ANYWAY.

286
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,290
YOU LEARN A LOT
ABOUT YOURSELF...

287
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,393
YOU LEARN THINGS THAT YOU WANTED
TO KNOW AND DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

288
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,329
AND IT DOESN'T GET EASIER EACH
TIME IT HAPPENS EITHER.

289
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,165
SO MOST OF US DON'T WANNA
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

290
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,038
[SHIROE, THINKING] OKAY, SO THIS
IS WHAT IT MEANS TO DIE HERE.

291
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:10,410
DEATH DOESN'T HAPPEN UNTIL YOU
ACTUALLY WANT TO DIE!

292
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:14,380
AND WELL, I CAN'T SAY I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT IT A FEW TIMES.

293
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,017
I REMEMBER THROWING ALL MY
PRECIOUS NOTEBOOKS AWAY ONCE...

294
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,586
OR JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME I SAID
GOODBYE TO MY FOLKS

295
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,387
WITH THAT FAKE SMILE OF MINE.

296
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,024
OR THE NIGHT WE PARTED
AT THE LIBRARY.

297
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:28,361
I GUESS THAT MEANS,
I'VE DIED A LOT ALREADY.

298
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,965
WHAT WAS DEMICAS THINKING WHEN
HE KICKED ME OUT OF THE WAY?

299
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,637
WHY DID WILLIAM SAY YES TO ME
WITHOUT HEARING ME OUT FIRST?

300
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,440
AND YOU WOULD THINK NAOTSUGU
WOULD'VE HAD BETTER SENSE

301
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,208
THAN TO FOLLOW ME HERE!

302
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,946
I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS,

303
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,048
NOT KNOWING WHERE I AM
OR WHAT I'M DOING.

304
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,084
THEY'RE JUST HANGING BY
A THREAD RIGHT NOW.

305
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,087
[MINORI]
THERE MIGHT BE A SPY FROM MINAMI

306
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,856
IN THE CITY SOMEWHERE.

307
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,090
A LEAK FROM ANY ONE OF US,

308
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,159
NO MATTER HOW "SMALL"
OR "HARMLESS,"

309
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,627
COULD CAUSE A PROBLEM.

310
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,095
[SHIROE]
THAT'S RIGHT.

311
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,065
[SHIROE, THINKING] HONESTLY,
IF THERE ARE SPIES FROM MINAMI,

312
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,967
THEY'RE THE LEAST
OF MY WORRIES.

313
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,302
SO FAR, I'VE ONLY SEEN

314
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,037
ADVENTURERS AND
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

315
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,106
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE HERE.

316
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,342
THERE'S AN UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY

317
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,580
THAT BROUGHT US TO THIS PLACE
FOR SOME REASON.

318
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,348
I'VE BEEN USING THE CONNECTIONS
OF THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE

319
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,785
TO SNOOP AROUND AND
FIND OUT THE REAL IDENTITY

320
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,054
OF THE PERSON OR
THING THAT DID IT.

321
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,524
I ASKED RODERICK TO INVESTIGATE
WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON

322
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,626
WITH FLAVOR TEXT IMBUING
OBJECTS WITH POWER.

323
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,061
AND I ASKED SOJIRO TO SEE IF
ANY OF THE MONSTERS

324
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,031
STARTED CHANGING BEHAVIOR.

325
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,433
I HAVE MICHITAKA EXAMINING
PLANTS TO THE SOUTH AND

326
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,235
KARASHIN IS COLLECTING
AND ASSEMBLING

327
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,738
A LIBRARY OF EASTAL'S FOLKTALES.

328
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,072
OF COURSE, ME BEING ME,

329
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,609
I NEVER REALLY TOLD THEM
WHY I WANTED IT DONE.

330
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,244
[SHIROE]
HMMM....

331
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,948
[SHIROE, THINKING]
AND AT LEAST, UP TO THIS POINT,

332
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,350
THERE'S NOTHING IN WHAT THEY'VE
GATHERED SO FAR THAT SHOWS US

333
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,253
THE FACE OF THE THIRD PARTY
I'M LOOKING FOR.

334
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,989
HOWEVER...

335
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,125
IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE
TOO COINCIDENTAL

336
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,993
THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTS IN THE DIRECTION.

337
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,630
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
SOMEONE PLANTED IT.

338
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,369
[SHIROE]
MPH...

339
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,705
[SHIROE, THINKING] I SUPPOSE
THAT'S JUST AN EXCUSE, RIGHT?

340
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,741
EVEN THOUGH I KEPT IT TO MYSELF
SO THEY WOULDN'T WORRY,

341
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,208
I'M STILL PUTTING EVERYONE OUT.

342
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,778
(SIGH) I'M NOT SURE
I DESERVE THEIR TRUST.

343
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,549
NAOTSUGU AND AKATSUKI
WAITED FOR ME BACK THEN,

344
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,651
AND NOW EVERYONE ELSE
IS WAITING FOR ME.

345
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,386
IT'S MY FAULT THERE'S
A DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

346
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,955
I SHOULD HAVE INVOLVED THEM MORE

347
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,690
AND TOLD THEM
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

348
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,324
AND THEN THERE WAS KINJO...

349
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,196
I DIDN'T TRUST HIM EITHER.
SO I KEPT MY THOUGHTS BURIED.

350
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,031
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
WHAT I WANTED

351
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,300
AND LET HIM HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

352
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,838
HMPH...

353
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,244
YEAH...

354
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,614
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

355
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,617
I SHOULD BE GETTING OUT
OF HERE, SHOULDN'T I?

356
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,322
YOU CAN ONLY SPEND SO MUCH TIME

357
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,158
HANGING OUT ON A BENCH
WITH YOURSELF.

358
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,437
UH? OH...

359
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,673
EARTH...

360
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:31,111
SO I'M GUESSING THIS
IS THE MOON, RIGHT?

361
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,185
MARE TRANQUILLITATIS?
THE "SEA OF TRANQUILLITY."

362
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,321
IT REALLY IS THE MOON!

363
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,224
SO WHAT AM I DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

364
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,860
WAS THIS REALLY THE TEST SERVER?

365
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,130
MANAGEMENT FOR THE ELDER TALES
GAME WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN

366
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,167
THIRTEEN SERVERS THAT COVERED
ALL OF THE REGIONS.

367
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,136
THE TEST SERVER IS NOT
OFFICIALLY INCLUDED

368
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,372
IN THE THIRTEEN, MAKING IT
THE FOURTEENTH SERVER.

369
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,274
[SHIROE] I KNOW SOMEONE
ON THE INTERNET

370
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,743
SAID IT WAS ON THE MOON,

371
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:05,211
BUT I NEVER BELIEVED THEM.

372
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,467
[SHIROE] I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS QUIET.

373
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,469
[AKATSUKI]
YEAH...

374
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,872
OH...

375
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,841
AH!

376
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,876
I THINK I...

377
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,745
I LOST PART OF MYSELF.

378
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,218
DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?
OR FEEL IT, MY LORD?

379
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:25,959
[SHIROE]
HERE, AKATSUKI.

380
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,694
YEAH, OKAY.

381
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,410
INCREDIBLE, ISN'T IT?

382
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,681
[AKATSUKI] LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

383
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:48,715
[SHIROE] YEAH.

384
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,450
[AKATSUKI]
THOSE ARE... THEY'RE MEMORIES?

385
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,218
[SHIROE]
EVERY TIME A PLAYER HAS DIED,

386
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,587
THEY'VE OFFERED A MEMORY

387
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,389
SO THEY COULD STAND UP
ONE MORE TIME.

388
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,927
SO I'M GUESSING YOU GOT
KILLED ON YOUR MISSION?

389
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,462
UH...?

390
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,365
[SHIROE] YEAH WELL... THE SAME
THING HAPPENED TO ME.

391
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,333
AND NOW WE'RE BOTH DEAD.

392
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,135
[AKATSUKI]
YOU TOO, MY LORD?

393
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,504
[SHIROE]
MM‐HM.

394
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,473
[AKATSUKI] THIS HAS TO BE

395
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,610
THE STRANGEST CHRISTMAS EVE
EVER, MY LORD. REALLY.

396
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:23,517
HUH? EH. EHEH...

397
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,054
[SHIROE]
I'VE COMPLETELY FAILED.

398
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,990
I DON'T THINK I
PLANNED WELL ENOUGH.

399
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,758
I DIDN'T TRUST ANYONE.

400
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,394
[AKATSUKI] I'M NOT REALLY SURE
I UNDERSTAND, MY LORD.

401
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,430
SOMEHOW I'M NOT ALL THAT
UPSET ABOUT LOSING MY BATTLE.

402
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:38,999
[SHIROE]
A MYRIAD OF THINGS

403
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,667
KEPT ME FROM DOING
WHAT I PLANNED TO DO.

404
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,637
AND IT WOUND UP
GETTING ME KILLED.

405
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,509
YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED OUT THERE
TONIGHT, AKATSUKI,

406
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,910
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS...

407
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,614
YOU STILL HAVEN'T LOST
YOUR FIGHT! NOT EVEN CLOSE.

408
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,751
IT'S OKAY.
I'M DISAPPOINTED, TOO.

409
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,853
BUT I KNOW YOU,
AND HOW HARD YOU WORK.

410
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:03,389
SO I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET UP AND FINISH THIS!

411
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,025
[SHIROE, THINKING]
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK...?

412
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,594
I THINK WE'VE BOTH GOTTA GET UP
AND TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT.

413
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,530
[SHIROE]
IT'S ALL SO STRANGE.

414
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,432
I NEVER IMAGINED I'D END UP
SEEING YOU OUT HERE LIKE THIS.

415
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,468
[AKATSUKI] HEH, YES, MY LORD.
IT IS STRANGE.

416
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,907
YOU KNOW, MY LORD?
I NEED TO GO BACK AGAIN.

417
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,443
I THINK I SHOULD GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT TOO,

418
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:25,679
AND USE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE.

419
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,081
[AKATSUKI]
SHALL WE?

420
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,083
MHM.

421
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,693
MPH...

422
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:44,064
[SHIROE, THINKING] AND THAT'S...
IS WHEN I CAME BACK TO LIFE.

423
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,824
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
RAW EMOTIONS ARE FULLY EXPOSED.

424
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,694
WHAT ELSE IS LEFT?
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

425
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,696
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE: NOTHING.

426
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,899
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS,
HE PUSHES FORWARD.

427
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,135
IT'S THE PATH HE CHOSE.
AND THERE IS NO WAY BACK.

428
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,604
HE WILL TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN

429
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,707
UNTIL HIS BANNER IS
PLANTED INTO THE SOIL.

430
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,176
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
