1
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,392
[SHIROE] WELL YEAH, THAT
CERTAINLY IS SURPRISING.

2
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:07,694
[NYANTA, VOICE CHAT] RUNNING
INTO KAZUHIKO LIKE THAT

3
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:10,597
WAS INDEED UNEXPECTED, HUH.

4
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:13,066
THIS TOWN HERE SEEMS TO HAVE
BECOME QUITE

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,269
THE NEXUS OF PLOTS
AND SCHEMES.

6
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,138
AND A LOT OF INNOCENT FOLKS
HAVE PAID THE PRICE.

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,308
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT] SO HOW ARE
MINORI AND THE OTHERS...?

8
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:24,278
[NYANTA] THEY'RE OUT OF DANGER,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN...

9
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,425
(ASTONISHED BREATHS)

10
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:36,576
(DISTRAUGHT)

11
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:42,216
(SNIFFLING AND CRYING)

12
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,227
MPH.

13
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,964
[TOYA, THINKING] HE WOULDN'T
LISTEN... HE JUST WOULDN'T!

14
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:00,900
[MINORI, THINKING] THE TOWN'S
IN RUINS... WE LOST...

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,737
[SERARA, THINKING] I SURE WASN'T
MUCH HELP OUT THERE...

16
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:05,372
I'M SORRY.

17
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:08,575
(EXHALE)

18
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,895
[ROE2] SO I GUESS THIS
IS THE ROAD TO IKOMA.

19
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,129
[MINORI] YEAH.

20
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,532
[SERARA] SO... IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GO?

21
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:34,501
[ROE2] THAT'S MY BEST
CHANCE FOR MAKING FRIENDS

22
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,935
WITH THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN.

23
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:39,739
OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS WHAT
THE FUTURE HOLDS, RIGHT?

24
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,741
[ROE2] OH, HANG ON...
[MINORI] HM?

25
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,610
[ROE2] I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR
YOUR...

26
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,144
TEACHER, I THINK YOU SAID.

27
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,181
I NEED YOU TO GIVE THIS TO HIM.

28
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:48,882
[MINORI] MASTER SHIROE?

29
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,284
YES.

30
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,818
BUT WAIT...

31
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,152
[ROE2] HMM?

32
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:54,488
[MINORI] OH...

33
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:55,789
I MEAN, UH,

34
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,357
SURE I'LL TAKE IT.

35
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:58,925
ALRIGHTY THEN,

36
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:00,960
IT'S TIME TO HIT THE ROAD.

37
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,829
IT'S A REALLY NICE DAY OUTSIDE.

38
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:05,365
MAYBE TOO NICE, IF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

39
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,033
[ROE2] UH...? OH?

40
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,374
WELL THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

41
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,443
(DISAPPOINTED SIGHS)

42
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,383
[ROE2] HEY GUYS, COULD YOU CALL
ME "BIG SISTER" ONCE MORE?

43
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:26,620
[SERARA, SNIFFLING] GOODBYE,
BIG SIS! I'LL MISS YOU!

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,988
[ROE2] OH, HEHE,
THAT FEELS GOOD!

45
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,624
[TOYA] BIG SISTER...

46
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,559
SISTER ROE2...

47
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,094
GOODBYE, BIG SIS.

48
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,232
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, BIG SIS.

49
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,033
MM‐HM!

50
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:42,536
[ROE2] WE'RE GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN,

51
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:46,540
MY LITTLE BROTHERS AND
SISTERS! I PROMISE!

52
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,278
[TOYA] HM. I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

53
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:54,113
[DARIELLA] AND NOW, I MUST GO
ALTHOUGH

54
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,950
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY GOODBYE.
[TOYA] OOH?

55
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,385
[DARIELLA] I'LL BE MEETING
UP WITH SOME PEOPLE I KNOW

56
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,754
IN SANAL AND FINISH
MY TRIP FROM THERE.

57
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:02,121
[TOYA]
UHH...

58
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:04,123
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU...

59
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,293
AND GET TO KNOW ALL OF YOU.

60
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:09,396
I REALLY DO HOPE WE CROSS
PATHS SOMETIME AGAIN.

61
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:13,400
[MINORI] YES... WE'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU TOO, DARIELLA.

62
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,369
[TOYA] UNGH.

63
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,437
HMPH.

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,490
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH JUST LETTING HER GO?

65
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,757
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

66
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,659
YOU KNOW, MISS DARIELLA?

67
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,660
YEAH, WELL...

68
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,995
MMM...

69
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,336
[TOYA] IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

70
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,305
[RUDY] ALL RIGHT...

71
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:56,410
ONE THING THOUGH, I
KNOW IT'S KINDA WEIRD...

72
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,812
HER HANDS, HER FINGERNAILS
WERE RAGGED...

73
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:01,548
LIKE SHE'S BEEN WORRIED
AND BITING THEM.

74
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:03,383
IS THAT SO?

75
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,757
[RUDY, THINKING] HE MUST HAVE
REALLY HAD AN EYE ON HER.

76
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:14,127
I GUESS THAT MEANS TOYA'S THE
ONLY ONE OF US TO REALLY NOTICE

77
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:18,232
SHE WAS HIDING SO MUCH PAIN
BEHIND THAT SMILE OF HERS.

78
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:19,899
SO TELL ME...

79
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,635
DO YOU BITE YOUR
FINGERNAILS TOO?

80
00:06:21,735 --> 00:06:25,905
HUH? WELL NOW THAT YOU MENTIONED
IT... NOT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

81
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,907
WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR IT.

82
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:29,743
YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

83
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:30,977
I'M PRETTY EASY TO TALK TO.

84
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,579
JUST SPIT IT OUT,
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

85
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,483
(LAUGHS) OH, TOYA...!
COMPANION OF MINE...

86
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,986
DON'T BE BASHFUL. YOU CAN ALWAYS
COME TO RUNDELLHAUS FOR ADVICE.

87
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,988
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT?

88
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,290
ROMANCE, OF COURSE!

89
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,359
HUH? (SNIGGERING)
DON'T THINK SO.

90
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,694
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING YOUR OWN
PROBLEMS LATELY, BUD.

91
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,128
THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

92
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,430
BUT I'M AWESOME!

93
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,499
(LAUGHING)

94
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,834
(LAUGHING TOGETHER)

95
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,109
[LOREILE] UH...

96
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,212
PRINCESS NUREHA! WELCOME BACK.

97
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,182
I WAS BEGINNING TO
WORRY ABOUT YOU.

98
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:23,730
(SIGH)

99
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,132
(HALF‐LAUGH)

100
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:31,104
(SHOUTING DIRECTIONS)

101
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:32,806
[ISUZU] DON'T YOU THINK
WE SHOULD GET IN THERE

102
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,241
AND HELP THEM OUT, GUYS?

103
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,743
[MINORI] MM‐HM... YEAH,
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.

104
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:39,213
WE COULD CERTAINLY HELP WITH
THE HEAVY LIFTING YOU KNOW?

105
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:42,115
[RUDY] NOW WAIT, WE'VE ALREADY
ACQUIRED OUR WYVERN HIDE,

106
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,918
BUT WE NEED TO GET THE
REST ON THE WAY BACK HOME.

107
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,453
WE DID WHAT WE SET
OUT TO DO HERE,

108
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,954
WE SHOULD REALLY GET GOING.

109
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,990
[TOYA] COME ON! WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE THE PLACE LIKE THIS.

110
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,459
[RUDY] THEY'RE FINE, TRUST ME!

111
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,961
REMEMBER THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT DESTINATION!

112
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,164
THEY'LL BE UP AND
RUNNING SOON ENOUGH!

113
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:59,499
WELL NOW, IT MIGHT BE OKAY.

114
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,501
IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE HANGING THEIR HEADS

115
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,569
OR ANYTHING.

116
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,538
[RUDY] THEY'RE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

117
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,540
THEY'RE USED TO
THIS SORT OF THING.

118
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,708
RUDY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'D BE A NICE THING

119
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,644
IF WE WENT OVER THERE
AND HELPED OUT...?

120
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:13,280
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY
COULD USE US, YOU KNOW?

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,749
OH NO! DON'T EVEN
WORRY ABOUT IT!

122
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,117
THEY'LL PROBABLY GET HELP
FROM A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

123
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,919
HOW DO I PUT THIS...?

124
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,256
IN THIS KINDA SITUATION,

125
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,324
IT CAN MAYBE GET A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE

126
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:26,125
WITH OUTSIDERS HANGING AROUND.
[SERARA] HMMM...

127
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:28,428
I DON'T KNOW... ARE
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

128
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,164
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

129
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,798
SHOULD BE TAKING CARE
OF THEIR OWN PROBLEMS?

130
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,568
LOOK CAN WE PLEASE JUST
LET IT GO? TRUST ME...

131
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,203
THEY CAN HANDLE IT ON THEIR OWN.

132
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,737
[ALL] OHHH...?

133
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,774
[TOYA] OKAY, I GUESS YOU WOULD
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

134
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,376
YEAH...

135
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,678
(STREET CHATTER)

136
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:48,948
[CAMUS] MY DEARS...! OUR MEETING
WAS FORETOLD IN THE STARS!

137
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:50,584
[GIRL A] UUHH...

138
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,752
WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE A PICKUP LINE?

139
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,355
[GIRL B] I THINK IT
WAS... SUPER CREEPY.

140
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:58,692
[CAMUS] MY HEART DANCES WITH
JOY! WON'T YOU BE MY BRIDE?

141
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,760
[AKATSUKI] SO WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO GET BURGERS TODAY?

142
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,029
OR WOULD YOU RATHER STOP
OFF FOR FRIED RICE BALLS?

143
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,864
[TETORA] OH, COME ONE! WE'RE NOT
GOING TO EAT THAT FATTY

144
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:06,300
JUNK AGAIN ARE WE?!

145
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,834
THAT'S CORRECT...

146
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,936
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO FOR DINNER...

147
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,605
IT'LL BE HERE BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT.

148
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,407
LOOK, I DON'T MIND
ORDERING FOOD

149
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,609
OR EATING OUT
SOMETIMES, BUUUTT...

150
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,344
IF NYANTA WERE HERE
COOKING FOR US,

151
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,579
I BET OUR DIETS WOULD
BE MUCH MORE BALANCED!

152
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,381
I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE PIMPLES!

153
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:23,217
A STARLET'S COMPLEXION
IS SO IMPORTANT,

154
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,485
THE UNIVERSE IS
DEPENDING ON MY BEAUTY!

155
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,222
WELL IF YOU HAVE ABILITY TO MAKE
UP NONSENSE, YOUR MAJESTY...

156
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,757
MAYBE PUT THAT CREATIVITY
INTO COOKING FOR YOURSELF.

157
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:33,092
I DUNNO. YOU DO
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

158
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:35,762
WHEN WE TRIED OUR HAND
IN THE KITCHEN, RIGHT?

159
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:37,564
(GIRLY SCREAM)

160
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:41,100
(FORCED CHUCKLING)

161
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,502
STARLETS SHOULDN'T
PREPARE ANYTHING

162
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,504
OTHER THAN PASTRIES AND SWEETS!

163
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:47,774
[NAOTSUGU] YOU ARE SUCH A LITTLE
SNOT! JEEZ! [MAN A] HEY!

164
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,075
[MAN A] OOF!

165
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,910
[NAOTSUGU]
DUDE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

166
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,146
SORRY MAN, I DIDN'T...

167
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:54,981
I DIDN'T HURT YOU, DID I?

168
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,951
NGH! NO, I'M FINE, OKAY?

169
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,254
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?
[GIRLS] UH...

170
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,522
THE POOR GUY, HE MUST
HAVE BEEN JEALOUS

171
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,258
OF HOW HAPPY
WE ARE TOGETHER!

172
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,959
ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, HONEY?!

173
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,694
YOU KNOW I GOTTA TELL YA,

174
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:09,363
I'VE BEEN SEEING
A LOT OF THAT...

175
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:11,798
PEOPLE SEEM ON EDGE
AND FRUSTRATED LATELY.

176
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:12,832
[TETORA] HUH?

177
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:14,768
YEAH, I'VE SEEN IT, TOO.

178
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,204
IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN
WE FIRST GOT HERE.

179
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,473
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE LIKE THAT.

180
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:23,109
EVERYONE WAS LOST AND CONFUSED
AND AS A RESULT,

181
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,580
PEOPLE FELL APART AND GOT DOWN.
THERE WAS MASS DEPRESSION.

182
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,549
HEY! DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE.

183
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,553
YEAH, LOOK! THOSE PEOPLE OVER
THERE SEEM PRETTY GIDDY TO ME!

184
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,423
(GIGGLES)

185
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:39,092
SEE HOW HAPPY THEY ARE. COME ON!

186
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:42,362
YEAH! NAOTSUGU SAYS HE ONLY
LIKES TO THINK OF PANTIES,

187
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:43,730
BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE

188
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,599
YOU'RE A BIG OL' TEDDY
BEAR! AREN'TCHA BOY?!

189
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,133
[NAOTSUGU] WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[TETORA] PANTIES.

190
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,768
COME ON! WHAT WAS THAT?!

191
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,238
THAT'S A HUGE DOUBLE STANDARD
IF SHE GET TO SAY PANTI‐

192
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:52,939
ARRRGGH!

193
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,343
[NAOTSUGU, STRAINING]
BUT SHE SAID IT TOO!

194
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:59,413
MY FREAKIN' JAW...
THAT HURT! HUH?

195
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,982
[NAOTSUGU, THINKING] YOU THINK
WE'RE "EXAGGERATING," HUH?

196
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,318
WELL I HOPE SO.

197
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:06,486
BUT IF THIS SAME KIND
OF MASS DEPRESSION

198
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:08,855
IS SPREADING THROUGH
AKIHABARA RIGHT NOW,

199
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,591
THEN IT MIGHT BE EVEN
WORSE THAN LAST TIME.

200
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,561
WE COULD BE IN REAL TROUBLE.

201
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,972
THEN DON'T STAND THERE AND
LECTURE ME ABOUT OTHER

202
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:29,476
PEOPLE'S WARS WHEN THEY'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US!

203
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,111
THEY TAKE SOMETHING FROM
ME, I TAKE FROM THEM.

204
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,547
IT'S AN EVEN TRADE.

205
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,282
[SHIROE, THINKING]
LONDARK'S TOUGH.

206
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,351
BUT I GUESS EVERYONE
HAS THEIR LIMITS.

207
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:38,752
MORE AND MORE OF US
ARE STARTING TO FEEL

208
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,387
LIKE WE'RE VICTIMS IN ALL THIS.

209
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:43,190
PEOPLE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS
ADJUSTING TO THIS WORLD.

210
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,660
[EINS] OUR SOCIETY IS FAVORING
CERTAIN PEOPLE OVER OTHERS.

211
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,530
THE RICH STAY RICH,
AND THE POOR STARVE.

212
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,499
[SHIROE, THINKING]
SO NOW WE HAVE ADVENTURERS

213
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,033
ACTUALLY JOINING UP WITH PEOPLE
OF THE LAND

214
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,602
WHO WANT TO GO TO WAR.

215
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:58,438
SOMETIMES, THEY'RE EVEN
INSTIGATING IT.

216
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:01,441
UH... THIS ISN'T GOOD.

217
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,711
[SHIROE, THINKING] I THOUGHT
IT WOULD NEVER COME TO THAT.

218
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,513
AT LEAST, NOT FROM THE
ADVENTURER SIDE

219
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,282
OF THINGS ANYWAY.

220
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,450
AND IF THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND DO GET INVOLVED,

221
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,353
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

222
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,022
WAR IS A MUCH MORE
FAMILIAR THING TO THEM.

223
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:19,893
MOST OF US WERE BORN IN A
PEACEFUL AND ORGANIZED JAPAN.

224
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:23,197
AND IF ALL THOSE DIFFERENT
FACTIONS WERE TO GO TO WAR,

225
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:27,867
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT
THINGS, AND KEEP OUR DISTANCE?

226
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,671
[SHIROE] OH MAN, WHY THE HELL
CAN'T THIS JUST BE A QUEST?!

227
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,540
(SIGH) GIVE ME A
BUNCH OF MONSTERS

228
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,109
OR A RAID BOSS TO FIGHT
AGAINST ANY DAY!

229
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,747
[SHIROE, THINKING] SO IF WAR
BREAKS OUT AMONG ADVENTURERS

230
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,616
OR WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

231
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:45,885
WHAT CAN THE ROUND TABLE
CONFERENCE DO ABOUT IT?

232
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,655
WE'RE IN PRETTY LOUSY
SHAPE RIGHT NOW.

233
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,458
WE'RE STILL HAVING A HARD TIME
WITHOUT KRUSTY.

234
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:53,126
I JUST HOPE WE GET SOMETHING
POSITIVE OUT

235
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:55,094
OF ISAAC'S TRAINING PROGRAM.

236
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,964
(HEAVY BREATHING)

237
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:02,936
[ISAAC] COME ON! GET THE
LEAD OUT, YOU PANSIES!

238
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,538
THIS IS RIDICULOUS,

239
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,540
A LITTLE BIT OF TRAINING
AND THEY'RE GIVING UP.

240
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,508
[REZARICK] NOT SURE
IT CAN'T BE HELPED...

241
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:09,643
PEOPLE OF THE LAND JUST DON'T

242
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,178
HAVE A LOT OF
STAMINA TO SPEAK OF.

243
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,413
THIS SUCKS.
VILLAIN IN GLASSES,

244
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:16,316
YOU'RE WASTING OUR
TIME ON THIS‐! HUH?

245
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,418
HEY! REZARICK,
KEEP AN EYE OUT!

246
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:19,686
[REZARICK] MISTER ISAAC?

247
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:24,424
[ITHERUS] MASTER ISAAC!

248
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:25,725
[REZARICK] HM...

249
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:30,930
[ITHERUS] HUH? OH...
MASTER ISAAC...

250
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:35,535
[NAZNA] SO DO WE KNOW EXACTLY
WHY SARA WAS KIDNAPPED?

251
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:37,103
[KAWARA] PROBABLY BECAUSE HE
WANTED TO GET BACK AT US

252
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,405
FOR BEING REJECTED.

253
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,739
[NAZNA]
WHO IS HE ANYWAY?

254
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,341
[OLIVE]
HIS NAME'S CAMUS...

255
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,942
HE'S A COMPLETE SCUMBAG.

256
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,212
HE'S A PERSON OF THE
LAND AND A MERCHANT...

257
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:48,815
BUT THE THING IS, HE HITS
ON EVERY GIRL HE'S RUN INTO!

258
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,350
[DOLCHE] YOU CAN'T
BE FOR SERIOUS!

259
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,085
THAT LITTLE MINX HASN'T
HIT ON ME YET!

260
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,153
[OLIVE] OH... HEH, SORRY?

261
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,756
ANYWAY, HE TRIED TO HIT
ON ALL OF US EARLIER.

262
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,358
[CAMUS] HEY LADIES...
[GIRLS] HM?

263
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,560
OUR MEETING IS A
BLESSING FROM HEAVEN...

264
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,562
WON'T YOU PLEASE BE MY BRIDES?

265
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:05,232
(CAMUS LAUGHING)
[ALL] UH... GUH‐ROSS!

266
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:09,203
[KAWARA] NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE
RAN AWAY FROM OLD CREEPY‐PANTS.

267
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,037
[ISAMI] APPARENTLY HE GOT
REJECTED BY ANOTHER GIRL

268
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:14,674
IN OUR BRIGADE. THE WHOLE
THING'S A REVENGE PLAY.

269
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,910
[KURINON] THERE'S THAT
PIECE‐A‐CRAP RIGHT THERE!

270
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,811
MPH...

271
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:18,412
MM.

272
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,112
EH?

273
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:20,247
DEAD MEAT!

274
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:28,555
SOMETHING'S STRANGE...
SARA SEEMS OFF.

275
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:32,359
SHE WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD
WITH A LOSER LIKE THAT.

276
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,228
[DOLCHE] THIS IS SARA
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

277
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:37,331
[KURINON] WHATEVER! I AM
GONNA GO KICK HIS ASS! HEY!

278
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:38,465
[NAZNA] WAIT,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?!

279
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:39,733
(PANTING)

280
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,401
YOU BETTER GET AWAY
FROM HER RIGHT NOW

281
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,069
OR I'M GONNA TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF!

282
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,640
OUR MEETING TODAY WAS
FORETOLD IN THE STARS!

283
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,243
[KURINON] OH YOU'RE GONNA
SEE STARS ALL RIGHT! HWAA!

284
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,810
GUH!

285
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:52,946
OOOH...

286
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,013
WHAT?

287
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:55,315
WHAT A TOOL.

288
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:56,583
MARRIAGE GENIUS?

289
00:14:56,683 --> 00:14:58,385
[NAZNA] GOTCHA, SARA!
[DOLCHE] SARA‐GIRL?!

290
00:14:58,485 --> 00:14:59,653
[NAZNA] SHE'LL BE OKAY...

291
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,855
BUT SHE'S GONNA BE OUT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

292
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,657
[CAMUS] HEH...

293
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:06,025
WOULD YOU... WOULD
YOU BE MY BRIDE?

294
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,497
GAH, I AM GOING TO PUNCH A HOLE
RIGHT IN YOUR DUMB STUPID FACE!

295
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:11,665
HUH?

296
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,234
(GROWLING)

297
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,907
WOULD YOU PLEASE
BE MINE FOREVER...

298
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:26,380
[KURINON] YES... PLEASE
MAKE ME... YOURS.

299
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,615
NO WAY! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

300
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,717
[SOJIRO] STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
[ALL] HUH?

301
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,853
[SOJIRO] HE'S USING SOME
KIND OF SEDUCTION SKILL!

302
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:36,523
[NAZNA] HEY, SOJI!
[DOLCHE] HEY BABY!

303
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:39,359
IT'S THINGS LIKE THIS
THAT ARE MAKING ME WONDER

304
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:44,298
IF IT WAS A MISTAKE TO SHUT DOWN
THE CITY'S MAGIC CIRCLE. HW‐AH.

305
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:47,934
YOU DECEIVE MY GIRLS... THEN
YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER TO ME.

306
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:52,206
EHEH... OUR MEETING IS
A BLESSING FROM HEAVEN,

307
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,540
WON'T YOU PLEASE BE MY BRIDE?

308
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,942
[SOJIRO] HUH?
[ALL] UH?

309
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,316
(SCOLDING AND HITTING)

310
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,019
[DOLCHE] YOU DIRTY LITTLE BOY, I
BET YOU LIKE THIS DON'T YOU?!

311
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,455
[SERARA] ALL OF THIS
SURE IS HEAVY, HUH?

312
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:12,659
IT'S KINDA A SHAME WE DON'T HAVE
A MAGIC BAG TO CARRY IT ALL.

313
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,929
WELL, MAYBE WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO EARN THAT NEXT.

314
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,931
MPH...

315
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:20,467
[MINORI] YOU DID A GOOD THING
BACK THERE, TOYA. [TOYA] HUH?

316
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,203
WITH THE KNIGHT WHO
KEPT WANTING TO DIE?

317
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:26,039
[TOYA] THERE'S MORE TO
THAT AND YOU KNOW IT!

318
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,608
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
ABLE TO SEE THAT!

319
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,246
MISTER, LIFE IS WHAT
YOU MAKE OF IT.

320
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:37,184
YOU CAN BE ALIVE, BUT DEAD
INSIDE. YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE!

321
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:40,587
S'NOT EASY TO TELL SOMEONE
WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR.

322
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:43,323
I DUNNO... I DON'T
THINK IT HELPED.

323
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:46,059
[SERARA] I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE AT ALL, TOYA!

324
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,896
[SERARA] OK, MAYBE HE DIDN'T GET
IT THEN, BUT YOU STILL SAID IT.

325
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,265
AND THE NEXT TIME HE FIGHTS,

326
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:53,333
HE'S GONNA THINK
TWICE, I PROMISE.

327
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,534
[TOYA]
HUH?

328
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,603
YOU GUYS WERE REALLY
GOOD OUT THERE.

329
00:16:56,703 --> 00:17:00,874
MINORI WAS, TOYA
WAS, ISUZU, TOO...

330
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:04,110
UH... AND RUDY...
I GUESS...

331
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:07,046
I MEAN... I CAN SEE
EVERYONE GETTING BETTER.

332
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:08,782
YOU WERE PRETTY
GROWN UP YOURSELF.

333
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:12,051
(EXHALE) IF THERE'S ONE
THING I'VE LEARNED,

334
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:17,291
I REALLY NEED TO FOCUS
ON DOING SOME GROWING UP.

335
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,860
IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD THAT I
REALIZED THAT, YOU KNOW?

336
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:27,000
[RUDY]
OOF. WHEW!

337
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,369
UH... WE'RE WALKING THE REST
OF THE WAY HOME.

338
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,471
MISS ISUZU, WILL YOU BE OKAY?

339
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,007
[ISUZU] OOF! YEAH,
I'LL BE FINE.

340
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,210
IT'S NOT AS FAR AWAY AS I
THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE,

341
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,444
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.

342
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,582
HMM. HEY, I HAVE A GREAT
IDEA...

343
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,983
ALL OF THIS STUFF,

344
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,919
MAYBE WE COULD GIVE IT TO
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

345
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,722
YEAH, IT BEATS THROWING
IT AWAY I GUESS.

346
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:51,425
[ISUZU] OH! UH...
[RUDY] HM?

347
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:53,927
[WOMAN A] I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

348
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:55,895
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
HERE TO PROTECT US.

349
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,332
[WOMAN B]
I KNOW, RIGHT? GIMME A BREAK.

350
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:00,667
I MEAN THEY'RE THE ONES WITH
ALL THE SPECIAL WEAPONS.

351
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,936
[WOMAN A] YEAH, I GUESS WE'LL
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.

352
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,372
[WOMAN B] THANKS A
LOT, ADVENTURERS.

353
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,041
UH, NO... IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK...!

354
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:10,644
I MEAN... THEY WEREN'T
TALKING ABOUT YOU!

355
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,412
[ISUZU] YEAH, I GET IT.

356
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:16,316
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE KNIGHTS... BUT STILL...

357
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,417
[RUDY] UH...

358
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:20,354
GUESS I KNOW WHY YOU
WANTED TO LEAVE...

359
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:22,322
YOU KNEW THE PEOPLE OF
THE LAND WEREN'T GONNA LIKE

360
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,791
A BUNCH OF ADVENTURERS
AROUND ALL THE TIME.

361
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:27,827
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAVED,

362
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,363
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE
ODYSSEY KNIGHTS KEPT

363
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,665
SACRIFICING THEMSELVES.

364
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,167
NOW, I'M SURE THE PEOPLE HERE

365
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,001
THOUGHT THE KNIGHTS WERE GONNA
LEAVE THIS PLACE

366
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,337
BETTER THAN THEY FOUND IT,
BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

367
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,539
[ISUZU] AND SINCE WE WERE
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT, TOO,

368
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,741
THEY PROBABLY ANGRY WITH US
SINCE WE'RE ADVENTURERS,

369
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,310
JUST LIKE THE KNIGHTS ARE.

370
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,845
[RUDY] YEAH... I'M SORRY.

371
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:49,949
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THEM, RUDY.

372
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,451
APART FROM THE FIGHT...

373
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,653
COMING TO THIS TOWN GAVE ME
A NEW PERSPECTIVE

374
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:55,255
ON A LOT OF THINGS.

375
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:56,990
ALL THAT STUFF I WAS
WORRYING ABOUT...

376
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,858
ENDED UP BEING PRETTY
INSIGNIFICANT

377
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,194
ONCE I THOUGHT IT OVER.

378
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:01,961
(RUDY EXHALES)
[ISUZU] I GUESS THAT'S WHY

379
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,431
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR
THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN...

380
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,667
Y'KNOW, SOMETHING THAT WOULD
HAVE A LASTING EFFECT ON THEM.

381
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,770
WELL, YOU WENT AND CREATED
NUMBER 43,

382
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,072
AND THEY GOT TO BE THE FIRST
PEOPLE TO HEAR A SONG

383
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,108
THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE.

384
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,910
AND IT MEANS SO MUCH MORE.

385
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,380
AT IT'S CORE IS HOPE...!
HOPE ITSELF!

386
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,416
WELL THANKS FOR THAT, RUDY.

387
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,050
BUT I DON'T KNOW

388
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,052
IF THAT'LL DO MUCH GOOD...

389
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:29,989
[RUDY] HMPH...

390
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,229
(BREATH)

391
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,801
[ISUZU] THIS IS
IT... WE'RE DONE.

392
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,170
[MINORI] YEAH, WE ARE...

393
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:44,704
(BREATH)

394
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:45,872
[ISUZU] OH...!
(DISTANT SINGING)

395
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,375
[RUDY]
HUH? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

396
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:50,744
YOU HEAR IT...

397
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:51,911
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

398
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:53,747
YEAH, I HEAR IT...!
IT'S YOUR SONG!

399
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:54,881
(CONFUSED)

400
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,983
[ISUZU] OH...!

401
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,356
OH?

402
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,724
[BOY A]
GOOD JOB! (GIGGLE)

403
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:05,959
[GIRL C]
AGAIN!

404
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,494
THE KIDS ARE SINGING IT!
(KIDS SINGING)

405
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:10,464
[RUDY] THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE
DONE, IT'S A GOOD THING.

406
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,598
[ISUZU]
UH...!

407
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,502
YOU GAVE THEIR LIVES
A BRAND NEW SONG.

408
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:19,206
AND THAT... THAT SONG WILL GIVE
ALL THE KIDS AROUND HERE A LOT

409
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:21,508
OF HOPE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
(KIDS GIGGLING)

410
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,478
(ISUZU EXHALES)

411
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:26,045
(HAPPY SOB)

412
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:26,580
HM?

413
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,582
(SOB) OH...?

414
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,517
THANK YOU.

415
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,287
(BLOWS NOSE)
[RUDY] AH...!

416
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,056
(SINGING CONTINUES)
[TOYA] EVERYBODY'S JOINING IN!

417
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:39,593
THEY'RE SINGING IT
OVER HERE, TOO!

418
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,229
[MINORI] THEY REMEMBER IT.

419
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,030
IT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE
GOING TO KEEP WITH THEM.

420
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,532
[SERARA] OH WOW...
[WORKER] NICE WORK!

421
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,501
[SERARA] THIS IS SO AMAZING!
[WORKER] KEEP IT UP GUYS!

422
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,002
[TOYA]
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

423
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:50,870
IT'S GONNA SPREAD AROUND.

424
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,241
AND GO WEST. AND EVENTUALLY,
ALL OVER THE WORLD!

425
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,775
[RUDY, THINKING]
AND THE BEST PART IS

426
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,277
THE FACT THAT WHEN IT SPREADS,

427
00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:00,380
IT'S GONNA GIVE EVERYONE ELSE
OUT THERE SOME HOPE, TOO!

428
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,648
HMPH...

429
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:12,192
(HUMMING)

430
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:17,431
(GRIFFON CRYING OUT)
[ALL] HUH?

431
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,299
[TOYA]
A GRIFFON?!

432
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,369
[NYANTA]
GOOD EVENING.

433
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:24,371
NYANTA! (GASP)

434
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:25,439
(LAUGH, RUNNING)

435
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,640
[TOYA]
HEY, CHIEF!

436
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,874
[MINORI]
CHIEF NYANTA!

437
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,443
(LAUGHS)

438
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,610
[ISUZU]
CHIEF!

439
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,711
(LAUGHS)

440
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,216
[MINORI, VOICEOVER] GETTING BACK
TO THE CITY WAS REALLY GREAT.

441
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:39,085
EVERYONE WAS THERE AND
WELCOMED US BACK.

442
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,320
AND AFTER ALL, WE'D BEEN THROUGH

443
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,557
IT MADE US FEEL SO
WANTED AND HAPPY.

444
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:46,125
IT WAS LIKE A GIANT WEIGHT
HAD BEEN LIFTED.

445
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:49,296
I FELT RELIEVED.
I COULD BREATH AGAIN.

446
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:52,232
ALL THE TENSION OF THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS DISAPPEARED,

447
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,501
NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

448
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:57,804
[ALL] CHEERS!
(LAUGHING AND GIGGLING)

449
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,906
[SHIROE] OH, IT'S GREAT TO SEE
YOU GUYS AGAIN. (LAUGHING)

450
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,841
[ISUZU] I'M SO GLAD TO BE BACK!

451
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:04,478
[SHIROE]
TELL US, WHAT HAPPENED?

452
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:06,112
[MINORI, THINKING] AHH...
EVERYONE HERE HAS

453
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:07,647
ALWAYS BEEN THERE TO PROTECT US

454
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:09,883
FROM ANYTHING THAT CAME OUR WAY.

455
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,651
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN
THOUGH WE'VE LEARNED

456
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,353
WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES,

457
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:17,191
THEY'LL STILL BE HERE. AND
THEY STILL LOOK OUT FOR US.

458
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:21,395
WE CELEBRATED A LONG
TIME THAT NIGHT,

459
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:24,531
AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN
WE ACTUALLY GOT TO BED.

460
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:29,336
BUT ONE THING I DO REMEMBER,
ROE2 CAME TO ME IN A DREAM.

461
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:34,174
AND EVEN THERE, SHE
WAS STILL A MYSTERY.

462
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,715
(SIGH)

463
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,478
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] MYSTERIOUS
MONSTERS HAVE INFILTRATED

464
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:21,481
AKIHABARA AND ARE PLUNGING
PEOPLE INTO CHAOS.

465
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,318
THE GENIUSES. WHAT
ARE THEY, EXACTLY?

466
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:26,586
ROE2'S LETTER HOLDS THE KEY.

467
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,955
AND IN SPITE OF ALL
HIS INVESTIGATIONS,

468
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:31,391
SHIROE NEVER ANTICIPATED
THEIR ARRIVAL.

469
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,660
THERE ARE PEOPLE OF
THE LAND, ADVENTURERS,

470
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,229
AND NOW... SOMETHING ELSE.

471
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,864
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES
ARE ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
