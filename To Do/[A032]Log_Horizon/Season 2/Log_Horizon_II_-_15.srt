00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:23,957
[ISUZU]
HM?

00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,692

HM?

00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,263
[SERARA]
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER

10
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,032
IF MINORI WAS HERE, YOU KNOW?

11
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,433
SHE WANTED TO
COME OUT TONIGHT...

12
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,468
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
SHE HAD TO WORK.

13
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,706
MISS MINORI IS TURNING OUT TO BE
QUITE THE WORKING GIRL NOWADAYS.

14
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,976
DON'T CALL HER THAT, RUDY...
IT MEANS SOMETHIN' ELSE.

15
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,849

[RUDY]
(LAUGHING) HM?

17
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,689
MISS ISUZU, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE DOWN.

18
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,927
UH...? MM‐MM! I'M FINE!
I AM VERY EXCITED!

19
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,629
[EXHALE] ARE
YOU SURE?

20
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,563
YEAH!

21
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,431
YOU WERE WONDERFUL TONIGHT!

22
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:55,168
REALLY! IT WAS LIKE
LISTENING TO A REAL PRO!

23
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,603
C'MON, SERARA!

24
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,572
THE MANAGER WAS HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU TONIGHT!

25
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,207
HE WAS TOTALLY PATTING HIMSELF
ON THE BACK FOR FINDING YOU!

26
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,976
IT ISN'T THAT BIG OF
A DEAL, TOYA!

27
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,946
HE'S GONNA HAVE ME IN ONE
NIGHT A WEEK AND THAT'S IT!

28
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,782
ALL I'M REALLY DOING ARE
COVERS OF STUFF ANYWAY.

29
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,351
WELL EVERYBODY IN THERE
CERTAINLY ENJOYED IT.

30
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,919
YOU WERE JAMMIN', LITTLE LADY.

31
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,422
MISS ISUZU! YOUR PLAYING IS
BREATHTAKING AND INSPIRING

32
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,859
LIKE THE GREATEST MUSES OF OLD.

33
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
GIVE IT A REST, WILLYA?

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,928
WE BOTH KNOW I'M
NOT ALL THAT GREAT.

35
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,565
WE JUST ALWAYS HAD INSTRUMENTS
LYING AROUND THE HOUSE,

36
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,399
AND I'D PICK 'EM UP AND PLAY.

37
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,435
YOUR EXQUISITE MELODIES
ENRICHED THE CITY NIGHT!

38
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,505
AND YOUR VOICE
LIFTED MANY HEARTS...

39
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,040
BIRDS AND BEASTS ALIKE
WERE MADE HAPPY.

40
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,475
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

41
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:39,245
[ISUZU, ANNOYED] DIDN'T I SAY
TO KNOCK IT OFF RUDY?

42
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,948
HEY! WHY CAN'T I SAY HOW
MAGNIFICENT YOU ARE,

43
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,249
IT IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH?!

44
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,752
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN YOUR DUMB MOUTH!

45
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,588
[ISUZU] GET BACK HERE
SO I CAN HIT YOU!

46
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,555
[RUDY]
AH! I'M PAYING YOU A COMPLIMENT.

47
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,923
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

48
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,193
ON A QUEST?

49
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,895
YEAH, TOYA AND
THE OTHER YOUNG ONES

50
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,462
NEED TO GAIN
SOME EXPERIENCE.

51
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,364
I'D ALSO LIKE TO HAVE
SERARA GO WITH THEM

52
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,266
SO THEY'LL HAVE
ANOTHER HEALER.

53
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,635
IF SHE WANTS TO
GO WITH THEM

54
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,870
I'M PERFECTLY FINE
WITH LETTING HER GO.

55
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,006
WHAT'S THE QUEST FOR?

56
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,073
RIGHT THERE.

57
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,475
[MARIELLE]
HUH? THE MAGIC BAG?

58
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,879
YEP, NONE OTHER THAN
DAZANEGG'S SATCHEL.

59
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,381
THEIR QUEST IS TO FIND THE
PIECES AND PUT THEM TOGETHER.

60
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,918
OH! I TOTALLY REMEMBER THAT ONE.

61
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,921
COOL. YOU HUNT DOWN A WYVERN
FOR ITS LEATHER.

62
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,456
[SHIROE] EXACTLY! AND ALL
OUR JUNIOR MEMBERS

63
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,393
ARE OVER THE MINIMUM LEVEL
TO TAKE THE QUEST.

64
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,831
OH YEAH! THEY'RE ALREADY
LEVEL 45! HOW EXCITING!

65
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,799
MM‐HM. TOYA'S BEEN
ASKING ABOUT IT.

66
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,601
AND LET'S JUST SAY
HE HASN'T BEEN

67
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,737
WHAT I'D CALL "SUBTLE" EITHER.
SO HERE WE GO.

68
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,706
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW.
IT IS THE MAGIC BAG!

69
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,543
YOU CAN CARRY ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING!

70
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,445
[SHIROE] WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S JUST THE BAG THEY WANT.

71
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,147
THEY'VE BEEN HERE
ALL THIS TIME

72
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,749
AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T HAD
THE CHANCE TO GO OUT AND

73
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,417
COMPLETE ANY OF THE
LARGER QUESTS.

74
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,987
D'YOU... DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL BE OKAY?

75
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,422
YOU MIGHT BE ASKING A LOT.

76
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:57,824
[BOTH]
HUH?

77
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,492
[MINORI]
EXCUSE ME!

78
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,263
[MINORI] THOUGHT YOU
COULD USE A REFRESHMENT.

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,731
WOW! THANK YOU!

80
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,367
SO, YOU'RE ALREADY DONE WITH
YOUR WORK? THAT WAS FAST.

81
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,035
YEAH!

82
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,606
THANKS A LOT. ACTUALLY
THAT WORKS OUT PERFECTLY.

83
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,074
HUH?

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,586
(EXHALES)

85
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,722
[ISUZU, THINKING]
IT'S REALLY NICE FOR EVERYONE

86
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,891
TO SAY ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT ME...

87
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,528
MUSIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A
BIG PART OF MY LIFE, BUT...

88
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,864
I MEAN, I'M GLAD NO ONE
EVER SAID I WAS BAD,

89
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,033
BUT NO ONE'S GONE
SO FAR OUT OF THEIR WAY

90
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,236
TO GIVE ME A COMPLIMENT, EITHER.

91
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,440
SURE, I MEAN I HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO BECOME A PRO LIKE DAD,

92
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,275
BUT IT WOULDN'T HURT
IF I PLAYED FOR FUN

93
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,778
FROM TIME TO TIME, WOULD IT?

94
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,688
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY
ALL ENJOYED THE SHOW!

95
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,123
[TOYA]
WOW, SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE

96
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,257
THEY'VE BEEN UP TO NO GOOD, HMM?

97
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,158
[ISUZU]
EHHHH!

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,159
[TOYA]
EHEHEHEH!

99
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,393
(GASP) WAIT WHAT?!

100
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,662
AM I REALLY STILL SMILING?!

101
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,363
[TOYA]
IT'S ALL OVER YOUR FACE!

102
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,165
YOU MUST'VE REALLY
ENJOYED YOURSELF.

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,333
YOU SOUNDED REALLY GOOD.

104
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,036
MMMM... THANKS...

105
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,771
HMFPH! IT WAS GREAT!

106
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,773
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
IN MY WILDEST DREAMS

107
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,509
I'D GET TO GO UP ON STAGE
AND LAY DOWN SOME BEATS!

108
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,711
YOU WERE REALLY
GOOD AT IT!

109
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,046
WHATEVER!

110
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,280
SERIOUSLY,

111
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,049
THE BARD CLASS
IS AMAZING TO ME!

112
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,519
I MEAN ABOUT IT, ALL I HAD
TO DO IS BE IN YOUR AURA

113
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,720
AND RIGHT THEN AND THERE

114
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,556
I SUDDENLY KNEW
HOW TO PLAY THE DRUMS.

115
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,457
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

116
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,259
IT WON'T WORK IF YOU
DON'T ALREADY HAVE

117
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,627
SOME KIND OF TALENT.

118
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,764
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
JUST ASK RUDY.

119
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,798
BO‐BA‐PFFT!

120
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,033
CHECK IT OUT!
I'M GETTING BETTER, RIGHT!

121
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,936
[RUDY] WHADDYA THINK?!
GETTIN' FUNKY NOW!

122
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,705
[RUDY] AHHH! OH GOD!
(TOYA LAUGHS)

123
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,007
I'M SORRY, SOMEBODY HELP ME!
[TOYA] OH WELL, NICE TRY RUDY.

124
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,309
SO I... I SUPPOSE

125
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,544
THAT MEANS YOU MUST HAVE

126
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,179
A REALLY GOOD EAR
FOR MUSIC, HUH, ISUZU?

127
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,547
UUUH NO, NOT NECESSARILY!

128
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,549
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS SORTA THING

129
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,884
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID.

130
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,752
[TOYA] I GET IT...
[ISUZU] UH?

131
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,521
[TOYA]
I PLAYED SOCCER. A LOT.

132
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,890
I PRACTICED ALL THE TIME.

133
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,225
BUT THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS EVER
GONNA BE BETTER THAN THE GUYS

134
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,994
WHO JUST HAD THE KNACK FOR IT.

135
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:18,599
YOU CAN TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S A
NATURAL, EVEN WHEN HE'S A KID.

136
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,001
BUT YOU KNOW,

137
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,470
I STILL HAD FUN PLAYING EVEN
THOUGH I WASN'T ALL THAT GOOD.

138
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,806
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
STILL HAVING FUN

139
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,307
PLAYING YOUR MUSIC, AREN'T YOU?

140
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,311
UUUH...? MM‐HM.

141
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,813
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

142
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,914
MM‐HM.

143
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,749
SO IF YOU GET A CHANCE
TO PLAY OUT THERE,

144
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,017
WHAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM?

145
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,685
OH...

146
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,888
(ISUZU EXHALES)

147
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,859
I WAS JUST THINKING...

148
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,461
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE AFTER
WE GOT SAVED FROM HAMELIN?

149
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,897
[TOYA] HUH?

150
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,166
[ISUZU] I'D BEEN WITH
CRESCENT MOON FOR QUITE A WHILE.

151
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,270
AND THEN, YOU AND ME AND MINORI
ALL JOINED LOG HORIZON

152
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,239
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

153
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,775
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

154
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,409
I SUDDENLY HAD MY FREEDOM,

155
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,013
AND I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS GONNA DO WITH MYSELF.

156
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,153
IT WASN'T LONG AFTER THAT,
I FOUND THIS LUTE.

157
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,454
IT WAS JUST SITTING THERE.

158
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,790
IT WAS ENGRAVED WITH A
MOTHER‐OF‐PEARL DESIGN

159
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,259
THAT FOR SOME REASON,
REMINDED ME OF A DOLPHIN.

160
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,894
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!

161
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,163
IT TURNS OUT THAT MARIELLE
MADE IT A LONG TIME AGO,

162
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,299
SO I ASKED IF SHE WOULDN'T
MIND GIVING IT TO ME.

163
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,672
IT MODIFIED IT
A COUPLE TIMES MYSELF...

164
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,306
IT'S LIKE MY BABY...

165
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,142
MY ONE AND ONLY,
MY FLYING DOLPHIN.

166
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,580
THIS INSTRUMENT OF MINE,
IT'S ALL I REALLY NEED.

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,183
IT MOTIVATES ME TO KEEP PLAYING.

168
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:47,087
AND PLAYING, IN TIMES LIKE
THESE, IS A REAL BLESSING.

169
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,589
MPH.

170
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,326
[MINORI] TOYA! ISUZU!

THOSE ARE THE REDSTONE MOUNTAINS
AROUND NAGANO, AREN'T THEY?!

179
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,888
THERE'RE GONNA BE ALL KINDS OF
MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND FORESTS!

00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,691
ON TOP OF THAT, WE'RE GONNA

TRAVELING HAVEN'T YOU RUDY?!

190
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,112
YES! WHILE IT WAS TRUE
I TRAVELED WITH AN ADVENTURER

I CAN'T MAINTAIN MY
INCREDIBLENESS

198
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,695
WITHOUT MY DIVINE COIFFURE!

199
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,030

I THINK THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT US, YOU GUYS.

231
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,528
THAT'S NOT REALLY NEW.

232
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,462
THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT
FOR US SINCE WE GOT HERE.

233
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,398
IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY, BUT I
THINK THEY'RE GONNA MISS US.

234
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,769
MM‐HM, AND I GUESS THEY'RE
TRYING TO BE SUBTLE ABOUT IT.

235
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,771
AND IT'S NOT WORKING.

236
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,809
I GET THE FACT THAT THEY
WANNA KEEP US SAFE...

237
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,245
BUT I WANNA DO THIS ONE
ON MY OWN, YOU KNOW.

00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,013
(EXHALES)

00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,101
ALL WE REALLY HAVE LEFT

[RUDY] HELLO!
[TOYA] HEY, THERE!

263
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,643

272
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,361
I CAN'T GET SOMETHING THAT'S
HIGHER THAN MY CURRENT LEVEL.

273
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,298
[AKATSUKI] YOU MIGHT
WANNA TRY CROW'S FEET.

274
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,867

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,947
[TATARA] TRUE, ANY CLASS CAN
USE THEM AS A THROWING WEAPON.

281
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,115
THEY CAN BE MASTERED QUICKLY.

00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,151
YOU ALSO MIGHT
WANNA TRY A KUNAI.

283
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,086
YOU CAN USE

284
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,521
AND FOR STABBING PEOPLE.

285
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,356

00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,192
YEAH, IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOUR
WEAPONS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

287
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,128

[SHOPKEEPER]

UNLESS YOU CLEAR AN EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT QUEST, YOUNG LADY!

308
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,975
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET

(EXHALE) S'NOT
QUITE OUR STYLE...

338
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:30,090
NOW, SOME OF THESE WERE
PIMPED OUT BY WAGON FANATICS.

339
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,958
[RUDY] THAT'S THE ONE!
[BOTH] HUH?

340
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,060
[RUDY]
I AM A NOBLE, MY FRIENDS.

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,230
NOT ONLY THAT,
I AM ALSO AN ADVENTURER!

342
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,632

MY FEATS OF DARING DO!

345
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,340
[ISUZU] DOWN, BOY.
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

346
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,083
WELL NOW, I BET THIS'LL
BE A BIT MORE REASONABLE.

347
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,019
[TOYA]
MMM... IT'S REALLY NICE!

348
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,386
[RUDY]

00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,690
YEAH, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE
A GOOD EYE, YOUNG MAN.

350
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,159
NOW IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A SIMPLE
WAGON BUT WE'VE IMPROVED

351
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,061
THE UNDERCARRIAGE
AND THE SUSPENSION.

352
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,530
IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT,
HIGHLY DURABLE,

353
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,965
AND THE STEERING ASSEMBLY
HAS A TURNING RADIUS OF...

00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,968
UH... ARE YOU TRYING TO
HIKE UP THE PRICE ON US?

355
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,303
I THINK I'LL LEAVE
THE HAGGLING TO MINORI.

356
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,339
[RODERICK] I STILL OWE
CHIEF NYANTA A FAVOR

357
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,107
FOR SHOWING ME THE
BEST PLACE TO HAVE

358
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,375
A BOWL OF RAMEN
A WHILE BACK.

359
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,011
I COULD PROBABLY
SWING A DISCOUNT.

RUDY, COME HELP ME!

368
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,407
OH! HEH! I'VE SPENT

369
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,510
WITH THE BEASTS
TO SIMPLY PLAY!

370
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,478
I KNOW I'VE NEVER SAID THIS,
BUT I'M ACTUALLY

371
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,614
A COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL WHEN IT
COMES TO WORKING WITH HORSES!

[SERARA] UH...?

375
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,690
MISS ISUZU! HORSES

376
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,324
THEY PICK UP ON SUCH TALK!

377
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,959
HAVE YOU NO COMPASSION
FOR THEIR FEELINGS?

378
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,896
UH...! SORRY HORSEYS!
I'M SORRY!

379
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,732
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,250
[ISUZU]
YEP, IT'S REALLY COOL!

387
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,853
[MINORI] ALL THIS PUPPY
NEEDS IS A PERSONAL TOUCH!

388
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,154
[ALL] AHHH!

(DINNER TABLE CHATTER)

391
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,270
THE GRAB TONIGHT COMES TO US
COURTESY OF SERARA.

392
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,305
(GIGGLE) CHIEF NYANTA'S
PUT IN A LOT OF TIME

393

BUT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU

398
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:15,088
HUH?! I‐ I REALLY ‐

YEAH IT IS!

405
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,705
AND HERE I WAS WORRIED THAT
IF WE WENT OUT ON THE ROAD

406
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,975
WITHOUT CHIEF NYANTA, WE'D BE
STUCK WITH TERRIBLE FOOD.

407
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,177
MM‐HMM! YEAH, YOU NAILED IT!

408

(SERARA GIGGLING)
(NYANTA CHUCKLING)

410
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,617
[TOYA] NOW THAT I
THINK ABOUT IT, ISUZU,

411
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,719
AREN'T YOU KINDA BUMMED
ABOUT LEAVING?

412
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,021
HUH? WHY'S THAT?

413
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,291
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO
HAVE ANY PERFORMANCES OUT THERE.

414
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,459
YEAH, BUT... WE CAN
MAKE THE WHOLE TRIP

415
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,562
LIKE OUR OWN

416
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,563
A TOUR?

417
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,364
THAT'S WHEN A ROCK BAND
HITS THE ROAD,

418

MAKES OUT WITH ALL THE LOCALS
AND PUKES IN THE HOTEL.

GOING ON TOUR WITH YOUR MUSIC!
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:28,494
ARE YOU GONNA DO ALL 42
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE?

429
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,132
FORTY‐TWO? I DON'T THINK WE'RE
GONNA HIT THAT MANY VILLAGES.

430
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,334
NO, "THE 42" IS
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS‐

431
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,603
ON THE ROUTE WE'RE TAKING
TO THE REDSTONE MOUNTAINS,

432
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,773
WE'RE PROBABLY ONLY GONNA COME
ACROSS FOUR OR FIVE VILLAGES.

433
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,441
THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL!

434
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,443
WE'LL BE LIKE
ROCK STARS ON TOUR!

435
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,778
I MEAN WE'LL HAVE TO STOP

436

439
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,986
DON'T GO TRYING ANYTHING
STUPID OUT THERE...

440
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,688
JUST CALL US IF
THINGS GET HAIRY.

441
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,456
WHOA, I THINK
IT WOULD BE BETTER

442
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,892
IF THEY STAYED OFF THE
TELEPATHIC NETWORK.

443
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,561

444
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,663
[NAOTSUGU]
UH... YOU SERIOUS?

445
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,765
IT'S THE POINT OF THEM
GOING OUT ALONE, NAOTSUGU...

446
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,867
THEY NEED TO SOLVE
PROBLEMS ON THEIR OWN.

447
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,702
ALL OF YOU SHOULD THINK
OF THIS WHOLE JOURNEY

448
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,471
AS AN EXTENDED EXERCISE
IN CRITICAL THINKING.

449
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:13,306
NOT TO MENTION
MEETING NEW PEOPLE,

450
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,308
AND SEEING AND
DOING NEW THINGS.

451
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,511
THAT'S RIGHT! AND YOU
SHOULD DEFINITELY ALLOW ME

452
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,746
TO HANDLE NAVIGATION

457
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,358
UH, SURE...
I'M THRILLED BEYOND WORDS!

458
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,361
I MIGHT HAVE TO GET RUDY HERE
TO FETCH ME SOME EXTRA STRINGS

459
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,597
WHENEVER THEY BREAK ON ME!

460

I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MANLY MAN.

463
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,237
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
HANDLE ONE LITTLE BARD.

468
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,620
REMEMBER MAINTAINING
YOUR WEAPONS IS CRUCIAL.

469

IF YOU EVER START
FEELING LONELY,

470

JUST THINK OF ME!

HOWEVER, THEIR JOURNEY BEGINS
TO FEEL STRANGE AND UNEASY.

487
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:30,203
A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE
APPEARS BEFORE THEM.

488
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,374

GREETS OUR YOUNG ADVENTURERS.
