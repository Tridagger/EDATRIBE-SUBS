1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,982
[ROE2, VOICEOVER] I WASN'T
SURE HOW TO BEGIN THIS LETTER,

2
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:09,985
BUT I THINK THE MOST APPROPRIATE
WAY WOULD BE TO USE THE WORD,

3
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:12,054
"HELLO." SO...

4
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:15,357
HELLO, WORLD.
HELLO, SHIROE.

5
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:17,892
"SHIROE OF LOG HORIZON."

6
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:21,130
I MUST ADMIT, HEARING THAT NAME
TOOK ME A BIT OFF GUARD.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,166
THE REASON IS BECAUSE I HAVE
A FEW OF YOUR MEMORIES

8
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,436
IN MY HEAD... SO I
FEEL A CONNECTION.

9
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:29,504
JUST LIKE YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDS ARE BEINGS

10
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:31,806
WHO CAME TO THIS WORLD
FROM A FARAWAY PLACE,

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:36,078
MY FAMILIARS AND I ARE ALSO
BEINGS FROM A DISTANT LAND.

12
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,847
MY NAME IS ROE2.

13
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:42,918
I AM ONE OF A GROUP THAT HAS
BECOME KNOWN AS "TRAVELLERS."

14
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:46,788
AND, MY CURRENT
JUXTAPOSITION IN THIS BODY,

15
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:51,860
MAKES ME SOMETHING AKIN
TO YOUR YOUNGER SISTER.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,657
[SERARA] AAH! WHAT ARE WE
DOING IN THE KITCHEN TODAY...

17
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,159
I'M SO EXCITED?!

18
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,128
WELL LET ME SEE NOW... HMM?

19
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,898
[SERARA] OH?

20
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,569
[SOJIRO] THANKS FOR
COMING, SHIROE.

21
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,105
[SHIROE] ALRIGHT, JUST
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED...

22
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,275
... AND ABOUT THIS
NEW KIND OF BEING.

23
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,983
[SOJIRO] AND WELL,
THAT'S ABOUT IT...

24
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,886
[SHIROE] HMM... THE MARRIAGE
GENIUS, KAMAISARU, YOU SAY?

25
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,488
[NAZNA] IF YOU ASK
ME, IT'S MORE LIKE

26
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:00,923
HE'S PLAYIN' ALL THESE GIRLS.

27
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:02,257
[SHIROE] SO THE
WEST WIND GIRLS ARE

28
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,592
ACTUALLY THE ONES WHO FOUND HIM?

29
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:04,893
[NAZNA] YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
[AKATSUKI] MMM!

30
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,929
WE HAVE A LARGE
INTELLIGENCE NETWORK

31
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,998
MADE UP OF NOTHING
BUT LADIES, SHIROE.

32
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,699
[NAZNA] HEH HEH.
[SOJIRO] HMM...

33
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,235
YEP...! THEY'RE PRETTY
AMAZING, MY LORD.

34
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,603
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT, AKATSUKI?

35
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:16,038
NO, I KNOW NOTHING.

36
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:16,705
HUH?

37
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,107
[SHIROE]
UH...

38
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,075
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

39
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:22,877
[NAZNA]
HE'S SWITCHING MODES.

40
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,779
[SOJIRO]
I'LL FINISH THIS QUICKLY.

41
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,649
[KAMAISARU] PROVIDE ME WITH
WHAT I NEED, ADVENTURERS.

42
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,152
[SOJIRO] NAZNA!
[NAZNA] GOT IT! THERE!

43
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,387
[KAMAISARU]
WON'T YOU MARRY ME, MY DEAR?

44
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,123
[SOJIRO]
SINGLE STROKE SLASH!

45
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:35,690
YAHHH!

46
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,061
SO YOU JUST JUMPED IN
AND ATTACKED, HUH?

47
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,729
[NAZNA] YOU MESS WITH SOMEONE
IN WEST WIND BRIGADE,

48
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,397
YOU'RE GONNA PAY
THE PRICE FOR IT!

49
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:45,100
[AKATSUKI] WE WILL SHOW NO MERCY
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT, MY LORD.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,668
[SHIROE] YOU HELPED
OUT, TOO, AKATSUKI?

51
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,637
NOPE. NO, I DIDN'T.
[SHIROE] HUH?

52
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:49,939
(HALF‐LAUGH)

53
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,442
SO? HOW DO WE GO ABOUT
CLASSIFYING THIS GUY?

54
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,544
[SOJIRO]
IS HE AN ENEMY?

55
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,113
"ENEMY," WELL?

56
00:03:58,213 --> 00:03:59,982
IF THEY'RE GOING OUT OF THEIR
WAY TO START A FIGHT...

57
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,616
THEN WE MUST DEFEND OURSELVES.

58
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:02,817
[NAZNA]
AND THAT MEANS DOING WHATEVER

59
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,153
IT TAKES TO PROTECT THE CITY.

60
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:05,720
[SOJIRO]
DON'T WORRY, LEAVE IT TO US.

61
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,089
[AKATSUKI]
WE WILL HANDLE THIS, MY LORD.

62
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,723
[SHIROE] UH... OKAY, THANKS.
[NAZNA] UH‐HUH...

63
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,125
[SOJIRO]
COME TO THINK OF IT,

64
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:12,161
THIS GUY WAS RATHER UNUSUAL.
[SHIROE] "UNUSUAL"?

65
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,863
I MEAN FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE WE CAME HERE,

66
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,598
IT REALLY FELT LIKE THE GAME.

67
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,667
[NAZNA] YEAH. IT NEVER SEEMED

68
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,970
LIKE THERE WAS ANY REAL DANGER.

69
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,705
[SOJIRO] IT WAS LIKE
IT WASN'T REAL.

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,107
IT DIDN'T FEEL NORMAL,

71
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,709
LIKE WE FOUGHT THE GUY
ONSCREEN OR SOMETHING.

72
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,978
[SHIROE]
HMM.

73
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:32,181
[SARGE] DEEP FRIED
ROCKFISH IS THE BEST!

74
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,184
[SOLDIERS] DEEP FRIED ROCKFISH
IS THE BEST! (PANTING)

75
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:38,287
[ITHERUS] MASTER
ISAAC! MASTER ISAAC!

76
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:39,922
(ISAAC GRUNTING)

77
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:43,125
HOW DOES A MAN THAT BIG
MANAGE TO JUMP SO HIGH?

78
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:46,628
WHOA! TELL ME HOW HE
DOES IT, MASTER ISAAC!

79
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,130
JUST CALL ME ISAAC.

80
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,631
OH? OKAY.

81
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,233
WHO'RE YOU AGAIN?

82
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,634
I'M ITHERUS, SIR.

83
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,237
[ISAAC] OKAY, ITHERUS.
CAN YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

84
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,107
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP
OVER HERE. (FIGHTING PRACTICE)

85
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,175
[ITHERUS] BUT, MASTER ISAAC,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINING

86
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,111
ALL MAIHAMA'S KNIGHTS
AND MAKING THEM BETTER.

87
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,878
[SOLDIERS] HYAHHHH!!
(STRUGGLING)

88
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,415
[ISAAC] DON'T BOTHER ME
WITH THE DETAILS, KID.

89
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,318
[ITHERUS] ALSO, I HEARD THAT MY
OLDER SISTER PRINCESS RAYNESHIA

90
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:11,886
IS CURRENTLY UNDER YOUR WATCH
INSIDE THE CITY LIMITS.

91
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,655
[ISAAC] YEAH, WELL
YA HEARD WRONG.

92
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,524
THAT'S NOT MY
JOB... GOT IT.

93
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:17,359
HER KEEPER'S ON LEAVE, I GUESS.

94
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,461
[ITHERUS] AND I TAKE IT HE'S
AN ADVENTURER TOO,

95
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,762
RIGHT? MASTER ISAAC, SIR?

96
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,631
[ISAAC] (SIGH) JUST ISAAC....

97
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,233
[REZARICK] MR. ISAAC.
[ISAAC] ERK!

98
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,235
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE
THE MEN A LITTLE BREAK...

99
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,703
[ISAAC] WOULD YOU GUYS KNOCK IT
OFF WITH THE "MISTER" CRAP!?

100
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,072
[REZARICK] YOU HEAR THAT,
ITHERUS?

101
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,941
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO
FORMAL WITH MR. ISAAC.

102
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,808
[ITHERUS] SO IT SHOULD
BE "MISTER ISAAC."

103
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,011
[ISAAC] ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT
TO GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE!

104
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,213
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
THAT, MISTER ISAAC, SIR?

105
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:41,316
IT SOUNDS SO DASHING AND
DIGNIFIED, MISTER ISAAC!

106
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,817
(GIGGLING) [MAID B] I THINK
HE'S GOING TO EXPLODE!

107
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,753
[ISAAC] AHHH! YOU'RE
JUST BEGGIN' ME

108
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:48,323
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
BLACK SWORD OF PAIN!

109
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,759
[MICHITAKA] WHEN
WE FIRST MET HIM,

110
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,861
HE LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL
PERSON OF THE LAND.

111
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:56,131
AND HE TOLD US HE HAD THE
ABILITY TO APPRAISE MINERALS.

112
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,168
EVER SINCE THE APOCALYPSE, WE
MADE IT A POINT TO DETERMINE

113
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,972
THE PRICE OF MATERIAL ITEMS BY
THEIR QUALITY OR WORKMANSHIP.

114
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,974
ADVENTURERS FLOCKED
FROM ALL AROUND

115
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,976
TO GET THINGS
VALUED FROM HIM.

116
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,543
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL...

117
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:11,713
LET'S SAY THIS NEW FRIEND OF
OURS APPRAISES JUST ANY OLD ROCK

118
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,516
AND SAYS IT HAS
GEMSTONE QUALITY.

119
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,319
NOW, I DON'T GET IT, BUT ALL OF
A SUDDEN EVERYBODY WOULD START

120
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,156
THINKING THAT THIS ROCK WAS A
24 CARAT DIAMOND OR SOMETHING.

121
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,025
[RODERICK] IN SHORT, THIS MAN
IS A MONSTER

122
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,893
OF SOME KIND WHO DEVALUES

123
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:27,096
ALL OF OUR KNOWN MEASUREMENTS
AND MATERIAL VALUES.

124
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,632
EVEN LENGTHS AND WEIGHTS
ARE SUSPECT NOW.

125
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,168
HE'S BUGRITH, THE
GENIUS OF MEASUREMENT.

126
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,570
A CONSISTENT STANDARD OF
MEASURES AND VALUES IS

127
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,406
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
YOU MIGHT THINK.

128
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,773
WE DID SOME SNOOPING,

129
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:41,410
AND WE ENDED UP
FINDING HIS HIDEOUT.

130
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,014
WE IMPROVISED A RAID TEAM.
BUT RAN INTO A SURPRISE.

131
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,983
[BUGRITH] (CHUCKLING)
WELL, WELL, WELL.

132
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,785
THIS SHOULD MAKE FOR
A NICE HAUL OF EMPATHIUM.

133
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,588
[MICHITAKA]
LIGHTNING STRAIGHT! HUH?

134
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:56,258
THIS GUY WAS A FLAT OUT
TRICKSTER!

135
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,160
NONE OF US KNEW HE COULD CONTROL
DISTANCES,

136
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,229
SPEEDS, TARGETING
AND SKILL DAMAGE

137
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:03,765
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.
WE WERE SCREWED.

138
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,567
[BUGRITH] GIVE UP
YOUR EMPATHIUM, NOW,

139
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,502
OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!

140
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:10,639
[RODERICK] AND, JUST WHEN
EVERYONE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP...

141
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,175
[RODERICK] SORRY
I MADE YOU WAIT!

142
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,110
[RODERICK] THANKS TO HELP
FROM THE KUNIE TRIBE,

143
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,512
OUR SECRET WEAPON'S
COMPLETE AND READY TO GO!

144
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:18,813
[MICHITAKA]
NOW WE'RE TALKIN'!

145
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,515
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, BUGRITH!

146
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:23,986
YOUR EVIL DEEDS ARE ABOUT
TO BE FOILED, MY FRIEND!

147
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,556
WITH THIS...! THE METRO BLADE!

148
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,558
[SHIROE] "METRO BLADE"?

149
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,860
[MARIELLE] YEAH, BUT ISN'T
THAT... JUST A RULER?

150
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,095
TOTALLY A RULER.

151
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:34,629
[AKATSUKI]
IT'S A RULER.

152
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:36,999
[RODERICK] THE METRO BLADE...

153
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,201
ANY UNIT CAN BE MEASURE
WITH PRECISION,

154
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:41,403
AND IT'S AUTHENTICITY IS
COMPLETELY CONFIRMED

155
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,837
BY THIS DEVICE!

156
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,040
FIRST WE SHUT DOWN HIS
ABILITY, AND THEN...

157
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,277
[MICHITAKA]
TIGER ECHO FIST! UWAH!

158
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,245
UAAHHHHH!

159
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,515
[MICHITAKA] ANYWAY.
THAT'S THE GIST OF IT.

160
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:54,849
[SHIROE] THERE WAS ONE MORE...

161
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,651
OKAY, SEINE. GO AHEAD.

162
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,953
[SEINE] UUH...

163
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,089
[SEINE] UH, HELLO EVERYBODY...
[AKATSUKI] MM.

164
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,491
MY NAME IS SEINE... AND...

165
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:05,494
AND THERE WAS MORE THAN JUST THE
SCANDAL GENIUS

166
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,096
WE REPORTED THE OTHER DAY.

167
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,131
WE ALSO HAD THE SO‐CALLED
"PESTILENCE INCIDENT"

168
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,865
RIGHT BEFORE THE LIBRA FESTIVAL.

169
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,102
AND SISLAU, THE MONSTER WHO
CAUSED IT,

170
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,005
LOVED CALLING HIMSELF
THE POISON GENIUS.

171
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:18,140
[RODERICK]
OUR BEST GUESS SO FAR IS

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,242
THAT A NEW TYPE OF
MONSTER WAS INTRODUCED

173
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:23,078
WITH THE NOVASPHERE
PIONEERS UPGRADE.

174
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,050
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD?
[SHIROE] HMM?

175
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,484
[AKATSUKI]
YOU'RE NOT TIRED, ARE YOU?

176
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:30,986
[SHIROE]
NO. I'M OKAY.

177
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,454
I'M FEELING JUST FINE.

178
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,123
MPH. ALL RIGHT...

179
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,958
[MINORI]
MASTER SHIROE!

180
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,026
[SHIROE]
HUH?

181
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,994
[MINORI]
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

182
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:41,096
[SHIROE]
MINORI. IS YOUR SHIFT OVER?

183
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:45,067
[MINORI] YEAH! THEY GAVE ME LOTS
OF FREE EXTRA STUFF TODAY!

184
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,535
YOU MEAN "EVERY DAY."

185
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:47,569
YOU NEED HELP?

186
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,004
NAH, I'VE GOT IT.

187
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,305
[MINORI]
AND HERE'S WHY....

188
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,475
TA‐DA! LIFE'S BETTER
WITH A MAGIC BAG!

189
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,309
WOW!

190
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,877
MINORI, YOU DESIGNED THAT?!

191
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,513
(GIGGLEE) I SURE DID!

192
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,083
LOOK! YOU CAN JUST KEEP
ON CRAMMING STUFF IN!

193
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,818
IT'S VERY EFFICIENT! AND
SUPER CHIC AND GIRLY!

194
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,554
[SHIROE]
AHHH...

195
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,157
[SHIROE] WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD GET SOME

196
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,191
TREATS TO TAKE BACK HOME.

197
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,692
[AKATSUKI] ABSOLUTELY!

198
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:11,893
RED BEAN BUNS, MY LORD!

199
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:12,928
[MINORI] COULDN'T WE
EAT SOMETHING LIKE

200
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,029
A FLAN FOR A CHANGE?

201
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:14,930
[AKATSUKI] YOU GOT A PROBLEM

202
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,998
WITH RED BEAN BUNS?

203
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,566
[MINORI] NO, BUT CHANGE IS GOOD.

204
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,569
[AKATSUKI] HA. IT'S NOT THE
USUAL RED BEAN BUNS TODAY.

205
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,838
THEY'RE CHERRY BLOSSOM BUNS,
A LIMITED SEASONAL EDITION.

206
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,274
[TETORA] OH YEAH? WELL,
[ALL] HUH?

207
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:28,143
I WANNA HAVE SOME STRAWBERRY
SHORTCAKE! RIGHT NOW!

208
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,678
[SHIROE]
WHA‐?! TETORA?!

209
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,812
GET OFF OF MY LORD.

210
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,047
YOU'RE A NUISANCE, HALF‐STARLET.

211
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,715
[TETORA]
HALF‐STARLET, YOU SAY?!

212
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,450
THE GALAXY TREMBLES
AT MY STARDOM

213
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,586
WHILE THE PLANETS
REVOLVE AROUND ME!

214
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,422
AND SHIROE ALREADY SAID HE
ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY LOVES IT

215
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:42,691
[TETORA] WHEN I STICK TO HIS
BODY LIKE THIS ALL DAY LONG!

216
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,625
(LAUGHS)
[SHIROE] NO, I DIDN'T.

217
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,659
[MINORI] SHIROE...

218
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,794
[AKATSUKI] I'LL CUT HER.

219
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,596
STRAWBERRY, STRAWBERRY
SHORTCAKE!

220
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,598
[MINORI] WE ARE GOING TO GET
FLAN! (SHIROE IN PAIN)

221
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:52,201
THE RED BEAN BUNS ARE THIS WAY,
MY LORD! [SHIROE] YAARGH!

222
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,237
[SHIROE] ARRGGGHHH!
(HORRIFIED)

223
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,439
[KNIGHT A] DEEP FRIED
ROCKFISH FOR ME!

224
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,173
[KNIGHT B]

225
00:09:58,273 --> 00:09:59,274
[WAITRESS A]
OKAY!

226
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,110
[KARASHIN]
HELLO, ISAAC.

227
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:02,744
(MUNCH)

228
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:03,612
[KARASHIN]
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

229
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:04,879
(GRUNT)

230
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,515
[ISAAC] YOU'VE BEEN
EXTRA CHUMMY LATELY.

231
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,850
[KARASHIN] OH, COME ON...
I'M JUST MEETING A FRIEND

232
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,852
TO DISCUSS BUSINESS OVER DINNER.

233
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,622
CAN I GET A DEEP FRIED
ROCKFISH AND A BEER?

234
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:14,789
[WAITRESS B] SURE!

235
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,125
(MOUTHFUL) TRYIN' TO
MAKE MONEY HERE?

236
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,227
Y'DON'T HAVE TO PUT
IT THAT WAY...

237
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,263
I'M JUST CHECKIN' IN ON ONE OF
MY GUILD'S FINE ESTABLISHMENTS.

238
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:22,764
[REZARICK] I DEFINITELY
TOLD YOU BEFORE

239
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,999
THAT THIS IS A TRADING BRANCH

240
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,301
OF SHOPPING DISTRICT
EIGHT, MISTER ISAAC.

241
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:29,104
[ISAAC] REZARICK. STOP CALLING
ME MISTER. I'M SERIOUS.

242
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,439
[REZARICK] YESSIR.
[KARASHIN] HERE YOU GO.

243
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,641
STRAIGHT FROM THE
ROUND TABLE TO YOU.

244
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:34,409
[ISAAC] AH.

245
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,145
[KARASHIN] APPARENTLY IT'S A
REPORT ON ENEMIES

246
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,646
THEY CALL "GENIUSES."

247
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,015
THE NAME RINGS A BELL,
BUT WHAT'RE THEY ALL ABOUT?

248
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,383
COULDN'T SAY.

249
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,986
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SOME PEOPLE OF THE LAND

250
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:45,854
ARE LOOKING TO GO TO WAR.

251
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:48,257
SHADY BUSINESS ALL
OVER THE PLACE, HUH?

252
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,160
[REZARICK] THEY'RE ALSO SAYING
THE WYVERN DISTURBANCE IN SAPHIR

253
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,827
WAS A SIDE EFFECT OF MINAMI

254
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,296
POWER‐LEVELING PEOPLE
OF THE LAND.

255
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,198
I GET IT NOW... WE'RE IN MAIHAMA

256
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,867
BECAUSE THE VILLAIN KNEW
ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON...

257
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,903
YEAH, THAT'S SHIROE.
ALWAYS A STEP AHEAD.

258
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:03,705
[ISAAC] TELL ME ABOUT IT.

259
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,443
[SHIROE] WOW... I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR

260
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,878
SINCE WE WERE TRANSPORTED HERE.

261
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:11,746
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

262
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:13,782
[SHIROE] IT MAKES SENSE

263
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,384
THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE.

264
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:18,687
[NYANTA] YEAH. AND SOME
A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS.

265
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,089
Y'KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

266
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,823
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD.

267
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,194
NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN EASY.

268
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:36,271
[MARIELLE] OH? YOU'RE HELPING
OUT? [SERARA] YES, MA'AM

269
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,074
[MARIELLE] AHH... I'M GLAD
YOU'RE GETTING THE HANG OF IT.

270
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,243
AND I REMEMBER YOU SAID

271
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,478
YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE
SIMPLE THINGS ALREADY...

272
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,748
AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE
CHEF SUBCLASS TO DO IT ANYMORE.

273
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,584
WELL THERE'S A LOT
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

274
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:50,552
HUH?

275
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,521
[SERARA] ALL DONE!

276
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,157
[NYANTA] NOW THAT'S A
LOVELY DISH, SERARA!

277
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,325
[SERARA] THANKS!

278
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,327
[NYANTA]
WHAT ABOUT THE NEW POTATOES?

279
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,494
[SERARA] I'VE GOT 'EM BOILED UP

280
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,263
AND SPICED JUST
THE WAY YOU LIKE IT!

281
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,565
[NYANTA] YOU KEEP
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

282
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,901
WELL, I'VE HAD A
WONDERFUL TEACHER!

283
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,503
WHY DON'T WE HAVE SOME TEA

284
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,805
WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE
VEGETABLES TO COOL DOWN?

285
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:11,941
SOUNDS GREAT.

286
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,943
(SLIME MOOING)

287
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,610
[NYANTA] IS IT A
GOOD POT THIS TIME?

288
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,512
[SERARA] YES, IT'S
REALLY WARM AND TASTY.

289
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,349
[NYANTA] MY GOODNESS,
WHAT A RELAXING DAY.

290
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,219
I JUST WANNA CURL UP IN
A SUNBEAM AND TAKE A NAP

291
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,221
(BLOW AND SIP)

292
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:28,123
HMMM.

293
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,993
WELL LOOK AT YOU, YOU SEEM
TO BE ENJOYING YOURSELF.

294
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,561
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE I AM!

295
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:35,730
[NYANTA] HMM? I'M
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

296
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:37,532
UH...

297
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,369
UM, IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOU, CHIEF?

298
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,337
I'M DOING WONDERFUL.

299
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,706
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

300
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,841
[NYANTA]
HEY SERARA,

301
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,112
ARE YOU GLAD YOU ENDED UP HERE
IN THE ELDER TALES WORLD?

302
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,747
[SERARA] HUH? OH! I AM.

303
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:54,383
ARE YOU SURE YOU MEAN THAT?

304
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,087
YEAH! I MEAN I KNOW I CAN'T SEE
MY MOM OR MY DAD RIGHT NOW,

305
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,654
AND A LOT OF REALLY
STRANGE THINGS

306
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,290
HAVE HAPPENED TO ME
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE...

307
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,658
BUT A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED TO ME TOO,

308
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:04,927
KINDA LIKE...

309
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,028
HMM?

310
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,462
WELL NOW THERE'S SOMETHING

311
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,431
I WANNA BE IN THE FUTURE.

312
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,600
SO YOU HAVE A DREAM THEN?

313
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,767
MM‐HM...

314
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:17,672
(CHUCKLING)
[NYANTA, THINKING] LOOK AT THAT.

315
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:21,576
NOT EVERYONE CAME HERE THE
SAME AGE OR THE SAME LEVEL.

316
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,678
BUT WE ALL HAVE ROOM TO GROW.

317
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:26,515
JUST LIKE CHILDREN EVENTUALLY
BECOME YOUNG ADULTS,

318
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:30,685
AND THEN THEY GROW SOME
MORE, AND ARE REBORN AGAIN.

319
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,287
AND EVENTUALLY

320
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:35,357
REINVENT THEMSELVES
INTO WHATEVER THEY WANT.

321
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:37,792
Y'KNOW I THINK YOU'LL BE FINE.

322
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,963
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU SET
YOUR MIND TO, LITTLE LADY.

323
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:43,865
[SERARA] OHH... EHH! UHH...

324
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,735
B‐B‐B‐B‐B‐BUT... MY DREAM
IS JUST SO FAR AWAY!

325
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,204
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
GIVING UP OR ANYTHING!

326
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:51,306
BUT I KNOW I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

327
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:54,143
YOU SEE...? WHEN I COMPARE WHAT
I'VE DONE WITH WHAT

328
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:56,645
MINORI AND ISUZU HAVE
MANAGED TO DO...

329
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,281
I REALLY HAVEN'T DONE
THAT MUCH AT ALL.

330
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,053
SO I JUST GOTTA WORK TO BE
THE BEST THAT I CAN BE.

331
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:05,720
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

332
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,924
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I HAVE TO DO FIRST.

333
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:12,794
I MUST FIND IT WITHIN MYSELF
TO BE STRONG AND INDEPENDENT.

334
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,864
THEN I CAN GET TO WHERE I WANT.

335
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,534
YOU'RE GROWIN' UP.
YAH!

336
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,270
I KNOW THAT
YOU CAN DO IT...

337
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,539
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU
NEED, UNDERSTAND.

338
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,109
SO YOU KNOW, I'M PULLING FOR YOU
TO GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT

339
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,981
OUT OF LIFE. THAT GOES FOR YOU
AND ALL YOU'RE FRIENDS, TOO.

340
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,949
(HAPPY SIGH)

341
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,423
[SHIROE, THINKING] KANAMI.
I SURE COULD USE YOUR HELP.

342
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,359
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN.

343
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,395
I WAS BETTER OFF
THAN MOST PEOPLE.

344
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:49,464
I RAN INTO SOME FRIENDS
RIGHT AWAY WHEN I GOT HERE.

345
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,969
I'M PRETTY LUCKY TO HAVE BOTH
NAOTSUGU AND AKATSUKI AROUND.

346
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,905
FEEL FREE TO THANK ME IN
PERSON. I'M RIGHT HERE.

347
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,007
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

348
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,174
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

349
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,642
I DID SOME
NINJA STUFF.

350
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,511
YOU'RE REALLY GETTING
THIS NINJA THING DOWN.

351
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,980
I'M GLAD YOU NOTICED, MY LORD.

352
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,349
AH...
SO TELL ME...

353
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,883
WHAT SEEMS TO BE TROUBLING
YOU NOW? [SHIROE] HUH?

354
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,219
[SHIROE] EH?
[AKATSUKI] I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

355
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:11,720
WHEN SOMETHING IS BOTHER YOU,

356
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,256
YOUR FOREHEAD GETS ALL
WRINKLY LIKE AN OLD MAN.

357
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:15,324
OH, IT DOES?

358
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,691
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.

359
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,428
HEY! SHIROE, I FINALLY
FOUND YOU! UWAHH!

360
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,296
[TETORA] MY NAUGHTY RADAR
IS GOING OFF!

361
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:22,764
IS THIS A MIDNIGHT TRYST?
[NAOTSUGU] ERK!

362
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:24,533
[TETORA] YOU'RE GOING
OVER BORING STRATEGY

363
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,035
STUFF AGAIN, AREN'T CHA?!

364
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:28,270
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, ARE YOU
GUYS DISCUSSING STRATEGY?

365
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,738
HEY! COME HERE!
[TETORA] OOPSY DAISY!

366
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,040
AN ADORABLE FACE,

367
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,341
ATTRACTIVE BEYOND A DOUBT...

368
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:33,908
WELL I'M RIGHT HERE!

369
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,611
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A GALACTIC
SUPERSTAR IN ON THIS PUPPY!

370
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,948
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR FAVORITE TANK!

371
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,815
[SHIROE] YOU TWO HAVE
BECOME QUITE A PAIR.

372
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,885
[NAOTSUGU] TH‐TH‐TH‐THAT'S
NOT EVEN FUNNY!

373
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,854
[TETORA] YOU KNOW WE'RE
MEANT FOR EACH OTHER!

374
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,957
JUST CALL US,
"TETOTSUGU" FROM NOW ON.

375
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:51,360
THE GUARDIAN'S TOTALLY
MASSIVE AND TOWERING ARMOR

376
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,963
GETS PROTECTED BY MY
REACTIVE HEALING SPELL!

377
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:57,066
EVERY TIME HE GETS BEAT UP,
THE POWER OF MY STARDOM...

378
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,701
AS WELL AS MY LOVE WILL MAKE
HIS HEART POUND FOR ME.

379
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:00,835
[NAOTSUGU] UGH... JUST... DON'T.

380
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,404
OH, NAOTSUGU,
YOU'RE SUCH A TEASE.

381
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,606
(TETORA GIGGLING)
UH‐HUH...

382
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:06,275
[TETORA] SO WHAT NOW?

383
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,642
[SHIROE] IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR

384
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,979
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE
BROUGHT US HERE.

385
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,581
THERE ARE A LOT OF ADVENTURERS
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN TO ADJUST,

386
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,583
AND THEY JUST WANNA GO HOME.

387
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,119
[AKATSUKI] BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY AN OPTION FOR US, IS IT?

388
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,553
[SHIROE] DON'T THINK SO...

389
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,622
AND WELL, EINS SAYS
WE SHOULD FIND A WAY

390
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:22,657
TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE.

391
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,960
[NAOTSUGU] YOU MEAN WHAT
HE SAID ABOUT LEVYING A TAX

392
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,629
ON THE WEALTHY AND
STARTING A WELFARE STATE?

393
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,032
[TETORA] YOU THINK SOMETHING
LIKE THAT'S REALLY GONNA WORK.

394
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,168
[SHIROE] I'M GUESSING IT WON'T.
[AKATSUKI] NO, OF COURSE NOT.

395
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:35,304
FOR NOW, I THINK THEY'RE ONLY
ONE WAY WE CAN POSSIBLY

396
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:39,174
HELP THEM. AND THAT'S TO TRY AND
GET THEM BACK TO THE OLD WORLD.

397
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,409
AND DO IT SOON...

398
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:43,212
THE ENTIRE SERVER'S
ABOUT TO GO TO WAR.

399
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:45,915
[TETORA] YOU MIGHT
BE RIGHT. (BLOW)

400
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:48,951
YES. AND IT COULD BE POSSIBLE
THAT OUR VERY EXISTENCE HERE

401
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,453
IN THE WORLD IS
ULTIMATELY THE CAUSE.

402
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,188
SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US...

403
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,689
IS THAT WE MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE A DUTY

404
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,758
TO FIND OUR WAY
BACK HOME, MY LORD?

405
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:57,859
HMPH...

406
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:00,495
[SHIROE] THERE'S SOMETHING
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

407
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,097
THAT I NEED TO TELL ALL OF YOU.

408
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:03,432
[ALL] HMM?

409
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:04,833
[NYANTA] OH YEAH?

410
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,902
WELL LET'S HEAR WHAT IT
IS YOU HAVE TO SAY, MY MAN

411
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:09,604
HEY CHIEF.

412
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:15,044
HMM?

413
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,212
[AKATSUKI] A LETTER?

414
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:18,847
[NAOTSUGU] A LOOOOVE LETTER?

415
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,950
[SHIROE] YEAH, NO THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.

416
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,716
HMM?!

417
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,252
THE LETTER'S
FROM ROE2.

418
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:25,320
SHE'S MY SECOND
CHARACTER.

419
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,388
[TETORA] OOOH...

420
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,556
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE AVATAR

421
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,324
YOU LEFT ON THE TEST
SERVER, RIGHT?

422
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,926
YOU GOT HER TO LEVEL 90?

423
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,594
COME ON! ARE WE
REALLY TALKING ABOUT

424
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,696
THE TEST SERVER? THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE MOON!

425
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:36,999
[SHIROE] MM‐HM.
[AKATSUKI] THE MOON...?

426
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,801
AND YOUR BETA CHARACTER'S
WRITING YOU LETTERS NOW?

427
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,371
I MEAN, HOW DID THE THING
GET HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

428
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,306
[SHIROE] MINORI GAVE
IT TO ME, ACTUALLY.

429
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,475
THE JUNIOR MEMBERS
MET HER ON THE ROAD.

430
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:48,677
[TETORA] HM...
[SHIROE] ANYWAY...

431
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,812
ACCORDING TO THIS, THE PERSON

432
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:54,049
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND
SINCE WE GOT HERE...

433
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,085
HAS INSTEAD FOUND ME.

434
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,688
SO IT'S GOT ME THINKING AGAIN.

435
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,091
WHAT IS THE REAL REASON WE WERE
ALL BROUGHT TO THIS WORLD,

436
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,558
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

437
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,460
IT'S STRANGE, DON'T YOU THINK?

438
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,097
IF THIS IS TRULY AN
ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE,

439
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:09,498
THEN IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE

440
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:11,800
THAT IT WOULD BE SO SIMILAR
TO ELDER TALES, RIGHT?

441
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,603
AND BESIDES, THE IDEA
THAT A GAME BECAME REAL

442
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,738
AND SOMEHOW TRANSPORTED
US ALL HERE?

443
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,608
THE THOUGHT OF THAT...
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

444
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,176
AND AS FAR AS WE ALL KNOW,

445
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:23,712
THERE'S NO TECHNOLOGY THAT
COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

446
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,415
[AKATSUKI] TRUE.
[TETORA] I KNOW, RIGHT?

447
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,250
[SHIROE] AND THE CHANGES
AFTER THE APOCALYPSE

448
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,119
DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE EITHER.

449
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,021
THE LAWS OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD

450
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:35,357
AND THE MECHANICS OF THE GAME
HAVE BEEN JUMBLED TOGETHER.

451
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:39,128
IT'S AS IF TWO SETS OF RULES
WERE ALMOST RANDOMLY MIXED.

452
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,964
[NAOTUSGU] IT STILL ACTS LIKE
THE GAME IN THE WEIRDEST WAYS.

453
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:44,566
[SHIROE] IN ANY CASE, I DON'T
THINK THE IDEA OF THIS BEING

454
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,802
AN ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE
IS PLAUSIBLE ANYMORE...

455
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:51,006
BUT SOMEONE MUST KNOW... THEY
KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE,

456
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:54,043
AND THEY KNOW HOW WE WERE
BROUGHT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

457
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:57,012
BUT SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T FOUND A
PERSON OF THE LAND OR A PLAYER

458
00:18:57,112 --> 00:19:00,049
LIKE US, WHO CAN EXPLAIN ANY
OF THIS IN FULL DETAIL.

459
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,484
[NAOTSUGU] SO THAT WOULD BE THE
BUTT‐WAD THAT BROUGHT US HERE.

460
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:04,853
[NYANTA] SO WHAT DOES
THE LETTER SAY?

461
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,957
[SHIROE] ROE2 SAYS SHE TOOK
OVER MY UNUSED SECOND AVATAR...

462
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,759
BASICALLY SHE FOUND HERSELF
A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL,

463
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,627
SO SHE COULD COME TO THIS WORLD.

464
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,796
SO WHO IS SHE ANYWAY?

465
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:18,067
[SHIROE] SHE REFERS TO HERSELF
HERE AS A "TRAVELLER."

466
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,769
AN INTELLIGENT ENTITY FROM
ANOTHER WORLD. YOU MIGHT CALL

467
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,273
HER AN "ALTERNATE LIFE FORM," OR
EVEN AN "ALIEN" FOR THAT MATTER.

468
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,075
(AKATSUKI INHALES)
[SHIROE] SHE COMES FROM A RACE

469
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:29,011
OF ARTIFICIALLY CREATED
LIVING BEINGS...

470
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,645
AND SHE SAYS THERE ARE TWO
TYPES,

471
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:31,914
THERE ARE "OBSERVERS,"

472
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:35,050
AND OTHERS SHE REFERS
TO AS "COLLECTORS."

473
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,452
THESE TRAVELLERS WERE
CREATED WITH THE MISSION

474
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,354
OF GATHERING A VALUABLE
RESOURCE,

475
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:41,690
SOMETHING CALLED "EMPATHIUM"

476
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,259
OKAY, AND THAT IS...?

477
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,896
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LETTER DIDN'T
REALLY SAY MUCH MORE, HOWEVER,

478
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:50,499
SHE DOES SAY THAT HER PEOPLE
EXHAUSTED THEIR EMPATHIUM

479
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,901
AND ENTERED A PERIOD
OF RAPID DECLINE.

480
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,769
[SHIROE/ROE2] "IN ORDER TO
OVERCOME THE SITUATION

481
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,472
WE NEEDED TO HARVEST IT
FROM A DIFFERENT WORLD.

482
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,141
AND LIFE FORMS LIKE ME
WERE CREATED TO SURVEY

483
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:03,678
THE ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSES
TO RESTOCK THE SUPPLY."

484
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:06,815
ROE2 AND THE OTHERS GOT HERE
THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED

485
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,919
"THE ECLIPSE." AND OF COURSE
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

486
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,287
IT'S THEIR VERSION
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

487
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:15,124
[NAOTSUGU] WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING
THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS?

488
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:17,559
[SHIROE] THEY DON'T... IT LOOKS
LIKE THE WHOLE THING'S JUST

489
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,528
AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO THEM TOO.

490
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,296
OKAY. YOU THINK THEY EVER GOT
AHOLD OF

491
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,232
THIS EMPATHIUM
THINGY‐MA‐BOB?

492
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,833
I DON'T KNOW...

493
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,936
[ROE2, VOICEOVER] WE UNDERSTAND
YOUR PEOPLE TO BE INTELLIGENT

494
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:29,338
ENTITIES THAT ARE
RANK 3 OR HIGHER.

495
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,942
MINORI AND HER FRIENDS HAVE
PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE SUCH.

496
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:35,077
CONSEQUENTLY, YOUR PEOPLE
RESERVE

497
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,980
THE RIGHTS TO THE
RESOURCES IN THIS WORLD.

498
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,849
COLLECTORS HAVE BEEN ORDERED
TO PRIORITIZE ACQUISITION,

499
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,619
BUT OUR MISSION AS OBSERVERS
IS TO CONTINUE INVESTIGATION.

500
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,488
[SHIROE/ROE2] "I HAVE NO IDEA IF
MY OLDER BROTHER,

501
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:48,390
SHIROE IS GONNA END UP
READING THIS LETTER,

502
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,926
BUT IF YOU DO, YOU ARE GOING
TO NEED A TRANSMITTER

503
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,062
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE MOON."

504
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:54,563
[AKATSUKI] AH...

505
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:55,998
[ROE2] AS YOU MAY KNOW...

506
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,967
WE HAVE A COMMUNITY ON THE MOON

507
00:20:58,067 --> 00:20:59,601
WATCHING OVER THE SITUATION.

508
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:02,004
[ROE2, VOICEOVER] AND IF ANY OF
YOUR PEOPLE WISH TO "RETURN,"

509
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,473
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
WE CAN ASSIST YOU.

510
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,774
(GASP)

511
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,409
[ROE2, VOICEOVER]
BUT AS A WORD OF WARNING,

512
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,710
BEWARE THE COLLECTORS.

513
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,579
THEY ARE TRAVELLERS LIKE US,

514
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,215
BUT THEIR INTELLIGENCE
IS ONLY AROUND RANK 2.

515
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,018
THEY CAME TO THIS WORLD USING
PRE‐EXISTING MONSTER

516
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:18,720
CHARACTERS WITH
HIGH COMBAT SKILLS.

517
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,123
AND AS YOU'LL SEE, IF
YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY,

518
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,959
THEY'RE NOT EASY
TO GET ALONG WITH.

519
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,862
[SHIROE] "AND SO I MUST ADVISE
YOU TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS.

520
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,032
[ALL] HMMM...

521
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,401
[SHIROE] SO WE CAN
ASSUME, I GUESS,

522
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,602
THAT THE "GENIUSES" ARE

523
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:34,836
THESE "COLLECTORS"
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

524
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,538
WHY IN THE HELL WOULD THEY
BE TARGETING

525
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:38,640
ADVENTURERS THEN, HUH?
[NYANTA] HMMM...

526
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,109
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SURE.

527
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,877
[ROE2] P. S. DEAREST MINORI,
IT WAS A PLEASURE

528
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:45,114
MEETING YOU AND ALL THE OTHERS.

529
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:46,848
MAY THE WARM GLOW
OF YOUR EMPATHIUM,

530
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:49,851
LIGHT THE WAY TO WHEREVER
YOUR FUTURE TAKES YOU.

531
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,887
LOVE, YOUR BIG SIS.

532
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:56,791
[SHIROE] THERE'S STILL A LOT
ABOUT THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND...

533
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,327
BUT IF WE CAN FIND
A WAY TO GET IN TOUCH

534
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:00,662
WITH THE OBSERVERS SHE
SAYS ARE UP ON THE MOON,

535
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:02,531
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO
GIVE US A HINT

536
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:04,099
ABOUT HOW TO GET BACK HOME.

537
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,969
[TETORA] SO YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
TRUST WHAT'S IN THAT LETTER?

538
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,570
[SHIROE]
I THINK WE CAN, TETORA.

539
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,440
[NYANTA] IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR
REASON WHY YOU TRUST IT.

540
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,776
WHEN I DIED IN THE ABYSSAL
SHAFT, I SAW SOMETHING.

541
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,246
IT WAS A BEACH...

542
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,247
ON THE MOON...

543
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,648
AND NOW THAT I'VE
READ THIS LETTER,

544
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:20,882
I'M PRETTY SURE...

545
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,751
IT WASN'T, IT WASN'T A DREAM.

546
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:25,054
I SAW IT... I WAS WITH YOU.

547
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:28,290
I REMEMBER ALL THE MEMORIES
FLOATING INTO THE SKY.

548
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,994
THAT REALLY HAPPENED, IT DID.

549
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:33,362
MPH...

550
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:34,296
[TETORA] HMM...

551
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,497
HM?
(TETORA GIGGLES)

552
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:36,932
[SHIROE] SO IF WE CAN GET THERE,

553
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,234
JUST ONE MORE TIME...

554
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:41,503
WE MIGHT...

555
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:44,073
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET BACK HOME!

556
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,632
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] MEET
RAYNESHIA'S YOUNGER BROTHER,

557
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,668
AND MAIHAMA'S PRINCE, ITHERUS.

558
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:21,370
A BIRTHDAY PARTY IS
HELD IN HIS HONOR

559
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,705
TO ANNOUNCE HIS
SUCCESSION TO LORD.

560
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:25,340
BUT EVEN DURING
SUCH FESTIVITIES,

561
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,909
THE THREAT OF WAR
HANGS OVER THE LAND.

562
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,980
AN INSIDIOUS SHADOW THREATENS
THE YOUNG BOY'S LIFE,

563
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,016
AND PROVOKES AN ENRAGED
BLACK SWORD KNIGHT.

564
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:37,286
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES
ARE ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
