00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:06,836
(ROAR)

2
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:11,108
HEH. COME ON YOU GUYS!
DON'T LET UP ON ME!

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,244
I NEED EVERYTHING YOU GOT!
NOW TAKE HIM DOWN!

4
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:20,417
GETTING A WIN AND SOLVING THE
PROBLEM AREN'T THE SAME.

5
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,918
[KANAMI]
WOOHOO!

6
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,488
BANG! BOOM! POW! SLAM! WOOHOO!

7
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,290
[NAOTSUGU]
FORTRESS STANCE!

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,793
I THINK I'M GOING TO TEST
OUT THESE NEW WEAPONS...

9
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,628
BY TAKING OFF YOUR HEAD!

10
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,963
[SOJIRO] WATCH CAREFULLY
AND LISTEN TO ME.

11
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:37,367
YOU MUST MAINTAIN AN ATTITUDE
OF CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT.

12
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:41,371
AND NEVER FOR A MOMENT DISCOUNT
TRAINING YOU'VE RECEIVED.

13
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:44,541
THIS IS IT! SHIROE, I NEED A
DISTRACTION FROM YOUR TEAM!

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,776
[KANAMI]
AWESOME, AWESOME!

15
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:49,313
FIVE HUNDRED GUARDS MEANS
ONE HECK OF A TREASURE!

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,715
I COULD NEVER HAVE FUN
LIKE THIS IN THE REAL WORLD.

17
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,183
NOT EVEN CLOSE!

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,684
I SEE IT NOW!

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,685
[SHIROE]
WILLIAM!

20
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,621
A LITTLE HELP HERE!

21
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:01,891
I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW
GOOD MY DINNER'S GONNA BE...

22
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:05,262
AFTER I GET DONE
KICKING ALL YOUR BUTTS!

23
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:41,391
(GRUNTING)

24
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,661
HEY PEOPLE, GOT YOUR
PUMPKINS OVER HERE!

25
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,797
(CHEERING)

26
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:52,302
[MAN 1]
FOR LADY MISA

27
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,470
[CROWD]
D. D. D.!

28
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,705
[MAN 2]
THANKS COMMANDER TAKAYAMA!

29
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:57,574
OOOOOH! I WANNA PLAY!

30
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:01,378
YOU OUGHTA KNOW BY NOW THAT
ORGANIZERS HAVE TO WORK, BABY!

31
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:02,579
UWAH...

32
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,547
(CHUCKLING)

33
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:04,848
[MARIELLE]
OH COME ON!

34
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:07,217
I WANNA PLAY TUG OF WAR!

35
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,259
[NYANTA]
HMM. SO TELL ME.

36
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,096
WHY EXACTLY DID WE NEED TO HAVE
AN AFTER HALLOWEEN EVENT, HRMM?

37
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:20,464
[MARIELLE]
WELL, YOU REMEMBER THE EVENT

38
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:21,598
WE HAD FOR HALLOWEEN, RIGHT?

39
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,467
THAT'S KINDA WHY I WAS ASKING...

40
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,603
THE GAME DEVELOPERS ALREADY HAVE
AN EVENT THIS TIME OF YEAR,

41
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:28,838
MONSTERS DROP PUMPKINS
WHEN THEY'RE BEATEN

42
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,275
DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS
OF THE MONTH, YOU DIG?

43
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,842
AND THAT'S JUST IT!

44
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,078
WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF PRIZE
PUMPKINS RIGHT HERE!

45
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,881
SO WHY NOT HAVE AN EVENT TO
FIND A WAY TO GIVE 'EM AWAY?

46
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:41,050
COUNT ON MARIELLE, THE PARTY
STRATEGIST, TO MAKE IT WORK!

47
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,819
[NYANTA]
NICE AIR GLASSES, GIRL.

48
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,555
[NYANTA] ONE THING'S FOR SURE.
(STRUGGLED GRUNTS)

49
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,124
[MARIELLE] HM?

50
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,826
[NYANTA] THIS CITY OF OURS HAS
BECOME A SMOOTH PLACE TO LIVE.

51
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:51,328
[MARIELLE]
YES IT HAS.

52
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:53,663
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW FAST IT HAS HAPPENED.

53
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:55,064
IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY

54
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,000
THAT WE GOT TRAPPED HERE
IN ELDER TALES.

55
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,336
I MEAN WE'VE STARTED A CITY,
SET UP A SYSTEM,

56
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,571
AND PUT TOGETHER
THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE

57
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,040
ALL IN A VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME.

58
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,879
YOU KNOW IT, AND EVERYONE'S
PUT IN A LOT OF WORK

59
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,015
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN,
EVEN LITTLE SERARA.

60
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,883
[SMASH] DON'T USE YOUR HANDS!
AND REMEMBER...

61
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:16,520
YOU GOTTA PAY FOR EVERY BUN
YOUR DROP OUT THERE!

62
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,022
EH! MMPH! EHH!

63
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,158
[SERARA, THINKING] I'M GOING TO
BEAT EVERYONE TO WIN THIS RACE

64
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:24,961
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE A
PUMPKIN PARTY WITH MISTER CAT!

65
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,264
(CHEERING)
JUST LOOK AT TOYA AND MINORI.

66
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:30,967
TOYA! YOU CAN'T DO
THIS WITH JUST ATTITUDE

67
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,303
ANTICIPATE WHERE
THE PHANTOM'S GOING!

68
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:36,340
GOT IT! OKAY! I CAN
TOTALLY DO THIS!

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,775
[NYANTA] ISUZU AND RUDY
ARE IN THE THICK OF IT, HMM?

70
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,110
[SMASH] ARE YOU READY?

71
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,878
DO ANY OF THESE
WANNABES‐NAY‐WHOS

72
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,880
THINK THEY CAN
ACTUALLY BEAT US?

73
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,482
AFTER ALL, OUR TEAMWORK
IS AMAZING,

74
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,517
AND OUR FOOTWORK IS NOTHING
SHORT OF MAGNIFICENT!

75
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,952
[SMASH]GET SET!
(HORN BLOWS)

76
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:51,288
RUDY! THEY'RE
STARTING WITHOUT US!

77
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:52,522
OH, COME ON!

78
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,362
(CROWD CHEERING)

79
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:01,565
WOW! I'VE NEVER SEEN AN
OBSTACLE COURSE LIKE THIS!

80
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:02,599
INCREDIBLY DONE!

81
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,201
THAT'S AKATSUKI
FOR YOU!

82
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,236
AMAZING!

83
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,306
FIRST PLACE GOES TO
AKATSUKI OF LOG HORIZON!

84
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:12,176
HEHE. I WILL MAKE SURE WE TAKE
HOME THE GRAND PRIZE, MY LORD!

85
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,811
[MINORI] MISS AKATSUKI!
[RUDY] (LAUGHING) WOOO!

86
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,945
[TOYA] THAT WAS REALLY SUPER,
MISS AKATSUKI!

87
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:16,946
[ISUZU] YEAH! YOU WERE GREAT!

88
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,615
(CHEERING) WOO!

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,720
I JUST WISH SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU
COULD BE OUT HERE TODAY!

90
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,522
I KNOW WHAT YOU
MEAN, BABY.

91
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:28,057
THEY'RE STILL HUNG UP
WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS.

92
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:29,493
[MARIELLE]
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME!

93
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,027
[NYANTA] MHMM!

94
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,631
[HENRIETTA] AH...

95
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:35,965
THE ARMOR'S EMPTY.

96
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,102
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT

97
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,170
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, YEAH. SO
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE,

98
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,472
BUT THEY'RE STILL
ROYAL GUARD ARMOR, RIGHT?

99
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,208
[HENRIETTA] AND THEY'RE STILL
NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING

100
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:45,609
UNLESS YOU TRY PICKING A FIGHT

101
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,412
WITH SOMEONE IN A
NON‐COMBAT ZONE

102
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:51,014
[NAOTSUGU] JUST NEVER BEEN
THIS CLOSE TO 'EM

103
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:54,251
IT'S SURE TAKING SHIROE
A WHILE TO GET THIS DONE...

104
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:57,020
MAKES ME WONDER IF
EVERYTHING IS GOING OKAY...

105
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:59,823
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S BEEN KINDA
ROUGH IN THERE FOR HIM.

106
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:03,127
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE WE BEEN HERE?

107
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:06,096
THE KUNIE TRIBE IS TRICKY.

108
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:08,165
[NAOTSUGU]
THEY'D HAVE TO BE...

109
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:09,833
THOSE NPCS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

110
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,136
CIRCULATING ALL THE
WORLD'S CURRENCY

111
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:14,171
[HENRIETTA]
IT ISN'T JUST BANKING.

112
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,040
THEY ALSO MAINTAIN AND
DEPLOY THE ROYAL GUARD,

113
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,475
ALONG WITH THE MAGICAL PATHWAYS

114
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,544
THAT RESPAWN MONSTERS
AND ADVENTURERS.

115
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:24,648
AND THEIR MAGIC BARRIERS KEEP
MONSTERS OUT OF THE CITIES.

116
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,153
[SHIROE] SO WE CAN'T COME
TO AN ARRANGEMENT?

117
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:32,589
TO DO SO WOULD BREAK LAWS
DATING BACK TO MY ANCESTORS

118
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:33,990
HMM...

119
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,561
[EINS] WELL THEN, DO YOU THINK
WE COULD TALK THE KUNIE

120
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:38,862
INTO GIVING US A LOAN?

121
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:42,065
[SHIROE]
NO, I WOULDN'T BET ON IT

122
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,368
THE GUILD BUILDING, WHICH
INCLUDES ALL LOCAL BANKING,

123
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:45,969
THE CATHEDRAL AND
THE TRADE CENTER

124
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,105
ARE AMONG THE RESOURCES
WE PURCHASED.

125
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:49,606
WE DID THAT IN ORDER TO PLACE
THEM

126
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,976
UNDER CONTROL OF THE
ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.

127
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:54,678
WE WANTED TO BE SURE THAT
NO ONE ELSE

128
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,580
WAS ABLE TO USE THEM
AS THEIR OWN.

129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,014
HOWEVER...

130
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:00,250
"HOWEVER", THE MAINTENANCE
COSTS ARE NUTS!

131
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,186
ALL THOSE BUILDINGS ARE
TAKING TEN MILLION IN GOLD

132
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,920
OUT OF OUR ACCOUNTS
EVERY MONTH!

133
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,623
NOW WAIT... I REMEMBER THE
PURCHASE OF THE GUILD BUILDING

134
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,159
AND IT WAS ONLY FIVE MILLION
IN GOLD AT THE TIME.

135
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,760
AND WE'RE PAYING
ALMOST DOUBLE THAT

136
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,329
TO HANG ON TO THEM
EVERY MONTH?

137
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,031
YEAH, AND THE ROUND TABLE
CONFERENCE IS GONNA WIND UP

138
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,401
GOING BANKRUPT BEFORE
TOO LONG...

139
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,236
[SOJIRO] WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD

140
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,205
OUR PARTIES OR
FESTIVALS ANYMORE.

141
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,607
[EINS] I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE ISSUE AT HAND HERE?

142
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,775
[WOODSTOCK]
HAS THIS THING GONE PUBLIC YET?

143
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,211
[SHIROE] NO.

144
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,214
IT WOULDN'T BE WISE TO MAKE
THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC,

145
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:32,182
NOT WITH UNWELCOME
EARS OUT THERE.

146
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:34,418
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MINAMI, AREN'T YOU?

147
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,620
YES, WE BELIEVE FROM
PLANT HWYADEN...

148
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,623
THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET ARE
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THEM.

149
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:42,326
I HEARD EVERYONE IN MINAMI BOWS
TO PLANT HWYADEN

150
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:43,993
LIKE IT'S SOME KIND
OF DICTATORSHIP.

151
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:46,096
YES, BUT THEY'RE DOING
OKAY, AREN'T THEY?

152
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,298
I'VE GOT A FRIEND OVER THERE
WHO TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT...

153
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,100
POLITICALLY THINGS
ARE KINDA SCREWED.

154
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,170
[SHIROE] NOT ALL DICTATORS
HURT THEIR PEOPLE, BUT...

155
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,604
[SOJIRO] YOU KNOW,

156
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:58,275
I SURE DO WISH KRUSTY AND
ISAAC'S GUILDS WERE BACK.

157
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,810
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] FATE DEALT
US A PRETTY BIG BLOW

158
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,978
WHEN THE GAME SERVER KICKED OFF

159
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,647
THE "RETURN OF THE
GOBLIN KING" EVENT

160
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:07,384
AND THE GOBLIN ARMY STARTED
STAMPEDING ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

161
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,719
AFTER THEIR VICTORY
IN THE RAID AT ZANTLEAF,

162
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,922
THE AKIHABARA ADVENTURERS BEGAN
TO INVADE THE GOBLIN ARMY'S

163
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:15,292
STRONGHOLD IN SEVENTH FALL.

164
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,529
KRUSTY AND ISAAC SERVE AS
OUR GENERALS OUT THERE.

165
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,531
KARASHIN AND AKANEYA
ARE ALSO THERE

166
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,533
FOR TECHNICAL AND
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT.

167
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,336
BUT THE BATTLE GUILDS
HAVE IT COVERED

168
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,274
I DON'T THINK MINAMI'S GOING
TO POSE MUCH OF A THREAT

169
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,875
TO US IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

170
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,578
FINE, SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

171
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:36,346
(EXHALE)

172
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,516
(EXCITED CHATTERING)

173
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:42,119
[SERARA]
HEY! THANKS FOR WAITING!

174
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,288
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
A LITTLE HINT OF PUMPKIN

175
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,890
IN MANY OF THE ITEMS
ON THE MENU TONIGHT.

176
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,093
(GROANING)
YEAH, IT'S TASTY

177
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,495
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
HE PUT PUMPKIN IN EVERYTHING

178
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,598
CHIEF NYANTA, DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING WITHOUT PUMPKIN IN IT?

179
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:57,267
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
NUTRIENTS ARE IN A PUMPKIN?

180
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,036
NOT TO MENTION THIS PUPPY
CAN KEEP YOU WARM AT NIGHT.

181
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,038
YOU'RE PARTICIPATING IN
A PUMPKIN FEAST,

182
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,673
DON'T DISRESPECT, LITTLE MAN.

183
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,041
I'M SORRY, CHIEF...

184
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:07,477
URR... WAHHH... I WANT MEAT!

185
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:10,013
[ISUZU]
WELL D. D. D. CAME IN FIRST.

186
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,681
AND THE BLACK SWORD
KNIGHTS TOOK SECOND.

187
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:14,151
[MINORI] TENTH PLACE IS ACTUALLY
STILL PRETTY GOOD FOR US.

188
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,920
YEAH... SO WHAT'S THAT THING
YOU GOT THERE, MINORI?

189
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,555
(STRANGE MOOING)
SOME WEIRD OLD GUY

190
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,890
JUST WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID IT
WAS OUR PRIZE FOR TENTH PLACE.

191
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,426
WELL IT'S KINDA FREAKY!

192
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:25,028
[TOYA] FU‐WOAH! THAT'S A
STUFFED FUZZY GOAT SLIME!

193
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,564
[RUDY] REALLY!? IS THIS ONE OF
THOSE DISGUSTINGLY CUTE ITEMS

194
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,399
I'VE BEEN HEARING
EVERYONE TALK ABOUT?

195
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,935
BOYS ARE SO CRAZY ABOUT THINGS
THAT ARE ALL GRODY, AREN'T THEY?

196
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,737
WHEN IT COMES TO
IMMATURE STUFF LIKE THAT,

197
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,505
YOU'RE SUCH AN ADULT,
MISTER CAT!

198
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,073
[MARIELLE] WELL THAT'S
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR...

199
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:38,542
[SERARA, UNDER] YOU'RE SO
GROWN UP AND REFINED

200
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:39,876
[HENRIETTA] OKAY, I'M HERE,
WHERE IS SHIROE?

201
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,945
UH MINORI...
IS IT JUST ME OR...

202
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:43,513
DID BIG BROTHER SHIROE
PULL A NO‐SHOW

203
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:45,382
FOR ANOTHER ONE
OF OUR PARTIES?

204
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:48,718
HMMM... APPARENTLY HE'S
CATCHING UP ON HIS WORK AGAIN.

205
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:50,887
HMMM...

206
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:52,256
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

207
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:55,392
HIS BAD HABIT IS CATCHING UP
WITH HIM AGAIN?

208
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,262
I DON'T LIKE IT...

209
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,297
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE
ONLY WAY TO GET IT DONE.

210
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,799
WHEWW!
(LAUGHING)

211
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,335
HEY! WE SHOULD PRESENT THIS
GLORIOUSLY SLIMY TROPHY

212
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,970
TO MASTER SHIROE!

213
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,037
UH, TOTALLY!

214
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:09,173
THAT'S AN AWFUL IDEA.

215
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:10,140
(LAUGH)

216
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,641
HEY SHIROE!

217
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:12,642
GOOD WORK OUT THERE!

218
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:13,677
HEY, THANKS.

219
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:14,978
MY LORD! MY LORD!

220
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,213
(STRANGE MOO)
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS...

221
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,247
WE GOT IT FOR TENTH PLACE

222
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,583
UH... Y‐YEAH? THAT'S GREAT!

223
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:22,852
MASTER SHIROE!
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT OUT!

224
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:25,289
UH? OH UH, THANK YOU MINORI.

225
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,657
SO UH, I GUESS
WORK'S BEEN DIFFICULT

226
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,959
(DISAPPOINTED MOO)
YEAH, KIND OF...

227
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,364
[SHIROE] SO THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL ALL OF YOU.

228
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:35,899
OH YEAH?

229
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,201
OKAY...

230
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:38,902
WHAT KINDA NEWS IS IT?

231
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:41,805
RIGHT...
IT'S LIKE THIS...

232
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:43,940
I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO
LEAVE THE CITY FOR A WHILE.

233
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,409
(GASPS)

234
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,044
NO YOU CAN'T...!
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING!

235
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:50,079
DON'T FORGET THAT
CHRISTMAS IS COMING UP!

236
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,515
THERE! HA! I GOT YOU!

237
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:52,616
YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEFORE
CHRISTMAS, MISTER STRATEGIST!

238
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,518
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

239
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,334
HMMM...
(DOOR OPENING)

240
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:12,001
WELCOME BACK.

241
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:13,437
HOW'D IT LOOK?

242
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:14,904
IT'S FINE OUT THERE.

243
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:18,442
A LITTLE SNOW... AND A LITTLE
BIT OF A BREEZE.

244
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,776
[SHIROE]
THAT'S GOOD. THANKS.

245
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,545
[NAOTSUGU]
SURE THING!

246
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:23,980
[NAOTSUGU]
HERE YOU GO...

247
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,948
OH...?

248
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,416
MMM.

249
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:30,154
SO... YOU GONNA TELL
ME WHAT'S GOING ON

250
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,156
OR ARE YOU GONNA
JUST KEEP GRUNTING?

251
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,423
HMM?

252
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:36,360
IT'S BEEN TEN DAYS
SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

253
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,961
[MINORI]
YOU'RE LEAVING AKIHABARA?

254
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,530
PLEASE TALK TO US, WHAT BROUGHT
THIS ON ALL OF A SUDDEN?

255
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,898
[SHIROE]
I KNOW I'VE BEEN

256
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,467
A LITTLE SECRETIVE
ABOUT THIS WITH EVERYONE...

257
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,535
BUT HERE'S THE THING,
YOU GUYS...

258
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,837
THE CITY IS IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

259
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:49,973
(GASPS)

260
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,608
[SHIROE]
I CAN'T GO INTO DETAILS...

261
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,412
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO HANDLE IT.

262
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:57,714
OF COURSE, MY LORD...

263
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:58,882
COULD YOU...

264
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,417
TELL US WHERE YOU'RE
GOING AT LEAST?

265
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:01,985
[SHIROE]
I REALLY CAN'T, ISUZU...

266
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,453
I DON'T LIKE IT...

267
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:05,355
I WISH OUR GUILD MASTER
COULD TRUST US MORE...

268
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:06,656
BUT IT'S FINE.

269
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:08,358
[MINORI, THINKING]
HE HAS A GOOD REASON.

270
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,561
THERE MIGHT BE A SPY FROM MINAMI
IN THE CITY SOMEWHERE.

271
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:13,230
[MINORI]
A LEAK FROM ANY ONE OF US,

272
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,031
NO MATTER HOW "SMALL"
OR "HARMLESS"

273
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:15,999
COULD CAUSE A PROBLEM.

274
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,201
[SHIROE]
THAT'S RIGHT.

275
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,568
[RUDY]
WELL THAT MAKES SENSE I GUESS.

276
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,604
THAT'S ONE WAY TO KEEP
US QUIET ANYWAY.

277
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:23,207
HAVE YOU TOLD ANYONE ON
THE ROUND TABLE ABOUT THIS?

278
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,641
[SHIROE]
KRUSTY NEEDS TO KNOW,

279
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,811
ALONG WITH SOJIRO AND ISAAC.
COMBAT GUILD LEADERS.

280
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,513
IF ANYONE CAN DO THIS,

281
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,316
GUILD LEADER SHIROE‐ECHHI WILL
FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK!

282
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,084
(ALL AGREEING)

283
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,519
THANKS A LOT, CHIEF.

284
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,121
AND NOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
THAT STRAIGHTENED OUT.

285
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,122
NAOTSUGU, I NEED‐

286
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,190
NO, YOU DON'T...
HUH?

287
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,159
PITCHERS NEED
THEIR CATCHERS, BUD.

288
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,793
AND AN ENCHANTER
NEEDS HIS GUARDIAN.

289
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:47,097
NO WAY I'M STAYING HERE,
YOU GOT THAT?

290
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:47,997
(EXHALE)

291
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:48,898
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD!

292
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:49,899
HUH?

293
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,401
I‐I'M GOING, TOO!

294
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,637
AKATSUKI, I NEED YOU
TO STAY BEHIND IN THE CITY.

295
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:54,704
OH?

296
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:56,273
(INHALES)

297
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,507
I'VE GOT A SPECIAL TASK

298
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:00,043
THAT ONLY YOU ARE
CAPABLE OF COMPLETING.

299
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,714
SO, WHY DID WE COME
ALL THE WAY UP HERE

300
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:06,350
IN THE SNOW LOOKIN' FOR CASH?

301
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,185
FOR ONE THING, YOU CAN'T GET
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

302
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,987
BY SLAYING MONSTERS
OR COMPLETING THE KNOWN QUESTS.

303
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,289
THAT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG.

304
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,857
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

305
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:15,159
THE GRAND TOTAL...

306
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,760
SITS SOMEWHERE AROUND
EIGHTY TRILLION.

307
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,295
(TOCCATA AND FUGUE PLAYS)
WOOOOOAAAAHHHH!

308
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,063
E‐EIGHTY TRILLION?!

309
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:21,265
RIGHT.

310
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,899
I DID THE MATH
AND FIGURED OUT

311
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,768
HOW MUCH EVERY ADVENTURER
IN THE WORLD HAD

312
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,137
AND EVEN THEN WE'D FALL
WELL SHORT OF OUR GOAL.

313
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,473
WAIT, WOULD WE NEED ALL OF THAT
JUST TO KEEP CONTROL

314
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,775
OF EVERYTHING
WE ALREADY HAVE?

315
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,976
HMMM?

316
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:35,812
[REGAN]
EXCUSE ME...

317
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,114
HMM?

318
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,648
UM, MASTER SHIROE.

319
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:41,451
PARDON ME, BUT IT WOULD APPEAR
YOUR GUEST HAS ARRIVED

320
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,953
THEN WHAT'RE YOU LURKIN'
AROUND LIKE A CREEP FOR?

321
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,358
IT'S BEEN QUITE A
WHILE HASN'T IT?

322
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,095
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

323
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,097
LET ME INTRODUCE
YOU TO REGAN.

324
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,800
HOWEVER, YOU MAY KNOW HIM BETTER
AS THE MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE.

325
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,268
[NAOTSUGU, THINKING]
I'VE SEEN HIS NAME

326
00:13:58,368 --> 00:13:59,703
IN FLAVOR TEXT LIKE
A ZILLION TIMES,

327
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,405
BUT THERE WASN'T
ANYTHING IN THERE

328
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,806
SAYING HOW SKETCHY
LOOKIN' HE WAS.

329
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,209
I SEE IT, BUT I STILL
DON'T BELIEVE IT.

330
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,810
[KINJO]
YES, OF COURSE.

331
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,214
I SERVE AS THE LIAISON
OFFICER FOR THE KUNIE TRIBE.

332
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,216
MY NAME IS KINJO.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

333
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,451
OH, IT IS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, TOO!

334
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,454
WHAT AN HONOR TO MEET A
MEMBER OF THE KUNIE TRIBE.

335
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:18,522
SUCH A TREAT.

336
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:19,889
LIKEWISE.

337
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,259
I FIND MYSELF BEFORE
THE MASTER STRATEGIST

338
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,827
WHO REPRESENTS ADVENTURERS.

339
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:27,664
AS WELL AS THE ONE AND ONLY
MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE, REGAN.

340
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,466
[KINJO]
I DOUBT EVEN MY GREAT ANCESTORS

341
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,401
COULD HAVE PREDICTED SUCH
AN IMPRESSIVE GATHERING.

342
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:32,902
(EXHALES)

343
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,771
IT TRULY IS WONDERFUL
TO HAVE YOU JOINING US.

344
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,840
THE FACE THAT YOU'VE
AGREED TO THIS MEETING

345
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,376
MAKES THE GRAVITY OF THIS
GATHERING QUIET ASTONISHING.

346
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,478
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

347
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,380
WHEN I THINK OF THE
POWER OF THE KUNIE TRIBE

348
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,616
AND THE ARTS AND SPELLS OF
THE MAGIC USER'S CIVILIZATION,

349
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:49,219
MY HEART JUST SWELLS
WITH ANTICIPATION!

350
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,520
ANTICIPATION?

351
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,257
OH YES! EVEN MASTER
SHIROE CAN'T HELP

352
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:54,824
BUT BE JUST GIDDY
THINKING ABOUT IT!

353
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:57,561
REALLY? DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A BIT MUCH?

354
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:59,696
(EXHALES)

355
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,098
[SHIROE]
LET'S GET BACK TO THE REASON

356
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:02,566
I ASKED YOU HERE, ALL RIGHT?

357
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,768
[KINJO] I REMEMBER YOU SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT FUNDING.

358
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,736
DID YOU NEED A LOAN FROM US?

359
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:10,240
[SHIROE] YES. WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS BRIEFLY IN THE CITY.

360
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,675
[KINJO]
BUT YOU STILL WANTED TO COME

361
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,210
ALL THE WAY UP HERE
TO NEGOTIATE.

362
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,480
I'M GUESSING THAT WAS TO PROVE
YOU KNEW OUR WHEREABOUTS?

363
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,083
REGAN HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

364
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,817
[KINJO]
OH, REALLY

365
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,953
AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S IN
THE RECORDS AT MIRROR LAKE?

366
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,124
[SHIROE] NOT PRECISELY,
BUT WITH HIS HELP,

367
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,725
I WAS ABLE TO DEDUCE THAT
THE KUNIE TRIBE'S VILLAGE

368
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:31,161
IS NEAR THE
TEAR STONE MOUNTAINS.

369
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,631
I SUPPOSE IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING,
"HEY, I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE."

370
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,634
HONESTLY, AS THREATS GO,
IT'S PRETTY CLICHE.

371
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,036
[KINJO] ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,

372
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:43,006
BUT I'M AFRAID A LOAN
SIMPLY IS NOT POSSIBLE.

373
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:45,175
YOU ALREADY KNOW.

374
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,643
ALREADY KNOW WHAT?

375
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:49,946
THAT IT WOULD VIOLATE EDICTS
LAID DOWN BY MY ANCESTORS.

376
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,915
(EXHALE) HMM...

377
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,017
[SHIROE, THINKING] IT WOULD SEEM
MY RESEARCH WAS DEAD ON.

378
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:57,121
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ITS
FOR A LOAN OR AN INVESTMENT,

379
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,224
THE BANKS HERE DON'T CONTRIBUTE
TO INCREASING THE MONEY SUPPLY.

380
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,392
BANK ARE JUST THAT, BANKS.

381
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,562
PLACES TO PUT YOUR MONEY AND
GET IT BACK WHEN YOU WANT IT.

382
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:09,399
MONEY LENDING,
EVEN FOR A FAIR INTEREST RATE,

383
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,568
ISN'T A PRACTICE IN THIS WORLD.

384
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,670
(ROAR)

385
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,107
[SHIROE, THINKING] SO BASICALLY,
IF YOU WANT GOLD...

386
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,213
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE BUSINESS
OF DESTROYING MONSTERS.

387
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:26,316
AND THAT MEANS THERE'S ONE JOB
AND ONE WAY TO GET PAID FOR IT.

388
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,252
NO OTHER CURRENCIES.

389
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,589
OKAY SO LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING, KINJO.

390
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,325
IS THE ONLY WAY TO EARN
GOLD TO DEFEAT MONSTERS?

391
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,026
YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

392
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,329
AND OCCASIONALLY WE CAN
GO ON A DUNGEON QUESTION,

393
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,831
[SHIROE] AND WE CAN GET HUNDREDS
OF GOLD PIECES THAT WAY?

394
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,600
[KINJO]
OF COURSE. YOU ARE, AFTER ALL,

395
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,235
SHOWING A GREAT AMOUNT
OF BRAVERY.

396
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,771
[SHIROE] IF THE KUNIE TRIBE
IS UNWILLING TO GIVE US A LOAN,

397
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,839
[SHIROE]
I MUST CONSIDER ANOTHER OPTION.

398
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,741
I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO
TAKE THAT GOLD

399
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,643
FROM ITS CENTRAL
DISTRIBUTION POINT.

400
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:56,045
I IMAGINE THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU
A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE.

401
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,714
I'M SURE YOU'D
WANT TO AVOID THAT.

402
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,516
EH? HMM...

403
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,551
UH? HUH?

404
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:02,886
WAIT A MINUTE, SHIROE!

405
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,754
YOU SAYING WHAT I THINK
YOU'RE SAYING?

406
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:06,756
[NAOTSUGU, THINKING] OKAY, SO
THAT'S HOW THE GAME WORKS:

407
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,825
WE BEAT A MONSTER, GOLD POPS UP.

408
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,394
PRACTICALLY OUT OF NOWHERE.

409
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,596
IT JUST SHOOTS UP. INSTANTLY.

410
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,564
I MEAN IT MAKES SENSE
IN A GAME.

411
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,200
HACK, SLASH, GET GOLD.

412
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,002
MONSTERS RESPAWN.
HACK, SLASH, GET MORE GOLD.

413
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,971
AND SO BASICALLY, SHIROE THINKS
THERE MUST BE A SOURCE

414
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,974
OF ALL THE COINS THAT APPEAR
WHEN MONSTERS COME BACK TO LIFE.

415
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,610
THAT'S A HELL OF A RISK, BUDDY,

416
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,178
'CAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE

417
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,847
WHO THINKS SOMETHING
LIKE THAT EVEN EXISTS.

418
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,217
AND YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS?

419
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,584
THE SPIRITUAL THEORY EXPLAINS

420
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,453
HOW THE MONSTERS
COME BACK TO LIFE.

421
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:39,523
BUT WHY ARE THEY REINCARNATED
WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF RICHES?!

422
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,125
WELL OF COURSE!

423
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,793
IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE THAT
THERE'D BE A MECHANISM IN PLACE!

424
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:46,663
NOT ONLY DID MY STUDIES FIND
THAT THERE WAS A MECHANISM,

425
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,598
BUT SOMEONE BEHIND IT
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE!

426
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:49,833
AND VOILA!

427
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,535
I FOUND THE KUNIE!

428
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,671
A TRIBE IN CHARGE
OF ALL THE GOLD.

429
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,908
[REGAN] IN THE LOWEST LAYER
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM,

430
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:02,479
MY TEXT SAID THERE IS A
GIGANTIC WHIRLPOOL OF GOLD

431
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,080
THAT DAZZLES THE EYE!

432
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,883
AND IT WAS SEALED AWAY
BY A MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE

433
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:09,653
FIFTEEN GENERATIONS AGO.

434
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:11,188
HAH. OH MY...

435
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:14,491
[SHIROE] I'VE ALREADY VERIFIED
THAT IT'S THERE.

436
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,493
THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S
BEEN SEALED OFF

437
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,162
WITH MAGIC FROM MIRROR LAKE.

438
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:21,998
CRACKING IT OPEN
SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD.

439
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,301
NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT
YOU WERE OUT THERE FOR.

440
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:27,571
[KINJO] INTERESTING. SO YOU
SPENT YOUR TIME RESEARCHING US,

441
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,174
SO YOU CAN ACQUIRE
A WHIRLPOOL OF GOLD.

442
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:31,741
YES.

443
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,143
AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE

444
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,145
ALL THIS GOLD BELONGS
TO MY TRIBE.

445
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,913
I AM.

446
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,382
WELL THEN, WHEN YOU SAY

447
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,217
YOU WANT TO "TAKE" THE GOLD
FROM ITS SOURCE...

448
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:43,453
DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOU'RE
INTENDING TO "STEAL" IT FROM US?

449
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:44,821
ARE YOU SAYING
THE ROUND TABLE

450
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,856
HAS DESIGNS ON
PILLAGING OUR GOLD?

451
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,159
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE
REASON I CALLED YOU

452
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,294
WE DO NO WANT TO STAND

453
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:53,663
ON ANTAGONISTIC TERMS
WITH THE KUNIE TRIBE.

454
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:55,465
I KNOW WHAT MY TRIBE
DOES WITH IT,

455
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,167
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT?

456
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:01,805
HM?

457
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:08,011
IF I WERE TO TELL YOU,

458
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,315
WOULD IT CHANGE IN ANY WAY
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL HELP US?

459
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:13,683
(EXHALES)

460
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,585
(LOG BREAKING, FIRE CRACKLING)

461
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,354
[KINJO]
I'M AFRAID NOT...

462
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:20,090
THERE'S STILL THE MATTER
OF THE ANCIENT LAW.

463
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,827
(NAOTSUGU AND SHIROE EXHALE)

464
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,900
[REGAN]
SO WHY DID MASTER SHIROE

465
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,970
BOTHER DISCUSSING THIS
WITH MASTER KINJO AT ALL?

466
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,872
IT OCCURS TO ME THAT YOU
COULD'VE GONE DOWN THERE

467
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:39,176
AND STARTED STEALING
THE GOLD, ALREADY.

468
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:40,844
[NAOTSUGU] IT MIGHT BE TRUE
THAT, FROM TIME TO TIME,

469
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,979
SHIROE IS THE
"VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES".

470
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,949
BUT NOT WHEN HE HAS A CHANCE
TO MAKE A FRIEND INSTEAD.

471
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,984
HUH? MAKE A FRIEND?

472
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:49,586
[NAOTSUGU]
HONESTY'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

473
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:52,156
AND TIPTOEING AROUND THE TRUTH
LIKE THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A LIE.

474
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,724
HE'S ALMOST TOO HONEST
FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

475
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,025
[REGAN]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

476
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,327
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SIT THERE,

477
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,329
AND WATCH BOTH OF 'EM
TALK TO EACH OTHER...

478
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,166
THEY BOTH KEEP SECRETS.

479
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,501
WHEN YOU MAKE A NEW BUSINESS
CONTACT WITH SOMEONE,

480
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:05,869
YOU GOTTA DROP
SOME OF THAT CRAP,

481
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:07,637
LEARN ABOUT WHAT MAKES
THE OTHER GUY TICK,

482
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:08,938
AND THEN BE UP FRONT ABOUT

483
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,775
WHAT YOUR SIDE IN THE
NEGOTIATION WANTS...

484
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,111
FINALLY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE COMPROMISES,

485
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:17,614
AND WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LEVEL,
YOU USUALLY GET WHAT YOU WANT.

486
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,149
[REGAN]
OHHH...

487
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,685
DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE A
MERCHANT, MASTER NAOTSUGU?

488
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,953
LET'S JUST SAY I CAN
TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.

489
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,322
"BIZ‐NESS..."

490
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:26,856
I'M BETTING THAT
JUST HAPPENS TO BE

491
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,358
A NEGOTIATION TALENT.

492
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,329
OKAY... LOOKS LIKE I NEED
TO GO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

493
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,609
ALL RIGHT... SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK HE MEANT BY THAT?

494
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,643
HM?

495
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,345
[KINJO]
IT'S SETTLED...

496
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,946
WE'LL MEET AT
THE MEANDERING RIVER

497
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,681
AND FORGOTTEN
UNDERGROUND GARDEN...

498
00:20:51,781 --> 00:20:54,017
THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH
THE GOLD COINS THAT APPEAR

499
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,586
FROM THE VOID,
RETURN TO THE VOID.

500
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,054
[BOTH]
HUH?

501
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,357
I'D SUGGEST BRINGING
SOME FRIENDS...

502
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,492
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
NEEDING THEM, I'M SURE.

503
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:06,096
IT WON'T BE EASY GETTING DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FOUNTAIN.

504
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,997
WE'LL MONITOR YOUR
GROUP'S PERFORMANCE...

505
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,567
IF YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
CHALLENGE IS SATISFACTORY,

506
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,936
WE WILL CONSIDER YOUR REQUEST.

507
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,272
[SHIROE]
"BRING A FEW FRIENDS..."

508
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,407
I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

509
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,908
IT'LL BE A HUGE BATTLE.

510
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,710
WE'LL NEED A FULL RAID PARTY.

511
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,078
WHOA...

512
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:26,850
[SHIROE] THE DEPTHS OF PALM
HAS A RAID ZONE AT THE BOTTOM.

513
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,819
IF WE DON'T CLEAR IT,
WE DON'T GET THE GOLD.

514
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,456
I'M NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE EASY.

515
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,790
[NAOTSUGU]
WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED

516
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,159
A RAID PARTY FOR THAT.

517
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,726
[SHIROE] YEAH, BUT THERE'S
NO WAY WE CAN CALL

518
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,062
SOMEONE FROM THE ROUND TABLE
TO JOIN US.

519
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:41,165
WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE
OF MINAMI FINDING OUT.

520
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,000
THEY COULD ONLY SEE IT AS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A MOVE.

521
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:47,704
OKAY SO WHO DO
WE CALL FOR HELP?

522
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,073
I THINK I HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND.

523
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,549
CAREFUL MY LORD...

524
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:09,159
[SHIROE]
I BLEW IT...

525
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:13,297
I DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR
ALL THE VARIABLES

526
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:17,167
AND I DIDN'T TRUST EVERYONE
TO GET THEIR PARTS DONE.

527
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,544
[SHIROE]
AKATSUKI? DID YOU... DIE?

528
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:28,945
MM‐HMM.

529
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,551
YEAH, WELL...
I DIDN'T MAKE IT EITHER.

530
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,353
SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE...

531
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,257
[AKATSUKI]
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

532
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:43,627
IT WAS A PRETTY CRAZY
CHRISTMAS EVE, MY LORD.

533
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:16,853
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
THEY HAVE DESCENDED UPON

534
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:18,255
THE NORTHERN LAND.

535
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,924
AND THERE, THEY FIND A MAN.
WILLIAM MASSACHUSETTS.

536
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,059
GUILD MASTER OF
A PROUD RAID‐GUILD,

537
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,429
THIS MAN TOLD SHIROE
HE WASN'T INTERESTED

538
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,998
IN PROTECTING AKIHABARA BUT,
THERE IS ONE OTHER MAN.

539
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,567
HIS NAME IS DEMICAS.

540
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,069
SHIROE TOOK HIS LIFE ONCE.

541
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:37,241
[SHIROE]
STAND UP... ONE MORE TIME!
