1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,039
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] SO THIS IS
ULLR OF THE NINTH GARDEN...

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,341
THE ABYSSAL SHAFT'S
FINAL RAID BOSS.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,144
EVEN IF I HAD ALL OF SILVER
SWORD WITH ME RIGHT NOW,

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,080
WE WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HIM... NOT EVEN CLOSE.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,216
HE'S NOT JUST ANOTHER KINJO...

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,152
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THEM IS

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,754
THE COLOR OF THEIR BREASTPLATES.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,790
OTHER THAN THAT... THEY'RE
PERFECT COPIES OF EACH OTHER.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,692
MUST BE SOME SORT OF
KUNIE TRIBE THING

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,193
HUH?

11
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,399
OF COURSE... HE HAS TO
BE GETTING WORRIED.

12
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,236
I MEAN, WE KEEP COMING
BACK EVERY TIME WE DIE.

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,705
IT'S LIKE HE'S FACING
A PACK OF ZOMBIES.

14
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,607
WE NEVER STOP COMING...

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,044
THE ONLY THING KEEPING HIM HERE
AND FACING US

16
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,946
IS PRIDE AT THIS POINT.

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,316
THE PRIDE OF THE WHOLE OF YAMATO
AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

18
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,719
(DEATH SCREAM)

19
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,090
[ALL] WHOA!

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,892
(OOHS AND AHHS)

21
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,226
AAAW YEAH!

22
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,696
WAY TO GO GUYS! WOOHOO!

23
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,871
WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE MORE
LEFT! TAKE HIM DOWN!

24
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,841
(SCREAMING)

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,843
[DEMICAS]
(WHIMPERING) NO!

26
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,079
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,720
I'VE COME HERE TO SPEAK WITH
KINJO OF THE KUNIE TRIBE.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,922
[KINJO] SINCE YOU HAVE
PERSEVERED AND SUCCESSFULLY

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,526
REACHED OUR INNER SANCTUM,
YOU MAY NOW HAVE YOUR AUDIENCE.

30
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,591
NOW THAT I'VE MADE IT ALL THE
WAY HERE,

31
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,760
I'M ASSUMING THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE GOLD COINS RECYCLE?

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,530
THAT IS CORRECT. AND
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT,

33
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,666
SO I'LL SHARE EVERYTHING YOU
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE.

34
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,503
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE GOLD
IN YAMATO WAS CREATED.

35
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,771
AND IT ALL RETURNS
HERE ONCE IT'S SPENT.

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,875
THE KUNIE ARE HERE TO GUARD THIS
PROCESS, BUT IT IS SO INCREDIBLY

37
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,546
ANCIENT EVEN WE DO NOT FULLY
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS.

38
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,181
THE GOLD FLOWS IN A GREAT
GLIMMERING RIVER,

39
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,384
RE‐SPAWNING MONSTERS.
IT'S PRACTICALLY ENDLESS.

40
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,656
THE ENGINE OF THIS IS BURIED
DEEP UNDERNEATH YAMATO'S LAND.

41
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,626
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN COMMITTED TO
PROTECTING THE GOLD RESERVE,

42
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,662
AND NO ONE'S EVER
MADE IT THIS FAR...

43
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,071
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THIS SYSTEM DISTRIBUTES

44
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,472
THE GOLD TO MONSTERS.

45
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,708
BACK IN OUR GAMING DAYS,
THE GOLD WAS JUST PART OF

46
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,177
THE PROGRAMMING. DIDN'T
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

47
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,047
THERE WASN'T ANY MALICE
OR MISINFORMATION.

48
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,315
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] BUT NOW THAT
NPC PEOPLE OF THE LAND

49
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,985
ARE AWARE OF OUR SITUATION,
THEY MIGHT START WONDERING

50
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,555
WHY THE KUNIE RESURRECT
MONSTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

51
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,490
AND SINCE THE KUNIE ARE NPCS,
THAT MIGHT PUT THEM ON THE WRONG

52
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,860
SIDE OF A VERY LONG,
ONGOING CONFLICT.

53
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,529
IF I WERE IN THEIR TRIBE,
I'D BE A LITTLE WARY, TOO.

54
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,798
THEIR PERSPECTIVE
MUST BE CONSIDERED.

55
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,499
HERE'S THE DEAL,

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,434
WE WOULD LIKE TO
KEEP YOUR SECRET.

57
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,036
IT CAN BE SAFE WITH US.

58
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,273
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
THE KUNIE TRIBE HAVE UPHELD,

59
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,441
YOU ARE ENTITLED TO
TAKE THE GOLD...

60
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,644
HOWEVER THERE COULD BE
A PROBLEM I'M AFRAID.

61
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,345
IT CENTERS AROUND
THE INTERPRETATION

62
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,881
OF OUR ANCIENT EDICTS.

63
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,084
MUCH OF THE TEXT HAS BEEN LOST
OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY.

64
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,753
TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE

65
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,723
A THOUSAND COINS OR A
HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM.

66
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,560
I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER DUTY... AND
IT INVOLVES PASSING ON THE WORDS

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,897
OF MY ANCESTORS AS
A WARNING TO YOU.

68
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,332
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
IT REALLY IS A LOT OF GOLD.

69
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,535
BUT EVEN SO,

70
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,638
JUST TO THINK OF ALL THE
PEOPLE I COULD HELP WITH THIS.

71
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,040
I WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING
BACK TO EVERYONE.

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,644
"BE WARY OF THE MISFORTUNE
THAT COMES WITH FORTUNE.

73
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,313
THESE GREAT RICHES
ARE NOT RICHES.

74
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,215
TAKE THESE WORDS TO HEART,

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,885
OR THY INNER BEAST WILL
CONSUME OUR WORLD."

76
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,654
THUS, IT WAS WRITTEN.

77
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,155
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
BACK IN THE MOUNTAINS,

78
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,424
I COULDN'T TELL KINJO
WHAT I WAS AFTER.

79
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,327
BUT TODAY, I'M GOING
TO DO EXACTLY THAT!

80
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,563
(ROAR)
[SHIROE] UH?

81
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,699
(SHIROE EXHALES)

82
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,802
MM?

83
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,846
[KINJO]
WHAT WAS THAT...?

84
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,949
[SHIROE] OKAY, I HAVE BOUND AND
FINALIZED YOUR CONTRACT WITH US.

85
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,418
THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE
DOES NOT WANT YOUR GOLD.

86
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,889
AND WE DON'T NEED THE
GUILD BUILDING TITLE

87
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,658
IT'S OBSOLETE NOW.

88
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,560
IT HAS SERVED IT'S PURPOSE...

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,427
WE USED THE SYSTEM
TO PROTECT US UNTIL

90
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,631
WE ULTIMATELY LEARNED
TO DO IT OURSELVES

91
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,900
WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE HELP YOU
OFFERED US

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,268
IN PROTECTING AKIHABARA,

93
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,937
BUT WE'RE JUST IN
A BETTER PLACE NOW.

94
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,774
IF SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE CITY
WERE TO THREATEN US...

95
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,075
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

96
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,844
WHAT YOU JUST WITNESSED WAS
A CONTRACT BINDING TECHNIQUE

97
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,480
AND ALL I NEEDED TO
DO TO EXECUTE IT...

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,084
WAS TEAR THE CONTRACT IN HALF,
WE'RE DONE.

99
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,452
THERE'S NOTHING
HIDDEN WITHIN IT.

100
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,023
WE WILL TRANSFER OUR
TITLES TO THE GUILD HALL,

101
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,693
CATHEDRAL AND THE OVERALL
CITY OF AKIHABARA,

102
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:36,496
INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS
TO THE YAMATO SERVER FORTH WITH.

103
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,700
PLUS THIS TERMINATING THE
CONTRACT WILL MAKE THOSE

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,468
TRANSACTIONS PERMANENT.
[KINJO] UH...

105
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,439
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
WE PURCHASED ALL OF AKIHABARA'S

106
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,810
PRIMARY INSTITUTIONS TO KEEP
ANYONE FROM ABUSING THEM.

107
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,146
HOWEVER, ALL OF THIS WAS
DRAINING THE ROUND TABLE'S

108
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,415
FINANCES. RUNNING
US DRY OF CAPITAL.

109
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,051
WHICH IS WHY WE APPROACHED
THEM FOR A LOAN.

110
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,553
WE EXPLORED OTHER POSSIBILITIES

111
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,822
AND DISCUSSED OTHER
WAYS TO GET IT DONE...

112
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,425
FINALLY, WE DECIDED ON
MOUNTING THIS EXPEDITION.

113
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,894
I SEE... SO ALL THAT GOLD FROM
AKIHABARA

114
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,230
WAS YOU PURCHASING
ALL THE BUILDINGS.

115
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,433
[SHIROE] CORRECT. I'M SURPRISED
TO KNOW THAT AS MANAGERS

116
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,468
OF ALL THE GOLD YOU
WEREN'T AWARE OF THAT.

117
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,038
THE CONDITIONS FOR THE
TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN MET,

118
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,273
SO THE FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASES
RETURN HERE IN EXCHANGE

119
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,643
FOR THE CONTRACT. THAT'S
HOW IT'S DRAWN UP.

120
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,545
[KINJO] AND YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

121
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,047
JUST TO EXPLAIN THAT
TO ME, PERSONALLY?

122
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,583
IN A WAY, YES.

123
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,053
THAT STILL LEAVES THE
QUESTION ABOUT THE LOAN.

124
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,855
I WAS JUST GETTING TO THAT.

125
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,590
IN ADDITION... WE'D
LIKE TO PURCHASE

126
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,224
ALL OF THIS SERVER'S
FIELD ZONES,

127
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,094
ALL OF IT FROM THE FOREST, TO
THE MOUNTAIN RANGES TO THE LAKES

128
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,463
AND ANY FLATLANDS THAT HAVE NOT
BEEN CLAIMED.

129
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,599
YOU WANT TO BUY ALL
THE FIELD ZONES?

130
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,233
[SHIROE] AND JUST LIKE THE
TRANSACTION

131
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,635
WE COMPLETED A MOMENT AGO,

132
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,937
WE WILL TRANSFER THOSE
TITLES TO THE SERVER.

133
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,206
OUR GOAL FOR THIS IS TO
ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY

134
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,375
OF ANYONE ELSE
PURCHASING A ZONE.

135
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,077
[KINJO] IF I
UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY,

136
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,380
YOU'RE DOING THIS TO KEEP YOUR
ENEMIES FROM OWNING THEM.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,248
THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

138
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,151
AS IT STANDS PEOPLE OF THE
LAND CAN'T PURCHASE A ZONE,

139
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,486
ONLY ADVENTURERS.

140
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,821
[KINJO]
OH...

141
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,823
[SHIROE] THAT SEEMS A
LITTLE UNFAIR TO ME,

142
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,491
CREATING AN IMBALANCE
OF CITIZENSHIP

143
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,293
COULD ONLY LEAD TO PROBLEMS.

144
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,961
[KINJO]
HMMM...

145
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,198
NOW IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE AGAINST
THE IDEA OF OWNING PROPERTY.

146
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:22,569
HOWEVER, WE WOULD NEED TO DRAW
UP ANOTHER CONTRACT OF COURSE.

147
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,872
SO I WILL ASK YOU ONE MORE
TIME TO GIVE US A LOAN...

148
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,009
PLEASE HELP US AVOID BRINGING
ABOUT OUR OWN DESTRUCTION.

149
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,579
A LOAN INSURES ALL FUNDS WILL
BE RETURNED TO THE SOURCE.

150
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,284
AND YAMATO'S LAND
WILL RETURN TO YAMATO.

151
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,286
(EXHALE)

152
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,958
[KINJO] WELL, MASTER SHIROE AS
IT STANDS, I AM IN YOUR DEBT.

153
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:49,563
(GRUNTS)

154
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,199
[WILLIAM]
(EXHALE) UH...? HMPH!

155
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,804
MPH.... HUH?

156
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,807
OH MY GOD...

157
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:07,047
(LAUGHTER)

158
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,583
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
I DON'T BELIEVE IT! WE DID IT!

159
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,719
(LAUGHING)

160
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,989
[WILLIAM, THINKING] MY GUILD...
MY FRIENDS... ARE AMAZING!

161
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,691
[WILLIAM, VOICEOVER] I MEAN,
THESE GUYS REALLY ARE

162
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,059
THE BEST OF THE BEST!

163
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,093
WE WON...?

164
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,095
YEAH, WE DID IT!

165
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,530
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

166
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,931
AMAZING...

167
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,241
[PROMETHEUS] MY GOD LOOK

THAT'S LITERALLY A
MOUNTAIN OF EPIC ITEMS!

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,849
SO, NORMALLY WHEN WE BEAT A
RAID BOSS FOR THE FIRST TIME,

171
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,587
IT'S CUSTOMARY FOR THE GUILD
MASTER TO DIVVY EVERYTHING UP.

00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,262
THE LUNAR FLOWER CHARM!

173

IT'S FULL OF RESISTANCE BOOSTS
AND A LOT OF GREAT ABILITIES.

181
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,460
I THINK IT'S FITTING FOR
THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES!

I KNOW HE'S NOT IN OUR
GUILD OR ANYTHING,

183
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,666
BUT HE FOUGHT BY OUR SIDE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HERE!

184
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,068

SILVER SWORD AND

I CAN'T DECIDED WHAT I

212
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,516
YOUR NORMAL ATTIRE SHOULD

WHAT'RE YOU DOING WEARING
ALL THOSE FANCY CLOTHES?

223
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,941
IT'S TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON
OUR NEW RECRUIT...

224
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,643
AS A SENIOR GUILDMATE,
I COULDN'T BE

225
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,210

YOU'RE RIGHT.

BUT YOU KNOW... THERE'S
ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY

232
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,728
THEY'LL SHOW UP EARLY, RIGHT?

233

A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

245
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,603

SINCE THE APOCALYPSE.

[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
UP UNTIL THAT DAY,

250
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,319
I'D NEVER USED HIS

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,287
NOT SURE WHY.

252
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,057
I SUPPOSE THE REAL REASON
I NEVER SAID IT...

253
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,594
WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT
I WAS ANGRY WITH MYSELF.

254
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,295
I WAS ACCUSTOMED
TO BEING IN CONTROL,

255
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,965
AND I DEFINITELY
WASN'T AT THAT POINT.

256

ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE,

00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,738
I GUESS IT WAS MY
WAY OF PRETENDING

259
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,740
THAT KIND OF PERSON
DIDN'T EXIST.

260
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,175
BUT IT WASN'T HAPPENING.
IT WAS IMMATURE OF ME.

261
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:06,312
I COULD'VE REASONED WITH HIM.
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN TRY...

262
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,282

JERK, YOU KNOW THAT?

263
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,986

LIKE I REALLY LIKE YOU EITHER.

264
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,456
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] WE MAY NEVER
BE FRIENDS. AND THAT'S OKAY.

WE AGREED TO TOLERATE
ONE ANOTHER.

WHY DID YOU LET THAT LITTLE
SPAZZY PANTS INTO OUR GUILD?

333
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,554
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED A STAR!

334
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,989
KAZUHIKO'S RECOMMENDATION
DIDN'T HURT.

335
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,391
HUH? WELL JUST SO YOU KNOW...

336
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,094
IT'S NOT LIKE I WENT TO SUSUKINO
UNDER ORDERS FROM KAZUHIKO

337
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,996
AND DID A BUNCH OF
SPY STUFF, OKAY?!

338
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,165
IT'S ALL RIGHT TETORA,
I BELIEVE YOU.

339
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,567
YOUR GUILD'S PRETTY STRONG,

340
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,536
YOU GUYS CAN HELP
OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE.

341
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,704
YEAH WELL, WE DIDN'T
START LOG HORIZON

342
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,373
TO BE SOME KIND OF A CHARITY.

343
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,209
YEAH, BUT... YOU STILL HAVE
FAITH IN THE WORLD...

344
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,878
AND YOU DON'T LET
EVERYONE'S INDIFFERENCE

345
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,247
KEEP YOU FROM HELPING PEOPLE.

346
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,015
MORE THAN THEY
DESERVE SOMETIMES.

347
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,483
HMPH?

348
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,218
[SHIROE, THINKING]
SHE'S SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT.

349
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,120
BETTER WATCH HER.

350
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,636
[ZELDEUS]
SO WHERE'S INTIX?

351
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,206
[MIZPHA] EASY, ZELDEUS...
SHE'LL BE HERE, SOON.

352
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,310
I TAKE IT THE PRINCESS
IS KEEPING HER?

353
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,979
I'M IN THE MOOD FOR A FIGHT...

354
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,480
NOT ENOUGH BLOOD THESE DAYS...

355
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,549
I DON'T WANT TO GET
OUT OF PRACTICE.

356
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,885
I'M TIRED OF JUST
SITTING AROUND WAITING.

357
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,352
BUT I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

358
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,955
IF IT'LL GET ME BACK
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

359
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,057
[NAKARUNARD]
YOU'RE JUST POSTURING.

360
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,026
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE WINE

361
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,329
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE, NPC. HMPH.

362
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,865
(YAWN)

363
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,067
[KUONG]
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?

364
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,137
I JUST WANNA GET THIS OVER
WITH AND GET OUTTA HERE.

365
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,773
[JARED GUNN]
UP TOO LATE WERE WE?!

366
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:31,878
YOU SHOULDN'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT
STARING AT THE MOON, CHILD.

367
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,514
I'M JUST WAITING FOR
A GM TO CALL...

368
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,182
SO I CAN FINALLY
GET AWAY FROM YOU.

369
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,885
[LOREILE] ALL RIGHT THEN, IT
LOOKS LIKE THE PRINCESS

370
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,187
WON'T BE GRACING US
WITH HER PRESENCE.

371
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:42,889
HM?

372
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,493
[INTIX] TELL ME,

373
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,964
WHAT IS THE STATUS OF
AKIHABARA'S EXPEDITIONARY ARMY?

374
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:54,434
THEY'RE STILL IN THE SEVENTH
FALL AREA, FIGHTING GOBLINS.

375
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:58,071
VERY GOOD, AND THE ROYAL
GUARDSMAN IN AKIHABARA?

376
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,306
NUMBER ONE SAID HE WAS CAUGHT.

377
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,876
HE WAS RAISING QUITE
THE RUCKUS OVER THERE.

378
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,244
A ROYAL GUARDSMAN?

379
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,946
[KAZUHIKO]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

380
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,548
NO ONE TOLD ME
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

381
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:11,685
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER
YOU... IT WAS A MINOR ISSUE.

382
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:12,819
HEH.

383
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,721
HMPH...

384
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:17,958
(EXHALE)

385
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:21,161
[KR] THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES
HAS MADE HIS WAY BACK TO TOWN.

386
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,863
(SURPRISED)

387
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:27,568
[KR] IT KIND OF MAKES ME WONDER
WHAT HE WAS DOING IN SUSUKINO.

388
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,737
OKAY, INTIX, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

389
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,939
THAT RABBLE THAT REFUSES TO
MARCH TO THE BEAT

390
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,075
OF YOUR DRUM HAS RETURNED.

391
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,510
(GIGGLE)

392
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,784
[NAOTSUGU] YOU KNOW, I'M STILL
SURPRISED YOU DECIDED

393
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,852
TO JUST GIVE THE ZONES
BACK TO THE SERVER.

394
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,955
[SHIROE] I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD
TURN INTO SUCH A BIG ORDEAL.

395
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,092
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, WELL, SEEMS
LIKE EVERYTHING'S AN ISSUE.

396
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,493
EVER SINCE WE STARTED.

397
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,461
[SHIROE] HMPH... PRETTY
MUCH. KR USED TO HAVE

398
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,363
AN OLD SAYING FOR
TIMES LIKE THIS...

399
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,801
"BLAME YOUR BIRTH STARS AND
SIMPLY GIVE IN TO YOUR FATE."

400
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,368
(TETORA SQUEALS)
[BOTH] HUH?

401
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,471
[TETORA] SO, ARE THEY THE
OTHER MEMBERS OF LOG HORIZON?!

402
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,508
[SHIROE]
GUYS!

403
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,579
[NAOTSUGU] MARIELLE! (GRUNTS)
[TETORA](GIGGLE) HI, EVERYBODY!

404
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,615
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NICE OF
ALL OF YOU TO GET TOGETHER

405
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,416
TO MEET ME TODAY.
(NAOTSUGU STRUGGLES)

406
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,519
[RUDY] WELL NOW, SOMEBODY'S
SURE FULL OF THEMSELVES.

407
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,120
[ISUZU] AREN'T YOU ONE TO TALK?

408
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,822
[TOYA] THAT MUST BE TETORA...

409
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,090
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A GIRL.
[MINORI] OH...

410
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,692
(LAUGHING)
[HENRIETTA] OH DEAR.

411
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,761
IT LOOKS AS IF THOSE
TWO ARE HOLDING HANDS.

412
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,295
[TETORA] GET READY TO
MEET YOUR NEW STARLET!

413
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,264
COME ON! I'M SERIOUS OKAY!

414
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,500
LEMME GO, YOU SKANK!
LET GO OF ME!

415
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,169
[TETORA] THANKS FOR WAITING!
(SHIROE EXHALES)

416
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,639
[TETORA] HEY EVERYBODY!
[NAOTSUGU] WHOA!

417
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,275
[ISUZU]
WELCOME BACK, MASTER SHIROE.

418
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,777
[RUDY] WE TOOK CARE OF
ALL THE IMPORTANT STUFF,

419
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:44,878
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

420
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,347
[TOYA] WE WERE FIGHTING
GOBLINS, YOU DOOFUS!

421
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,250
AND WE WENT TO CHOSHI, SO WHAT
THAT REALLY MEANS

422
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,686
IS I SAVED TWO CITIES!
(BOTH GROANING)

423
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,989
[MINORI] I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE IT
BACK SHIROE. GOOD TO SEE YOU!

424
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,257
HMMPH.

425
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,994
[SHIROE] IT'S GREAT TO SEE
EVERYBODY. (ALL CHUCKLING)

426
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,230
[NYANTA] WELL, NOW... IT'S
BEEN FAR TOO LONG MY MAN...

427
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,799
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOUR FACE.

428
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,002
WHY DON'T WE BREAK THIS UP WHILE
HE STILL HAS BOTH HIS ARMS?

429
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,204
SO, WHO'S YOUR
LITTLE FRIEND HERE?!

430
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,306
[NAOTSUGU]
UWALLH... I'M JU... AH!

434
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:26,419
A STARLET, HUH? OKAY WELL...!
I'M A GUILD MASTER!

435
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,021
(NAOTSUGU CRYING OUT)
[TETORA] ZAP! ZAPPITY‐ZAP! ZAP!

436
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,691
I AM NOT GONNA MESS WITH THAT
RIGHT NOW. [TOYA] NO DOUBT.

437
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,959
[SHIROE] I THINK WE'LL SAVE THE
FORMAL INTRODUCTION

438
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,528
FOR LATER. HUH?

439
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,062
[MINORI]
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

440
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,932
WELL, UH... UH?

441
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,069
YOU'RE HERE. RIGHT
ON TIME AS USUAL.

442
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,306
HEY NOW, DID YOU GROW?

443
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,041
MY LORD THAT'S
NOT VERY NICE!

444
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:54,180
UH... S‐SORRY! I MEAN, IT'S
JUST YOU'RE STANDING TALLER!

445
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,250
[SHIROE, THINKING]
SHE SEEMS... DIFFERENT...

446
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,452
THAN THE LAST TIME I SAW HER.

447
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,689
(EXHALE)

448
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,891
(EXHALE)

449
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,994
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT
MY LORD, IT'S EMBARRASSING.

450
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,496
UH... I'M SORRY! SORRY!

451
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:11,765
[SHIROE, THINKING] I FORGOT...

452
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,967
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A BATTLE OF HER OWN.

453
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,503
AND NOT JUST HER, THEY ALL HAVE.

454
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:20,473
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] NO MATTER
HOW CLOSE THEY ARE...

455
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,776
NO MATTER HOW FAR AWAY...

456
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,479
THE DISTANCE MEANS NOTHING...

457
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,149
THEY'RE ALL WORKING TO MAKE
THEIR OWN PART OF THIS WORLD

458
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,884
THE BEST THEY CAN.

459
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:35,088
I'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS,
AND WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

460
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,626
[SHIROE]
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME, AKATSUKI.

461
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,963
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU BACK, MY LORD.

462
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,223
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
VALENTINE'S DAY ALSO COMES TO

463
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,292
THE WORLD OF ELDER TALES.

464
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,762
IT'S HERE. YOU CAN
IGNORE IT IF YOU WANT,

465
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,964
BUT IT'S RIGHT HERE
ON TOP OF US.

466
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,067
SOME WILL FIND HAPPINESS,
AND OTHER...? WELL...

467
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:30,571
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO
KNOW WHAT'S IN ANOTHER'S HEART.

468
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,105
WHO DO YOU LOVE?

469
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,510
[SHIROE] I WANT TO STAND UP...
ONE MORE TIME...
