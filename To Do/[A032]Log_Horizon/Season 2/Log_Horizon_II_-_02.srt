1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,928
(LOW GROWL)

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,597
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
A RAID PARTY

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,665
IS A MASSIVE ASSAULT ON AN
OBJECTIVE BY A LARGE GROUP

4
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,501
OF ADVENTURERS THAT
GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,437
THE USUAL PARTY OF SIX.

6
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,872
THE MOST COMMON RAID PARTY
IS THE FULL RAID,

7
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,441
WHICH TAKES
FOUR GROUPS OF SIX

8
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,377
AND COMBINES THEM
INTO ONE FIGHTING UNIT.

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,613
THIS LET'S THE
PLAYERS EXPERIENCE

10
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:24,782
A FULL RANGE OF COMBAT AS WELL
AS GET THE BEST REWARDS.

11
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:26,984
HOWEVER, YOU CAN'T JUST
HAVE HIGH‐LEVEL PLAYERS

12
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,287
WITH OUTSTANDING EQUIPMENT
TO MAKE A GOOD RAID PARTY.

13
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:32,890
YOU MUST ANALYZE YOUR ENEMY AND
HAVE A WELL‐PLANNED STRATEGY.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,692
OF COURSE,
THE PLAYERS YOU CHOOSE

15
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,095
HAVE TO HAVE SOLID TEAMWORK
TO PULL THE RAID OFF.

16
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,864
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST
PICK A BUNCH OF RANDOM PEOPLE

17
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,033
AND GO FOR IT.

18
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,800
AND IT DOESN'T HURT IF
THE MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,303
HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED
DEATH AND RESURRECTION TOGETHER.

20
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,740
[NAOTSUGU] OKAY, SO WHO DO
WE CALL FOR HELP?

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,642
I THINK I HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND.

22
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,012
[NAOTSUGU]
DUDE, REALLY?

23
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,773
[REGAN]
THIS FORTIFICATION ONCE STOOD

24
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:31,443
AS A DEFENSE AGAINST
ALL MANNER OF GIANTS...

25
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:34,179
IT'S WHY THE EZZO
EMPIRE BUILT SUSUKINO.

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,382
[NAOTSUGU] HMMM? NOT SEEING
ANY GUARDS OUT HERE ANYMORE.

27
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:39,284
I'M HOPING THAT'S A GOOD THING.

28
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:43,255
[SHIROE] SIX MONTHS CAN
CHANGE A LOT, SO IT SEEMS.

29
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:47,225
WELL IF I DON'T SEE YOU BACK
PRETTY SOON, GOOD LUCK!

30
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,560
[SHIROE]
OKAY.

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,627
SAME TO YOU.

32
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,796
[NAOTSUGU]
PFFFT. YOU KNOW ME.

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,219
[WILLIAM] WELL, WELL.
NOW ISN'T THIS A TREAT?

34
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,122
[SHIROE] MISTER MASSACHUSETTS...
HOW'RE THINGS GOING HERE?

35
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,858
DON'T BE SO FORMAL,
JUST CALL ME "WILLIAM".

36
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,460
[SHIROE] FEEL FREE TO
CALL ME "SHIROE" THEN.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,928
HMMM...

38
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:26,898
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
SILVER SWORD,

39
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,800
A RAID GUILD,
RANKING RIGHT UP WITH D. D. D.

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,803
AND THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS
FOR PURE COMBAT POWER.

41
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,705
WE ASKED WILLIAM TO ATTEND
THE FIRST MEETING

42
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,407
ESTABLISHING THE
ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.

43
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,110
WE WANTED TO GET SILVER SWORD
ONBOARD WITH OUR EFFORTS.

44
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,344
HOWEVER...

45
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:41,246
[WILLIAM] YOU WANT TO LIVE
HERE AND TRY TO DEAL WITH

46
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,115
ALL ITS LITTLE ISSUES,
THEN FEEL FREE.

47
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:46,118
IT'S ACTUALLY CHARMING THAT YOU
THINK YOU CAN TALK IT ALL OUT.

48
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,786
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO IT WITHOUT US.

49
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,356
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THEY DECIDED
TO MOVE TO SUSUKINO,

50
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,725
IN SEARCH OF RAIDS MORE
WORTHY OF THEIR SKILLS.

51
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,494
NOW THEIR ABSENCE FROM
AKIHABARA MAKES THEM PERFECT.

52
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,365
HE'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN TURN TO.
I JUST HOPE HE AGREES THIS TIME.

53
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,801
OTHERWISE, I MAY RUN OUT
OF OPTIONS RATHER FAST.

54
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,672
I HAVE COME TO SPEAK TO YOU,
ONE GUILD MASTER TO ANOTHER.

55
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:09,007
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
A FAVOR OF YOU.

56
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,043
[WILLIAM]
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL DO IT.

57
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:11,976
[SHIROE] UH?

58
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,611
YOU'VE COME
A LONG WAY TO SEE ME.

59
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,781
YOU MUST NEED HELP WITH A TASK
ONLY SILVER SWORD CAN COMPLETE.

60
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,783
AND IT'D BE PRETTY LOW CLASS
OF ME TO SAY NO

61
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,352
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

62
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:21,953
[SHIROE]
I APPRECIATE IT.

63
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,688
[WILLIAM]
WELL...

64
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,657
IT'S A FULL PARTY RAID,
AND I NEED ALL OF YOU.

65
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,993
THE DESTINATION IS
A NEW RAID ZONE

66
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:31,263
DOWN IN THE LOWEST LEVELS
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

67
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,797
A FULLY PARTY RAID...

68
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,833
AND THAT MEANS WE CAN ONLY
GO IN THERE WITH 24 PLAYERS.

69
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,436
WE NEED OUR BEST PEOPLE,
BUT NOT EVERYONE WE HAVE.

70
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:41,039
WE WILL BE NEEDING
ADVANCE RECON OF THE AREA.

71
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,175
I HAVE ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF THAT.

72
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,177
REALLY?

73
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:47,879
[NAOTSUGU]
IT'S CRAZY DOWN THERE!

74
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,514
[REGAN]
IMPRESSIVE, I'D SAY!

75
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,317
[SHIROE] WE'LL STOP HERE
FOR TODAY. LET'S GET BACK.

76
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,351
[NAOTSUGU]
DEFINITELY.

77
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,786
REGAN]
THAT'S AMAZING!

78
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,155
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY
MONSTERS IN ONE PLACE.

79
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,058
[SHIROE] NOT TO MENTION
THEY'RE LEVEL 89 OR BETTER.

80
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,826
I'M PRETTY SURE
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE

81
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,295
AN EASY PART OF THIS RAID.

82
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:05,063
SO WHAT DID YOU SEE?

83
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,132
THE TOP LEVEL
HAD SLIME MONSTERS,

84
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:10,702
AND THEY WERE EASILY
FIVE METERS ACROSS.

85
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,070
NOW, I'M ONLY
THINKING OUT LOUD HERE,

86
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,371
BUT BASED ON THE ORAL TRADITIONS

87
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,273
AND THE LAYOUT OF
THIS "SHAFT" STRUCTURE...

88
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:18,676
I GET THE FEELING WE'RE GOING
TO BE FACING MYTHICAL BEASTS.

89
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,313
ALRIGHT.
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

90
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,015
WORKING OUT OF
SUSUKINO AS A BASE,

91
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,283
WE'VE GOTTEN USED TO
SUCH ADVERSARIES.

92
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:28,253
HOWEVER, MY GUILD ISN'T
AS STRONG AS YOU'D THINK.

93
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:28,853
HUH?

94
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,255
(EXHALES)

95
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,591
[NAOTSUGU] YOU EVER BEEN
HERE BEFORE, OLD TIMER?

96
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,993
[REGAN] OH MANY TIMES!

97
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,095
I HEARD THINGS FELL APART
AFTER THE "APOCALYPSE",

98
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,796
BUT IT SEEMS BETTER NOW...

99
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:41,499
I'M BETTING HAVING THE SILVER
SWORD AROUND HAS HELPED A LOT.

100
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,802
YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE A RAID
GUILD WITH A LOT OF DISCIPLINE.

101
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,171
'COURSE, I'D TAKE THESE GUYS

102
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,973
INSTEAD OF THOSE
BRIGANDIA LOSERS ANY DAY.

103
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,242
[REGAN]
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

104
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,711
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE
THOSE HOODLUMS WENT?

105
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,647
I'M SORRY,
BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

106
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,082
[WILLIAM] WE DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS

107
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,350
NEEDED TO BE
UP AND RUNNING.

108
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,818
WE'RE KIND OF JUST A
NAME RIGHT NOW.

109
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,154
[SHIROE]
EH...?

110
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,588
I'M PRETTY SURE
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET

111
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,423
EVERYONE TO COME
WITH US...

112
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:07,392
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED A NUMBER
OF PEOPLE SQUATTING IN GUILDS

113
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,195
JUST TO KEEP THEMSELVES
SAFE FROM ENEMIES OR MONSTERS.

114
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,797
IN OTHER WORDS,
THEY'VE BASICALLY RETIRED.

115
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,332
THEY MIGHT BE UP
FOR A MILD RAID,

116
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,734
BUT NOTHING THAT PUTS
THEM IN REAL DANGER.

117
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,436
AND THIS RAID YOU'VE
COME TO ME WITH,

118
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,406
IT COULD BE THE TOUGHEST THE
SYSTEM'S EVER PUT TOGETHER.

119
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,609
WE NEED LEVEL NINETY‐FIVES, AND
WE'LL BE LUCKY TO GET TWENTY.

120
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,845
SO TELL ME, ARE THEY TRYING
TO PROTECT THEIR MEMORIES?

121
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,747
[WILLIAM] HMMM... POSSIBLY...

122
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,083
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE

123
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,784
SAY ANYTHING OUT LOUD
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

124
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,520
MOST OF MY PEOPLE THINK IT'S
A RIDICULOUS IDEA ANYWAY.

125
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,090
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE AFRAID OF IT.

126
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,957
I'M NOT SURE
I UNDERSTAND.

127
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:42,995
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
DIED SINCE YOU GOT HERE?

128
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,696
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE?

129
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:47,099
I HAVEN'T... REALLY BEEN
THROUGH IT YET.

130
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,237
I'M NOT SURE I CAN
EXPLAIN IT, BUT I'LL TRY.

131
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:55,307
YOU LEARN A LOT
ABOUT YOURSELF...

132
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:56,908
YOU LEARN THINGS
THAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW

133
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,543
AND THINGS YOU
DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

134
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,113
AND IT DOESN'T GET EASIER
EACH TIME IT HAPPENS EITHER.

135
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,182
SO MOST OF US DON'T WANNA
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

136
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:06,218
(DOORS SLAM OPEN)
[SHIROE] HM?

137
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:08,586
[WOMAN] OOHHH, YOU'D BETTER
NOT MESS WITH HIM...

138
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,122
[MAN]
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

139
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,957
[DEMICAS] WELL, IF IT ISN'T
SHIROE THE ENCHANTER.

140
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,161
YOU'VE GOT A LOTTA NERVE
SHOWING YOUR FACE AROUND HERE!

141
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:20,732
HMPH.

142
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,334
(ANGRY GRUNT)

143
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,437
[REGAN] DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT WILL BE EASY TO FIND

144
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:27,039
NEW PARTY MEMBERS?

145
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,573
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE'S
TAKING CARE OF MOST OF IT,

146
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:32,010
BUT I HAVE TO FIND A
FEW MYSELF, JUST IN CASE.

147
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,079
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

148
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,014
I'M KINDA PLAYIN' IT
BY EAR, YOU KNOW?

149
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,416
THAT HARDLY TELL ME
ANYTHING, MASTER!

150
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:41,053
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
IN YOUR MAGICKY TALK.

151
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,755
I JUST NEED SOME DUDES,
KEEP AN EYE OUT.

152
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,223
I WAS THINKING
OF HELPING YOU,

153
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:47,225
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

154
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,326
THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST

155
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,727
TAKE CARE OF THINGS
AROUND HERE?

156
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,396
(CHUCKLES)
THAT WORKS FOR ME!

157
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,298
MY SKILLS AS A RESEARCHER
ARE BETTER SUITED

158
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,633
TO FINDING OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THIS CITY.

159
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,335
[TETORA] AW, DANGIT!
[BOTH] HM?

160
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,171
[NAOTSUGU]
NICE PANTIES!

161
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,139
WELL FOR ONCE
I MUST AGREE WITH YOU.

162
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,907
A FELLOW
PANTY FAN, NICE!

163
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,476
I AM INDEED!

164
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,512
I UNDERSTAND ADVENTURERS ALSO
REFER TO THEM AS "BLOOMERS" OR

165
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,482
PANTALOONS OR
"HOT PANTS," IF YOU WILL.

166
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:12,184
IF YOU'LL PARDON ME,
IT SEEMS SUCH NAMES

167
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,186
MIGHT DISPARAGE
SOMETHING SO DELIGHTFUL.

168
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,687
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

169
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,422
I HOLD THEM IN THE
HIGHEST REGARD!

170
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:19,391
AS A TRUE ADMIRER OF
LADY'S UNDERWEAR I CAN‐

171
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,026
WAUUUGHHHH!

172
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,195
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

173
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,901
[AKATSUKI] I GUESS THAT'S
ENOUGH PRACTICE FOR TODAY.

174
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,236
[NAOTSUGU] WH‐WHAT WAS THAT?!

175
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,005
THE LITTLE SHRIMP
PUT A CURSE ON ME.

176
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,140
A CURSE? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

177
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,209
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT,

178
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,444
AND DON'T LEAVE OUT ANY
DETAILS, IF YOU PLEASE.

179
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:40,945
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU'RE WAY TOO HAPPY, DUDE!

180
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,980
[TETORA]
GET ME OUTTA HERE, YOU MORONS!

181
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,981
AH!

182
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,683
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

183
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:47,785
YOUR FINE CURVES
DISTRACTED US.

184
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,723
IT'D BE A CRYING SHAME FOR ALL
MY LOVE‐STRUCK FANS OUT THERE

185
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,858
IF MY BEAUTIFUL FACE WAS
BLEMISHED IN A SNOW BANK.

186
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,560
DID SHE ACTUALLY SAY THAT?

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,496
IT WOULD APPEAR OUR NEW FRIEND
IS QUITE FULL OF HERSELF.

188
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,564
GAH!

189
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,365
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAMPS?

190
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:01,799
THE MORE I GET
TO KNOW YA,

191
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,268
THE MORE I'M STARTING
TO LIKE YA! HAHA

192
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,902
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

193
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:05,837
UH‐HUH!

194
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:06,804
I CAN HEAR YOU, Y'KNOW!

195
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,173
HUH?
AH, SHE'S RECOVERED.

196
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,775
I'M TETORA, THE STAR
SHINING IN THE NIGHT SKY!

197
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,180
SYMBOL OF DIVINE BEAUTY...
THE GALAXY‐STYLE STARLET!

198
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,948
OR JUST "TETORA",
IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

199
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,650
TETORA, HUH?
HM... SURE,

200
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,585
YOU MIGHT BE CUTE
AND EVERYTHING...

201
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,154
BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN
HELL I'M ADMITTING TO IT

202
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,056
WHEN YOU'RE ALL
STUCK UP LIKE THAT.

203
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,923
IF I HAD TO TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT EVERYTHING

204
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,226
I'M SEEING AND HEARING
FROM YOU SO FAR...

205
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,963
THERE'S NO CONTEST!
THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS...

206
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,799
IS THE LOVELY AND
GRACIOUS MARIELLE!

207
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,035
MARIELLE! MARIELLE!

208
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,170
[BOTH]
HUH?

209
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,771
UH, SORRY
'BOUT THAT...

210
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,173
[NAOTSUGU]
HERE YOU GO.

211
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,341
OKAY, THANKS...

212
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,046
[NAOTSUGU] INTERESTING,
SHE'S LEVELED UP TO 92,

213
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,183
JUST LIKE ME AND SHIROE
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE.

214
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,785
[NAOTSUGU] SHE MIGHT NOT BE
THAT BAD, ACTUALLY.

215
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,220
LOOK, MISTER...

216
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,988
I KNOW I DO A LOT TO KEEP
MYSELF LOOKING AMAZING...

217
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,656
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP STARING.

218
00:09:58,756 --> 00:09:59,991
I WASN'T
STARING AT YOU!

219
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,393
OH I KNOW YOU
CAN'T HELP IT.

220
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,161
GORGEOUS HOTTIES LIKE
ME ARE CONSTANTLY

221
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,829
SPEWING OUT PHEROMONES,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!

222
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,100
FACE IT, YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME
WHENEVER YOU SMELL ME.(HUMS)

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,102
THIS MIGHT BE A BAD
TIME TO TELL YOU,

224
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,403
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE EMITTING

225
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:12,937
SOMETHING OTHER
THAN PHEROMONES.

226
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,239
ACK!

227
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,973
OH MAN! NOW THAT'S
WHAT I CALL A ZINGER!

228
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,575
CHALK ONE UP
FOR STINKY!

229
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,777
[TETORA] STARLETS DO NOT
DO SUCH THINGS, SIR!

230
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,747
[TETORA] THAT WAS VERY IMPOLITE
OF YOU, YOU WRINKLED OLD TOAD!

231
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,382
DID YOU CALL ME A TOAD?!

232
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,318
AND SINCE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
IN LOVE WITH ME,

233
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,186
I'LL LET YOU CARRY ME,
MISTER ARMOR.

234
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,055
[NAOTSUGU]
H‐HEY! GET OFF! WHA‐

235
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,289
EH‐HEHH! I DON'T THINK SO.

236
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,325
OH, I JUST LOVE SEEING
HOW MEN FREAK OUT

237
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,559
AND GET ALL GOOEY AND STUPID

238
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,361
WHENEVER I RUB
ALL OVER THEM. Y'KNOW...

239
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,096
AND YOU BETTER
MIND YOUR MANNERS,

240
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,731
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN GUYS
DO IT BACK TO ME!

241
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,900
[NAOTSUGU] ERK! IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, DON'T DO IT!

242
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,069
[TETORA] ALLEY‐OOP
[NAOTSUGU] WOAH!

243
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,737
(GIGGLE)

244
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:47,972
[NAOTSUGU, MUFFLED]
OKAY, FINE, YOU'RE IN...

245
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,174
HUH?

246
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,076
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A WISE IDEA?

247
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:53,011
REMEMBER I'M GOING
WITH MY GUT HERE.

248
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,679
HMM?

249
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,515
(SEETHING)

250
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,452
[VOINEN]
I THINK THEY'LL BE FINE.

251
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,720
[FEDERICO] THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD
TIME TO TAKE A BREAK OUT BACK.

252
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,656
[WAITRESS]
UH! (EXHALES)

253
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:06,058
HMPH.

254
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,492
[DEMICAS] LISTEN TO ME
YOU ARROGANT PRICK...

255
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,295
WE'VE GOT UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

256
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,499
[DEMICAS] LAST WE MET,

257
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,301
YOU WERE HAVING SOME
TROUBLE WITH MY NAME.

258
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,569
REMEMBER IT NOW?

259
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,538
[SHIROE] OF COURSE I DO,
MISTER DUMMY FACE.

260
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,441
[DEMICAS] WELL GET OUTTA THAT
CHAIR! WE'RE TAKIN' IT OUTSIDE!

261
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,143
[SHIROE] OH, I THINK
I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

262
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,112
I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS.

263
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,314
[WILLIAM] KNOCK IT OFF, DEMICAS.
[DEMICAS] HUH?

264
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,149
SHIROE'S HERE AS
MY GUEST, UNDERSTAND?

265
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,518
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN...!
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM PAY‐

266
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,153
[WILLIAM]
HE DEFEATED YOU, RIGHT?

267
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,254
UWAH! (GRUNT)

268
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,023
YOU HAD A FIGHT.
YOU LOST.

269
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,025
YOU GOT RESURRECTED.
GET OVER IT.

270
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,726
COME ON!

271
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,529
I HAVEN'T HAD MY EXERCISE YET...
WHATTYA SAY?

272
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,933
[DEMICAS] HHRGH...
(SHAKY EXHALE)

273
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,437
I KNOW FOR A FACT HE'D JUST
EMBARRASS YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

274
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:56,141
I PICKED UP NEW RAID ITEMS,
IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME FIGHT.

275
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,010
AND RELYING ON EQUIPMENT
IS EXACTLY WHY

276
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,311
YOU WOULDN'T WIN IN A REMATCH.

277
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:01,979
I'M GONNA CUT YOU
INTO PIECES?!

278
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,750
SO TELL ME WHICH ONE YOU PREFER:
HAMBURGER OR MINCED CUTLETS?

279
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,152
THEY'RE BOTH TASTY,

280
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:09,554
AS LONG AS I MARINADE THEM IN
SOME DEMI‐WHATEVER‐IT‐IS SAUCE.

281
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,389
URGH! YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A
HARD TIME RUNNING THAT MOUTH

282
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,325
WITHOUT ANY DAMN TEETH!

283
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,493
WELL THAT'S NOT VERY NICE,
MISTER DEMI‐DING‐DONG.

284
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,429
(GRUNTS)
(WILLIAM CHUCKLES)

285
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,864
YOU ARE REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF!

286
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,766
DON'T GET BENT OUT OF
SHAPE, DEMI‐DINGLEBERRY.

287
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,768
I'M GONNA RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!
(DOOR OPENS)

288
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,537
[TETORA] AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW
IT, HALF THE GUYS IN BRIGANDIA

289
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:27,705
WENT TO THE GUILD‐HALL HERE
AND JUST BAILED ON HIM!

290
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,242
I CAN'T BLAME THEN REALLY.
SOME CAT PIRATE GUY,

291
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,477
WHO WASN'T EVEN IN A GUILD,
KICKED THEIR BUTTS.

292
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,113
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, THEIR
LEAD STRATEGIST, LONDARK,

293
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,582
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
TO LEAVE AND GO WEST.

294
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,584
[NAOTSUGU]
OK, SO WHAT HAPPENED TO DEMICAS?

295
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,453
[TETORA] DEMI‐POO AND
WHAT'S LEFT OF BRIGANDIA

296
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,855
ARE ALL UNDERLINGS
OF SILVER SWORD NOW!

297
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,157
THAT'S HOW WE FINALLY GOT

298
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,924
A LITTLE CHANCE AT
PEACE IN SUSUKINO.

299
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,393
GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

300
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,562
OH YEAH! YOU HAVE GOT
TO MEET HIS WIFE.

301
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,564
SHE'S AN AWESOME LADY
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER.

302
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,599
MARRIED?!
YOU'RE KIDDING!

303
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,469
I GUESS THERE'S HOPE FOR ME
IF HE CAN GET MARRIED.

304
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,704
AND HERE'S THE
REALLY AMAZING PART.

305
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,273
SHE'S THE DAUGHTER
OF AN ARISTOCRAT

306
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:02,707
AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND!

307
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,609
HE KIDNAPPED HER LOOKING
FOR A HOUSEKEEPER.

308
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,278
BUT POOR LITTLE
DEMI‐POO HERE

309
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:07,712
ENDED UP FALLING
IN LOVE WITH HER

310
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:10,215
AND HER HAMBURGERS
AND MINCED CUTLETS.

311
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,816
[NAOTSUGU]
THAT'S HILARIOUS!

312
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,318
[REGAN]
I'M SO JEALOUS!

313
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,487
(THE TRIO GIGGLES)
[SHIROE] EHEH...

314
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,090
THANKS TO HER, HE'S AS TAME
AS A HOUSE CAT NOWADAYS.

315
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,226
WHOA...HUH?
HEY, DEMI‐POO!

316
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,429
(SNARLS, WAR CRY)

317
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,763
(FRIGHTENED GASP)

318
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,332
(GROWL)

319
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,676
[TETORA]
WHY DID YOU STOP?

320
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,645
[DEMICAS] HUH... YOU'RE
PRETTY GOOD THERE, BUD

321
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,147
[NAOTSUGU] WE'RE INSIDE
A CITY, DILL WEED.

322
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,082
I KNOW YOU WON'T
TRY ANYTHING.

323
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:46,418
I COULD TAKE ON
THE GUARD, TOO.

324
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,520
ONE OF THESE DAYS, TETORA,
THAT LIP OF YOURS

325
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,024
IS GONNA MAKE ME FEED YOU
TO A GIANT, YOU LITTLE WENCH.

326
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,991
YOU'LL PROTECT
ME WON'T YOU?

327
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:55,427
PLEASE GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE!

328
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,429
[SHIROE] WHERE'D YOU FIND
YOUR NEW FRIEND?

329
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,863
FELL FROM THE SKY.

330
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,898
[WILLIAM] WELL THAT'S SOMETHING.
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

331
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,302
WE'LL HAVE OUR 24 IF WE ADD
DEMICAS AND YOUR HEALER FRIEND.

332
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:05,837
YOU WANNA SETTLE THE SCORE
WITH SHIROE?

333
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,940
BURN OFF SOME OF THAT ENERGY
DURING THE RAID, BIG MAN.

334
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,108
[SHIROE] UH‐WAH

335
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,476
[DEMICAS] WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

336
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,245
YOU HEARD ME, ARE YOU IN?!

337
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,580
[ALL]
YEAH!

338
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,622
[WILLIAM]
ALL RIGHT! GUESS WE'RE ALL HERE.

339
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,791
FIRST PARTY!

340
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,628
SECOND PARTY!

341
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:35,433
THIRD PARTY!

342
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,105
FOURTH PARTY!

343
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,409
LET'S MOVE OUT, PEOPLE!

344
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,677
(CHEERING)

345
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:49,014
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES
OUT THERE! MMHMMM.

346
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,389
[DEMICAS]
EAT THIS, YOU UGLY PUKES!

347
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:01,026
LIGHTNING... STRAIGHT! YAH!

348
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,260
(SHIROE SIGHS)

349
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,895
SOMEONE'S FEELING IT...

350
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,830
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL THAT
"TEAMWORK," YOU KNOW.

351
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,234
[VOINEN] DON'T GET TOO FAR
AHEAD OF US, DEMICAS!

352
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,835
[DEMICAS]
TRY TO KEEP UP, FAT‐ASS!

353
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,470
[FEDERICO]
YEAH, YEAH. WHATEVER...

354
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,440
[VOINEN] WE'LL SEE HOW LONG
HE STICKS WITH US.

355
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,109
[NAOTSUGU]
I GUESS IT KINDA MAKES SENSE

356
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,843
FOR WILLIAM TO BE OUR COMMANDER.

357
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:19,977
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT

358
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:21,913
WE WERE ALL GONNA HAVE TO
FREAKIN' WALK HERE!

359
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:25,483
I CAN'T BE A SOARING STARLET
WITH BUNIONS ON MY TOOTSIES!

360
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,185
YEAH, YEAH.

361
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,088
[SHIROE] IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYONE
HERE HAS A GRIFFIN TO CALL ON.

362
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:34,092
BESIDES, I THINK WILLIAM HAS
A REASON FOR DOING IT THIS WAY.

363
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,360
HUH?

364
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,928
IF I WERE IN HIS POSITION,

365
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,264
I'D WANNA KNOW WHAT
EVERYONE IN THE PARTY CAN DO.

366
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,166
EVERY QUIRK, EVERY ABILITY.

367
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,301
OKAY, I GET IT, BUT DO YOU
THINK WE'RE GONNA EVEN

368
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,470
RESEMBLE A PARTY
ONCE WE GET THERE?

369
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,939
[SHIROE]
WELL... WE'LL SEE...

370
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,243
[TETORA]
UGH! I DON'T WANNA WALK ANYMORE!

371
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,479
GUESS THERE ONLY ONE OPTION...
I'LL JUST HAVE TO RIDE NAOTSUGU.

372
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,049
LISTEN, FLUFFHEAD,
I'M NOT YOUR DONKEY!

373
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:58,316
ACT ALL TOUGH IF YOU WANT...

374
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,784
BUT I KNOW YOU
REALLY LOVE ME. EHEE!

375
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,453
THE HELL I DO.
WUUGHHH!

376
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,021
HOW COULD YOU LIVE WITH
YOURSELF IF I ENDED UP

377
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,956
WITH A BLISTER ON
MY DELICATE STARLET TOES?

378
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:06,391
HEY!

379
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,460
THE ENTIRE TETORA FANBASE
WOULD BE IN MOURNING!

380
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,096
THE SUN WOULDN'T COME UP
FOR DAYS ON END!

381
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:12,397
[NAOTSUGU] TELL YA WHAT...

382
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:14,166
IF YOU GET DOWN ON YOUR
KNEES AND BEG ME...

383
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,867
MAYBE I'D HELP YOU OUT!

384
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,435
[TETORA]
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT!

385
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,503
[NAOTSUGU] WOOOAAAH!

386
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,038
BUT IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

387
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:23,575
YOU NEVER TAKE A WARRIOR'S
SHIELD! GET BACK HERE!

388
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,644
[SHIROE] MPH...
[NAOTSUGU] COME HERE, DAMMIT!

389
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,314
[WILLIAM] YOUR TEAM
CERTAINLY SEEMS RELAXED.

390
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,749
WE TRY NOT TO TAKE
THINGS TOO SERIOUSLY.

391
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,218
HMPH...

392
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,121
I THINK I'M GETTING CLOSE
TO FIGURING OUT DEMICAS.

393
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,191
[SHIROE] I'D HOPE SO,
HE SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE.

394
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,561
[WILLIAM] WELL WE ALREADY KNOW
HE'S NOT A STRANGER TO RAIDS.

395
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:45,130
I'LL FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY
TO USE HIM IN A FIGHT

396
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,132
SOON ENOUGH... IF I CAN'T...

397
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:50,768
THEN PERHAPS I'M NOT THE
LEADER I THOUGHT I WAS.

398
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,937
STARE AT ME ALL YOU WANT...

399
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:56,541
BUT I'M GONNA BE PAYING YOU
BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

400
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,776
[VOINEN] I HOPE WE GET THIS DONE
BEFORE NEW YEAR'S.

401
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,745
[NAOTSUGU]
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN...

402
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,581
WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF THINGS
GOING ON AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

403
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,550
DON'T WANNA MISS OUT...

404
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:07,919
[MARIELLE] I KNOW.

405
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,355
I JUST WISH THIS WHOLE THING
WASN'T SO HARD ON YOU...

406
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,556
[NAOTSUGU, VOICE CHAT]
I'M OKAY.

407
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,091
[MARIELLE]
YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

408
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:15,460
ONE OF THOSE GUYS HAS
ME WORRIED, YOU KNOW?

409
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,495
DIDN'T THAT DINKY FACE
GUY RUN SUSUKINO?

410
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,331
[NAOTSUGU]
HIS NAME'S DEMICAS.

411
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,932
ITS NOT LIKE HE'S
A PROBLEM FOR ME.

412
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,135
WILLIAM STAYS ON HIS CASE,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

413
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,737
NOT TO MENTION HIS WIFE
IS SUPPOSEDLY IN CHARGE.

414
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,804
[MARIELLE, VOICE CHAT]
I'LL BET SHE IS.

415
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:27,972
THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT WORKS!

416
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,575
(DEMICAS GROWLS)
[NAOTSUGU] OKAY...

417
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,644
[MARIELLE] SO WHAT'S YOUR
FOOD LIKE OUT THERE?

418
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:34,946
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE JUST
EATING THE SAME THING EVERY DAY.

419
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,582
I'M SURE YOU'RE CRAVING SOME
CHICKEN THIS TIME OF YEAR!

420
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,218
CHICKEN AND WINTER REALLY
DO GO HAND‐IN‐HAND!

421
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,686
IT'S CHICKEN SEASON!

422
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:44,322
[NAOTSUGU] UH... WHAT IS YOUR
DEAL WITH CHICKEN? WEIRD.

423
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:45,823
[MARIELLE]
CHICKEN IS GREAT!

424
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,426
IT'S CHOCK FULL OF
NUTRIENTS AND YUMMINESS!

425
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,028
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH, SURE...

426
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,097
I'M REALLY HOPING YOU CAN MAKE
IT BACK IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS,

427
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,431
OKAY, NAOTSUGU?

428
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,967
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT ITS...

429
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:59,204
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO MAKE IT, ALL RIGHT?

430
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:00,905
LATER.

431
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:02,774
[MARIELLE]
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW.

432
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,843
SAME TIME, 'KAY? HMPH.
(VOICE CHAT ENDING)

433
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,613
[HENRIETTA] MA‐RI‐ELLE!
[MARIELLE] EHHHH...

434
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,915
[HENRIETTA] SWEARING YOUR
ETERNAL LOVE OVER TELEPATHY?

435
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,685
[HENRIETTA] YOU TWO ARE LIKE
A VIDEO GAME SOAP OPERA!

436
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,153
[HENRIETTA] I SUPPOSE NEXT,
YOU'RE GONNA START

437
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:17,022
GETTING ON HIM FOR PUTTING IN
TOO MUCH TIME AT WORK.

438
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:19,791
YOU'RE LETTING YOUR IMAGINATION
RUN AWAY WITH YOU.

439
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,459
(SIGH) WE REALLY
NEED TO FIGURE OUT

440
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,395
WHERE THIS MINAMI SPY
COULD BE HIDING.

441
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:24,997
WE CAN'T LET IT SLIP BY US...

442
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:27,065
THAT'S WHY WE ESTABLISHED
STRICT PROTOCOLS

443
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,567
FOR CONTACTING THE OTHERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

444
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,203
YOU KNOW THAT.

445
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:32,870
I KNOW, OKAY?!

446
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,506
WE'RE BEING CAREFUL, HENRIETTA,

447
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:39,077
WE DECIDED TO LIMIT OUR CALLS TO
JUST ONCE A DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK.

448
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,845
OH? REALLY?!

449
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,847
TAKE IT EASY,
IT'S NOT THAT EITHER.

450
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,816
ANYWAY, I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS,

451
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,917
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DISCUSSING

452
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,253
MILITARY STRATEGY
OR ANYTHING.

453
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,855
IT'S GOTTA BE OKAY...

454
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,758
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S GONNA BE
IN A BIG RAID, OR SOMETHING.

455
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:56,361
I'M NOT ASKING HIM ABOUT IT!
AND I KNOW ONE THING...

456
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:59,564
AFTER A BIG BATTLE, HE NEEDS
TO HAVE SOME DOWN TIME!

457
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:02,100
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO MAKE HIM COME HOME!

458
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,701
AND WELL BESIDES,
I'M TECHNICALLY

459
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,470
SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU'S
DIRECT CONTACT

460
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,039
WITH THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

461
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,307
SO, WHAT I'M REALLY
DOING IS WORKING!

462
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:13,278
YOU'RE PUTTING OUR SECURITY AT
RISK BY ABUSING YOUR AUTHORITY!

463
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,979
SO CAN I?
PRETTY PLEASE?

464
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,949
WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I
GONNA DO WITH YOU, REALLY?

465
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,053
I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT
IN ALL OF THIS...

466
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,154
IT'S OKAY BY ME!

467
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,521
AH!

468
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,923
BESIDES I'M YOUR GUILD MASTER
SO YOU KINDA HAVE TO LET ME.

469
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,994
AH... HAHAHA HMMM

470
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:33,231
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, HOW CAN I SAY NO?

471
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,204

472
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,438

(CLOCK TICKING)

474
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,345
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI, I NEED YOU
TO STAY BEHIND IN THE CITY.

475
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,646
UH...

476
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:49,881
I'VE GOT A TASK FOR YOU TO DO

477
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,251
THAT ONLY YOU ARE
CAPABLE OF COMPLETING.

478
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,754
I NEED YOU TO PROTECT THE
PRINCESS WHILE I'M GONE.

479
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:00,958
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THERE ARE SPIES

480
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,328
SUSPECTED FROM MINAMI
IN THE CITY.

481
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,662
AND IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY HERE,

482
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:07,732
MY LORD BELIEVE THE
PRINCESS NEEDS PROTECTION.

483
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,768
I CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT, HOWEVER...

484
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,637
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
HE HAD ANOTHER REASON

485
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,173
TO LEAVE ME HERE IN AKIHABARA

486
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,942

[AKATSUKI] HM...?

487
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,078
WHAT IS THAT
YOU'RE EATING?

488
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,113
RED BEAN BUN.

489
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:22,780
RED BEAN BUN...?

490
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,483
AND WHAT KIND OF TEA IS THIS
THAT YOU'RE HAVING WITH IT?

491
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,285
[AKATSUKI]
ROASTED GREEN TEA.

492
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:30,288
SO I'M GUESSING APPLE TEA ISN'T
EXACTLY TO YOUR LIKING THEN?

493
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:34,159
RED BEAN BUNS AND ROASTED
GREEN TEA ALWAYS GO TOGETHER.

494
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,128
OKAY...

495
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,333
I DON'T GET IT...
EVERYTHING'S SO DIFFICULT.

496
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,834
HM...?

497
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,969
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE
SINCE I CAME TO AKIHABARA,

498
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,871
AND THERE'S STILL A
LOT ABOUT YOUR CULTURE,

499
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:48,206
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

500
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,941
I GUESS, THERE'S A LOT
I NEED TO LEARN

501
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,477
ABOUT THE CUSTOMS
OF YOUR PEOPLE.

502
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:56,548
UH... MY PREFERENCES
AREN'T CUSTOM.

503
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,051
APPLE TEA IS NICE, TOO.

504
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,155
AKATSUKI, THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO KIND.

505
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:04,822
(ANNOYED GROAN)

506
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,392
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHY DO I FEEL SO AWKWARD?

507
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,277
HMMMM...

508
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,947
[TATARA] GOOD MORNING.
[AKATSUKI] MPH...

509
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,483
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
JUST ABOUT EVERY GAMER KNOWS

510
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,652
THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET POWERFUL
EPIC‐CLASS ITEMS IN RAIDS.

511
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,155
THAT'S HOW MY LORD
ACQUIRED HIS GRIFFIN.

512
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,591
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS THE
PROOF THAT YOU AND YOUR PARTY

513
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:41,793
COMPLETED A LARGE
SCALE RAID OR EVENT.

514
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,862
ME, I DON'T HAVE ANY
RAIDING EXPERIENCE AT ALL.

515
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:47,565
ANOTHER WAY TO GET AN ITEM
OR WEAPON LIKE THAT

516
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,167
IS TO BUY ONE
FROM A VENDER.

517
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,536
BUT THAT CAN BE
VERY EXPENSIVE.

518
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,571
HOWEVER...

519
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:54,772
[TATARA]
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

520
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:56,541
THE PRICE IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.

521
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,810
I DON'T CARE TO HAGGLE.

522
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,246
(SIGH)

523
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,782
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
NO WAY!

524
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:07,385
THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE
EVERYTHING I HAVE!

525
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,455
I MUST GET STRONGER!

526
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,362
[VOINEN] THIS IS IT. THE BOTTOM
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM...

527
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,398
[FEDERICO] IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK IT WAS HERE!

528
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:23,201
JUST LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THOSE
DOORS, THEY'RE RIDICULOUS.

529
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,570
AND THIS IS THE
ENTRANCE, RIGHT?

530
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,671
[SHIROE]
IT IS.

531
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,106
[NAOTSUGU]
WE FINALLY MADE IT!

532
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,774
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
ALRIGHT, SHIROE.

533
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:32,277
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE AFTER INSIDE THESE DOORS.

534
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:35,480
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T GET IT.

535
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,984
YOU'VE GOT A DREAM, LITTLE MAN.
AND I'M GONNA RIP IT TO SHREDS!

536
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,519
BY THE TIME I'M DONE WITH YOU,

537
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,989
YOU'RE GONNA BE CRYING FOR
SOMEONE TO GET YOU OUTTA HERE!

538
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,015
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
SLUMBERING FAR BENEATH

539
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,218
THE DEPTHS OF PALM LIES
THE RAID ZONE ABYSSAL SHAFT.

540
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:22,787
THERE, THE FULL‐RAID
PARTY BEGINS.

541
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,589
IN A BATTLE OF OFFENSE
AND DEFENSE,

542
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,892
SHIROE, WILLIAM, AND DEMICAS END
UP FIGHTING NOT ONLY THE BATTLE,

543
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,195
BUT THEIR OWN FEELINGS AS WELL.

544
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:33,398
AND ANOTHER MUST FIGHT
HER OWN LONELINESS.

545
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,302
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
