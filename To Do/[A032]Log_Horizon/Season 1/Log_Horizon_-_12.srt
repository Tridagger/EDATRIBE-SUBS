00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,739
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] DUNGEONS
ARE PLACES SUCH AS ABANDONED
STRUCTURES,

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,508
FORTRESSES, SHRINES, OR CAVES.

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,776
WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS
THEY'RE ENCLOSED AREAS

4
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,613
WHERE IT'S EASY FOR MONSTERS
TO GET THE DROP ON YOU.

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,616
A LOT OF DUNGEONS ARE HOME
TO LOW‐LEVEL MONSTERS.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,851
HOWEVER, WHAT SEEMS LIKE
A LACK OF MONSTERS

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,219
CAN MEAN SOMETHING HUGE,

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,655
LIKE A DRAGON IS GUARDING
A TREASURE THERE.

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,391
BIG DRAGON, ENCLOSED SPACE...
NOT GOOD FOR ADVENTURERS.

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,694
AND IT'S A WHOLE LOT HARDER
THAN FIGHTING ONE IN THE OPEN.

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,630
YOUR TEAMWORK HAS
TO BE IMPECCABLE

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,699
OR YOU WON'T LAST LONG.

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,264

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,299

HM.

16
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,241
[SHIROE, THINKING] IT'S KIND
OF STRANGE, BUT THIS IS THE
OPENING THEME TO "ELDER TALES."

[SERJIAD] ONCE YOUNG LADIES
IN EASTAL COME OF AGE,

THEY MAKE THEIR SOCIAL
DEBUT AT A FORMAL BALL.

19
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,250
THE 10‐DAY CONFERENCE
BEGINNING TOMORROW ALSO HOLDS

20
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,154
A SIMILAR PROMISE FOR
US TO GET ACQUAINTED.

(SLOW WALTZ CONTINUES)

22
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,799
[SERJIAD] SO WHY DON'T
YOU JOIN THE DANCE?

23
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,333
[SHIROE] EHH?
[MICHITAKA] HUH?

24
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,803
HA HA! TAKE A
LOOK OUT THERE.

25
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,708
THEY'RE ALL FASCINATED
WITH YOU. HOW ABOUT IT?

26
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,611
AH. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MISS?

MY LORD'S NINJA.

28

I CANNOT BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC. AAH!

(SHIROE CHUCKLES WEAKLY)

30

31
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,624
[MICHITAKA] NO, NO.
I'M MORE OF A ROUGHNECK
THAN SOME DANCER GUY.

THE OBVIOUS CHOICE IS‐

33

34

[SHIROE] UH!

35
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,064
[KRUSTY] SINCE I REPRESENT
THE ROUND TABLE,

36
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,401
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE
THAT I SHOULD TALK MORE
WITH HIS LORDSHIP.

37
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,369

I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

[SHIROE, THINKING] YOU'RE
ENJOYING THIS, AREN'T YOU?

40
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,412

MYSELF AND GET IT OVER WITH.

[HENRIETTA] SHIROE...
[SHIROE] HUH?

42
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,020
A GENTLEMAN MUST NEVER ALLOW
HIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE TO SHOW.

43

RIGHT NOW YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
THE ROUND TABLE'S DELEGATION.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,627
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

OK. SINCE YOU'RE BEING
SUCH A GOOD BOY,

DANCE, RIGHT?

53
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,924
THIS IS BOUND TO GET
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

54

YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT MY
CLASS IS, AREN'T YOU, SHIROE?

55

68

THEY PLAY A SUPPORT ROLE
IN MOST PARTIES, HMM.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,411
A SUPPORT ROLE?

70
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,914

AN ENCHANTER DOES?

[NAOTSUGU] THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BARDS AND ENCHANTERS

78
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,730
IS THAT THEY USE MUSIC.

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,865
[NYANTA] ONE OTHER TRAIT THAT
DISTINGUISHES A BARD IS

80

OF THEIR ABILITIES, HUH.

FOR 10 DAYS.

162
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,940
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
WALL‐TO‐WALL EVENTS
GOING ON EVERY DAY.

163
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,744
THE MAJORITY IS BACKROOM
DEALS AND PRIVATE MEETINGS,

164
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,780
LIKE A BUNCH OF
LITTLE TEA PARTIES.

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,615
THE POLITICS HERE
ARE A LITTLE TOUGH

166
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,149
FOR ME TO GET MY HEAD AROUND.

167
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,620
HOWEVER, I HEARD THAT
THERE'S 24 NOBLE HOUSES

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,755
IN EASTAL'S LEAGUE
OF FREEDOM CITIES.

169
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,791
ADD THE ROUND TABLE,
AND THAT'S 25.

170
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:56,029
LORD SERJIAD'S CITY OF
MAIHAMA HAS A POPULATION
OF 30,000 OR SO.

171
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,132
[TAKAYAMA] SO IN
TERMS OF PURE NUMBERS,
A CITY LIKE AKIHABARA

172
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,268
IS KIND OF SMALL WHEN YOU
CONSIDER WE ONLY HAVE 20,000.

173
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,772
[SHIROE] I ALREADY HAVE AN
IDEA OF WHAT THE NOBLES
WANT TO FIND OUT.

174
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,073
FIRST AND FOREMOST,

175
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,242
FIND OUT WHAT AMBITIONS
THE ADVENTURERS HAVE

176
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,178
AND THE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS
OF THE ROUND TABLE.

177
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,647
BUT LAST NIGHT AT THE BALL,

178
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,950
IT'S LIKELY THAT WE DISPELLED
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS.

179
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,653
[KRUSTY] OK, THEN. SO THEIR NEXT
PLAY IS GOING TO BE GETTING US

180
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,021
TO WORK FOR THEM.

181
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,156
[SHIROE] RIGHT. REMEMBER,
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE,

182
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,359
WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A
SINGLE QUEST FROM THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

183
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,427
(CLOCK GONGS)

184
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,929
[KILIVA] THE MAY INCIDENT

185
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,064
IS CERTAINLY THE CAUSE
OF ALL THIS TROUBLE.

186
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,200
THE ADVENTURERS SUPPOSEDLY REFER
TO IT AS "THE APOCALYPSE."

187
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,738
UNTIL NOW, THE ADVENTURERS OF
AKIHABARA WERE PRETTY FRAGMENTED

188
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,073
AND DISORGANIZED.
WHICH, OF COURSE,

189
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,142
MADE THOSE INGRATES MUCH
MORE EASY TO DEAL WITH.

190
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,077
[DALTE] THEY WERE
ALWAYS QUITE USEFUL

191
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,412
IN EXTERMINATING MONSTERS
AND GUARDING CARAVANS.

192
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,748
AS LONG AS YOU PAID THEM,

193
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,850
THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

194
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,785
BUT EVER SINCE THIS
APOCALYPSE OF THEIRS,

195
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,554
THEY HAVE HARDLY VENTURED
OUTSIDE OF THEIR CITY

196
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,988
TO HELP US AT ALL.
(CLOCK GONGS)

197
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,090
AND NOW THEY'VE FOUNDED
THAT ROUND TABLE.

198
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,193
I GUESS THEY'RE MAKING
AN ATTEMPT TO RULE THEIR
CITY JUST LIKE WE DO.

199
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,528
(CLOCK GONGS)

200
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,329
I'VE HEARD THEY'RE
DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY

201
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,898
AT A RAPID PACE.

202
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,100
WE HAVE TO GET THEIR BRIGHTEST
MINDS WORKING FOR US QUICKLY.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,870
OTHERWISE, WE'RE GOING TO
WIND UP HAVING THE WHOLE LOT

204
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,972
OF THEM LEAVE US BEHIND!

205
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,741
[SHIROE] WHAT THEY'LL NEED IS
OUR POWER AND ABILITIES.

206
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,611
BUT THEY'LL NEVER ACT LIKE
WE'RE SUPERIOR TO THEM AT ALL.

207
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,781
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THEY MIGHT
GRANT A NOBLE TITLE TO KRUSTY

208
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,415
OR TO THE ROUND
TABLE AS AN ENTITY.

209
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,819
THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA TRY
TO MAKE US BEHOLDEN TO THEM.

210
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,688
THE PROBLEM IS HOW
TO DEAL WITH THEM

211
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,422
WHEN THEY COME TO
US INDIVIDUALLY

212
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,024
RATHER THAN THROUGH
THE ROUND TABLE.

213
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,226
THAT'LL BE KIND
OF TOUGH.

214
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,128
[SHIROE] CHANCES ARE GOOD THAT
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THE GAME

215
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,231
WHERE NOBLES GO TO THE
GUILDS OR INDIVIDUALS
TO DO THEIR BIDDING.

216
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,966
I'M SURE THE WARRIOR AND
CRAFTING GUILDS WILL WANT

217
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,902
WHATEVER THE NOBLES OFFER THEM,
JUST LIKE THE GAME.

218
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,004
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

219
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,472
[MICHITAKA] POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS
WON'T SAY NO EITHER.

220
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,441
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR
THE ROUND TABLE

221
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,711
TO MONITOR EVERYONE
ALL THE TIME,

222
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,445
NOR IS IT OUR PURPOSE
TO BEGIN WITH.

223
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,149
MAYBE, BUT WE PROBABLY
STILL NEED TO LAY DOWN
SOME GUIDELINES.

224
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,018
[SHIROE] AND THAT'S ONE
REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT

225
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,886
FOR US TO KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE THINKING.

226
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,456
SO IT'S YOUR TURN,
AKATSUKI. YOU'RE UP.
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

227
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,958
[SHIROE]
RECONNAISSANCE, PLEASE.

228
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,027
[AKATSUKI] HM. I'M ON MY WAY.

229
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,897
(GRUNTING)

230
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,232
[RUNDELLHAUS] HUH?

231
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:16,336
[NYANTA] WELCOME TO THE
FOREST OF LAGLANDA.

232
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,014
[NYANTA] IT'S RATHER
EXPANSIVE INSIDE,

233
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,851
BUT BASICALLY AT THE
FIRST FORK IN THE PATH,

234
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,086
THE RIGHT SIDE LEADS
TO THE BEGINNER COURSE.

235
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,422
THE LEFT IS FOR
INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS.

236
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,724
HMM.

237
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,425
DON'T PUSH YOURSELVES TOO HARD.

238
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,095
TRAINING INVOLVES KNOWING
YOUR CURRENT LIMITS

239
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,530
AND WORKING WITH THEM, HMM?

240
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,366
[NAOTSUGU] THAT'S RIGHT.
DON'T GET YOURSELVES KILLED.

241
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,634
[REZARICK] LISTEN UP, GUYS.

242
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,969
YOU'LL ALL BE CAMPING
IN THE CLEARING HERE

243
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,971
AND GOING INTO THE
DUNGEON EVERY DAY.

244
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,508
I'LL BE HERE TO GIVE YOU FURTHER
TRAINING AFTER YOU GET OUT.

245
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,009
(CLAPS HANDS)

246
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,078
ALL RIGHT! LET'S SPLIT UP
INTO OUR COMBAT TEAMS, PEOPLE.

247
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,746
PICK WHO YOU WANT
TO ADVENTURE WITH

248
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,314
AND HOLD YOUR STRATEGY MEETINGS.

249
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,716
THEN HIT THE DUNGEON!

250
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,417
[YOUNG PLAYERS] YES, SIR!

251
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,821
[TOYA] OK, EVERYBODY,
WHY DON'T WE START
BY INTRODUCING OURSELVES?

252
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,858
I'M TOYA. I'M A SAMURAI,
AND I'M LEVEL 29.

253
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,595
LET ME HANDLE
THE FRONT LINES, OK?

254
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,096
I'M SERARA.

255
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,998
I'M A DRUID AND A HEALER.

256
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,633
AND I'M AT LEVEL 25.

257
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:23,804
I'M NOT GOOD AT ATTACKING STUFF,
BUT LEAVE THE HEALING TO ME!

258
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,472
I'M ISUZU,
AND I'M A BARD CLASS.

259
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,975
I'LL BE HELPING WHEN IT'S
TIME TO ATTACK SOMETHING.

260
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,178
I'M AT LEVEL 24.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

261
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,981
I'M MINORI.
I AM A SHRINE MAIDEN.

262
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,483
AND MY SPECIALTY IS
CASTING DEFENSIVE MAGIC.

263
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,353
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH SERARA

264
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,189
TO KEEP ALL OF YOU HEALTHY
AND OUT OF THE CATHEDRAL.

265
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,526
I'M AT LEVEL...
(MOANS SOFTLY)

266
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:46,927
...AT LEVEL 21.

267
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,262
YOU'RE LEVEL 21? HMPH!

268
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,798
DO ME A FAVOR AND
DON'T SLOW ME DOWN.

269
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,399
HMPH. WHO ARE YOU?

270
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,871
MM‐HMM. I AM NONE OTHER THAN
THE MIGHTY RUNDELLHAUS CODE.

271
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,172
BUT IF YOU FIND
YOURSELF IN A HURRY,

272
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,473
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME RUDY.

273
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,808
[TOYA] WHAT'S
YOUR CLASS?

274
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,409
[RUDY] ISN'T MY APPAREL
AND APPEARANCE

275
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,811
THE DEAD GIVEAWAY?

276
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,279
I'M A SORCERER, OF COURSE.

277
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,249
YOU SURE TALK A LOT, DON'T YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR LEVEL?

278
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
(RUDY CHUCKLES)

279
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,285
23, MY FRIENDS.

280
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,921
[TOYA] SO WHY ARE YOU GIVING
MY SISTER A HARD TIME?!

281
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,189
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR.

282
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,024
MY GRACEFUL YET
DEVASTATING TECHNIQUE

283
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,026
WILL ANNIHILATE
OUR ENEMY.

284
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,128
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STAND
BACK AND SUPPORT ME, OK?

285
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,297
[TOYA] SORCERERS DON'T
FIGHT UP FRONT, STUPID!

286
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,167
[RUDY] TRY NOT TO GET
CAUGHT UP IN THE SEMANTICS.

287
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,902
HA HA!

288
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,171
[SERARA] UM, HEY.
SO IF IT'S OK,

289
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,139
WHY DON'T WE WORK ON
OUR STRATEGY?

290
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,408
[TOYA] WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING ANYWAY?

291
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,811
[ISUZU] YEAH. I REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

292
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,445
[MINORI] HEY, GUYS, I KNOW.

293
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,147
MAYBE WE SHOULD START
WITH OUR BASIC FORMATION

294
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,549
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT‐

295
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,084
[RUDY]
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT!

296
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,387
WE JUST NEED TO GET FIRED UP
AND READY FOR COMBAT!

297
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,022
I DON'T KNOW...

298
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,625
[TOYA] OH, YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY!

299
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,594
I'M ABOUT TO KICK
SOME MONSTER BUTT!

300
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,061
[MINORI] MAYBE NOT.

301
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,364
LET'S TAKE THAT DUNGEON!
THAT'S RIGHT! WHO'S THE MAN?!

302
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,335
YES, BUT ALSO REMEMBER TO
BE ELEGANT IN ALL THINGS.

303
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,772
BUT A MAN MUST BE CRANKED UP
AND RAGING TO WIN THE DAY!

304
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,709
COME ON, NOW!
LET'S DO THIS! WHOO!

305
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,143
(BOYS LAUGHING)

306
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,745
(TOYA LAUGHS)
[RUDY] YEAH!

307
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,015
[MINORI, THINKING]
WHY ARE BOYS SUCH BOYS?

308
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,554
RIGHT. LET'S GO.
(SERARA WHIMPERS)

309
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,625
[NAOTSUGU] TOYA, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU PROMISED ME?

310
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:25,992
[TOYA] SENSEI?

311
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,762
[NAOTSUGU] THE JOB OF
A FRONT‐LINE TANK IS

312
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,430
TO ABSORB ALL THE ENEMY HITS

313
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,533
AND TO ALWAYS TRUST THE
REST OF HIS GROUP.

314
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:36,970
TOYA, AS A MAN, YOU MUST
PROMISE TO BE AWESOME.

315
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,772
I REMEMBER, SENSEI.

316
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,807
RIGHT ON, LITTLE MAN.

317
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,008
[NYANTA] HMM?

318
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,779
LITTLE MINORI,
WHAT'S WRONG, HMM?

319
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,815
OH, I, UH, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

320
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,884
LISTEN, IF YOU EVER
HAVE A PROBLEM,

321
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,285
YOU MUST STEP FORWARD.

322
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,956
BUT NOT WITH YOUR LEGS;
WITH YOUR HEART.

327
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,510
[TOYA] WHAT'S GOING ON?
[RUDY] MONSTERS NOW?

328
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,312
[MINORI] CALM DOWN, DANG IT!
WE NEED SOME LIGHT FIRST!

329
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,583
[RUDY] YOUR WISH
IS MY COMMAND.

330
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,451
[ISUZU] I HOPE THE ENEMY
DOESN'T USE THAT AS A BEACON.

331
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,088
[RUDY] WELL, I'M HOPING
THEY'LL DO EXACTLY THAT!

332
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,656
ARE YOU KIDDING?

333
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,593
[MINORI] MOST OF THE ENEMIES
HERE ARE OF THE UNDEAD VARIETY.

334
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,027
[SERARA] THAT'S RIGHT.

335
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,428
THE UNDEAD CAN SEE
US IN THE DARK.

336
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,297
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF WE HAVE LIGHT.

337
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,466
BUT WE'RE NOT BETTER OFF
FUMBLING AROUND WITHOUT IT.

338

IGNITING FOX LIGHT!

BRIGHTER, SEE?!

340
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,573
LOOK AT THAT!

341
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,341
[SERARA] THIS ISN'T A
COMPETITION, YOU SHOWOFF!

342
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,476
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR
LIGHT GOES OUT, HUH?!

343
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,279
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE MORE THAN ONE!

344
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,283
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING
MY LIGHT WAS WEAK OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

345
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,687
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
'CAUSE I'M AWESOME! HA HA!

346
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,322
(GROANS)

347
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,230
[ISUZU] UH, NOT GOOD.

348
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,699
[MINORI] IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF
THE GROUPS THAT WENT BEFORE US

349
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,868
BATTLED A FEW SKELETONS HERE.

350
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,302
[RUDY] HMM?

351
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,204
[SERARA] THERE'S A
FORK UP AHEAD.

352
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,373
[ISUZU] UM, WASN'T THE
RIGHT FOR BEGINNERS

353
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,676
AND THE LEFT FOR
INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS?

354
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,379
[TOYA] LOOKS LIKE THE GROUP
AHEAD OF US WENT LEFT.

355
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,682
LET'S GO THIS WAY. COME ON.

356
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,283
[RUDY] YEAH, SURE.

357
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,820
JUST DON'T THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
THE EASY PATH EVERY TIME, OK?

358
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,793
HOLD UP. HEY, RUNDELLHAUS?

359
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,996
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CAST
YOUR MAGIC FROM THE BACK.

360
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,265
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, MISS MINORI?

361
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,634
THE BATTLE BEGINS THE MOMENT
THE ENEMY IS IN SIGHT.

362
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,504
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WASTE
WAITING ON EVERYONE ELSE

363
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,774
WHILE I CAN CAST MY SPELLS
FROM THE FRONT OF OUR FORMATION.

(MINORI SIGHS)

365
00:17:56,777 --> 00:18:00,346
[MINORI, THINKING]
I GUESS I'LL JUST HELP HIM
IF HE GETS INTO TROUBLE.

366
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,317
I CAN'T HEAL AS WELL AS SERARA,
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BOTH HEALERS.

367
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,554
BUT MY MAGIC CAN CANCEL A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENEMY DAMAGE.

(BELLS JINGLE)

369
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,526
THE SAMURAI'S STRENGTH IS
ITS POWERFUL ATTACKS,

370
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,360
BUT THEY HAVE A LONG
COOL DOWN PERIOD.

371
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,730
TIMING THEIR ATTACK IS
THE TRICKY PART.

372
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,664
[TOYA] UH!

373
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,498
[TOYA] WAIT UP.

374
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,600
[ALL] HM?

375
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:26,840
WE'VE GOT 3.

[MINORI] TOYA! DON'T JUST
CHARGE STRAIGHT IN THERE!

380
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,788
[TOYA] I KNOW!
IIZUNA SLASH!

381
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,192

AT LONG DISTANCES.

00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,197

UH! PURIFICATION BARRIER!

391
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:09,115
OH, NO. I NEED TO USE MY
MAGIC FIRST OR IT WON'T WORK!

10 SECONDS UNTIL YOU'RE
ALL HEALED UP!

395
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,592
NOT TOO SHABBY, MR. TOYA.

396
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,361
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYTHING YET!

398
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,106
AMAZING!

399

IT HAS LIMITED RANGE,
BUT IT'S POWERFUL!

400

[SERARA] IS THIS THE TRUE
POWER OF THE SORCERER,

DID YOU DO JUST NOW?

ATTACKS WITH MAGIC,

IT AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCHES
ANOTHER ATTACK.

428
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,379
[TOYA] GREAT. THERE'S 5 OF THEM.

GONNA ATTACK HIM ON ALL SIDES.

I MUST REMAIN CALM.

435
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,663
FIRST I SHOULD CAST MAGIC
TO PROTECT THE FRONT ROW!

HUH?

NO, IT'S TAKING TOO
LONG TO CAST!

00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,367
THEN I'LL JUST BURN

TO ASH AGAIN.
