NOT GONNA COME AT ALL.

MAKING PLANS TO LAUNCH

HAS A LEADER, AND THE

STILL THE PROBLEM.

WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

66
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,650

ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

67
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,351
WE'RE GONNA GET
A VICTORY.

68
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,353
THE PROBLEM'S GONNA
BE AFTER THE FIGHT.

69
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,624
THE GOBLINS ARE SURE TO
SCATTER ALL OVER THE PLACE.

70
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,327
AND THEY'LL PROBABLY HIT EVERY
OCCUPIED VILLAGE IN THEIR WAY.

71
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,930
WHENEVER POSSIBLE,
WE'VE BEEN MAKING SURE

72
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,497
WE SURROUND THEM, BOX THEM IN,

73
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,567
AND CHIP AWAY AT THE EDGES.

74
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,203
HOWEVER, IF WE DON'T
DEDICATE SOME OF OUR FORCES

75
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,405
TO DEFENDING CHOSHI AS WELL...

76
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,376
THEN THEY'RE GONNA END UP
NIPPING AT OUR HEELS INSTEAD.

77
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,712
THAT'S THE
REAL PROBLEM.

78

ABOUT IT, SIS.

93

LIKE A BIG WALKING PILE OF MOJO.

166
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,931
HE'S PUTTING IT ALL OUT THERE.

167
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,101
HE'S USING ALL HIS PENT‐UP
TEENAGER EMOTIONS IN HIS MAGIC.

168
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,369
[MINORI] RUDY. DON'T BLAST
EVERYTHING SO HARD.

169
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,671
[RUDY] YEAH. I GOT IT.

170
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,639
[MINORI] SERARA.

171
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,140
EVERYONE'S HEALTH IS GOOD.

172
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,341
GET BACK ON OFFENSE!

173
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,710
YOU'LL BE MORE HELP
THERE FOR NOW.

174
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,211
[SERARA] ALL RIGHT.

175
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,947
[MINORI] 10 SECONDS UNTIL WE
CAN RECAST GUARDIAN BARRIER!

176
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,616
[NAOTSUGU] AND MINORI
DOES A GOOD JOB

177
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,718
OF KEEPING A WATCHFUL
EYE ON THE BIG PICTURE

178
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:18,985
THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT.

179
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,154
EVERYONE'S TEAMWORK,
ENEMY LOCATION,

180
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,890
ENEMY ENCOUNTER ORDER,
AND THE ENEMY DEFEAT ORDER.

181
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,693
[NYANTA] WHAT'S NICE IS THAT
YOU GET TO USE THAT INFORMATION

182
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,295
LATER ON AFTER YOU'VE STARTED
TO KEEP TRACK OF IT.

183
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,533
AND THEN I PUT IT IN A
LITTLE BOOK I CALL "TACTICS."

184
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,569
THAT WAY, IT JUST BECOMES
EASIER NEXT TIME.

185
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,370
ALL THESE FACTS
SHE'S TRACKING

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,040
HAS HER FIGHTING
JUST LIKE SHIROE.

187
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,275
DOWN TO THE
PERCENTAGE POINTS,

188
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,344
AND 30 SECONDS AT A TIME.

189
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,046
I THINK...

190
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,848
[NAOTSUGU] I THINK
WHAT HE MEANT WAS

191
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,784
THAT HE WAS FIGHTING BY LOOKING
30 SECONDS INTO THE FUTURE.

192
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:55,421
AND HE CLOSELY TRACKS HIS
ALLIES' REMAINING MP DOWN TO 1%.

193
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,324
NOW, TRACKING THE MP OF
ALLIES IN DIFFERENT CLASSES

194
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,696
IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT
MONITORING THE STATUS SCREEN.

195
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,966
BUT HE CAN TRACK IT TO
A SINGLE PERCENTAGE POINT.

196
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,001
PLUS, MONITOR THE ENEMY STATUS

197
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,204
TO PREDICT WHERE THE BATTLE
WILL BE IN 30 SECONDS.

198
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,508
HE CAN MAKE EVERYTHING HAPPEN
THE WAY HE WANTS IT TO.

199
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,843
THAT'S WHEN SHIROE
IS AT HIS BEST...

200
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,312
IN HIS OWN CREATED COMBAT.

201
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,549
A FULL CONTROL ENCOUNTER.

202
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,618
[MINORI] TOYA!
YOU NEED TO FALL BACK!

203
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:28,421
HEY, SERARA, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO CAST A GROUP HEALING SPELL!

204
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,323
ROGER THAT!

205
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,859
[NAOTSUGU] OF COURSE, WE
ACTUALLY LIVE WITHIN
THIS WORLD NOW,
[TOYA] EAT THIS!

206
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,497
[NAOTSUGU] SO, I DOUBT
HE'S ABLE TO SEE A FULL 30
SECONDS AHEAD LIKE HE USED TO.

207
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:41,401
EITHER WAY, MINORI IS DEFINITELY
TRYING TO MIMIC OR RECREATE

208
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,671
HER OWN VERSION OF SHIROE'S
FULL CONTROL ENCOUNTER.

209
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:50,110
[NYANTA] MINORI‐CHI IS
CHASING AFTER SHIROE,
THAT'S FOR SURE. NYAH.

210
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,681
YEAH. MAKES ME WONDER
HOW FAR AHEAD SHE CAN SEE.

211
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,616
(DISTANT SHRIEKING)
HUH?

212
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,050
UHH!

213
00:11:58,619 --> 00:11:59,820
[NAOTSUGU] DO YOU HEAR THAT?

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,556
[NYANTA] IT'S A DRUID
SPECIAL ATTACK MAGIC.

215
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,759
THE SHRIEKER ECHO. HM.

216
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,062
[MINORI] I HAD SERARA SET
IT UP AS A WARNING SYSTEM.

217
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,065
I'M SURE THE GOBLINS
ARE COMING BACK.

218
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,568
[TOYA] WE'VE GOT
THIS ONE, MASTER!

219
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,469

[ISUZU] HANG ON, RUDY!

220
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,040

221
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,274

[MINORI] MASTER NAOTSUGU,
[GROUP] HUH?

223
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,779
[MINORI] WE CAN HANDLE
THE GOBLINS IF YOU LET
US GO AFTER THEM NOW.

224
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,584

SO WE SHOULD HAVE GOOD
SUSTAIN ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

225

228
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,704

ON HEALING FOR NOW!

229
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,372
