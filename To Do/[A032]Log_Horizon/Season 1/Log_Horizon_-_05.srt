1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:09,075
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] NON‐PLAYER
CHARACTERS ARE PEOPLE IN THE
GAME THAT AREN'T PLAYERS.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,144
THEIR DIALOGUE IS SET
BY THE PROGRAMMERS,

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,747
AND THEY DON'T HAVE
DISTINCT PERSONALITIES.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:18,418
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THERE TO
FULFILL ROLES AT CERTAIN
POINTS IN THE GAME.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,689
IN "ELDER TALES," PLAYERS
ARE CALLED ADVENTURERS,

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,160
AND NON‐PLAYERS ARE CALLED
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,733
HOWEVER, THE APOCALYPSE
MAY HAVE CHANGED THAT.

8
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,696
[MARIELLE] SERARA?

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,364
YOU'RE OK, RIGHT?

10
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,268
I‐I'M, LIKE, SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT BACK
FROM SUSUKINO, SWEETIE!

11
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,672
[SERARA] YES. I'M SORRY
I WORRIED YOU.

12
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,006
GOOD‐BYE.

13
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,744
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M REALLY SAFE NOW, RIGHT?

14
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,580
[SHIROE] YEAH. WE'RE PAST
THE LYPORT CHANNEL NOW.

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,282
[NYAN‐TA] AND BRIGANDIA
DOESN'T HAVE ANY GRIFFINS.

16
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,018
THEY'RE WEEKS BEHIND US,
SO DON'T EVEN WORRY.

17
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,787
IT'S ALL GOOD.

18
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,557
UH...

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,893
[SERARA] NOW THAT I'M SAFE,
I JUST FEEL KIND OF...

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,929
THANK YOU, EVERYONE!

21
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,231
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

22
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,733
(STOMACH GROWLS)
UH!

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,504
UH‐OH. LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY'S TUM‐TUM
ISN'T TOO HAPPY.

24
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,173
[AKATSUKI] DO YOU
EVER SHUT UP?!

25
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,975
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY, I FART, TOO.

26
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,410
(LAUGHTER)

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,418
[NAOTSUGU] OH, MAN.

28
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,353
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
PITCHED A TENT BEFORE.

29
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,890
[SHIROE]
WELL, START BY LAYING
OUT THE GROUND SHEETS.

30
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,594
UH, I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU SAYING YOU EVER
ROUGHED IT BACK HOME.

31
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,663
THAT'S TRUE, BUT I READ
A BOOK ABOUT IT ONCE.

32
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,132
OF COURSE, I'M BETTING
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE

33
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,568
THIS EASY FOR ME
IN THE REAL WORLD.

34
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,805
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S
TRUE ABOUT A LOT OF
THINGS AROUND HERE.

35
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,573
[NAOTSUGU]
IT'S PRETTY CRAZY.

36
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,474
(RUSTLING)

37
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,710
(GASPS)

38
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,778
[SERARA]
WILD DEER?

39
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,381
SO THERE ARE ANIMALS IN THIS
GAME THAT AREN'T MONSTERS.

40
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,583
[NYAN‐TA]
WELL, NOW.

41
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,785
THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A TIME TO SHINE.

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,920
(DING)

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,387
[SERARA] AH!

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,924
[NAOTSUGU]
THERE WE GO.

45
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,926
WE'VE GOT A
PLACE TO SLEEP.

46
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:50,030
[SHIROE] IT'S KIND OF
SATISFYING, COMPARED TO JUST
HAVING TO LOG OUT AND GO TO BED.

47
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,167
[NAOTSUGU] SINCE WE'RE OUT IN
THE BUSH, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
FUN DOING IT THE HARD WAY.

48
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,969
[SHIROE]
THAT'S RIGHT.

49
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,706
[SHIROE] BUT OUR FOOD
ISN'T EXACTLY...

50
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,675
[NAOTSUGU] IT LOOKS
SO GOOD, SHIROE,

51
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,378
BUT IT STILL TASTES LIKE
ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!

52
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,881
[AKATSUKI] SERARA AND
NYAN‐TA ARE RUNNING LATE.

53
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,115
(NAOTSUGU SNIFFS)

54
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,551
DO YOU SMELL THAT?!

55
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,252
[SHIROE]
WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU?

56
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,820
(NAOTSUGU AND AKATSUKI SNIFF)

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,855
WHAT?

58
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,791
IT SMELLS LIKE
MEAT ROASTING.

59
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,493
(SIZZLING)

60
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,164
[NYAN‐TA] HMM, DID THE SMELL
OF THIS FINE CUISINE ROUSE YOU
FROM YOUR BASE CAMP?

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,165
[SERARA] HEY!

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,833
[NAOTSUGU] TELL YOU WHAT,

63
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,970
I'M WILLING TO GIVE
TASTELESS MEAT A TRY
IF IT SMELLS THIS GOOD.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,074
(TRIUMPHANT BELLS)

65
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,342
YEAH!

66
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,545
(MOUTH FULL)
THIS IS...
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT!

67
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,047
[SHIROE] (MOUTH FULL)
THE TEXTURE WHEN
YOU BITE INTO IT...

68
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,482
THE DELICIOUS JUICES!

69
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,318
[NAOTSUGU] THE SWEETNESS
OF THE FAT... AWESOME!

70
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,453
(MOUTH FULL)
JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF SALT,

71
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,356
AND HE OBVIOUSLY USED
ROSEMARY IN IT, TOO!

72
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,859
IT'S, WITHOUT A DOUBT...

73
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,028
[ALL] REAL FREAKING FOOD!

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,396
[NYAN‐TA] OH, YEAH.

75
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,932
AWESOME! I LOVE YOU!
MORE, PLEASE!

76
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,300
[NYAN‐TA] NOW, NOW.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,235
[SHIROE, AKATSUKI, AND NAOTSUGU]
PLEASE, PLEASE!

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,504
[NYAN‐TA]
PLENTY TO GO AROUND.

79
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,072
SO, HOW THE HECK
DID YOU DO IT ANYWAY?

80
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,373
(SERARA GIGGLES)

81
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,442
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,

82
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,178
YOU CAN PICK THE ITEM YOU
WANT FROM OFF THE MENU.

83
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,614
YOU DIG?

84
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,248
AND IT WILL MAKE
YOU FOOD ITEMS

85
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,518
THAT LOOK JUST LIKE
THE REAL THING.

86
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,353
[SHIROE]
RIGHT. THAT'S JUST
LIKE THE GAME.

87
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,255
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, BUT
YOUR FOOD HAS FLAVOR.

88
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,926
[NYAN‐TA] AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING
OF THIS AS A GAME.

89
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,696
AFTER ALL, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
STILL HAVE THEIR FLAVOR, RIGHT?

90
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,132
[NAOTSUGU] HUH.
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

91
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,433
WELL, THEN.

92
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,336
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
THE SAME THING I DID:

93
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,672
JUST DON'T USE
THE INTERFACE.

94
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,607
FORGET ABOUT TAPPING
YOUR FINGERS IN THE AIR

95
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,577
AND USE YOUR OWN HANDS
TO COOK YOUR DINNER.

96
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,679
IT'S THAT EASY, BABY.

97
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,715
I KNOW. I TRIED TO
DO THAT, TOO, CHIEF.

98
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,283
CHECK IT OUT.

99
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,118
[NAOTSUGU]
BLAM‐O!

100
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,687
PURPLE PUKE STICK!

101
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,989
[SHIROE] BOILING IT TURNS IT
INTO A WEIRD PASTE OF SOME KIND.

102
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,059
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,
IT ALL TURNS OUT LIKE THIS.

103
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,929
I MEAN, WE JUST FIGURED
THAT THIS WAS THE WAY
IT WAS GONNA BE HERE.

104
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,099
[NYAN‐TA] WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME
AS IF THE PERSON WHO WAS
PREPARING YOUR FOOD

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,171
DIDN'T HAVE A SUBCLASS OF CHEF
OR OTHER SIMILAR COOKING SKILL.

106
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,539
[NAOTSUGU]
OK. SO YOU'RE...

107
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,974
THAT'S RIGHT, HOLMES.

108
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,578
I HAVE MASTERED THE GENTLEMANLY
ART OF BEING A CHEF.

109
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,513
[NAOTSUGU] WHOA.
[SHIROE] MAKES SENSE.

110
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,447
SO SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE
THE SKILL AHEAD OF TIME

111
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,817
TO MAKE A DECENT
MEAL FOR HIMSELF.

112
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,586
[SHIROE, THINKING]
HE'S GOT A POINT.

113
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,088
I'M REALLY STILL STUCK
IN THAT GAMER MENTALITY,

114
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,890
WHICH MEANS...

115
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,925
(NAOTSUGU CHEWS LOUDLY)

116
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,460
[AKATSUKI] MASTER NYAN‐TA?
[NAOTSUGU] "MASTER"? REALLY?

117
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,097
[AKATSUKI] ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE MYSELF PROPERLY.

118
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,364
MY NAME IS AKATSUKI.

119
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,701
MY CLASS IS ASSASSIN,
AND I'M AT LEVEL 90.

120
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,804
[NYAN‐TA] AND YOU DID SOME FINE
WORK BACK THERE, YOUNG LADY.

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,173
[AKATSUKI] IT WAS NOTHING.
THE WAY YOU FOUGHT
WAS MASTERFUL.

122
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,677
[NAOTSUGU]
WELL, HOLD UP. I HAD A
PRETTY GOOD FIGHT MYSELF.

123
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,679
YOU ARE A
WORTHLESS TURD.

124
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,147
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

125
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,750
[AKATSUKI] WHATEVER, TURD.
[NAOTSUGU] YOU'RE A TURD.

126
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,719
(SHIROE AND NYAN‐TA CHUCKLE)

127
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,254
[NYAN‐TA] I SEE YOU HAVE
SOME GOOD COMPANIONS...

128
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,989
YOU, TOO,
LITTLE ONE.

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,257
HUH! RIGHT!

130
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,893
I GUESS I SHOULD INTRODUCE
MYSELF PROPERLY.

00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,638
BUT, UH, I...

135
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,873
[SERARA]
I'M SORRY FOR THE
TROUBLE I CAUSED WITH

136
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,609
MY POOR HEALING SKILLS
BACK IN SUSUKINO.

137
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,410
[NAOTSUGU] DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, OK?

138
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,646

139
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,614

HUH?

142
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,287

MEANS SO MUCH TO ME,
I CAN'T TELL YOU!

[SHIROE] UH, NO.

144
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,792

THAT SPECIAL, ALL RIGHT?

EASY TO EMBARRASS.

ALL ABOUT YOU.

YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD
YOU'RE THE THIRD‐CUTEST
IN YOUR CLASS,

MORE SECRET LOVE LETTERS
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

TOO MUCH, YOU DUMMY.

BACK WHEN WE WERE
PLAYING THIS AS A GAME,

164
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,470
WE ALL JUST HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE SAME LOOSE‐KNIT
GROUP OF PLAYERS.

165
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,673
YOU MIGHT'VE EVEN
HEARD OF US...

166
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,875
WE WERE THE DEBAUCHERY
TEA PARTY.

167
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,677
THAT'S RIGHT.

168
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,715
I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT A
LEGENDARY GROUP THAT COMPLETED
A LOT OF DIFFICULT QUESTS

169
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,551
WHEN THE ADMINS ADDED
THEM TO THE GAME.

170
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,620
[AKATSUKI] THAT WAS MY LORD
AND MASTER NYAN‐TA?

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,722
HEY, DON'T FORGET
ABOUT ME!

172
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,692
[SERARA] WOW. SO THAT MEANS
ALL OF YOU WERE IN THE SAME
GUILD TOGETHER ONCE.

173
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,095
[NAOTSUGU]
NAH, IT WASN'T A GUILD...
MORE LIKE A HANGOUT.

174
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,697
[SERARA] OH.

175
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,600
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
US WAS IN A DIFFERENT
GUILD AT THE TIME.

176
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,802
AND WE WEREN'T
ALL THAT ORGANIZED,

177
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,705
BUT WE DID HAVE
SOME GOOD ADVENTURES
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

178
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,674
[NYAN‐TA] I SUPPOSE THAT'S
WHAT MADE US STRONG.

179
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,809
[NAOTSUGU] HMM.

180
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,178
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

181
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,516
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE TO ASK
WHY MY LORD AND HIS FRIENDS
CAN SUMMON GRIFFINS.

182
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,151
THAT'S A HIGH‐LEVEL QUEST,

183
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,721
AND THAT'S HOW THEY WORK
SO WELL TOGETHER.

184
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,923
(AKATSUKI WINCES)

185
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:21,862
I FOUGHT BY MY LORD'S SIDE ON
SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS NOW.

186
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,999
I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WORKING
IN TANDEM WITH HIM LIKE THAT.

187
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,035
I HAVE TO PRACTICE MORE.

188
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,672
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI?
[NAOTSUGU] TUMMY ACHE?

189
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,273
[AKATSUKI] SHUT. UP.

190
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,409
NOW, THEN, IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU JUST LIED TO ME.

191
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,011
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

192
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,713
THERE'S NO WAY THE
DEBAUCHERY TEA PARTY

193
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,482
COULD'VE HAD SOMEONE
LIKE NAOTSUGU IN IT.

194
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,284
I WAS THERE!

195
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,686
(CRACKLING)

196
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,220
[NYAN‐TA] WHEN ALL
WAS SAID AND DONE,

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,855
WE'D GONE ON QUITE
A FEW QUESTS

198
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,824
AND SEEN QUITE A
FEW PLACES, HMM?

199
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,259
[NAOTSUGU]
MADE FRIENDS,
DID QUESTS...

200
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,228
IT WAS A
BLAST, DUDE.

201
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,731
RIGHT.

202
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,068
(GRIFFINS SCREECH)

203
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,744
[NYAN‐TA] MMM.

204
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,446
[SERARA, THINKING]
NYAN‐TA IS SO AWESOME!

205
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:17,651
HE'S HANDSOME, YOUNG, KIND,
AND ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP.

206
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,553
NO, I THINK HE'S OLDER.

207
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,089
A HANDSOME MIDDLE‐AGED
MAN? BUT HE'S SO IN SHAPE.

208
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,792
SERIOUSLY, I WONDER
HOW HE DOES IT.

209
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,828
NEXT TO HIM, I LOOK KIND OF FAT.

210
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,230
OK, MAYBE I'M A
LITTLE OVERWEIGHT...

211
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,333
[SERARA] OH, NYAN‐TA,
YOU'RE JUST SO PERFECT...

212
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,968
[NAOTSUGU] SO OBVIOUS.

213
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,671
SO THE LITTLE GINGER'S
INTO OLDER CAT DUDES.

214
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,105
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

215
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,474
I GUESS NYAN‐TA'S
GOT IT GOING ON.

216
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,475
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)

217
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,644
SERARA HAS
GOOD TASTE.

218
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,145
[BOTH] HUH?!

219
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,347
[SHIROE] YOU MEAN YOU'VE GOT
A THING FOR CAT GUYS, TOO?!

220
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,183
[NYAN‐TA] MEOW?
[AKATSUKI] THE MASTER IS
A FIRST‐CLASS SWORDSMAN.

221
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,286
[SHIROE, THINKING]
OK. SWORDSMAN. HMM.

222
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,489
I WONDER IF THE CHIEF'S OK
WITH ALL THEIR GIRLIE STUFF.

223
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,991
[AKATSUKI] UM, MY LORD?

224
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,125
[SHIROE] HMM?

225
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,194
YOU MAY NOT BE ADEPT
WITH A SWORD OR ANYTHING,

226
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,597
BUT YOU DO HAVE OTHER
APPRECIABLE TALENTS.

227
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,165
UH, OH, YEAH?

228
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,500
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU HURT MY
FEELINGS OR SOMETHING, DID YOU?

229
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,069
UH... UH...

230
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,571
OF COURSE NOT.

231
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,140
[SHIROE] HMM?

232
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,177
[NAOTSUGU] WHEN YOU SEE HER
LIKE THIS, SHE REALLY DOES
LOOK KIND OF YOUNG.

233
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,179
[SHIROE] HOW OLD DO YOU
THINK SHE REALLY IS?

234
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,983
[NAOTSUGU] WHO KNOWS?
I MEAN, WE ALL LOOK LIKE
OUR GAME AVATARS HERE.

235
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,986
JUST BASED ON HER LOOKS,
I'D SAY THAT SHE WAS
IN ELEMENTARY‐

236
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,021
OHH! GOD!

237
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,323
[SHIROE]
MIDDLE SCHOOLER, MAYBE?

238
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,092
I WONDER.

239
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,695
I GUESS SHE'D BE THE
SAME AGE AS THE TWINS.

240
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,262
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT TWINS?

241
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,032
[SHIROE] I RAN INTO THEM WHEN
THIS WAS STILL JUST A GAME.

242
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:43,704
THE GIRL WAS A SHRINE MAIDEN,
AND HER TWIN BROTHER
WAS A SAMURAI.

243
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,173
[BOY] MISTER?
MISTER! HEY, STOP!

244
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,410
[GIRL] UM, CAN WE
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

245
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,245
[BOY] A QUESTION!

246
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,648
[GIRL] MY BROTHER WAS JUST
IN A REALLY BIG FIGHT

247
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,650
AND I'M TRYING TO
HEAL HIS WOUNDS,

248
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,952
BUT MY MAGIC
IS TOO WEAK.

249
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,287
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY
ALL THE MAGIC‐Y STUFF?

250
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,591
[BOY] I NEED SKILLS,
TOO, DUDE. CAN YOU TELL
US WHERE TO GET 'EM?

251
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,128
[SHIROE] SO I'M GUESSING
THIS IS YOUR FIRST
TIME TO PLAY, HUH?

252
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,832
[GIRL] YEAH.
[BOY] THAT'S RIGHT.

253
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,835
[NAOTSUGU] REALLY? HAVE YOU
ALWAYS BEEN THAT NICE?

254
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,739
[SHIROE] I USUALLY DON'T LIKE
IT WHEN PEOPLE RUN UP ON ME
FOR ADVICE LIKE THAT.

255
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,140
[NYAN‐TA] TRUE.

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,142
[SHIROE] IT WAS THEIR FIRST
DAY PLAYING, YOU KNOW,

257
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,678
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE
ADVENTURING JUST FOR THE
SAKE OF ADVENTURE.

258
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,214
I EVEN TOOK SOME TIME
OFF FROM MY QUEST TO
SHOW THEM AROUND.

259
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,884
THE TEACHER SYSTEM
REALLY HELPED A LOT.

260
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,753
[AKATSUKI]
"TEACHER SYSTEM"?

261
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,156
[SHIROE] A SYSTEM THAT
ALLOWS HIGH‐LEVEL PLAYERS
TO DECREASE THEIR ABILITY

262
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,025
SO THAT THEY CAN PLAY WITH
THE LOWER‐LEVEL CHARACTERS.

263
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,529
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, BUT
HARDLY ANYONE USED IT.

264
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,897
IT WAS TOO RISKY.

265
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,266
YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS THE
IDEA BEHIND IT, THOUGH.

266
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,268
YOU COULD REENACT HOW YOU
PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING.

267
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,471
SO THE PEOPLE YOU
WERE TEACHING WOULD
EARN THEIR POWER‐UPS.

268
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:52,839
HMM.

269
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,440
YEAH, MAKES SENSE.

270
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,078
[NYAN‐TA] THAT'S A PRETTY
BRILLIANT DEDUCTION,
MISS AKATSUKI.

271
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,847
[NAOTSUGU]
OK, SO WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

272
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,116
[SHIROE] THEY'RE STILL
ON MY FRIENDS LIST.

273
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:07,320
THE SISTER IS MINORI, AND HER
YOUNGER BROTHER IS TOYA.

274
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,957
I SAW THEM SHORTLY AFTER
THE APOCALYPSE CAME TO PASS.

275
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,093
PRETTY ROUGH FOR
A COUPLE OF KIDS.

276
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,228
[SHIROE] BUT THEN I WOUND
UP BACK IN AKIHABARA.

277
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,463
EVERYTHING HAD
BECOME SUCH A MESS.

278
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,299
WE GOT SEPARATED
FROM EACH OTHER.

279
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,836
[AKATSUKI] I WAS ALSO TELEPORTED
INTO AN ABANDONED BUILDING.

280
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,538
(WAVES CRASHING)

281
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,107
[NAOTSUGU] MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
TRIED GETTING AHOLD OF THEM.

282
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,911
YOU KNOW, JUST TO MAKE
SURE THEY'RE SAFE...

283
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,813
[SHIROE] YEAH...

284
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,787
[NYAN‐TA] WELL, I'M SURE
HE HAD HIS REASONS.

285
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,422
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

286
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,258
[SHIROE] WE WERE GETTING
READY TO HEAD OUT HERE.

287
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,328
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD
THE TIME TO FIND OUT.

288
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,898
LAST TIME I SAW THEM,
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY
JOINED A GUILD.

289
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,900
[NAOTSUGU]
IS THAT RIGHT?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,002
[SHIROE] THEY WERE
LEVEL 8 WHEN WE LEFT,

291
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,371
BUT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE A LITTLE HIGHER NOW.

292
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,642
EVERYTHING SHOULD
BE OK IF THEY HOOKED
UP WITH A GUILD.

293
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,810
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO KNOW.

294
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,279
[SHIROE] HMM?
[NAOTSUGU] THAT MINORI...

295
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,948
WAS SHE A HOTTIE?

296
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,449
LIKE I WOULD KNOW.

297
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,652
ALL I COULD SEE IN THE
GAME WAS HER AVATAR,

298
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,486
AND HER VOICE WASN'T
ANYTHING SPECIAL.

299
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,624
OH, COME ON. YOU COULD
TELL A LOT FROM A CHICK'S
VOICE IF YOU LISTEN.

300
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,025
[AKATSUKI]
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

301
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,894
[NAOTSUGU] EXCUSE ME,
I WAS TALKING TO SHIROE!

302
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,429
(SHIROE LAUGHS)
[AKATSUKI] SHUT UP. YOU'RE
MAKING MY TEA TASTE BAD.

303
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,233
[NAOTSUGU] LOOK, DUDES LIKE
CHICKS! IT'S SCIENCE!

304
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,943
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, SHIROE.
THE CLOUDS ARE CLOSING IN ON US.

305
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,411
[NYAN‐TA] I'M WITH
NAUTSUGUCCHI ON THIS ONE.

306
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,615
WE NEED TO GET ON THE GROUND
AND UNDER SOME SHELTER.

307
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,983
THIS CAT AIN'T A
FAN OF THE RAIN.

308
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,551
[NAOTSUGU] RIGHT.

309
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,189
IF I REMEMBER, THIS ZONE HAS
A VILLAGE JUST PAST THOSE WOODS.

310
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,657
(THUNDER)

311
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,392
(MOO)

312
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,460
[NAOTSUGU] WHERE ARE WE?

313
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,863
[AKATSUKI] THE SOUTH END
OF THE ARB HIGHLANDS.

314
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,798
(MOO)

315
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,832
SHIROECHI?

316
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,300
YES?

317
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,203
SO HAVE YOU BEEN
ALONE SINCE OUR
LAST EXPEDITION?

318
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,237
HUH?

319
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,940
WITHOUT JOINING
A GUILD, I MEAN.

320
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,374
UM, WELL, CHIEF,

321
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,977
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
GUILD YOU WERE JOINING?

322
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,413
[SHIROE] UM, YOU KNOW,
THE CAT FOOD GUILD?

323
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,082
[SERARA] THE CAT FOOD
GUILD? WHAT'S THAT?

324
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,152
[NYAN‐TA] A PROUD ORGANIZATION
COMPRISED SOLELY OF PLAYERS

325
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,687
WHO PLAYED AS CAT PEOPLE.

326
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,324
I LOVE SITTING ON THE PORCH,
BUT THE HOUSE WAS GETTING OLD.

327
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,760
OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, YOU KNOW?

328
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,061
HUH?

329
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,030
[CAT PEOPLE] MEOW...

330
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,665
HOW WONDERFUL!

331
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,035
[NYAN‐TA] IT WAS, RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE TIME THE WEATHER GOT TO IT

332
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,837
AND HALF THE HOUSE COLLAPSED.

333
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,338
[SHIROE]
SO IT BROKE UP?

334
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,574
(HEAVY DOWNPOUR)

335
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,210
[NAOTSUGU] HELLO?

336
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,946
[SHIROE]
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

337
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,014
COULD YOU POSSIBLY
PUT US UP FOR THE NIGHT?

338
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,618
[MAN] OH, MY. ADVENTURERS
AT MY DOORSTEP.

339
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,120
NOW, THAT'S A RARE
SIGHT, INDEED.

340
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,321
[NAOTSUGU]
HOW'S IT GOING?

341
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,457
[MAN] WELCOME TO
THE VILLAGE OF ARB.

342
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:01,161
[SHIROE, THINKING]
WAIT, IS THIS GUY REALLY AN
NPC, A PERSON OF THE LAND?

343
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,865
MY NAME HAPPENS TO BE FEDOR,
VILLAGE OMBUDSMAN.

344
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,166
PLEASURE'S MINE.

345
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,301
AH. IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

346
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,237
THAT'S COOL. YOU GOT
A NAME AND EVERYTHING.

347
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,876
[SERARA] WOW!
[FEDOR] NOW, YOU KIDS GO
AHEAD AND USE THIS BARN

348
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,811
FOR AS LONG AS
YOU LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

349
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,079
[SHIROE] THANK YOU.

350
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,080
(NAOTSUGU GASPS)

351
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,682
IT'S REALLY HAY!

352
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,984
MOVE IT. YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR STINK ON
EVERYONE'S BEDDING.

353
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,552
WHATEVER!

354
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,621
UH, COULD I TROUBLE
YOU TO SHOW ME TO
THE HEARTH, HMM?

355
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,023
[FEDOR] IT'S RIGHT
OVER THERE, FELLA.

356
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,093
[SERARA] I'M READY
TO COOK. HOW ABOUT YOU?

357
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,628
[NAOTSUGU] I'M GONNA
NEED MORE THAN THAT!

358
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,663
[AKATSUKI] THIS IS FOR MY LORD!
[NAOTSUGU] COME ON!

359
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,199
[FEDOR] YOUR FRIENDS ARE
QUITE LIVELY, AREN'T THEY?

360
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,301
[SHIROE]
YEAH. HEH.

361
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,871
[FEDOR] OH. SO YOU'RE
GOING TO AKIHABARA?

362
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,773
[SHIROE] YES.

363
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,442
[FEDOR] PEOPLE OF THE LAND
LIKE US DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT
OF TRAVELING, YOU KNOW.

364
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,778
[NAOTSUGU] IF YOU WANT
TO HEAR A STORY OR TWO,
WE'VE GOT PLENTY.

365
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:56,783
[FEDOR] YEAH? I BET
YOU GOT TALES TALLER
THAN A GRIFFIN'S EYE.

366
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,119
[SHIROE] UH...

367
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,054
DON'T JUST STAND THERE
STARING AT OUR GUESTS.

368
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,023
COME ON IN.

369
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,357
DON'T BE AFRAID, NOW.

370
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,426
[KIDS] GOOD AFTERNOON!
[SHIROE] HI THERE.

371
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,929
[NAOTSUGU] OH, YOU
GUYS SURE ARE CUTE.

372
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,030
WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES?

373
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,065
[GIRL] MISCHA.
[BOY] IVAN.

374
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,868
MISCHA AND IVAN?
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

375
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,336
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.

376
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,303
(CRINGING)

377
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,072
[MISCHA] A NINJA?
[IVAN] A NINJA!

378
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,241
[MISCHA] IT'S A NINJA!
[IVAN] DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL!

379
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,743
DO A BACKFLIP!
KICK MY SISTER!

380
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,245
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE TAKEN A
SHINE TO YOUR FRIEND THERE.

381
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,281
THEY'RE ALL THE
SAME SIZ‐ AH‐AH‐AH!

382
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,150
(MOO)

383
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,185
[FEDOR] THEY'RE MY
GRANDCHILDREN.

384
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,088
IT WAS ONE HELL OF A DAY
WHEN THEY WERE BORN.

385
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,389
[SHIROE]
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

386
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,125
10 BELOW, AND THEIR
FATHER ALREADY DECIDED

387
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,461
TO GO OUT IN THE
BLIZZARD TO THE MARKET.

388
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,230
I WAS THE ONLY MAN
HERE, SO HERE I GO

389
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,867
CARRYING THEIR MOTHER TO THE
DOCTOR ON THE OTHER SIDE‐

390
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,268
[IVAN] GRANDPA, COME HERE!

391
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,270
[FEDOR] WHAT IS IT?
[NAOTSUGU] THIS IS CRAZY, MAN.

392
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,274
EVEN THE NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS
HAVE BACK STORIES THAT MAKE
THEM SEEM REAL, SHIROE.

393
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,976
(CHILDREN LAUGH)
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,

394
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,444
I'D SWEAR I WAS TALKING
TO REAL PEOPLE.

395
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,047
[SHIROE] THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE.
[NAOTSUGU] HMM?

396
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,885
[SHIROE] SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
DON'T GIVE THOUSANDS
OF NPCs FAMILIES,

397
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,753
FEELINGS, AND MEMORIES.

398
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,056
WE RUN AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE
ACTING LIKE WE'RE SUPERHEROES,

399
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:15,061
AND IN A WORLD LIKE THIS
WE CAN'T EVEN DIE NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES WE TRY.

400
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,329
SERIOUSLY.

401
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,664
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT
KIND OF MAKE US

402
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,901
THE FREAKS AND THE
WEIRDOES IN THIS PLACE?

403
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,269
I GUESS SO.

404
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,971
[SHIROE] THEY'RE THE ONES
ACTUALLY LIVING HERE.

405
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,408
IT'S THEIR WORLD. THEY'RE
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

406
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,443
[NAOTSUGU] EVER SINCE
THIS WHOLE THING WENT DOWN,

407
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,880
IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE
BEEN SEEING MORE OF
THEM THAN BEFORE.

408
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,218
YOU THINK WE DIDN'T NOTICE
THOSE GUYS BECAUSE WE WERE
PLAYING, YOU KNOW?

409
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,987
[SHIROE]
AND QUESTING?
YEAH, MAYBE.

410
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,422
[SERARA] TA‐DA!

411
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,357
DINNER'S GONNA
BE AWESOME!

412
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,827
[NYAN‐TA]
WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO
VISIT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS.

413
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:50,463
LUCKY FOR US, THEY WERE
NICE ENOUGH TO SELL US
SOME FOOD, NOW.

414
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,198
[SERARA]
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

415
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,267
THEY ACTUALLY SOLD US
CHEESE AND SAUSAGE!

416
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,569
[AKATSUKI]
SO YOU MEAN...

417
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,604
YOU DIDN'T USE THE
MENU TO MAKE THOSE?

418
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,339
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

419
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,475
NO, CHEESE AND SAUSAGE
ARE ACTUALLY INGREDIENTS.

420
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,311
AND THEY'RE REALLY TASTY
WHEN OUR CHEF COOKS 'EM.

421
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,214
[SERARA] WE MANAGED TO GET
BUTTER AND EGGS, TOO!

422
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,617
AND I ALSO GOT SALT
WHEN I WAS IN SUSUKINO.

423
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,253
THAT MEANS WE CAN MAKE
A BATCH OF COOKIES!

424
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,155
[NYAN‐TA]
MMM, RIGHT.

425
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,224
"COOKIES"?
WHAT ARE THOSE?

426
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,197
(RIBBIT)

427
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,466
[IVAN AND MISCHA]
OHH... MMM.

428
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,334
[BOTH] AH!

429
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,473
AH!

430
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,776
[IVAN] WHAT ARE THESE?
[MISCHA] SO GOOD!

431
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,443
[IVAN] YEAH!

432
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,412
(IVAN AND MISCHA GIGGLE)

433
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,381
[MISCHA] THESE ARE GOOD.

434
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,285
[SHRADER] GET MOVING!

435
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,354
WE NEED TO GET BACK BEFORE
THE TRIFFIDS RESPAWN.

436
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,091
OUR HEALER WAS SENT
TO THE CATHEDRAL.

437
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,458
(GROANS)

438
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,228
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF DAMN BABYSITTER?

439
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,964
THIS IS FREAKIN' RIDICULOUS.

440
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,032
[ISUZU] UH!

441
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,333
ARE YOU OK?

442
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,269
SORRY, TOYA. GUESS
I JUST GOT DIZZY.

443
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,871
THAT GUY...

444
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,274
[TOYA] TWO OF US DIED TODAY
BECAUSE OF THAT JERK.

445
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,611
[ISUZU] YEAH, BUT
I HATE TO SAY IT,

446
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,313
WE'RE NOT THAT STRONG
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

447
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,348
[SHRADER] UNBELIEVABLE.

448
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,783
WELL, WE DIDN'T
HIT OUR QUOTA,

449
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,086
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU
STUPID KIDS ARE TOO WEAK.

450
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,354
[TOYA] THAT'S CRAP.

451
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,657
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE
LEVEL 8s AND HE'S A 28.

452
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,059
THAT'S WHY WE GOT
BEAT UP OUT THERE!

453
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,493
[ISUZU] WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, TOYA?

454
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,962
[TOYA] I STILL DON'T
REALLY GET IT,

455
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,465
BUT HE'S LIKE A MAGNET
FOR MORE POWERFUL MONSTERS.

456
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,035
I CAN'T PROVIDE DEFENSE
IF THEY'RE ATTACKING HIM!

457
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,369
[GIRL] AAH!

458
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,872
[TOYA] THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GETTING DESTROYED!

459
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,142
I GUESS THAT MAKES
SENSE. IT'S NOT FAIR.

460
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,910
OK. I GET IT.

461
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,481
THAT'S WHY SHIROE
USED THE TEACHER SYSTEM
TO LOWER HIS STATS.

462
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,416
[SHRADER] YOU TWO
NEED TO SHUT UP!

463
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,919
YOU'RE GIVING
ME A HEADACHE!

464
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,422
[TOYA] COME ON.
WE'RE ALMOST BACK TO
AKIHABARA. YOU CAN MAKE IT.

465
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,892
[ISUZU] YEAH. OK.

466
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,595
(THUNDER)

467
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,298
[MINORI] IF THEY GAVE YOU
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME,

468
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,734
THOSE WOUNDS WOULD
HEAL ON THEIR OWN.

469
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,336
THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP
RUNNING YOU OUT THERE.

470
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,173
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HANDS?
DO THEY HURT?

471
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,641
[MINORI] MY HANDS...

472
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,943
I JUST GOT TO GET USED
TO THE SEWING, I GUESS.

473
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,311
(FUMING)

474
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,214
MAN, WHY DID WE JOIN THIS
STINKING GUILD ANYWAY?

475
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,816
WE WERE STUCK.

476
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,720
WE WERE LOST, AND WE DIDN'T
BOTHER TO ASK ANYONE ELSE.

477
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,121
(CLOCK STRIKES)

478
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:31,892
[SHRADER] ALL RIGHT, YOU LITTLE
PANSIES, SHOW US YOUR HANDS.

479
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,231
CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY.

480
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:43,036
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PRETTY
WORTHLESS, YOU CAN STILL
EARN 3 MEALS A DAY.

481
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,540
(SHRADER LAUGHS)

482
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,711
I WONDER WHAT... WHAT
WOULD SHIROE DO ABOUT THIS?

483
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,746
[TOYA] HOW WOULD HE
GET OUT OF HERE?

484
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,080
HUH!

485
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,518
BROTHER SHIROE...

486
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:04,457
[SHRADER] WELL, THAT'S
EVERYONE. LET'S GO.

487
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,193
AND TRY NOT TO GET
YOURSELVES KILLED TODAY.

488
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,394
GOT IT?

489
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,464
[MARIELLE]
THANKS, SHIROE!
THANK YOU!

490
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,767
[SHIROE] YOU DON'T NEED
TO THANK ME, MARIELLE.

491
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,637
[TOYA] I KNOW THAT VOICE.
IT'S GOT TO BE...

492
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,304
[NAOTSUGU]
LET GO OF MY NECK!

493
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,040
[TOYA] BROTHER SHIROE!

494
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,616
[SHRADER]
HEY, SHAKE A LEG, BOY.

495
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,418
YOU WANT TO EAT
TONIGHT, DON'T YA?

496
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,890
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
WE RETURNED TO AKIHABARA,

497
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,593
WHICH SEEMED TO BE REGAINING
A MEASURE OF PEACE.

498
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,728
HOWEVER, IT WAS THE KIND
OF PEACE THAT HAPPENS

499
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,430
WHEN THE WEAK RELINQUISH
CONTROL TO THE STRONG.

500
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,466
DO SOME SEE IT
AND DO NOTHING?

501
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,068
IS SHIROE ONE OF THEM?

502
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,703
WILL HE ONLY WATCH AS
THE WORLD AROUND HIM

503
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,806
BECOMES MORE WARPED
AND UNBALANCED?

504
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,809
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
