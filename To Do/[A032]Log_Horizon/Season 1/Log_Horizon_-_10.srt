1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,238
[TOYA] HMM.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,409
[MINORI] HEY. ARE WE
REALLY GONNA... TOYA?

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,711
[TOYA] HMM.

4
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,008
[MARIELLE] OH WOW!

5
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,876
AHH!

6
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,979
TAKOYAKI! AHH!

7
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,017
[HENRIETTA] YOU CAN EAT LATER.
WE STILL HAVE THINGS TO BUY.

8
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,920
OH, WHY ARE YOU
SO MEAN, UMEKO?

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,254
[HENRIETTA] ERR!

10
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,825
YOU PROMISED NOT TO CALL
ME BY THAT NAME AGAIN.

11
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,492
NOW LET'S GO.

12
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,729
AAH!

13
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,764
(WHIMPERING)

14
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,265
OHH?

15
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,202
HUH.

16
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,740
[HENRIETTA]
WHAT'S WRONG?

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,074
HOLY MOLY!

18
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,310
AKIHABARA REALLY HAS
CHANGED, YOU KNOW?

19
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,512
HMM.

20
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,947
[HENRIETTA]
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

21
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,982
REAL CHANGE
TAKES A WHILE.

22
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,051
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE
IT'S GOING TO STICK,

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,453
BUT LET'S JUST TEMPER
OUR OPTIMISM A LITTLE.

24
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,855
(SLAM)

25
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,457
[ISAAC] YOU GOT OUR ATTENTION
NOW, SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US

26
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,661
WHAT YOU AND THAT RINKY‐DINK
GUILD OF YOURS HAS IN MIND?

27
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,297
OR WAIT! DO YOU
EVEN KNOW THAT YET?

28
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,476
[SHIROE] I HAVE TWO PRIMARY
GOALS FOR THE ROUND TABLE.

29
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,112
WE HAVE TO START BY MAKING
THE SOCIAL CLIMATE LIVABLE

30
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,748
FOR THE PEOPLE
HERE IN AKIHABARA.

31
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,019
PART OF THAT IS COMMERCE
LIKE THE CRESCENT
BURGER PHENOMENON.

32
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,487
MARIELLE.

33
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,623
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE
THAT MY GUILD IS CURRENTLY

34
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,758
RUNNING A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT CALLED

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,993
CRESCENT MOON...

36
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,995
COME ON, MARIELLE.
YOU CAN DO IT.

37
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,431
[MARIELLE] IT'S BECAUSE WE
PREPARE FOOD WITH ACTUAL FLAVOR,

38
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,768
AND IT'S TIME WE REVEALED
THAT SECRET TO YOU.

39
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,903
OH!

40
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,270
SO HERE'S THE TRICK.

41
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,073
GET NORMAL INGREDIENTS TOGETHER,

42
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,242
DON'T USE THE COMMAND
MENU TO PREPARE THEM.

43
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,111
PLUS, A CHEF HAS TO DO IT,

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,915
AS IN SOMEONE WITH
THE SUBCLASS OF CHEF
WHO DOES IT HIMSELF.

45
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,249
HUH?

46
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,718
[MARIELLE] ALSO, DON'T
EXPECT MUCH FROM A CHEF

47
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,252
WITH A LOW SKILL LEVEL.

48
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,021
THAT'S IT REALLY.

49
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,825
THE TRICK TO MAKING A BETTER
BURGER IS THAT THERE ISN'T ONE.

50
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,327
SO YOU JUST COOK YOUR MEALS
YOURSELF INSTEAD OF USING

51
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,563
THE COMMAND MENU
TO DO IT FOR YOU?

52
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,565
WELL, THAT'S NOT
MUCH OF A SECRET.

53
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,967
[SHIROE] THIS DISCOVERY
IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND,

54
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,401
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

55
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,270
THE FACT THAT WE CAN MAKE
CHANGES LIKE THIS IN THIS

56
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,941
WORLD IS FAR TO
SERIOUS TO IGNORE.

57
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,408
MICHITAKA...

58
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,444
[MICHITAKA]
YEAH. THE MARINE AGENCY,

59
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,448
WITH SOME HELP FROM RODERICK'S
MERCHANT GUILD AND THE PEOPLE
FROM SHOPPING STREET 8,

60
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,051
WE'VE ACTUALLY CREATED
A WORKING STEAM ENGINE.

61
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,519
[OTHERS] OHH!

62
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,555
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A PROTOTYPE.

63
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,123
WE STILL HAVE A
FEW BUGS TO WORK OUT,
BUT IT'S PRETTY

64
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,759
GOOD AS PROOF
OF CONCEPTS GO.

65
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,426
[SHIROE]
IT'S STILL PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU WENT

66
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,062
AND DID THAT IN
JUST 12 HOURS.

67
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:26,399
UGH. HANG ON. WHAT'S
THE POINT IN TELLING
US ALL ABOUT THAT?

68
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,569
BASICALLY, IT MEANS THE
SECRET YOU JUST LEARNED

69
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,405
ABOUT COOKING ACTUALLY
APPLIES TO ANY OTHER
SKILL YOU MIGHT POSSESS.

70
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,610
BACK WHEN WE WERE PLAYING,
"ELDER TALES" DIDN'T LET
US USE STEAM ENGINES.

71
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,379
HOWEVER, ANY PLAYER WITH
THE PROPER SKILL LEVEL

72
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,815
AND DETERMINATION ONLY
NEEDS THIS WORLD'S

73
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:46,386
MATERIALS, A GOOD IDEA, AND
THE POWER OF HIS OWN HANDS.

74
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:53,059
WE CAN CREATE THINGS THAT
WEREN'T A PART OF THIS WORLD
BEFORE WE ARRIVED HERE.

75
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,597
[RODERICK] AND THAT MEANS
WE'RE AT THE START OF
A TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION.

76
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,265
AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES
MEAN NEW BUYERS.

77
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,467
[KARASHIN] AND THAT WILL
NECESSITATE AN INCREASE

78
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,637
IN ALL OUR CITIZENS'
SPENDING POWER.

79
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,140
THEY WON'T BE SITTING
AROUND DOING NOTHING.

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,645
WITH THIS POTENTIAL,
I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR
ALL 3 CRAFTING GUILDS.

81
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,148
WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY
RECOGNIZE THE ROUND
TABLE CONFERENCE.

82
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,249
[SERARA] AHH!

83
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,119
AW, YEAH.
THAT'S 3, BABY.

84
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,754
THIS CITY'S DEAD
RIGHT NOW.

85
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,624
EVERYONE'S WALKING
AROUND IN DESPAIR,

86
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,127
AND MOST PEOPLE JUST
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THEMSELVES.

87
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,262
LIVING IS WAY TOO CHEAP.

88
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,532
I'M TALKING ABOUT
ECONOMIC STIMULUS.

89
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,867
CREATE A SERIES
OF PRODUCTS AND
GOODS THAT ENHANCE

90
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:38,004
LIVES AND ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE TO SPEND TIME
EARNING MONEY.

91
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,543
[SHIROE]
TO EARN MONEY OR FOSTER
TRADE IN BARTERING,

92
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,645
WE'D NEED A LOT MORE
HUNTING PARTIES.

93
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,949
THIS IN TURN WOULD GIVE
THE WARRIOR GUILDS MORE
WORK AS BODYGUARDS.

94
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,885
PUBLIC SAFETY IS NEXT.

95
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,756
[SHIROE]
IT'S NOT LIKE WE NEED
DRACONIAN LAWS TO DO THIS.

96
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,892
IN FACT, THERE ARE
PLACES WHERE PLAYERS
SHOULD STILL FIGHT.

97
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,094
THE BOUNDARIES
OF HUNTING GROUNDS
FOR EXAMPLE.

98
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,497
WE SHOULDN'T ELIMINATE
THE ESSENCE OF COMPETITION
FROM OUR DAILY LIFE.

99
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,932
WE AGREE ON THAT.

100
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,569
[SHIROE] HOWEVER, THERE ARE
STILL OTHER THINGS THAT

101
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,238
NEED TO BE CONSIDERED OUT
OF BOUNDS... PLAYER KILLINGS.

102
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,640
HUH?

103
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,941
[SHIROE] WE REALLY SHOULD
CONSIDER THE PROHIBITION

104
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,510
OF PLAYER KILLING IN
THE LOWER LEVEL ZONES

105
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,911
OUTSIDE THE CITY.

106
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,681
THERE'S NO POINT IN FIGHTING
ANYONE BELOW LEVEL 50.

107
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,616
WE DON'T NEED
ANY BULLIES.

108
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,585
[SHIROE] LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HUMAN RIGHTS NEXT.

109
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,188
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT
DEATH IS NO LONGER
AN ABSOLUTE NOW...

110
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,556
I'VE ALREADY
SEEN AN EXAMPLE...

111
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,926
KIDNAPPING AND FALSE
IMPRISONMENT CAN BE WORSE.

112
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,261
AND LEAVING OR JOINING
A GUILD SHOULD BE UP TO

113
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,898
AN INDIVIDUAL AND
NEVER COMPULSORY.

114
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,265
DEFINITELY.

115
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,401
[SHIROE] ALL RIGHT.
THE LAST ITEM.

116
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,636
THE RIGHTS WE DISCUSSED.

117
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,538
WE ARE NOT THE ONLY
ONES WHO NEED THEM.

118
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,307
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
HAVE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS.

119
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,010
[OTHERS] HUH?

120
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,778
HUH?

121
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,346
THIS WORLD MIGHT
LOOK FAMILIAR,

122
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,682
BUT IT'S NOT THE
"ELDER TALES" WE KNEW.

123
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,553
OUR TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES ARE PROOF
THINGS ARE CHANGING.

124
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,454
[RODERICK]
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK‐

125
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,257
[SHIROE]
"ELDER TALES" IS THE
BASIS FOR ALL THIS,

126
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,027
BUT THIS IS A
DIFFERENT WORLD THAN
THE ONE WE USED TO KNOW.

127
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,864
WE CAN'T JUST ASSUME THAT
EVERY SINGLE FACET'S
GONNA BE THE SAME.

128
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,668
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
ARE THE ORIGINAL RESIDENTS
INSIDE THIS WORLD.

129
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,538
WE'RE THE STRANGERS,
AND WE'RE VASTLY OUTNUMBERED.

130
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:22,142
SO YOU'RE SAYING THESE
GUYS AREN'T NONPLAYER
CHARACTERS ANYMORE?

131
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,376
THAT'S RIGHT.

132
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,811
THEY'RE ALL
UNIQUE NOW.

133
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,114
THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN DREAMS,
DESIRES, AND GOALS.

134
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,250
THAT IS SO MORONIC.

135
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,320
[SHIROE] HAVE YOU EVER
SPOKEN WITH ANY OF THEM
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE?

136
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,523
WHY THE HELL WOULD I?

137
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,859
[MARIELLE] HEY. UH, CAN
I ADD SOMETHING TO THIS?

138
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,794
I TOTALLY JUST
REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

139
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,429
WE DON'T JUST
SERVE ADVENTURERS.

140
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,865
[KARASHIN] HUH?

141
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,399
THAT'S RIGHT. A LOT OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

142
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,601
WERE COMING BY.

143
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,135
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

144
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,004
EVERYONE WANTS
A GOOD MEAL!

145
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,406
[SHIROE] A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND CURRENTLY WORK

146
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,642
IN THE MARKET OR
THE GUILD BUILDING.

147
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,245
WE CAN'T GET
BY WITHOUT THEIR
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY.

148
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,814
WE NEED THEM.

149
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,284
HOWEVER, I'M PRETTY
SURE THEY CAN DO
WITHOUT US JUST FINE.

150
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:07,187
IF WE DON'T GOVERN OURSELVES
AND DO IT SOONER THAN LATER,

151
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,455
WE'RE RUNNING THE RISK OF
A BACKLASH AGAINST US

152
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,659
FROM A GROUP THAT CAN BEAT
US WITH SHEER NUMBERS.

153
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,734
ARE YOU SAYING WE MIGHT END
UP FIGHTING A WAR WITH THE

154
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,869
PEOPLE OF THE LAND, SHIROE?

155
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,605
[SHIROE] IF WE'RE THE
LEAST BIT RESPONSIBLE,

156
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,541
THEN WE HAVE TO
CONSIDER IT, YES.

157
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,655
THOSE OF THE D. D. D. AGREE TO
JOIN THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.

158
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,724
WE'LL BE PROACTIVE.

159
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,593
THE BRIGADE OF THE
WEST WIND AGREES, TOO.

160
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,762
YOU USED FULL
CONTROL AND COUNTER.

161
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,664
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
NOW, HASN'T IT?

162
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,799
OH, MAN, I WISH
YOU'D JOINED US.

163
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,637
WELL, DIVIDING THE
CITY WOULD BE USELESS.

164
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,239
THE BLACK SWORD
KNIGHTS ARE ALSO IN.

165
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,407
HONESTY AGREES,
AS WELL.

166
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,443
HMM.

167
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,278
GLENDALE'S ON BOARD.

168
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,147
RADIO MARKET AGREES.

169
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,414
US, TOO!

170
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,251
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
TOTALLY AGREES.

171
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,062
[MARIELLE] AND SO THE ROUND
TABLE CONFERENCE WAS
FOUNDED ON THAT DAY,

172
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:26,399
AND OF COURSE, WE WENT PUBLIC
WITH THE BIG RECIPE SECRET. HA!

173
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,771
[KRUSTY] THE WORLD WE'RE
IN IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE
"ELDER TALES" WE ONCE KNEW.

174
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,741
WE NEED TO ACCEPT
THIS AND STOP TREATING
IT LIKE A GAME.

175
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,778
WE ADDRESSED HUMAN RIGHTS AND
SECURITY IN OUR FIRST ATTEMPT.

176
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,112
[RODERICK] NEXT ITEM ON OUR
AGENDA IS FINDING OUT MORE

177
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,881
ABOUT WHY THE TRANSPORT
GATES DON'T WORK.

178
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,916
WE'LL DO SOME RESEARCH
ON TIMING THE FAIRY RINGS.

179
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:47,053
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

180
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,056
[EINS] EACH USE OF THE GUILD
BUILDING WILL COST ONE GOLD.

181
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,293
THIS WILL SERVE AS A
TAX FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

182
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,662
HMM.

183
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,935
[MICHITAKA] EAT, DRINK,
ENJOY ALL THE NEW FLAVORS
TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT!

184
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,638
[KARASHIN] GO AHEAD
AND EAT UP, EVERYONE!

185
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,375
[SMASH]
HEY! THAT'S MINE!

186
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,678
[LYCOPENE] OH, I
DON'T THINK SO.

187
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,181
[MARIELLE] OH, AND HAMELIN,
THEY WENT AND DISBANDED.

188
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,817
HMM.

189
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,451
[HENRIETTA]
TRUE TO HIS WORD,

190
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,954
SHIROE ACTUALLY
DENIED THEIR ACCESS
TO THE GUILD BUILDING.

191
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,990
[MARIELLE]
SO FOR A WHILE, THEY WERE
LOCKED IN THEIR GUILD HALL.

192
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,793
[HENRIETTA] RIGHT! AND IT DID
NOT MAKE THEM VERY HAPPY.

193
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,795
NOW A FEW OF THEM DID
THE SMART THING AND USED

194
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,932
THE CALL OF HOME TO TELEPORT
BACK OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES

195
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,868
AND DIDN'T BOTHER TRYING TO
GET BACK INTO THE BUILDING.

196
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,770
AND SOME OF THE NOT‐SO‐SMART
ONES JUST WENT

197
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,605
AND KILLED THEMSELVES SO
THEY'D HAVE THEIR OWN

198
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,541
RETURN POINT IN THE CATHEDRAL.

199
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:44,410
[MARIELLE] REGARDLESS,
THEY CAN'T USE THIS
GUILD BUILDING ANYMORE.

200
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,583
[HENRIETTA] EVERY LAST HAMELIN
MEMBER REALLY LEFT THE CITY.

201
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,317
YEAH. THAT'S NICE.

202
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,352
[HENRIETTA] HMM?

203
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,054
[MARIELLE]
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,

204
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,457
ALL THE KIDS WHO RAN
AWAY FROM HAMELIN THAT
DAY WANTED TO JOIN US.

205
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:01,427
SO WE HAD TO MOVE INTO A LARGER
GUILD HALL TO ACCOMMODATE
ALL THE NEW MEMBERS.

206
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,396
[HENRIETTA]
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE,

207
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,067
BUT I THINK SHORYU MIGHT
HAVE DONE A LITTLE TOO MUCH
DURING THE RAID ON HAMELIN.

208
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,002
IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE KIDS
WE PICKED UP ARE LIKE

209
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,739
BABY DUCKS WHO CONFUSE THEIR
FIRST TOY WITH THEIR MOTHER.

210
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,609
OH!

211
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,145
[SERARA] NYAN‐TA, WHAT
ARE YOU UP TO RIGHT NOW?

212
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,947
[MARIELLE] I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE SHIROE TOTALLY

213
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,184
ORCHESTRATED THAT
RESCUE WHILE HE WAS
AT THE CONFERENCE.

214
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,287
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
DOING BOTH OF THOSE
THINGS AT ONCE EITHER.

215
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,390
HE REALLY DID RUN
THEM OUT OF THE
CITY LIKE HE SAID.

216
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,860
YOU KNOW THAT
SHIROE CAN BE, LIKE,
REALLY SCARY SOMETIMES.

217
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,863
HMM? YOU KNOW WHAT
JUST DAWNED ON ME?

218
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,232
WHERE'S EVERYONE
FROM LOG HORIZON?

219
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:43,504
[HENRIETTA] OH, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE MOVING TODAY, TOO.

220
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,471
[MARIELLE] FOR REAL?

221
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,740
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY, SHIROE.

222
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,609
WHERE DO YOU WANT
THIS STUFF, MAN?

223
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,111
[SHIROE]
UH, OVER THERE, PLEASE.

224
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,478
HMM?

225
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,683
(HUMMING)

226
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,687
HEY. IT'S STARTING
TO SHAPE UP IN HERE.

227
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,088
[SHIROE]
KARASHIN?

228
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,990
HMM.

229
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,192
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT WAS HE HERE FOR?

230
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,128
[SHIROE] HE SUGGESTED HIRING
PEOPLE OF THE LAND AS

231
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,396
COURT REPORTERS FOR
THE ROUND TABLE.

232
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,765
HE'S GOT A POINT.

233
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,867
THEY'RE A LOT CHEAPER
THAN ADVENTURERS WOULD BE.

234
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,969
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
HEARING A WILD RUMOR.

235
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,771
PEOPLE OF THE LAND
ARE ACTUALLY COMING TO

236
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,740
AKIHABARA BECAUSE
OF THE COOKING.

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,942
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT, DUDE?

238
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,449
MY LORD, A LOT OF THEM ARE
ALREADY INSIDE THE CITY,

239
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,786
AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
MORE THAN JUST IMMIGRATION.

240
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,955
HMM. I'D AGREE
WITH THAT.

241
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,323
[MISA] HE'S WRONG THIS TIME.
[KRUSTY] HUH?

242
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,425
[MISA]
SHIROE FROM LOG HORIZON
BELIEVES THE ROUND TABLE IS

243
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,361
GOING TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT GOING TO WAR AGAINST

244
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:45,098
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND, BUT
HE'S FORGETTING ONE THING.

245
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,535
THE SIDE WITH NUMERICAL
SUPERIORITY DECIDES.

246
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:55,175
[KRUSTY] AT LEAST THAT'S THE
WAY IT WORKS OUT HISTORICALLY.

247
00:12:55,275 --> 00:13:00,013
WELL, VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES,
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

248
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,560
[SHIROE] WE SHOULD ASSUME
THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED.

249
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,895
HUH?

250
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:15,996
[MARIELLE] OH, MY GOODNESS!

251
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,063
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS AMAZING!

252
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,364
[MARIELLE] THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

253
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,200
[BOTH] HUH?

254
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,967
HA HA!

255
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,168
[HENRIETTA] OH, MY GOSH!

256
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,638
THIS NEW HAIRSTYLE
IS ADORABLE ON YOU.

257
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,607
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF CLEANING!

258
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,509
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE IT?

259
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:32,445
YOUR HOUSEWARMING GIFT? HA!

260
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,347
[HENRIETTA]
YOU'RE... GONNA...

261
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,048
[AKATSUKI] QUIT IT.

262
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,116
[SHIROE]
ARE YOU OK?

263
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,483
[NAOTSUGU]
IS SHE GONNA PUKE?

264
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,621
[MARIELLE] SHIROE, NAOTSUGU,
HOUSEWARMING GIFT!

265
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:43,857
TAKOYAKI, OKONOMIYAKI,
AND CREPES!

266
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,892
DID YOU HAVE TO DEEP
FRY THE DESSERT?!

267
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,360
YEAH, THERE'S TOO MUCH!

268
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,195
COME ON, SHIROE. YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO EAT A LOT,

269
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,032
OR YOU WON'T GROW
UP TO BE BIG AND
STRONG LIKE NAOTSUGU.

270
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,100
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
BIG BOY?

271
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,904
HANG ON. DID YOU GO AND GET
BIGGER ON ME SOMEHOW, NAOTSUGU?

272
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,940
[NAOTSUGU] UH, NOT REALLY.

273
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,076
THAT'S, UH...
THAT'S NOT ME.
[AKATSUKI] LEAVE ME ALONE!

274
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,546
[SOJIRO] WELL, HEY.
THE GANG'S ALL HERE.

275
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,847
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

276
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,549
WHOA! HEY, BABY!

277
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,683
HEY, THERE,
YOU GUYS!

278
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:10,951
WHAT'S UP?

279
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:15,522
LITTLE MAN, NAZNA,
WELCOME HOME, HUH?

280
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,190
WHAT'S SHAKING, BACON?

281
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,159
[AKATSUKI]
DO YOU KNOW THESE
TWO, MY LORD?

282
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,863
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM. NAZNA
WAS ALSO IN THE TEA
PARTY ALONG WITH SOJI.

283
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,798
[NAZNA]
THIS IS FOR YOU.

284
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,166
[NYAN‐TA] HMM?

285
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,334
[NAZNA] IT'S CHERRY SAKE
FROM OUR BREW MASTER.

286
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,304
WELL, NOW I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS LIBATION.

287
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,907
[SOJIRO] YOUR GUILD HALL
IS AMAZING, GUYS.

288
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,141
[MARIELLE] TOTALLY TOTES.

289
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,777
IT MUST HAVE COST A FORTUNE.

290
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,079
[SHIROE]
NOT MUCH REALLY.
TAKE A LOOK.

291
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,982
THAT TREE DESTROYED THE
ELEVATOR HALLWAY AND STAIRS,

292
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,185
SO IT WAS EMPTY, AND WE GOT IT
CHEAPER THAN YOU'D EXPECT.

293
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,187
AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR
THE CENTER OF THE CITY.

294
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,855
[HENRIETTA] HOW DID YOU
MANAGE TO GET THE ISSUES

295
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,824
WITH THE STAIRS
AND FLOORING FIXED?

296
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,860
[SHIROE] YEAH. I ASKED
MICHITAKA ABOUT THAT.

297
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,197
[MICHITAKA] I LIKE IT.
RENOVATING ALL THESE
RUN‐DOWN BUILDINGS

298
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,834
AND MAKING THEM USEFUL
AGAIN IS SOMETHING I CAN
TOTALLY GET BEHIND.

299
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,302
I DON'T LIKE
WASTED SPACE.

300
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,371
[SHIROE] SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK IT'LL COST?

301
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,640
HMM.

302
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,742
[NAOTSUGU]
AND, UH, REMEMBER,
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE,

303
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,676
SO DON'T RIP US OFF.

304
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,444
I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW.

305
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:14,681
OTHER THAN A CRESCENT BURGER,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT ANYTHING COSTS.

306
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,216
HUH?

307
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,118
IT'S NOT LIKE BUILDING AN
OFFICE OR A TRACK HOUSE.

308
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,355
ALL THIS STONE
AND MASON WORK IS
NEW TERRITORY FOR ME.

309
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,090
[HENRIETTA] SO WE REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUE

310
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,260
VALUE OF OUR GOODS AND
SERVICES ARE, RIGHT NOW.

311
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,162
WHEN IT COMES
RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

312
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,932
THAT'S A PRETTY GLARING
HOLE IN ANY ECONOMIC SYSTEM.

313
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,534
[NAOTSUGU] OH, I
FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

314
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,335
ISAAC CAME BY.

315
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,540
YOU GOT A BIG
ENOUGH PLACE, GUYS.

316
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,441
[SHIROE] ISAAC!

317
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,410
HEY. VILLAIN IN GLASSES,
THIS IS JUST ENOUGH SPACE

318
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,013
TO LET MY SUMMONERS
GET SOME WORK IN HERE.

319
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,382
[SHIROE] HEY. WAIT
A SECOND, ISAAC.
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

320
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,316
[ISAAC] DO IT!

321
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,417
[SUMMONERS] HM!

322
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,789
(GIGGLING)

323
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,958
COSPLAY CHICKS!

324
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,065
AAH!

325
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:07,968
HUH?

326
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,405
HEH. LATER.

327
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:16,009
THE CLEANING SERVICE
IS FREE THIS TIME.

328
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,011
[SOJIRO]
UH, NOT VERY SOCIAL.

329
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,148
[NYAN‐TA] THEY'RE NOT
AS BAD AS ONE MIGHT LEAD
YOU TO BELIEVE, MK?

330
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,484
HMM.

331
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,287
[SOJIRO] WE'RE MAKING A HUGE
BATH OVER AT OUR PLACE.

332
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,022
WHY DON'T YOU DROP
IN WHEN IT'S DONE?

333
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,290
[SHIROE] SOUNDS GOOD.

334
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,192
[HENRIETTA] SEE YOU
SOON, AKATSUKI,

335
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,729
WHEN WE CAN TAKE
OUR TIME.

336
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:41,001
WELL, SHIROE, YOU'VE
BUILT A LOVELY HOUSE.

337
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,903
[NAZNA]
LATER! SEE YOU AROUND!

338
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,037
[MARIELLE]
LET'S GO.

339
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,338
[SHIROE] OH!

340
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,774
ARE TOYA AND MINORI
DOING OK WITH YOU GUYS?

341
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,978
[MARIELLE]
OH, WOW. THEY HAVEN'T
TOLD YOU ABOUT IT YET?

342
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,046
[SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU] HUH?

343
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,516
[MARIELLE] OH.
[HENRIETTA] HMM.

344
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,317
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

345
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,053
SEE YOU AT THE
NEXT MEETING!

346
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,455
MK...

347
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,293
[AKATSUKI] ARE YOU
GOING SHOPPING, MASTER?

348
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,530
I'M JUST PICKING UP A
FEW THINGS FOR DINNER.

349
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,966
IT'S EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE, CURRY TIME.

350
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,035
OHH! MY LORD,
DROP EVERYTHING!

351
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,870
WE'RE GONNA HAVE CURRY!

352
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,404
[SHIROE]
WHAT? CURRY?!

353
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,173
(AIRPLANE FLYBY)
(TIRES SQUEAL)

354
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,709
I LOVE CURRY, CHIEF!

355
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,977
HEY, NAOTSUGU!

356
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,278
IT'S CURRY TONIGHT!

357
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,881
[NAOTSUGU]
SERIOUSLY?! HA HA HA!

358
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,382
YEAH!

359
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,718
[NYAN‐TA] HEH. DON'T
YOU GO NOWHERE.

360
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,119
[ALL] HURRY BACK!

361
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,289
CURRY. OH, MY GOSH. CURRY.

362
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,059
[NAOTSUGU] MMM. I'M TRYING
TO DECIDE WHICH ONE I'D

363
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,127
RATHER HAVE STUFFED IN
MY MOUTH RIGHT NOW,

364
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,564
CURRY OR‐ OHH!

365
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:44,765
[NAOTSUGU] GOD!

366
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,332
MY LORD, MAY I PHYSICALLY
HUMILIATE THIS SCUMBAG?

367
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,234
WOULD YOU ONE TIME
LET ME FINISH?!

368
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,403
DO NOT BRING SHAME TO
THE GLORY OF CURRY!

369
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,006
[NAOTSUGU] THE CHIEF'S
CURRY IS FOR GROWNUPS.

370
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,141
IT'S FREAKING
SUPER‐MEGASPICY.

371
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,844
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
LITTLE BRITCHES?!

372
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:58,945
[AKATSUKI]
SHUT YOUR MOUTH HOLE.

373
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,614
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU'RE A MOUTH HOLE!

374
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,920
[BOTH] HEH.

375
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,421
(SIGHS)

376
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,794
I AM STARTING
A NEW GUILD.

377
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,796
WILL YOU JOIN ME?

378
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,967
[NAOTSUGU] UH... ZERO
SURPRISE FACTOR, DUDE.

379
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,636
WORST KEPT SECRET EVER.

380
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:26,139
FACE IT. WE'VE BEEN LIKE
A GUILD WITHOUT A NAME
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

381
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,174
I GUESS IT'S COOL YOU
REGISTERED AND EVERYTHING.

382
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,277
IT IS A NINJA'S
TASK TO SIMPLY
FOLLOW HER MASTER.

383
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,115
GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS,
AND I WILL FOLLOW
THEM TO THE END.

384
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,685
HMM.

385
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,260
[AKATSUKI] I WILL...
I WILL HAVE CURRY, AND...

386
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,763
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!

387
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,206
[MAN 1] LOOKING
FOR PARTY MEMBERS!

388
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,876
[MAN 2] WE'RE LEAVING
TOMORROW MORNING!

389
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,412
[MAN 1] MAN, IF WE COULD JUST
RECRUIT ONE MORE GOOD GUY.

390
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,915
[PLAYER] YOU GUYS SHOULD
JUST JOIN MY PARTY INSTEAD.

391
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,116
[OTHERS] HUH?

392
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,152
I'M STILL WORKING OUT
ALL THE DETAILS,

393
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,386
BUT THIS IS PERFECT.

394
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,355
IT WAS DESTINY
FOR US TO MEET.

395
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,257
REALLY NICE TIMING, GUYS.

396
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,458
[OTHERS] HUH?

397
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,161
[MAN 1] UH, WHAT
LEVEL ARE YOU ANYWAY?

398
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,164
HA! LEVEL 20.

399
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,966
[MAN 2]
UH, YEAH. DON'T CALL US.

400
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,902
WE'LL CALL YOU,
LIKE, UH, NEVER.

401
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,337
WHAT?! COME ON!

402
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,774
[NAOTSUGU] THERE WILL BE
NO MILD CURRY, PEEWEE!

403
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,441
SPICY IS
FOR WEAKLINGS.

404
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,443
[NYAN‐TA]
GUESS WHO'S BACK.
[GROUP] HUH?

405
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,046
[AKATSUKI] YOU'RE

406
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,416
[NAOTSUGU] UH, W‐WE'RE STILL
GONNA HAVE CURRY TONIGHT,
AREN'T WE, CHIEF?

407
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,486
THESE TWO APPEARED TO BE
ADMIRING OUR HANDIWORK
ON THE HOUSE,

408
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:49,022
SO I THOUGHT
I'D LET THEM HAVE
A CLOSER LOOK.

409
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,558
TOYA, MINORI.

410
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,131
[SHIROE] I HEARD THAT
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
WAS MOVING TODAY.

411
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,299
[MINORI]
WE, UM...

412
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,001
[TOYA]
WELL, IT'S
LIKE THIS.

413
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:05,271
WE CAME HERE... UH...

414
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,174
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE ME AND
MY SISTER WANT TO BECOME

415
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,843
MEMBERS OF YOUR GUILD!

416
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,144
OH!

417
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,979
WE'D LIKE YOU TO
TEACH US INSTEAD OF

418
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,381
THE CRESCENT MOON
ALLIANCE, SHIROE.

419
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,383
MISS MARIELLE AND EVERYONE
WITH HER GUILD WERE REALLY

420
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,522
NICE TO US AND ALL,
BUT WE WANT TO GO ON
ADVENTURES WITH YOU.

421
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,689
OH.

422
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,357
[TOYA] WE MADE IT THROUGH
ALL THE STUFF WE WENT

423
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,892
THROUGH BECAUSE
YOU TAUGHT US HOW.

424
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,062
WE WANT TO BE IN
THE GUILD YOU CREATED,
BROTHER SHIROE!

425
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,666
I KNOW I'M WEAK NOW,
BUT I WANT TO GET
STRONGER WITH YOUR HELP!

426
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,601
WE KNOW WE'RE NOT
AS STRONG AS THE
REST OF YOU ARE,

427
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,436
BUT WE REALLY
WANT TO LEARN!

428
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:40,006
PLEASE TEACH US,
SO WE CAN BE AN ASSET
AND NOT SLOW YOU DOWN.

429
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,175
[MINORI]
LET US JOIN YOU!

430
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,946
WHA‐? I, UH... HMM.

00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,192
[NYAN‐TA] COME ON.
DON'T JUST STAND THERE
STARING AT THEM, FOOL.

433
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,794
YOU'RE THE GUILD MASTER.

434
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,228
AH...

435
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,830
[SHIROE, THINKING]
A GUILD MASTER...

436
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,569
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN I REGISTERED.

437
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,939
OK. GUESS I AM.

438
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,711
[SHIROE, THINKING]
RIGHT. IT'S MY TURN
TO LEAD EVERYONE.

439
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:26,319
ALL RIGHT. I AM LOOKING
FOR A FIGHTER AND A CLERIC.

440
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,054
WELCOME TO LOG HORIZON!

441
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,656
[TOYA] YAH!

442
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,558
AND FOR YOUR VERY
FIRST ASSIGNMENT,

443
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:35,195
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
GUYS TO EAT CURRY WITH
THE SENIOR MEMBERS.

444
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,229
GOT IT?

445
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,263
[TOYA] YES, SIR!

446
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,532
[MINORI] NO PROBLEM!

447
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,801
[NYAN‐TA] MMM. LET'S
MAKE THE CURRY FIRST.

448
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,002
HEH HEH.

449
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,604
[NAOTSUGU]
OH, YEAH!

450
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:46,640
[AKATSUKI] NOTHING BEATS A PLATE
OF CURRY UNDER A NIGHT SKY.

451
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,643
[NYAN‐TA] AHH. JUST WISH
I HAD SOMETHING TO GO WITH IT.

452
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,579
NEXT TIME, I'LL MAKE
SOME CURRY RELISH, BABY.

453
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,281
[NAOTSUGU] I WANT TO
HAVE YOUR BABY, CHIEF!

454
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:58,318
(BOTH LAUGH)

455
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,888
HUH?

456
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,973
[MAN]
A ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE?

457
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,108
I SEE.

458
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,045
THE ADVENTURERS
ARE ORGANIZING.

459
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,583
[MAID]
LORD SERJIAD.

460
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,085
HMM?

461
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:36,857
I'VE BROUGHT YOU
LADY RAYNESHIA AS YOU
ORDERED, YOUR GRACE.

462
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,790
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
PEACE HAS COME TO AKIHABARA.

463
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,961
MINORI AND TOYA
JOIN LOG HORIZON
AND TRAIN EVERY DAY.

464
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:24,430
SHIROE DECIDES
TO HOLD A TRAINING
CAMP FOR NEW PLAYERS.

465
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,668
MEANWHILE, A LETTER
COMES TO THE ROUND TABLE.

466
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,604
IT'S FROM THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND.

467
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,907
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
