00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,990
I USE THE SAME HEIGHT
WHEN I ASSIGN FOR THE...

172
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,260
I JUST REMEMBER, I MADE
MY CHARACTER TALLER
THAN I REALLY AM.

173
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,429
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I'M FEELING A LITTLE
BIT AWKWARD IN THIS BODY.

174
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,631
(ROCK BOUNCES)

175
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,634
SHOULDN'T WANT MORE
THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE.

176
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:32,272
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OUR
TRUE SELVES IN OUR AVATARS.

177
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,840
[NAOTSUGU] UH... WHOA!

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,577
UH, WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR DAMAGE, MAN?!

179
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,811
WHAT IF YOU HIT US?!

180
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,613
YOU WANT A PUNCH
IN THE PETER?!

181
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,916
[SHIROE]
YOU'RE... AKATSUKI!

182
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,918
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT, YOU KNOW HIM?

183
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,320
WE'VE BEEN IN A COUPLE OF
RAIDING PARTIES TOGETHER BEFORE.

184
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,791
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY
A THING, BUT HE'S GREAT
AT WHAT HE DOES.

185
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,727
[SHIROE]
TOP‐NOTCH ASSASSIN.

186
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,965
[SHIROE] WELL, WELL. IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU GOT STUCK HERE
WITH US, AKATSUKI.

187
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,101
[NAOTSUGU]
I'M NAOTSUGU, A GUARDIAN.

188
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,437
I'VE GOT A THING FOR
THE LADIES AND I'M NOT
ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT.

189
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,772
[SHIROE SIGHS]

190
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,340
[SHIROE]
ONE CHANCE TO MAKE
A FIRST IMPRESSION...

191
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,975
[NAOTSUGU]
HELL, YEAH.

192
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,377
[AKATSUKI] [FEMALE VOICE]
SIR SHIROE, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

193
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,646
[SHIROE] HUH?

194
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,080
[AKATSUKI] I NEED YOUR HELP.

195
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,550
I NEED SOMETHING TO FIX
THIS BODY I'M IN.

196
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,684
SELL ME A POTION.

197
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,553
[NAOTSUGU]
UH, YOU SOUND LIKE A...

198
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,788
[SHIROE]
WHOA. ALL THIS TIME...

199
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,158
YOU WEREN'T A DUDE?

200
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,161
[SHIROE] GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO QUIET.

201
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,267
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S A
REAL METAMORPHIC.

202
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,838
THOSE WERE ONLY AVAILABLE
WHEN THE GAME FIRST STARTED.

203
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,741
[AKATSUKI] I REMEMBERED
SIR SHIROE GOT ONE.

204
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,443
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, LET GO OF ME!

205
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:47,948
[SHIROE] I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
USE THE VOICE CHAT TO FEEL MORE
LIKE AN ACTUAL ASSASSIN.

206
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,350
(GRUNT)

207
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,752
UH, YOU DOING OK?

208
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,520
[AKATSUKI] AAH!

209
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,788
[SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU] OHH!

210
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:58,124
(BONES BREAKING)
(AKATSUKI SCREAMS)

211
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,863
[NAOTSUGU] UHH...

212
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,231
[AKATSUKI]
MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU.

213
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,634
(STAMMERING)

214
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,835
[NAOTSUGU] OH, YEAH!

215
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,838
'SUP, GIRL!
BABE CITY, SERIOUSLY!

216
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,840
YOU'VE TRULY
SAVED ME.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,909
I APPRECIATE IT.

218
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,344
[SHIROE] HEY, NOW,
NOTHING TO IT.

219
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,380
(NAOTSUGU STAMMERS)

220
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,852
[NAOTSUGU] LET'S GET BACK
TO WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

221
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,988
CHICKS ARE AWESOME, AND
A REAL MAN AIN'T AFRAID

222
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,790
TO TELL THEM
ALL ABOUT IT.

223
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,525
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

224
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,827
YOU GOT TO BE
A MAN, MAN!

225
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,764
[AKATSUKI] SIR SHIROE,
YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THAT GUY?

226
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,800
THE LIST OF THINGS IS
RATHER LONG AND VARIED.

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,401
[NAOTSUGU] YOUR FACE
IS LONG AND VARIED!

228
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,905
[AKATSUKI] SO WE AGREE
THAT HE HAS SOME SORT
OF MENTAL PROBLEM?

229
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,773
[SHIROE] UH, AKATSUKI,
DID YOU TAKE THAT POTION

230
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,543
TO MAKE YOURSELF CLOSER
TO YOUR REAL SIZE?

231
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,077
YES.

232
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,413
[NAOTSUGU] YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED
THAT SIZE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

233
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,482
[AKATSUKI] UH, THAT'S KIND
OF THE POINT OF BEING IN
A ROLE‐PLAYING GAME...

234
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,384
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

235
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,822
BUT BEING IN A MAN'S BODY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MESS
WASN'T HELPFUL AT ALL.

236
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,790
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

237
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,659
RIGHT, LIKE
USING THE CAN.

238
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,728
(SLAM)
(NAOTSUGU WAILS)

239
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,765
[AKATSUKI] UM, OK. IS IT ALL
RIGHT IF I KNEE MR. PERVY PANTS
IN HIS STUPID FACE?

240
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,567
[NAOTSUGU] ASK BEFORE
YOU DO IT, PIPSQUEAK!

241
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,903
(SHIROE GROANS)
[AKATSUKI] DO NOT
CALL ME PIPSQUEAK!

242
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,072
NOW, THEN, WHAT DO I
OWE YOU FOR THIS SPELL?

243
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,075
UH, WELL, I‐I WAS
JUST HAPPY TO HELP OUT.

244
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,510
[AKATSUKI]
I CANNOT ALLOW THAT.

245
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,613
I DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO CLAIM
THAT I'M UNGRATEFUL.

246
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,448
NO, IT'S OK. REALLY.

247
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,484
OR IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN LET ME GET
A COUPLE OF HANDFUL‐

(THUD)

250
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,890
SIR SHIROE, IS IT ALL
RIGHT IF I KNEE THIS LOSER

251
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,324
IN HIS STUPID
FACE AGAIN?

252
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,061
[NAOTSUGU] I SAID TO ASK BEFORE
YOU DO IT, LITTLE BIT!

253
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,429
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LET ME
FINISH MY SENTENCE!

254
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,732
YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY GONNA
SAY SOMETHING GROSS.

255
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,601
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE.

256
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,402
HUH.

257
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,906
SO WHY DON'T YOU HANG AROUND
WITH US UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

258
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:53,940
[AKATSUKI AND SHIROE] HMM?

259
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,610
TELL HER ABOUT IT,
MR. STRATEGY.

260
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,978
[SHIROE] YOU'RE RIGHT.

261
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,413
WE SHOULDN'T
LEAVE HER ALONE.

262
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,483
AKATSUKI, DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU HAD
A THING AGAINST JOINING A GUILD?

263
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,620
[AKATSUKI] I CHOSE TO BE
AN ASSASSIN TO AVOID
ALL THE POLITICKING.

264
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,956
[SHIROE] YEAH, THAT'S
KIND OF WHY THE TWO OF
US AREN'T IN ONE EITHER.

265
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,892
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE NOT
IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER,

266
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,395
WE'RE PROBABLY BETTER
OFF BANDING TOGETHER
FOR OUR OWN SAFETY.

267
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,865
[AKATSUKI] YOU'RE SURE?
YOU REALLY WANT ME IN
YOUR PARTY, SIR SHIROE?

268
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,802
IT'D BE AWESOME TO HAVE
YOU ALONG, AKATSUKI.

269
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,505
OK.

270
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,641
[AKATSUKI] THEN FROM
THIS MOMENT ON, I SHALL
REVERE YOU AS MY LORD,

271
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,775
AS YOUR NINJA.

272
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,376
[SHIROE] MY NINJA? MY LORD?

273
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,378
[NAOTSUGU] ISN'T THAT
A SAMURAI'S JOB?

274
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,181
[AKATSUKI] YOU HAVE SAVED
ME FROM THE DIRE AND MOST
DISGUSTING FATE

275
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,250
OF BEING TRAPPED
IN A MAN'S BODY.

276
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,386
MY CODE OF HONOR
REQUIRES ME TO PAY BACK
THE DEBT I'VE INCURRED.

277
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,390
EVEN IF IT IS BUT
A SMALL KINDNESS,
IT SHALL BE REPAID.

278
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,995
I WILL BE YOUR NINJA AND
SERVE AS YOUR BODYGUARD.

279
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,466
(SPARKLES)
[SHIROE] UM, WELL,
THANKS FOR THAT, I GUESS.

280
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,768
[NAOTSUGU] HMM.

281
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,238
ALL RIGHT, TEAM,
LET'S DO IT.

282
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,255
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] THE
NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS THAT
INHABIT THE WORLD OF ELDER TALES

283
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,958
REFER TO THEMSELVES AS
"THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND."

284

(VENDOR SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

285
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,632
AND PLAYERS LIKE US,
WE ARE CALLED "ADVENTURERS."

286
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,268
[VENDOR] YOU GUYS WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT? YOU LOOK HUNGRY.

287
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,637
[NAOTSUGU] IS ALL THIS
STUFF REALLY FOOD?

288
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,272
(STOMACHS GROWLING)

289
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,374
[NAOTSUGU] I'LL STARVE IF I
WASTE TIME THINKING ABOUT IT.

290
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,743
RICE DUMPLINGS AND
GREEN TEA, PLEASE.

291
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,945
[VENDOR]
RIGHT. COME AGAIN.

292
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,383
[NAOTSUGU] THIS TASTES
LIKE DOG CRAP.

293
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,019
[SHIROE] IT'S BAD.
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

294
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,254
[AKATSUKI]
THIS IS SO WRONG.

295
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,956
[NAOTSUGU] IT FEELS
LIKE A SOGGY CRACKER,

296
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,025
AND THEY DIDN'T PUT
ANY FREAKING FLAVOR IN IT.

297
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,928
AND ALL THE DRINKS TASTE
LIKE UNFLAVORED WATER.

298
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,663
(CHIME)
HUH?

299
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,964
[NAOTSUGU] WHAT'S UP, HUH?

300
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,966
[SHIROE] SOMEONE'S CALLING ME.
[RINGING]

301
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,735
I WONDER WHO.

(GASPS)

303
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,172
[NAOTSUGU] IT WAS MARIELLE?
[SHIROE] YEAH.

304
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,975
SHE'S THE GUILD MASTER FOR
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

305
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,376
[NAOTSUGU]
THE GRAND GUILD HALL?

306
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,514
OUGHT TO BE CALLED
"BIG DOORY TOWN PLACE."

307
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,449
[SHIROE] EACH GUILD HALL
IS ITS OWN ZONE, NAOTSUGU.

308
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,654
[NAOTSUGU] ONLY THE REALLY WEIRD
STUFF STILL FEELS LIKE THE GAME.

309
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,492
[AKATSUKI] THAT'S A
WHOLE LOT OF... CUTE.

310
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,663
[NAOTSUGU] THIS IS THE
GUILD MASTER'S ROOM?

311
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:30,964
HA HA HA!

(THUD)

315
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,837
[MARIELLE] ARE YOU OK?
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY!

316
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:39,472
EAT SOMETHING, EAT SOMETHING,
NOT THAT IT HAS ANY FLAVOR!

317
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,107
[SHIROE] CALM DOWN,
WILL YOU, MARIELLE?!

318
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,076
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

319
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,911
WHO'S THIS?

320
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,580
HMM.

321
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,115
[MARIELLE] SHIROE, DID YOU
GET A GIRLFRIEND AND NOT
TELL ME ABOUT HER?

322
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,817
[SHIROE] OF COURSE NOT! JEEZ!

323
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,154
[MARIELLE] WOW, YOU'RE
SO CUTE! YOU WANT A
LOLLIPOP OR SOMETHING?

324
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,056
SHIROE, ALL THESE
DAMN HOTTIES?

325
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,891
WHERE DO YOU
HIDE THEM ALL?

326
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,325
I HAVEN'T BEEN
HIDING HER.

327
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,027
[MARIELLE] OH, AND
WHO'S THIS BIG GUY?

00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,029
[NAOTSUGU]
I'M NAOTSUGU.
WHAT'S UP? OH!

329
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,899
[MARIELLE] HO HO HO!
GOOD TO MEET YOU, NAOTSUGU!

330
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,534
WH‐WH‐WHA‐?

331
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,736
YOU'RE SO BUFFED UP,
AND YUMMY MUSCLES!

332
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,273
DO YOU LIFT WEIGHTS?
OH, I JUST LOVE
THE BEEFY PECS!

333
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,108
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S JUST
A SUIT OF ARMOR.

334
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,779
UH, DUDE, SHE'S...
SHE'S FREAKING ME OUT!

335
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,113

336
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,948
[NAOTSUGU] WHOA!
ANOTHER ONE?

337
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,950
FREAKING HOTTIE PARADE!

338
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,719
BEST GAME EVER!

339
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,887
[SHIROE] HENRIETTA!

340
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,454
MY GOODNESS.

341
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,525
SIR SHIROE, I'M SORRY I ASKED
YOU HERE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

342
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,260
[HENRIETTA] NOW, CONSIDERING
THE SITUATION WE'RE IN,

343
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,430
I'D LIKE TO
ASK YOU A FEW‐
(GASPS)

344
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,768
AH! SHE'S SO CUTE!

345
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,136
(FAWNING)

346
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,739
[SHORYU] AND THERE THEY GO,
WASTING THEIR TIME.

347
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,775
[AKATSUKI] YOU DON'T TOUCH ME!
[SHIROE] EXCUSE ME?

348
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,243
UH, MISS HENRIETTA?

349
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,112
DID YOU WANT TO
ASK ME SOMETHING?
[NAOTSUGU] SAVE ME!

350
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,615
[AKATSUKI]
SERIOUSLY, GO AWAY!

351
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,251
[SHIROE] TELL ME, HOW MANY
OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE HERE?

352
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,687
[MARIELLE] INCLUDING MYSELF,
19 OF US ARE ONLINE,

353
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,790
18 OF US ARE IN AKIHABARA,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT LOGGED IN.

354
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,393
AND IT'S SAFE
TO SAY WE CAN'T
CALL ANYONE ELSE.

355
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:12,065
ON TOP OF THAT, SHIBUYA,
MINAMI, SUSUKINO... ALL OF THEM.

356
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:16,770
ALL OF THE MAJOR JAPANESE
CITIES ON THE SERVER ARE
IN BAD SHAPE RIGHT NOW.

357
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,642
AND IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH,
NONE OF THE INNER CITY
TRANSPORT GATES ARE WORKING,

358
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:25,612
AND THAT MEANS
OUR USUAL METHOD OF
GETTING AROUND IS SHOT.

359
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,081
EVERYONE'S MEETING
WITH THEIR GUILDS NOW.

360
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:33,286
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR
ANSWERS WITHOUT KNOWING
ALL THE QUESTIONS TO ASK.

361
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:38,324
AND IT LOOKS LIKE GUILDS
ARE STEPPING UP MEMBERSHIP
DRIVES FOR SELF‐PROTECTION.

362
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,595
[MARIELLE] LISTEN,
AT A TIME LIKE THIS,

363
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,964
THE MORE PEOPLE ON
YOUR SIDE THE BETTER.

364
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,932
[NAOTSUGU]
SO LIVING HERE IS NEW,

365
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,869
BUT EVERYONE STUCK HERE
IS AT LEAST FAMILIAR
WITH THE GAME, RIGHT?

366
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,804
THAT ISN'T
NECESSARILY TRUE.

367
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,238
[ALL] HUH?

368
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,875
[SHIROE] REMEMBER, THEY JUST
LAUNCHED THE EXPANSION PACK,

369
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,943
THE NOVASPHERE PIONEERS.

370
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,278
[AKATSUKI] OHH.

371
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,946
[NAOTSUGU] I GET IT.

372
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,216
IF THEY'VE ADDED THAT NEW
EXPANSION, THE ENTIRE
WORLD OF THE GAME...

373
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,985
FROM WEAPONS,
MONSTERS, AND QUESTS,

374
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,253
COULD BE WAY DIFFERENT
THAN IT USED TO BE.
(GOBLIN HOWLS)

375
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:12,759
[SHIROE] WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T
COUNT ON THIS WORLD BEING
ELDER TALES THE WAY WE KNEW IT.

376
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,831
[MARIELLE] WELL, LET
ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

377
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,633
[SHIROE] HMM?

378
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,167
HMM.

379
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,337
LOOK, SHIROE, I KNOW WE'VE
HAD THIS TALK, AND I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A BIG FAN

380
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,741
OF ALL THE BACKBITING THAT
GOES ON IN THE GUILDS...

381
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,209
HMM.

382
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,212
[MARIELLE]
BUT... BUT THAT
WAS THEN, OK?

383
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,147
WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT
JOINING CRESCENT MOON?

384
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,649
UH, MARIELLE...

385
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:38,952
[MARIELLE] DEBAUCHERY TEA PARTY
ISN'T AROUND ANYMORE, RIGHT?

386
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,253
AND NOW WOULD
BE PERFECT TO‐

387
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,455
[SHIROE] I'M SORRY, MARIELLE.
[MARIELLE] OHH.

388
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,726
I JUST CAN'T
DO IT, NOT YET.

389
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,599
[NAOTSUGU] SHE'S A PRETTY
COOL GUILD MASTER.

390
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,168
SHE'S GOT ALL THAT
SEXY RESPONSIBILITY.

391
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,570
AND SHE WAS
NICE TO US.

392
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,305
[SHORYU]
THE DEBAUCHERY
TEA PARTY.

393
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,207
I HEARD THE TEA PARTY
WAS THIS AMAZING GUILD

394
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,443
THAT JUST PLAIN
WENT AND BROKE UP.

395
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,678
[MARIELLE] NOT REALLY.

396
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,247
THEY HAD A NAME AND ALL
BUT DIDN'T REGISTER.

397
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,015
[SHORYU] UH...

398
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,452
THE TEA PARTY USED
THEIR DIVERSITY TO CONDUCT
LARGE‐SCALE RAIDS AS A GROUP.

399
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,555
THEIR INDEPENDENCE
ALLOWED THEM TO COME
TOGETHER AT TIMES

400
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,457
OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING AND
WIN SOME LUCRATIVE BATTLES

401
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,560
WITH SHIROE AS THEIR STRATEGIST.

402
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,862
[PLAYER] HOW LONG ARE
WE GONNA BE STUCK HERE?

403
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,798
[NAOTSUGU] ARE THEY REALLY JUST
GONNA SIT THERE DOING NOTHING?

404
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,032
[SHIROE] HMM.

405
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,034
[NAOTSUGU] DO YOU SUPPOSE
DYING WOULD LET THEM OUT?

406
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,505
IT'S A PRETTY COMMON SCENARIO
IN ALL THAT FANTASY NOVEL CRAP.

407
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,540
[SHIROE] AND ANOTHER ONE IS
JUST STAYING DEAD AFTER YOU DIE.

408
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,408
[NAOTSUGU]
UH‐HUH. YEAH...

409
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,545
[AKATSUKI] DYING IN
THE GAME USED TO MEAN
RESURRECTION IN THE CATHEDRAL.

410
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,114
[NAOTSUGU] NICE, BUT I'M
NOT TESTING THAT OUT.

411
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,248
HMM.

412
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,717
[NAOTSUGU]
AND DUDE, I'M LEVEL 90.

413
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,119
I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE THAT, YOU KNOW?

414
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,389
[AKATSUKI] IS SOMETHING
WRONG, MY LORD?

415
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,926
[SHIROE] MAYBE WE
SHOULD TRY IT.

[NAOTSUGU] THE ARCHIVE
TOWER WOODS.

417
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,436
[SHIROE] WE'RE LEVEL 90...
THAT'S THE LEVEL CAP.

418
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,039
NORMALLY, LOW‐LEVEL MONSTERS
WOULD JUST IGNORE US.

419
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,510
BUT IN THIS AREA, ANYTHING
WILL JUMP US WHEN THEY SEE US.

420
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,177
SO WE SHOULD STAY ALERT.

421
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:15,782
[AKATSUKI] SOUNDS LIKE
THE PERFECT PLACE TO
EXPERIMENT, MY LORD.

422
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:19,586
[NAOTSUGU] DUDE, YOU
KNOW THE MINIMAPS DON'T
WORK OUT HERE, RIGHT?

431
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,806

EXPECTING IT TO BE MORE PAINFUL,

434
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,680
BUT NAOTSUGU'S RIGHT.

435
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,749
IT'S NOT LIKE SITTING AT
HOME PLAYING WITH SOFTWARE.

436
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,284
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE OUR
BODIES AND WHAT'S IN OUR HANDS

437
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,986
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

438
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,320
AND IT'S NOT GOING WELL.
