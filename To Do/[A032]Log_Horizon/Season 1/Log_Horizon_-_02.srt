1
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:10,877
[PEPIN] UH.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,280
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
SUPPOSEDLY A MAN DIED
WHILE FIGHTING MONSTERS,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,684
AND JUST LIKE IN THE GAME,
HE REVIVED IN THE CATHEDRAL.

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,788
[PEPIN] I'M ALIVE! I‐I TOTALLY
JUST CAME BACK TO LIFE!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,289
[MAN 1] SERIOUSLY?

6
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,158
[MAN 2] WAIT, SO
DOESN'T THAT MEAN...

7
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,360
[PEPIN] I DIED,
AND I CAME BACK!

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,197
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE MMORPG "ELDER TALES."

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,701
WITHOUT WARNING, AN ESTIMATED
30,000 JAPANESE PLAYERS,

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,837
AND SEVERAL HUNDRED
THOUSAND WORLDWIDE,

11
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:41,141
WERE TRAPPED IN A WORLD
THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE
THE ONE IN THAT GAME.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,046
AND IN THIS WORLD,
DEATH IS NOT THE END.

13
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,777
WHOA!

14
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,179
ASTRAL BIND!

15
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,949
(TRIFFID GURGLES)

16
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,517
(PANT)
HUH!

17
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,620
[NAOTSUGU]
AND WE'RE DONE
WITH THAT.

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,723
[SHIROE] ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S CALL IT QUITS FOR TODAY.

19
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,592
YES, MY LORD.

20
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,426
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE GOOD NEWS SEEMS TO BE

21
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,330
THAT OUR BODIES
ALREADY KNOW ALL THE
BASIC COMBAT MOVES...

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,968
AS IN WE DON'T
HAVE TO USE THE
GAME MENU TO FIGHT.

23
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,136
AS LONG AS WE HAVE
THE INTENT TO FIGHT

24
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,772
AND CAN SEE THE ENEMY
IN FRONT OF US,

25
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,509
WE CAN USE SKILLS
AND MAGIC AS IF WE
WERE USING VOICE INPUT.

26
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,111
HOWEVER, USING THE
SYSTEM AND MASTERING IT

27
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,446
ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS ENTIRELY.

28
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,117
AND WE COULD USE
A LITTLE PRACTICE.

29
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,986
HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW
IF PRACTICING THE WAY

30
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,690
MARTIAL ARTISTS DO IN OUR
WORLD WILL BE ENOUGH.

31
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,258
[AKATSUKI] LORD SHIROE?

32
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,894
[SHIROE] MISS AKATSUKI,
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO

33
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,195
KEEP ON CALLING
ME THAT, OK?

34
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,863
"SHIROE" IS FINE.

35
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,833
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULD STOP REFERRING
TO ME AS "MISS."

36
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,334
[SHIROE] BUT...

37
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,070
THAT'S QUITE THE GAGGLE OF
LADIES YOU'RE BUILDING THERE.

38
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,507
DO ME A FAVOR AND SHUT
YOUR BIG DUMB FACE!

39
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,647
MY LORD.

40
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,716
[SHIROE] UH, YEAH?
[NAOTSUGU] HEH.

41
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,652
[AKATSUKI] I'D LIKE TO DO
SOME ADVANCE RECONNAISSANCE
ON THE WAY HOME, OK?

42
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,522
[SHIROE] AND WHY IS THAT?
[AKATSUKI] FOR PRACTICE.

43
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,224
ONE OF MY SKILLS AS AN
ASSASSIN IS DARK VISION.

44
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,360
I ALSO HAVE SNEAK AND
SILENT MOVE IN MY INVENTORY,

45
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,063
AND THE FOREST IS A
PERFECT PLACE TO PRACTICE.

46
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,264
[AKATSUKI]
I SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,766
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

48
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,168
[SHIROE] OK, LET'S MEET
UP AT THE SOUTH GATE.

49
00:03:55,268 --> 00:04:00,173
I WILL ILLUMINATE THE PATH
WITH MAGIC LIGHT SO YOU
CAN SEE US ALONG THE WAY.

50
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,008
[AKATSUKI]
UNDERSTOOD.

51
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,679
[NAOTSUGU] SO AKATSUKI
HAS A SUBCLASS OF TRACKER
ON TOP OF BEING A NINJA?

52
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,248
[SHIROE] I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR
ANY LEAVES MOVING AROUND.

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,216
THAT GIRL IS PRETTY GOOD.

54
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,252
MAGIC LIGHT.

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,222
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE SKILLS AKATSUKI MENTIONED,
SNEAK AND SILENT MOVE,

56
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,191
ARE TRACKER SKILLS.

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,393
TRACKER IS ONE
OF THE SUBCLASSES.

58
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,563
"ELDER TALES" HAS A
BUNCH OF SUBCLASSES

59
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,531
FOR AN ADVENTURER
TO CHOOSE FROM,

60
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:29,202
AFTER HE OR SHE HAS CHOSEN ONE
OF THE 12 MAIN COMBAT CLASSES.

61
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,706
MASTERING YOUR PRIMARY
AND SUBCLASS IS VITAL.

62
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,308
[NAOTSUGU] SO I GUESS ASSASSIN
AND TRACKER EQUALS NINJA.

63
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,277
REMIND ME NOT TO
PISS HER OFF.

64
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,345
[SHIROE] YOU ALREADY HAVE.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

65
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,150
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW LONG
WE'VE BEEN HERE.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,854
[MARIELLE] PUBLIC ORDER
IN THE CITIES IS GOING
TO THE POOPER.

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,489
[SHIROE] YES.

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,992
IT LOOKS LIKE THE
RECRUITMENT RACE BETWEEN
THE GUILDS IS OVER,

69
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,494
SO WE CAN SAY ALL
THE LOCAL POWER
BASES ARE SET.

70
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,296
WE'LL SEE WHO
STARTS DOMINATING.

71
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,133
ADVENTURERS IN THE LARGER
GUILDS ARE SURE THROWING
THEIR WEIGHT AROUND.

72
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,270
AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE IN THE
SMALLER GUILDS ARE TRYING
TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,642
RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO
ACT LIKE YOU'RE AN ENEMY IF
YOU'RE NOT IN THEIR GUILD.

74
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,078
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
GO FIGHTING IN THE STREET,
NOW, CAN YOU?

75
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,048
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
FIGHTING WASN'T ALLOWED
IN THE MAJORITY OF TOWNS

76
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
WHEN ELDER TALES
WAS A GAME.

77
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,120
IF YOU TRIED TO
FIGHT IN A TOWN,

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,890
SPECIAL GUARDS CALLED THE
ROYAL GUARD WOULD APPEAR,

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,759
AND THAT WAS IT.

80
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,762
YOU RESISTED THE ROYAL GUARD,
YOU GOT SQUASHED AND REVIVED
IN THE CATHEDRAL.

81
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:32,265
[HIEN] AND THERE ARE STILL
WAYS TO HARASS SOMEONE
AND GET PHYSICAL WITH THEM

82
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,200
WITHOUT THE GUARD
SHOWING UP.

83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,071
[EISEL] ON TOP OF THAT, PKs
HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE OVER
THE PAST FEW DAYS, TOO.

84
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,540
WHAT'S A PK?

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,876
PLAYER KILLINGS, OR AS SOME
PEOPLE SAY, PLAYER KILLER.

86
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,478
[HENRIETTA] THEY ATTACK
PLAYERS RATHER THAN MONSTERS,

87
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,414
THEN STEAL THE ITEMS AND MONEY
THEY DROP AFTER THEY DIE.

88
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,017
IT'S ABOUT THE WORST
THING YOU COULD DO.

89
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,121
[HIEN] MINIMAPS THAT TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE IS AROUND YOU
DON'T WORK OUTSIDE OF TOWN,

90
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,823
AND THERE'S NO ADMIN HERE.

91
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,092
[EISEL] BASICALLY, THERE
ARE PEOPLE TREATING
THIS AS A DEATH MATCH,

92
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,795
ENRICHING THEMSELVES
AT THE EXPENSE OF ANYONE
WHO ISN'T AS AGGRESSIVE.

93
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:06,900
AND ANYONE WHO'S ALREADY
DOING IT IS AHEAD OF THE
GAME AND THE OTHER GAMERS.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,134
BUNCH OF JERKHOLES.

95
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,437
WELL, RIGHT NOW, FORTUNE
IS FAVORING THE "JERKHOLES."

96
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,739
[MARIELLE] HUH?

97
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,407
[SHIROE] HMM? WHAT'S
WRONG, MARIELLE?

98
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,609
(MARIELLE GASPS)

99
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,943
OH, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY!

100
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,279
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS JUST
A TERRIBLE SITUATION?

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,181
[MARIELLE]DON'T YOU
AGREE, NAOTSUGU?
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, GET OFF OF ME!

102
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,550
[NAOTSUGU] COME ON! AH! AH!

103
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,052
[HENRIETTA] OH, I WAS JUST SO
TAKEN BY AKATSUKI'S CUTENESS,

104
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,222
I FORGOT TO TAKE A BREATH
AND THINK CLEARLY ABOUT IT.

105
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,591
REALLY, I DID!

106
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,426
NYAH‐NYAH‐NYAH‐NYAH!
(HENRIETTA LAUGHS)

107
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,562
[NAOTSUGU] EARTH TO SHIROE.

108
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,163
[SHIROE] I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

109
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,968
YOU KNOW, SHIROE, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU LATELY, MAN.

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,504
YEAH?

111
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,672
AND YOU NEED
TO LIGHTEN UP...

112
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,575
[NAOTSUGU] DUDE.
[SHIROE] YEAH, WHATEVER.

113
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,043
[NAOTSUGU]
HEY, SHORT STUFF!

114
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,978
[AKATSUKI] DON'T CALL
ME THAT, YOU BUTTFACE!

115
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,080
[NAOTSUGU] WERE THERE
ANY GOBLINS IN THERE?

116
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,882
[AKATSUKI] THERE WAS ONE
WITH A SKULL ON ITS HEAD.

117
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,151
WEIRD AND SILLY...
MY KIND OF GOBLIN.

118
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,021
[NAOTSUGU] UH, WHAT?

119
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,863
HUH?

120
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,133
[NAOTSUGU] I HEARD
SOMETHING, OR SOMEONE.

121
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,135
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

122
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,004
HUH! WHOA!

123
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,239
OHH!

124
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,741
THANKS A LOT, SHIROE.

125
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,376
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN QUICK TO
GET ME OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT.

126
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,679
SO WHAT'S THE
PLAN, MASTERMIND?

127
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,715
NAOTSUGU, TAKE UP
A TANDEM FORMATION.

128
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,418
WE'VE GOT PK'S OUT THERE,
AND I'VE GOT A VISUAL ON 4.

129
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,655
[SHIROE] GIVE ME A SEC.

130
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,289
GOT 'EM.

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,758
MIND BOLT!

132
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,660
[KATSUOMARU] HUH.
[SHIROE] THERE YOU GO.

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,764
OK, CREEPS, YOU GOT A LOT
OF GUTS TURNING INTO PKs.

134
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,132
HUH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET OUT
OF YOUR MOTHER'S BASEMENT

135
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,334
AND HAVE HER TEACH
YOU SOME MANNERS!

136
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,304
[SHIROE, THINKING] AT LEAST ONE
FIGHTER CLASS, TWO THIEVES,

137
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,673
ONE DRESSED LIKE A HEALER.

138
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,608
SO YOU CAN HAND OVER
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

139
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,277
AND WE WON'T SEND YOUR SORRY
ASSES TO THE CATHEDRAL.

140
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,747
[SHIROE] FROM THE SOUND
OF IT, HE'S BEEN WATCHING
WAY TOO MUCH ANIME.

141
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,483
[SHIROE, THINKING]
HOWEVER, THEY'RE
HUMAN LIKE US.

142
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,118
[SHIROE]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

143
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,687
KICK THEIR ASS!

144
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,155
I'M NOT BACKING
DOWN FROM FREAKS WHO
ATTACK PEOPLE FOR FUN!

145
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,758
[NAOTSUGU] YOU WANT TO TRY
THAT PK CRAP ON US,

146
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,661
THEN YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO BACK AND
GET SOME MORE GUYS!

147
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,697
[SHIROE]
I'D BE WILLING TO GIVE
THEM A COUPLE OF GOLD

148
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,099
IF IT WAS A ONE‐OFF
KIND OF DEAL.

149
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
(CHUCKLES)

150
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,303
THAT IS, IF THEY CAN BEAT US.

151
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,171
IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

152
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,773
[SMASH] COME ON.

153
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,709
[SHIROE] THE WARRIOR IN FRONT
ON THE RIGHT, TARGET HIM FIRST.

154
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,476
KEEP THE OTHERS OCCUPIED
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

155
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,978
[NAOTSUGU] ROGER!

156
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,479
(GRUNTING)

157
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,415
[SMASH] I'VE GOT
THE FIGHTER. AH!

158
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,350
YOU ATTACK THE
MAGICAL NERD GUY.

159
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,085
[LYCOPENE] ROGER!

160
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,954
[SHIROE] ASTRAL BIND.

161
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,856
[LYCOPENE] AH!

162
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,092
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] ASTRAL BIND
IS SIMPLY A SPELL THAT RESTRICTS
A TARGET'S MOVEMENTS.

163
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,495
IT KEEPS A TARGET FROM
COVERING LONG DISTANCES,
AND IT DOESN'T LAST LONG.

164
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:53,900
[SMASH] (GROANS)
FINE, I'LL TAKE THE MAGE.
YOU FIGHT THE STUPID WARRIOR.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,869
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS GUY.

166
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,605
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
NORMALLY A GOOD CALL...

167
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,142
BUT NAOTSUGU ISN'T A SAMURAI;
HE'S A GUARDIAN.

168
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,579
ANCHOR HOWL!

169
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,514
(SMASH GROANS)

170
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,050
YOU SON OF A...

171
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,787
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
A GUARDIAN BELONGS TO A
LARGER GROUP CALLED TANKS,

172
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,958
AND A TANK PROTECTS THEIR
ALLIES BY INTERCEPTING ATTACKS.

173
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,595
ON TOP OF THAT, HE CAN
CAST THE ANCHOR HOWL.

174
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,997
THIS LITTLE SPELL KEEPS
ATTACKERS FROM IGNORING HIM.

175
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,701
IF THEY TRY ATTACKING
SOMEONE ELSE, THEY GET
CLOBBERED MAGICALLY.

176
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,469
[SMASH]
FINE! WHATEVER!

177
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,772
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
KICK YOUR ASS FIRST.

178
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:35,008
YOU CAN'T BREAK
THIS ARMOR, D‐BAGS!

179
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,810
(GRUNTING)

180
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,547
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] MAYBE,
BUT YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF
HIT POINTS FAST THERE, BUDDY.

181
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,448
(NAOTSUGU GROANS)

182
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,818
[SHIROE]
ELECTRICAL FUZZ!

183
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,920
OOH!

184
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,922
[LYCOPENE] WAIT A SECOND.
HE'S AN ENCHANTER!

185
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,125
[KATSUOMARU] WHAT SPELL IS THAT?
IT DOESN'T HURT OR NOTHING.

186
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:56,129
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] A MAGE
THAT IS ABLE TO CAST SPELLS
IS AN ENCHANTER.

187
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,999
IT'S ONE OF THE CLASSES
THAT USES OFFENSIVE MAGIC,

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,768
BUT ITS ATTACK POWER IS WEAK.
[LYCOPENE] AH!

189
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,369
[KATSUOMARU] HYAH!
[NAOTSUGU] UGH!

190
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,871
[SMASH] OH, SCARY.

191
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,574
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO WITH
THAT SPELL ANYWAY?

192
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,944
[SHIROE] THORN BIND HOSTAGE.

193
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,313
AAH! HEY, WHAT
THE HELL, MAN?!

194
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,015
(GROANING)

195
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,717
YAA!

00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,586
(KATSUOMARU SCREAMS)

197
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,688
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THORN BIND HOSTAGE...

198
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,490
IT BINDS THE CASTER'S
TARGET IN SHINING THORNS,

199
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,028
AND FOR EVERY HIT AN ALLY IN
YOUR GROUP LANDS ON YOUR TARGET,

200
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,698
THE THORNS EXPLODE,
DEALING 1,000 DAMAGE.
(KATSUOMARU SCREAMS)

201
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,968
ULTIMATELY, ENCHANTERS
HAVE POOR OFFENSE,

202
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,837
BUT THEY CAN WEAKEN
AN ENEMY'S ATTACK,

203
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,139
OR INCREASE THE HEALTH
OF THEIR ALLIES.

204
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,842
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE HALF
THOSE HIT POINTS WHEN
THOSE VINES BLOW UP.

205
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,610
YOU WIENERS FEEL
LIKE GIVING UP?

206
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,579
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT!

207
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,648
[SMASH] WE NEED MORE
HIT POINTS. HEALER!

208
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,115
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
ENCHANTERS ARE
PRETTY HELPLESS,

209
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,952
AND I DEFINITELY CAN'T
DO MUCH WITHOUT BACKUP.

210
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,855
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
IT'S A ROLE I LIKE.

211
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,190
[LYCOPENE]
TAKE THIS, DIRT BAG!

212
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,659
HA HA HA!

213
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,927
NOT VERY SMART FORMING A
PARTY WITHOUT A HEALER.

214
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,697
HAVE FUN CRYING IN THE
CATHEDRAL, JACKHOLES!

215
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,332
(KATSUOMARU SCREAMS)

216
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,268
UH!

HEALTH OVER HERE!

218

HEY!

219
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,008
[SHIROE] I JUST CAST A SLEEP
ENCHANTMENT ON YOUR HEALER,

220
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,744
BUT HONESTLY, HE'S BEEN ASLEEP
SINCE WE STARTED THE FIGHT.

00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,915
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
ASTRAL HYPNOS,
A STOP‐TARGET SPELL

223
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,950
THAT PUTS THE TARGET TO SLEEP.

THAT'S ENOUGH, FOUR‐EYES!

225

NO, DON'T! NOT YET!

226
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,956
MY ANCHOR HOWL
HASN'T WORN OFF YET!

227
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,224
OH, GOD.

(LYCOPENE SCREAMS)

229
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,327
[SMASH] SCREW THIS!

230
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,363
SORCERER, SUMMONER,
LET'S KILL THESE CLOWNS
AND CALL IT A NIGHT ALREADY!

231

OF FREAKING DORKS!

[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE COVERT KILLER, ASSASSIN.

235
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,208
CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS
ARE THIS CLASS' SPECIALTY,

236
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,644
MAKING FOR QUICK
KILLS OUT OF SIGHT

237
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,278
AND OCCASIONALLY OUT OF MIND.

238
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,916
THE ANCHOR HOWL ATTRACTED
THE 4 PKs I SAW TO NAOTSUGU,

239
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:59,219
BUT THE 4 FRONTMEN DIDN'T
HAVE A SPELLCASTER.

240
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,222
WHEN I SAID I HAD A VISUAL ON 4,

241
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,891
AKATSUKI UNDERSTOOD
WHAT I MEANT

242
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,828
AND WENT OUT AHEAD OF US
TO NEUTRALIZE EVERYONE ELSE

243
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,263
WHO WAS HIDING IN THE FOREST.

244
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:16,637
YOU WERE NOT WISE TO INSULT
MY LORD'S MAGICAL ABILITIES.

245
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,772
YOU FOUND THE ELECTRICAL
FUZZ LAUGHABLE,

246
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:23,944
BUT ALL THOSE BRIGHT LIGHTS
KEPT YOU FROM SEEING
IN THE DARK FOREST.

247
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,714
YOU NEVER EVEN KNEW
YOUR HEALER WAS ASLEEP.

248
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,750
YOUR TEAMWORK IS NONEXISTENT.

AH! UH!

250
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,786
[AKATSUKI] YOUR LEADERSHIP
IS JUST PATHETIC.

251
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,320
YOU RUN YOUR MOUTH,
AND ALL THE WHILE

252
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,690
YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR PARTY
ARE LOSING HIT POINTS.

253
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,292
TAKING OUT YOUR AMBUSH
PARTY WAS EASY.

254
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,527
[SMASH] SHUT UP!

255
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,928

CHANGE ANYTHING.

AND GET YOU AGAIN.

YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

259
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,035

00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,963
[AKATSUKI] PUBLIC SAFETY REALLY
IS GETTING BAD, ISN'T IT?

267
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,701
[SHIROE] IT'S NOT LIKE
THERE'S A LOT TO BE GAINED
BY PLAYER‐KILLING.

268
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,136
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME
BOAT RIGHT NOW.

269
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:27,774
SO WHY DON'T THESE GUYS
JUST FIND OTHER THINGS
TO OCCUPY THEIR TIME WITH?

270
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,075
[AKATSUKI] LIKE WHAT?

271
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,144
[NAOTSUGU]
I KNOW WHAT I‐ OWW!

272
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,414
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, MAY I
TAKE A MOMENT AND KNEE THIS
RIDICULOUS PERVERT IN THE FACE?

273
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:37,283
[NAOTSUGU] ASK BEFORE YOU DO IT,
AND LET ME FINISH MY SENTENCE!

274
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,886
[AKATSUKI] I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD
GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

275
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,556
[NAOTSUGU] THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE!

276
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,758
[SHIROE]
OTHER THINGS TO DO?

277
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,760
THAT MIGHT BE IT.

278
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,629
THERE REALLY IS NOTHING.

279
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,697
THERE REALLY ARE NO GOALS.

280
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,234
[SHIROE] IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT THERE IS FOOD TO BE HAD.

281
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,070
YOU CAN MAKE THE MONEY FOR
THAT AND A PLACE TO STAY

282
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,840
BY DESTROYING LOW‐LEVEL
MONSTERS, I GUESS.

283
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,275
I MEAN, NOTHING IS
ALL THAT EXPENSIVE.

284
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,680
FIGHTING ISN'T ALLOWED IN TOWN,
SO YOU'RE PRETTY SAFE.

285
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,682
AND DEATH ISN'T EVEN PERMANENT.

286
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,585
[NAOTSUGU] SO BASICALLY
YOU'RE SAYING YOU CAN
SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD

287
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,153
WITHOUT REALLY
DOING ANYTHING?

288
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,790
[SHIROE]
PRETTY MUCH, BUT IT'S
NOT MY IDEA OF LIVING.

289
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,725
OR IS IT STAYING ALIVE?

290
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,729
SO THEY'VE RESORTED TO KILLING
OTHER PLAYERS BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE TO DO?

291
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,330
[SHIROE]
I GUESS SO.

292
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,867
THEY'RE BORED,
THERE AREN'T ANY JOBS
HERE REALLY, SO, YEAH.

293
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,871
[NAOTSUGU] OK, SO THEY
WANT TO GET THEIR ROCKS
OFF BY HURTING OTHER PEOPLE?

294
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,272
THAT'S STUPID.

295
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,441
[SHIROE] PRETTY LAME,
AND DEFINITELY MESSED UP.

296
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,410
SICK, REALLY.

297
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,781
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THING IS, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M DOING ANYTHING EITHER.

298
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,749
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD?
[SHIROE] HUH?

299
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:46,653
UH, ANYWAY, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE IF THINGS
ARE GETTING WORSE, SO FAR.

300
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,188
HMM.

301
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,190
[SHIROE] IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY,
AND IT PROBABLY HAS TO DO

302
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,959
WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE STILL
THINK THAT THIS IS A GAME WORLD

303
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,295
WITHOUT ANY REAL
PENALTIES TO SPEAK OF.

304
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,099
IF THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD,
THEN MAYBE OUR SENSE
OF PUBLIC ORDER

305
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,267
IS REALLY AN ILLUSION.

306
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,537
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD...

307
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,838

308
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,772
UH... YES?

309
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,173
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

310
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,075
[SHIROE] HUH?

311
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,877
[NAOTSUGU] YOU'RE
GOING TO SUSUKINO?

312
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,879
[HENRIETTA] ON THE DAY
OF THE APOCALYPSE,

313
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,048
ONE OF OUR MEMBERS
WAS GOING TO SUSUKINO.

314
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,350
[MARIELLE] SHE'S A YOUNGER
GIRL NAMED SERARA.

315
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,185
[SHIROE] YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND HER?

316
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,655
[NAOTSUGU] AREN'T THE INTERCITY
TRANSPORT GATES STILL DOWN?

317
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,759
FAIRY RINGS ARE THE ONLY
OTHER WAY TO GET THERE
IF YOU HAVE THEM.

318
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,027
[NAOTSUGU]

00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,929
RIGHT, BUT WITHOUT
THE ONLINE HELP

320
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,164
OR SOMEONE WHO'S MEMORIZED
THE TIMETABLES,

321
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,967
YOU COULD END UP
TRANSPORTED INTO THE

322
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,936
WITH THOSE FAIRY RINGS.

SAID, OH, CRAP.

332
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,829
THE "ELDER TALES" WORLD
IS HALF‐SCALE, SO IT
WOULD BE 425 KILOMETERS.

GOING TO RUN INTO PACKS

IN SUSUKINO THAN HERE.

IN AND SAVED HER.

TO SUSUKINO TO BRING HER BACK.

THINKING THAT MAYBE...

POWERFUL PLAYERS, IT'S DICEY.

A MAXIMUM PARTY SIZE OF 6,

AND EVEN THE BEST 6 DON'T HAVE
A GOOD HEALER AMONG THEM.

NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
THEIR PARTY STILL WON'T MAKE IT.

362
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,117
