1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,607
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
SERARA, THE GIRL WE
SAVED IN SUSUKINO,

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:11,211
IS A MEMBER OF
MARIELLE'S GUILD,
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:15,649
A GUILD IS BASICALLY A TEAM
OF ADVENTURER PLAYER CHARACTERS.

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,151
GUILDS OFFER MANY ADVANTAGES

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,421
THAT PARTIES, WHICH ARE MORE
PROVISIONAL, DON'T HAVE.

6
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,258
FOR EXAMPLE, A SHARED
VAULT IN THE GAME'S BANK

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,161
AND A DEDICATED
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,331
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
POTENTIAL USE OF A GUILD HALL

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,168
LOCATED HERE AT
THE GUILD BUILDING.

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,270
THESE HALLS CAN BE
PURCHASED OR RENTED

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,306
AND ARE DIVIDED
INTO SEVERAL RANKS.

12
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,009
NORMALLY YOU SELECT A HALL

13
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,079
BASED ON HOW MANY MEMBERS
YOU HAVE IN TOTAL.

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,114
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE
USES WHAT'S KNOWN AS

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,152
A RANK "B" HALL,
CONSISTING OF 7 ROOMS.

16
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,822
FOR THEM, THE SIZE
IS A PERFECT FIT.

17
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,985
(SIZZLING)

18
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,486
WHILE IT'S TRUE
THAT MAKING FOOD

19
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,923
WITHOUT THE COMMAND MENU
MIGHT BE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT,

20
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,191
IT'S A LOT
MORE REWARDING.

21
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,160
[GHIROV]
OH, AND THE SMELL!

22
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,995
AND THE BURN MARKS
FROM THE PAN!

23
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,196
(CRYING)

24
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,599
IT IS SO INCREDIBLY
EDIBLE THIS TIME!

25
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,334
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
IT SALTY IF YOU
KEEP ON CRYING.

26
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,304
[SECOND] AH, IT STILL
TURNED INTO MUSH ON ME!

27
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,439
[NYAN‐TA]
IF YOU'RE MAKING
A COMPLICATED DISH,

28
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,743
YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO
DO IT RIGHT UNTIL YOUR
CHEF LEVEL IS HIGHER.

29
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,480
AND EVEN IF TWO PEOPLE
WITH THE SAME LEVEL USE
THE SAME INGREDIENTS,

30
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,549
THE DISHES CAN STILL
TASTE DIFFERENT.

31
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,418
IN THAT WAY, IT'S NO
DIFFERENT THAN REALITY.

32
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,487
[NYAN‐TA] YOU PICKING UP
WHAT I'M PUTTING DOWN?

33
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,523
[HIEN] SERARA IS REALLY
WORKING THE ROOM.

34
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,157
[ASUKA] YOU'D THINK
SHE'D BE TAKING IT EASY

35
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,960
SINCE WE'RE PUTTING
THIS PARTY ON FOR HER.

36
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,267
[NAOTSUGU] MMM.

37
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,437
LISTEN, KID. YOUR LEVEL
ISN'T WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

38
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,940
IT'S WHAT COMES
AFTER LEVELING UP.

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,875
WHAT COMES AFTER?

40
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,110
SPECIAL ATTACK?!

41
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,646
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?
PANTIES ARE NEXT, DUDE!

42
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,747
UH, WHAT?!

43
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,215
[MARIELLE] LIKE, WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

44
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,449
[SHORYU] AH!

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,618
[NAOTSUGU] NOT MUCH.
JUST TALKING ABOUT‐

46
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,085
[SHORYU] NOTHING!
NOTHING AT ALL!

47
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,722
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ANYTHING! UH...

48
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,656
[HENRIETTA] MARIELLE.

49
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,758
[MARIELLE] I'M COMING.
[SHORYU] UH!

50
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,561
[MARIELLE]
DON'T TELL ANYONE?

51
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,062
[HENRIETTA] IF IT'S
AT ALL POSSIBLE,

52
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,230
WE SHOULDN'T
LET OUR RIVALS

53
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,665
LEARN ABOUT THIS
FOOD FOR A WHILE.

54
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,867
OH, COME ON. IT'S THE
LIFE OF THE PARTY.

55
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,202
AND YOU JUST MADE
MY POINT FOR ME.

56
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,974
[HENRIETTA] IF PEOPLE WERE
TO FIND OUT, IT COULD
CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR US.

57
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,475
THAT'S WHAT
SHIROE SAID.

58
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,044
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR HELP.

59
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,145
WITH SERARA, I MEAN.

60
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,379
[SHIROE]
UH, IT WAS NOTHING.

61
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,381
EVERYONE'S GLAD
TO SEE HER BACK.

62
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,016
LET'S DRINK
TO IT. KANPAI!

63
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,620
[ASUKA] HA HA HA!
[SHIROE] UH... HMM.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,321
[HENRIETTA] AAH!

65
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,090
I'M SO HAPPY! OH!

66
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,259
NOT JUST ASHLIN
BUT AKATSUKI ALSO!

67
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,861
[AKATSUKI] WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO TO ME?

68
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,162
OH, ASHLIN!

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,530
[ASHLIN]
YES, MA'AM.

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,898
TODAY WE HAVE 3 TYPES
OF SUMMER DRESS FOR YOU,

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,568
ALL FROM OUR
EXCLUSIVE COLLECTION.

72
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,036
I AM MY LORD'S
PERSONAL NINJA!

73
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,605
I CAN'T WEAR SUCH
FRILLY THINGS!

74
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:35,175
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE GAVE ME HIS
PERMISSION TO PLAY WITH YOU,

75
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,077
SO IT'S PLAYTIME.

76
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,946
UH, MY LORD
SOLD ME OUT?

77
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,717
[AKATSUKI]
HE SOLD ME OUT!

78
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,388
(PEOPLE MOANING)

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,327
YES. I LOVE YOU,
TOO, MARIELLE.

80
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,029
[MARIELLE] HMM.

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,463
[SHIROE] HMM.

82
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,566
[MARIELLE] WE'LL BE BUSY
CLEANING TOMORROW.

83
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,434
ARE YOU HEADED
TO BED NOW?

84
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,236
[SHIROE] I'M NOT
REALLY THAT SLEEPY.

85
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,740
WELL, THEN, WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO PUT ON SOME TEA?

86
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,243
[MARIELLE] YOU, LIKE, REALLY
HELPED US THIS TIME.

87
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,978
THANK YOU.

88
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,647
[SHIROE]
IT'S OK, HONESTLY.

89
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,316
I REALLY DIDN'T DO MUCH
OF ANYTHING THAT GREAT.

90
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,251
YOU SAVED SERARA
FROM A CREEPY STALKER

91
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,654
WHO WANTED TO KEEP HER,
SO THAT'S PRETTY BIG.

92
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,423
OK, SO WHAT ELSE
HAS BEEN GOING ON
WHILE WE WERE GONE?

93
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,592
AROUND HERE?
IN AKIHABARA?

94
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,761
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.
[MARIELLE] HMM.

95
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,330
IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE
BETTER THAN IT WAS.

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,698
I THINK SO.

97
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,333
THERE'S NOT AS MUCH
PLAYER KILLING,

98
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,502
AND IT SEEMS SAFER, ANYWAY.

99
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,137
HERE'S THE THING.

100
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,605
I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT,

101
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,708
BUT SOMETHING SEEMS TO
HAVE EVERYONE UNEASY.

102
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,444
YEAH. IT'S ALMOST LIKE
PEOPLE ARE BANDING TOGETHER

103
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,379
INTO THEIR OWN
SOCIAL CLIQUES.

104
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,214
"SOCIAL CLIQUES"?

105
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,382
[MARIELLE]
WE'RE A SMALL GUILD

106
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,752
WITH FEWER THAN
30 MEMBERS, RIGHT?

107
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,656
WE HAVE 4 LEVEL 90s,
BUT MOST OF US ARE UNDER 50.

108
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,058
BUT THERE ARE SOME HUGE
GUILDS OUT THERE.

109
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,027
AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU'VE
HEARD OF D. D. D., HAVEN'T YOU?

110
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,664
THEY'RE THE GUYS
WITH KRUSTY.

111
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,398
[SHIROE] YEAH.
THOSE WERE THE GUYS

112
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,968
WHO FINALLY BEAT
ORACLE TOWER, RIGHT?

113
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,637
A LOT OF GUYS WERE
TALKING SMACK ABOUT
HOW A JAPANESE GUILD

114
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,039
WOULD NEVER BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT IT.

115
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,708
[MARIELLE] YEAH.

116
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,911
A RAID FIGHT NEEDS ABOUT 500
INDIVIDUAL PLAYER FIGHTS

117
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,045
TO GO OFF PROPERLY.

118
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,848
D. D. D. HAS NEARLY
1,500 PLAYERS

119
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,950
WITH MORE THAN A
HANDFUL OF LEVEL 90'S.

120
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,553
WELL, THAT'S
PRETTY BIG FOR
A SOCIAL CLIQUE.

121
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,354
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
THE BIGGER GUILDS

122
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,192
ARE RUNNING THIS TOWN
THROUGH SOME SORT OF
TYRANNY BY MAJORITY.

123
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,461
EVEN THE SHOPKEEPERS
ARE FEELING BULLIED
BY ALL THE CLIQUES.

124
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,130
I HAD NO IDEA.

125
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,333
[MARIELLE] WE'RE HAVING
THE SAME PROBLEM IN
THE HUNTING GROUNDS.

126
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,503
SINCE THE STRONG AND WEAK
GUILDS WERE DIVIDED,

127
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,371
A SMALLER GUILD WON'T APPROACH
A FERTILE HUNTING GROUND

128
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,140
WHEN IT'S ALREADY OCCUPIED.

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,477
[SHIROE] THEN THE LARGER
GUILDS HAVE TAKEN ALL
THE GOOD HUNTING SPOTS?

130
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,779
THAT'S NO GOOD.

131
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,480
[MARIELLE] AND IT, LIKE,
GOES WITHOUT SAYING

132
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,949
YOU CAN'T FIGHT IN TOWN.

133
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,285
BUT THE HUNTING AREAS ARE
CONSIDERED NEXT TO THE CITY,

134
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,687
SO YOU CAN'T FIGHT THERE.

135
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,823
SO, YES, THERE'S LESS
PLAYER KILLING GOING ON,

136
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,660
BUT IT'S STILL A HOT MESS,
AND I GUESS IT'S GETTING WORSE.

137
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,565
[SHIROE]
YOU FIX ONE PROBLEM,
AND ANOTHER TAKES ITS PLACE.

138
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,200
[MARIELLE]
YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY,
LIKE, WHAT'S HAPPENED.

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,736
IT'S NOT JUST
THE HUNTING GROUNDS.

140
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,606
INVISIBLE BARRIERS ARE
BEING ERECTED EVERYWHERE.

141
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,742
CLIQUES BECOME PARTIES
BECOME GUILDS,

142
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,478
AND EVERYONE'S TRYING TO
PICK A SIDE TO STAY SAFE.

143
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,748
[MARIELLE] IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
CAN BLAME ANYONE FOR IT,

144
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,950
AND THE BIGGER GUILDS AREN'T
NECESSARILY THE BAD GUYS

145
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,351
IN ALL THIS, EITHER.

146
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,588
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
LAWS OTHER THAN NOT
FIGHTING IN THE CITY,

147
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,058
SO YOU DON'T NEED
A CONSCIENCE TO
LIVE HERE, I SUPPOSE.

148
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,662
[SHIROE] MAYBE...

149
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,898
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT OK, THOUGH.

150
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,737
[SHIROE] ALTHOUGH SOME
PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY
PREFER IT THAT WAY.

151
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,607
I GUESS SO.

152
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,976
[MARIELLE]
YOU MIGHT BE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

153
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:00,280
[MAN] COME ON. YOU KNOW
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO US IF WE TRY
OPPOSING THE LARGER GUILDS.

154
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,848
[WOODSTOCK] OF COURSE WE DO,

155
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,551
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HOLDING
THIS MEETING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

156
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,687
LISTEN, WE NEED
TO WORK AS ALLIES,

157
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,321
OR THEY'LL
STARVE US OUT.

158
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,691
[MARIELLE] MANY OF THE SMALL
GUILDS HAD A MEETING RECENTLY

159
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,128
TO TALK ABOUT BANDING TOGETHER
INTO A JOINT COUNCIL OF SORTS.

160
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,396
(THUD)

161
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,565
[MARIELLE] IT WAS...
LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL.

162
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,233
EACH OF THEIR LEADERS
HAD THEIR OWN OPINION

163
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,803
ABOUT WHO SHOULD DO WHAT,
AND WE ENDED UP QUARRELING

164
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,439
OVER MINOR DIFFERENCES OF

WAIT, MY FRIENDS.

166
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,410
PLEASE. I'M SURE THIS
WILL ALL WORK ITSELF OUT

167
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,645
IF WE SIT DOWN AND TALK.

168
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,280
IT'S A WASTE
OF TIME.

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,550
COME BACK AGAIN.

170
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,118
[ICHIMONJINOSUKE]
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

171
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,687
I TRULY WANTED TO HELP
THIS IDEA WORK OUT.

172
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,557
WHATEVER. I KNEW
IT WOULDN'T WORK.

173
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,793
HMM. MORE BAD NEWS.

174
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,996
THE GUILDS OF
THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS
AND THE SILVER SWORD

175
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,131
ARE AIMING FOR 91.

176
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,766
[SHIROE] 91?

177
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,002
RIGHT. THE HIGHEST
LEVEL YOU COULD GO WAS
ALWAYS 90, OF COURSE,

178
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,038
BUT THEN THE
EXPANSION CAME ALONG.

179
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,606
[SHIROE]
RIGHT. RIGHT.

180
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,042
WHEN THE DEVELOPERS ANNOUNCED
NOVASPHERE PIONEERS,

181
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,713
THEY SAID THE CAP LIMIT
WAS GOING UP TO 100, WASN'T IT?

182
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,481
[MARIELLE] AND YOU KNOW THAT,
LIKE, WELL, THE APOCALYPSE

183
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,616
DIDN'T JUST SEAL US IN.

184
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,818
IT'S KEEPING NEW
PLAYERS OUT, TOO.

185
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,987
[SHIROE]
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
AND SINCE EVERYONE'S

186
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,956
ALREADY PICKED
THE GUILD THEY
WANT TO BE WITH...

187
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,924
THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS
HAVE ALWAYS HAD A THING

188
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,827
ABOUT BEING THE BEST
FIGHTERS ON THE SERVER FARM.

189
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,764
[MARIELLE]
THEIR GUILD MASTER,
ISAAC, IS PROUD.

190
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,999
OR MAYBE HE JUST LIKES
EXCLUDING OTHERS,

191
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,803
BUT HE WON'T ALLOW ANYONE
UNDER 85 TO JOIN.

192
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,540
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S DOING WHAT KRUSTY
IS DOING WITH D. D. D.,

193
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,943
OPENING HIS DOORS AND
TAKING IN THE SMALL
GUILDS THAT WANT TO JOIN.

194
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,012
ISAAC'S APPROACH IS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

195
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,715
[SHIROE]
SO HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT
QUANTITY WITH QUALITY.

196
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,817
THAT SEEMS
FINE, RIGHT?

197
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,752
TO MAKE THEIR
LEVEL 85s BETTER,

198
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,889
THEY'D HAVE TO HUNT
LEVEL 85 MONSTERS AND STUFF.

199
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,025
[SHIROE] YEAH, BUT THIS
ISN'T A GAME ANYMORE.

200
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,928
SOUNDS LIKE A QUICK
TRIP TO THE CATHEDRAL.

201
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,931
(ROAR)
[MARIELLE] IF THEY WERE TAKING
THE NORMAL RISKS, I'D AGREE.

202
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,933
HUH?

203
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,504
THEY'RE LEVELING
UP USING EXP POTIONS.

204
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,739
[SHIROE] EXP POTIONS?

205
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,377
NOW, WAIT. WHAT ARE LEVEL 85
GUYS DOING WITH EXP POTIONS?

206
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,614
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
EXP POTIONS...

207
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,917
ITEMS THAT GIVE A
PLAYER A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN THEIR ATTACK POWER,

208
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,020
AND FASTER HEALTH
REGENERATION AFTER INJURY.

209
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,124
THEY ALSO DOUBLE THE EXPERIENCE
A PLAYER EARNS IN COMBAT.

210
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,161
"ELDER TALES" ADMINS
CONFIGURED THE SYSTEM

211
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,432
TO GIVE EVERY PLAYER
UNDER LEVEL 30 ONE
EXP POTION EVERY DAY.

212
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,435
THE IDEA WAS TO LET NEWER
PLAYERS LEVEL UP MORE QUICKLY

213
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,970
AND ENJOY THE GAME MORE.

214
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,439
KEEP THE CUSTOMER HAPPY,
AS THEY SAY.

215
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,942
IT'S AN EXTORTION RING.

216
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,910
THERE'S A GROUP CALLED
HAMELIN OUT THERE.

217
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,981
AFTER THE APOCALYPSE,
THEY TARGETED THE
LOWER LEVEL PLAYERS.

218
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,918
THEY ENTICE UNDER‐30'S INTO
THEIR GUILD FOR THEIR POTIONS,

219
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,022
AND NOT JUST ONE...
EVERYONE, EVERY DAY.

GOING WRONG AROUND HERE...

IT ISN'T JUST ONE PERSON.

224
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:22,482
WE'VE ALL GOT A PART
IN THIS, INCLUDING ME,

225
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,118
AND I'M NOT REALLY
DOING ANYTHING.

226
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,890

TO VENT SOME OF MY FRUSTRATION

AND THAT'S NOT SOLVING MUCH.

AM I GOOD FOR?

REALLY WANTED

WAS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY

I'LL BE THE FIRST TO
ADMIT THAT THE SYSTEM

DOESN'T ENCOURAGE GUILDS TO MAKE
WHAT I CALL "MORAL CHOICES."
