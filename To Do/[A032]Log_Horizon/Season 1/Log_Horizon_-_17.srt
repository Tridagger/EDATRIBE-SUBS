1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,205
(SPELL ENERGY PULSES)

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,807
[NAOTSUGU, VOICE‐CHAT]
WE'VE ALMOST CLEARED THIS AREA.

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,043
WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED A SQUAD
OR TWO, SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,177
[MINORI] UNDERSTOOD.

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,946
THERE'S A MESSAGE FROM NAOTSUGU.

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,148
LOOKS LIKE GOBLINS MIGHT
BE HEADED THIS WAY.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,184
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I SEE
ANYTHING COMING. TOYA!

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,353
[TOYA] I'LL DRAW THEM OUT
WHEN THEY GET HERE, GOT IT?

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:25,258
[RUDY] THAT'S CRAZY. JUST
HOW FAR CAN MISS MINORI SEE WHEN
IT'S DARK LIKE THIS ANYWAY?

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,795
[SERARA] SHE'S USING SOME
MAGIC EYE DROPS THAT
NAOTSUGU LENT HER.

11
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,999
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
LIKE A CAT FOR A FULL DAY.

12
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,736
[MINORI, THINKING] IT'S WORKING
JUST LIKE I PLANNED.

13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,437
AND IT HAS TO WORK.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,274
I MEAN, I PRETTY MUCH DRAGGED
EVERYBODY INTO THIS.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,909
[MARIELLE, VOICE‐CHAT]
THEY'RE ATTACKING THEM?

16
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,344
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NAOTSUGU?

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,913
THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE GONNA
LEAD IN THE EVACUATION!

18
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,481
THOSE KIDS CAN'T
DO IT ON THEIR OWN!

19
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,018
RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
NOT TRYING TO HOLD THEM OFF.

20
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,087
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
FIGHTING THEM INSTEAD.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,455
[MARIELLE] WHAT?
[NAOTSUGU] LOOK...

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,891
THE GOBLINS DON'T HAVE A
PLACE TO FALL BACK TO.

23
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,492
AND THEY HAVE
NOTHING TO PROTECT.

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,261
SO WE NEED TO TAKE
THE FIGHT TO THEM.

25
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,863
DIRECTLY. THAT'S THE PLAN.

26
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,297
[MARIELLE]
I DON'T KNOW, NAOTSUGU.

27
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,832
[NAOTSUGU] THEY'LL RUN
LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO

28
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,400
WHEN WE START
BEATING ON THEM.

29
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,970
THEY'RE STUPID AND CLUMSY
AND HAVE NO TRAINING,

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,471
LIKE GOBS ALWAYS ARE.

31
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,640
AS LONG AS THEY'RE GONNA KEEP
ON FIGHTING LIKE GOBLINS,

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,610
OUR BEST CHANCE IS TO
HIT THEM HARD AND FAST.

33
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,181
REALLY... WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD STRATEGY.

34
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,849
YUP, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

35
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:28,288
AND, BESIDES, THE KIDS HAVE US
FOR BACKUP. WE GOT THIS, RIGHT?

36
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,459
IT'S GONNA
BE A LONG NIGHT.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,963
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DOING THIS ALONE,
THOUGH, ARE WE?

38
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:41,768
I'VE KIND OF GOT TO ADMIT IT,
RUDY, I'M GLAD THEY'RE ALL HERE.

39
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,405
[SHIROE] MARIELLE TELLS
ME THEY'RE GOING TO BE
DEFENDING CHOSHI.

40
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,141
NAOTSUGU AND HIS GROUP ARE
PREPARING A SURPRISE ATTACK.

41
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,245
[MICHITAKA] WHAT? BUT WE HAVEN'T
EVEN FINISHED DISCUSSING
EVERYTHING HERE YET.

42
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,347
IF YOU WERE OUT THERE
SEEING IT HAPPEN,

43
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,183
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER
WE WERE NEGOTIATING.

44
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,921
OF COURSE. BUT HE DOES HAVE
A POINT ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT
BE PERCEIVED AS...

45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,856
ADVENTURERS ACTING ON THEIR OWN.

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:08,795
WE HAVE TO AGREE ABOUT
THIS BEFORE THE NEXT
CONFERENCE CONVENES.

47
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,489
[SERJIAD] A PLOT?

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,326
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE
GOBLIN ATTACK IS ACTUALLY

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,729
BEING ORCHESTRATED BY
THE ADVENTURERS?

50
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,965
[TAIHAKU] IF THE
ADVENTURERS HAD ACTED TO
WEAKEN THEM FROM THE START,

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,400
THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE
HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

52
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,002
[KRENDITT] HONESTLY,
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE

53
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,639
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS
OF THEIR APOCALYPSE AT ALL.

54
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,473
[KASHIWAZAKI]
BARON KRENDITT,

55
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,343
RIGHT NOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
NO ONE WITHHOLD THEIR THOUGHTS.

56
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,779
THAT DOES US ABSOLUTELY
NO GOOD WHATSOEVER.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,182
I WOULD THINK THAT'S
WHY WE'VE HELD THIS
CONFERENCE WITHOUT THEM.

58
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,887
[TAIHAKU] WELL, IN ALL
LIKELIHOOD, WE'RE PROBABLY GOING
TO LOSE CHOSHI BY NIGHTFALL.

59
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,924
AND THEN, IF THEY CONTINUE,
LORD KILIVA'S TERRITORY
IN TSUKUBA IS NEXT.

60
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,959
(KILIVA GROANS)

61
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,360
OR PERHAPS FURTHER.

62
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,964
[SERJIAD] MAIHAMA ITSELF?

63
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,439
SO WAIT, ARE THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND STILL HAVING
THEIR SECRET LITTLE MEETING?

64
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,408
PROBABLY. AND I THINK
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY

65
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,578
TO DO THIS WITHOUT
OUR INVOLVEMENT.

66
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,546
[SHIROE] THEY OBVIOUSLY
HAVEN'T DECIDED.

67
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,548
AND THEIR PRIDE'S
ON THE LINE HERE.

68
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,216
AND I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THEY

69
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,585
DON'T WANT TO OWE
US ANYTHING.

70
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,286
[KRUSTY] IF HISTORY
TELLS US ANYTHING,

71
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,254
THEY ALREADY HAVE
SOMEONE FOR THIS JOB.

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,123
[SHIROE] RIGHT. A GROUP
EVEN MORE POWERFUL

73
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,025
THAN AN EQUAL NUMBER
OF ADVENTURERS...

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,194
THE IZUMO KNIGHTS. HOWEVER...

75
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,263
[KRENDITT] SO IT'S
JUST AS WE FEARED.

76
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,200
YES. THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
DISAPPEARED.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

78
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,504
THEY ARE GONE.

79
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,138
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

80
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,408
[TAIHAKU] WE SENT
IN A NUMBER OF TEAMS
FOR RECONNAISSANCE.

81
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,476
AND THEY REPORTED BACK THAT
SEVERAL OF THE FORTRESSES

82
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,546
THAT WERE ONCE OCCUPIED
ARE NOW EMPTY.

83
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,181
NO CORPSES, NO SIGNS OF COMBAT.

84
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,551
JUST NOTHING LEFT
ON THE PREMISES.

85
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,520
AS TROUBLING AS IT IS,

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,890
WE MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THE
SITUATION AND MOVE FORWARD.

87
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,328
[KILIVA] WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE OUR
ONLY HOPE IS FOR ALL THE LORDS

88
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,564
TO UNITE AND ATTACK
THE GOBLINS TOGETHER.

89
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,098
[NOBLEMAN WITH EPAULET]
STRATEGICALLY SPEAKING,

90
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,435
SURROUNDING THEM IS PROBABLY
THE MOST FEASIBLE PLAN,

91
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,338
FORCING THEM TO LAY SIEGE
TO A WELL‐DEFENDED CITY.

92
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,906
AND WHEN THEY ARE TIRED,

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,677
WE SURROUND THEM WITH A LARGE
COMBINED ARMY AND THEN ATTACK.

94
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,912
WELL, NOW... BASED ON
WHERE THEY WERE HEADED,

95
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,316
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONLY WAY
TO ENTRAP THEM IS TO SACRIFICE
A CITY IN THE PROCESS.

96
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,119
WHAT?! OH, I SEE!
I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING!

97
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,790
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT TSUKUBA
WILL BE THE MOST LIKELY TARGET!

98
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,324
YOU ALL KNOW THAT!

99
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,726
[BALD OFFICIAL]
UNFORTUNATE. BUT UNAVOIDABLE.

100
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,829
HELL, NO! I WILL NOT
LET TSUKUBA BE SACRIFICED!

101
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,831
YOU HEAR ME?!

102
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,367
[SERJIAD] CALM YOURSELF,
LORD KILIVA.

103
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,003
I BELIEVE A RECESS IS IN ORDER.

104
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,075
(LOUD CLANG)

105
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,646
[MINORI]
THEY'RE COMING. ABOUT TEN!

106
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,648
I CAN SEE 2 ASSAULT
UNITS. GET READY.

107
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,517
TOYA'S ABOUT TO LEAD
THEM OUT INTO THE OPEN.

108
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,985
[RUDY] OK.
[ISUZU] RIGHT.

109
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,120
[SERARA] LET'S GO AHEAD
AND START THE COUNTDOWN.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,792
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

111
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,959
ZERO.

112
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,928
(PANTING)
[TOYA] OK!

113
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,362
(GOBLINS GROWLING)

114
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,865
[SERARA] WILLOW SPIRITS!

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,902
I'VE ROOTED THEM!

116
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:42,903
ALL RIGHT!

117
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,306
OK! ICICLE BLADE!

118
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,908
[TOYA] THANKS, RUDY! HYAH!

119
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,376
[ISUZU] I'M GONNA GIVE
YOU A 30‐SECOND BOOST.

120
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,145
TRY TO KEEP YOUR ATTACK
SPELLS SMALL FOR NOW.

121
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,313
[RUDY] GOT IT.

122
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,448
[MINORI] ANOTHER SQUAD
AT 2 O'CLOCK!

123
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,952
FLAMING ARROW!

124
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,220
(GOBLINS SCREAM)

125
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,623
[ISUZU] THE MASTER'S ECHO!

126
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,129
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION,
MISS ISUZU.

127
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,266
NOT NOW! WATCH YOUR COOL
DOWN AND ATTACK AGAIN
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

128
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,601
[RUDY] I'VE GOT THIS.

129
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,738
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

130
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,808
[SHIROE] RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE
FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF
THE KNIGHTS NOT BEING HERE.

131
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,246
WELL, I GUESS THAT WOULD
MAKE US THEIR ONLY OTHER
OPTION NOW, WOULDN'T IT?

132
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,315
[SHIROE] AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE
AND POSSESS THESE ABILITIES,

133
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,853
WE WON'T HAVE THE LUXURY
OF AVOIDING ANY WARS
THAT MIGHT ERUPT.

134
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,921
HOWEVER, NEITHER US
NOR THE NOBILITY

135
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,457
SHOULD CONSIDER A PLAN
THAT WOULD JUST FREELY HAND OVER

136
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,459
SOLDIERS TO THE
OTHER THAT EASILY.

137
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,028
SO WE NEED TO HAVE
A TREATY OF SOME KIND,

138
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,530
IF I HEARD YOU RIGHT.

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,600
YES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS
WE'LL NEED TO AGREE IN HERE

140
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,068
BEFORE WE AGREE WITH THEM.

141
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,871
[MICHITAKA] OH, YEAH? ANOTHER
OF YOUR SNEAKY PLANS?

142
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,472
I'M WITH YOU,
VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES.

143
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,076
[SHIROE] THIS IDEA ISN'T
EXACTLY A MAJOR COUP.

144
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,579
I'M ONLY SUGGESTING THAT
WE SIT DOWN AND DECIDE

145
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,647
WHAT OUR ROLES
ARE AHEAD OF TIME.

146
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,217
ALL RIGHT. WHAT
DO WE NEED TO DO?

147
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,891
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
THIS THING WITH THE GOBLINS...

148
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,295
I'VE NEVER SEEN FATHER
LOOK SO SERIOUS BEFORE.

149
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,131
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO GET HURT?

150
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,400
[NOBLEMAN WITH EPAULET]
IT WILL HAVE TO BE TSUKUBA.

151
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,068
IT IS A WELL‐DEFENDED CITY,

152
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,238
AND IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO
LAST QUITE A LONG TIME.

153
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,173
[KASHIWAZAKI] SO WHO'S
BREAKING THE NEWS TO KILIVA?

154
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,443
HE ISN'T GOING TO SIMPLY LOSE
A FEW VILLAGES AROUND TOWN.

155
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,747
I DON'T THINK MANY OF
HIS PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE.

156
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,418
WE'VE ALL BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

157
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,086
BUT NONE OF US
HAVE SAID IT YET.

158
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,089
WE MUST TRULY CONSIDER BRINGING
IN THE ADVENTURERS ON THIS.

159
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,027
OF COURSE. I MEAN, IF THEY DIE,
THEY SIMPLY RETURN TO LIFE.

160
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,864
AND THE DOWNSIDE IS, WELL, WE
WOULD BE LARGELY IN THEIR DEBT.

161
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,967
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY WE
CANNOT TELL THEM ANYTHING

162
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,003
BUT GET AS MUCH INFORMATION
FROM THEM THAT WE CAN.

163
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,306
AS FAR AS THE SITUATION WITH
THE KNIGHTS IS CONCERNED,

164
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,242
WE MUST KEEP THAT
TO OURSELVES.

165
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,045
[RAYNESHIA] UH!
[KASHIWAZAKI] I DON'T KNOW A
THING ABOUT THOSE ADVENTURERS.

166
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,882
SO IF I HAVE TO LIE TO A FEW OF
THEM TO KEEP THEIR PROTECTION,

167
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,317
I WILL DO SO WITHOUT HESITATION.

168
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,087
[MICHITAKA] SO THEY FINALLY
BROKE DOWN AND CALLED US, HUH?

169
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,090
[KRUSTY] LOOKS LIKE THE WEST
WIND BRIGADE MADE IT IN, TOO.

170
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,694
YEAH. SOUJIRO JUST LET
ME KNOW ABOUT IT.

171
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,665
[SOUJIRO] IT'S HUGE.

172
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,099
[SHIROE] THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

173
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,836
THEY CAN'T GET IN UNTIL
THE CONFERENCE IS OVER.

174
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:34,240
[KRUSTY] WELL, HELLO, PRINCESS.
ISN'T IT PAST YOUR BEDTIME?

175
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,509
[RAYNESHIA]
HM. UH, LOOK, I‐

176
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,144
SOMETHING HAS
YOU CONCERNED.

177
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,347
YOU LOOKING FOR A WARM GLASS
OF MILK OR SOMETHING?

178
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,215
AH!

179
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,084
(GROANS)

180
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,187
[RAYNESHIA] SAY WHAT YOU
WANT ABOUT ME BEING LAZY,
EVEN A COWARD,

181
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,890
AND THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING EXCEPT SLEEPING...

182
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,859
BUT I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF
THE HIGH LORD'S FAMILY.

183
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,795
AND I DON'T ALWAYS SLEEP EASILY.

184
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,997
[KRUSTY] SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

185
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,398
SERIOUSLY, THEN...

186
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,635
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND THAT WOULD
KEEP YOU UP SO LATE TONIGHT?

187
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,269
[RAYNESHIA] AH. HM.

188
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,574
[RAYNESHIA] I REMEMBER
YOU SAYING ONCE

189
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,343
THAT FREEDOM REQUIRES
A PERSON TO BE RESOLUTE.

190
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,778
[KRUSTY] THAT'S TRUE.

191
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,580
[RAYNESHIA] WELL, I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU SAID.

192
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,783
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

193
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,428
[MINORI] YES, WE'RE FINE,
REALLY.

194
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,297
IT LOOKS LIKE WE TOOK CARE OF
ALL THE GOBLINS AROUND HERE.

195
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,068
AND WE'RE GETTING A CHANCE
TO REST RIGHT NOW.

196
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,605
THEY'RE STILL HEADING
NORTH‐NORTHWEST, YES? RIGHT.

197
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,675
ABOUT 3 CLICKS.
ROGER THAT.

198
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,111
YOU AND NYANTA TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELVES, OK?

199
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,350
[RUDY] MAGE'S GAUNTLETS?

200
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,086
[MINORI] NYANTA IDENTIFIED THEM
AND TOLD ME WHAT THEY WERE FOR.

201
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,055
THEY'RE JUST THE THING
FOR PEOPLE WHO USE

202
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,057
OFFENSIVE MAGICAL ATTACK SPELLS.

203
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,560
YOU CAN USE THEM ONCE YOU'VE
GOTTEN TO LEVEL 25.

204
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,229
[TOYA] LEVEL 25? JEEZ. HOW GOOD
CAN SOMETHING THAT PUNY BE?

205
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,666
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE THE
FIRST ITEM FOR ALL OF US

206
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,601
TO ACQUIRE BY WORKING TOGETHER.

207
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,003
HM. YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

208
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,606
[ISUZU] WE SPENT ALL THAT TIME
IN THE DUNGEON TO GET THEM.

209
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,374
THAT MAKES THEM PRETTY
COOL IF YOU ASK ME.

210
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,642
I MEAN, COME ON!

211
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,611
[RUDY] YUP,
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

212
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,245
[TOYA] OK! SO WHAT
DO WE DO WITH THEM?

213
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,516
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN ALL USE
THEM AT THE SAME TIME.

214
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,850
[ALL] HMM.

215
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,418
[ISUZU] GUYS...
[GROUP] HUH?

216
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,088
I KNOW! WHY DON'T WE
GIVE THEM TO RUDY?
[RUDY] HUH?

217
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,592
[ISUZU] THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR PEOPLE WHO USE
ATTACK MAGIC, RIGHT?

218
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,093
[MINORI] YEAH, THEY ARE.

219
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,962
AND SINCE WE ONLY
HAVE ONE SORCERER...

220
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,099
WOW! I DON'T KNOW
IF I DESERVE IT.

221
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,669
[TOYA] THAT ISN'T LIKE YOU,
RUDY, ALL MODEST AND STUFF.

222
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,404
[RUDY]
OH SHUT IT, TOYA!

223
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:45,839
ARE YOU GUYS SURE?

224
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,474
I WANT TO DESERVE THEM.

225
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,813
AH...

226
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,681
[ISUZU] THEY LOOK
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

227
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,282
[RUDY] HUH?
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,385
[MINORI] IT'S TIME TO GO. WE
NEED TO MOVE DOWN TO THE RAVINE.

229
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,222
AND LET'S REMEMBER OUR PATROL
OVERWATCH TECHNIQUES.

230
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,025
[RUDY] OK, I SWEAR
BY THESE GAUNTLETS,

231
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,060
I'LL BEAT EVEN
MORE GOBLINS!

232
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,995
[ISUZU] DON'T GET
TOO EXCITED.

233
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,497
[RUDY] COME ON! YOU GOT
TO HAVE SOME ENTHUSIASM.

234
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,266
[ISUZU] HM.

235
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,403
[ISUZU] SURE. LET'S GET 'EM.

236
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,808
[KRENDITT] GENTLEMEN, THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US HERE.

237
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,177
THE LORDS OF EASTAL APPRECIATE
YOUR PARTICIPATION

238
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,080
IN THIS MEETING, OF COURSE.
BUT OUR CURRENT...

239
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,783
[MICHITAKA] GOOD GRIEF.
THIS ISN'T GETTING US ANYWHERE.

240
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,319
[SHIROE] I'M GUESSING
HE'S WAITING FOR ONE
OF US TO SPEAK UP, YES?

241
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,189
BOTH OF US AND THE NOBLES WANT
INFORMATION ABOUT EACH OTHER

242
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,158
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
OUR OWN SECRETS.

243
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,828
SO, OF COURSE, WE SHOULD GO
WITH THE PLAN WE DISCUSSED.

244
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,664
IF I OFFER TO SEND
IN OUR OWN TROOPS,

245
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,033
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL US WHAT THEIR
TACTICAL SITUATION IS.

246
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,037
[SHIROE, THINKING] ALL RIGHT,
GENTLEMEN, THIS GAME OF CAT
AND MOUSE IS FUN, BUT...

247
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,775
CAN ANYONE HERE SUMMON
THE KNIGHTS OF IZUMO?

248
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,810
WE NEED TO WORK WITH THEM.

249
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,446
ALL RIGHT. I'LL
TAKE THAT AS A "NO."

250
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,618
WELL, THEN IT APPEARS TO
ME AS IF THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
ARE FAILING YOU.

251
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,086
THEY SHOULD BE
RUSHING TO YOUR AID.

252
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,954
[KRENDITT] THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
WON'T SHOW UP HERE

253
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,490
TO SIMPLY ERADICATE A
FEW SNARLING MONSTERS!

254
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,493
ADVENTURERS HAVE FAR MORE
EXPERIENCE WITH GOBLINS.

255
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,197
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOUR PEOPLE AREN'T IN
TROUBLE, TOO, YOU KNOW.

256
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,900
[KRUSTY] SO YOU'RE ASKING US TO
SEND PEOPLE TO HELP YOU FIGHT.

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,935
[KRENDITT] WELL,
YOU KNOW, I...

258
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,437
[MICHITAKA] ALL RIGHT. LOOK,
I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF

259
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,407
THIS CONFERENCE WAS TO SHARE
THOUGHTS ON HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

260
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,377
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE
JUST INTERESTED IN GRILLING US!

261
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,848
[NOBLEMAN WITH EPAULET]
EXCUSE ME. THE AKIHABARA
KNIGHTS ARE SAID TO BE BRAVE

262
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,517
AND UNMATCHED IN COMBAT!

263
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,219
[SHIROE] IF BY "KNIGHTS,"
YOU ARE REFERRING TO
MILITARY OFFICERS

264
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,955
WHO ARE ALWAYS AT THE
READY TO FIGHT BATTLES...

265
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,490
THEN THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
A MISUNDERSTANDING, SIR.

266
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,227
AS A GROUP, WE ADVENTURERS
DO NOT HAVE AN ARMY.

267
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,831
THEN TELL ME, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU ADVENTURERS GOOD FOR?

268
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,699
WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

269
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,100
[KILIVA]
GIVE ME A BREAK!

270
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,802
YOU ADVENTURERS HAVE
BEEN BLESSED WITH

271
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,638
SPECIAL ABILITIES
FROM THE GODS!

272
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,305
YOU HAVE A DUTY
TO PROTECT THE LAND!

273
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,308
[MICHITAKA] OH, YEAH?
WELL, THAT'S NEWS TO ME, PAL.

274
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,745
THAT IS UTTER NONSENSE,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

275
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,246
YOU ARE INVINCIBLE!

276
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,148
AND DESPITE SUCH AN
INCREDIBLE GIFT,

277
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,084
YOU BLINDLY ABANDON
THE RESPONSIBILITIES
THAT COME WITH IT!

278
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,053
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELVES.

279
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,756
[MICHITAKA] SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

280
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,824
[KILIVA] GUH...

281
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,259
[MICHITAKA] FIRST OF ALL,
LAST I CHECKED,

282
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,427
NONE OF US ARE CITIZENS
OF THE FREEDOM CITIES!

283
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,830
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE NEVER BOTHERED
TO INVITE US TO ATTEND

284
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,799
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE
CONFERENCES HERE BEFORE!

285
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,400
SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?!

286
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,436
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF PLAN
YOU GUYS HAVE UP TO THIS POINT,

287
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,807
BUT THE ADVENTURERS HAVE NO
OBLIGATION TO BE ANY PART OF IT!

288
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,577
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, BARON KRENDITT?!

289
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,647
[KRENDITT] MR. MICHITAKA,
THE POINT WE'RE TRYING
TO GET ACROSS...

290
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,183
THAT IS TO SAY...
(TAIHAKU GROWLS)

291
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,052
GENTLEMEN, IN SPITE OF
WHAT SOME OF US HAVE SAID,

292
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,389
WE ARE NOT HERE TO REQUEST OR
DEMAND FIGHTERS FROM AKIHABARA.

293
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,457
REALLY? YOU'RE TELLING
ME THAT WE WERE INVITED

294
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,460
TO THIS CONFERENCE TO LISTEN
TO LORD KILIVA'S REQUEST,

295
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,764
AND THE LEAGUE OF FREEDOM
CITIES DISAGREES WITH HIM?

296
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,399
THAT'S A BIT PRESUMPTUOUS.

297
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,636
WHAT? ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF ACTING FOR MY OWN BENEFIT?

298
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,172
THAT IS AN INSULT TO ME AND
EVERYONE ELSE AT THIS TABLE!

299
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,341
[TAIHAKU] IT IS NOT
THE WILL OF THE LEAGUE.

300
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,277
BUT MANY OF US DO, INDEED,
SHARE LORD KILIVA'S CONCERN

301
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,113
ABOUT WHAT YOUR ROLE
IN THIS MIGHT BE.

302
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,749
WILL THE MIGHTY AND ALL‐POWERFUL
WARRIORS OF AKIHABARA

303
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,854
SIT THIS ONE OUT AND STAND
IDLY BY WHILE YAMATO FACES
CERTAIN DISASTER?

304
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,923
WE ARE NOT YOUR
STINKING GUARD DOGS.

305
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,025
[MICHITAKA] "OH, YOU GUYS
HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

306
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,460
GO AND KILL THE
GOBLINS FOR US."

307
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,929
WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THAT?

308
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,931
JUST SENDING PEOPLE OUT
TO THE BATTLEFIELD TO DO

309
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,498
YOUR WORK FOR YOU IS DISGUSTING.

310
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,069
AND IT WON'T GAIN THE TRUST
OF THE PEOPLE OF AKIHABARA!

311
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,675
SORRY ABOUT THE TABLE.

312
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:46,046
[SHIROE, THINKING] MICHITAKA,
ALL OF US ADVENTURERS RISK
LOSING OUR MEMORIES WHEN WE DIE.

313
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,549
ANYONE WOULD GET UPSET
ABOUT THAT, NOT JUST YOU.

314
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,986
AND WHILE WE DID WANT
YOU TO PLAY THE VOICE
AGAINST SENDING TROOPS...

315
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,288
YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE JUST A
BIT OVERBOARD THERE, BUDDY.

316
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,092
I THINK MICHITAKA MIGHT
HAVE JUST BOXED US IN.

317
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,497

OK, DEEP BREATHS HERE.

322
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,021

EXQUISITE, MADAM.

323
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,957

I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.
I DON'T BELONG.

326
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,465
WHAT AM I DOING?

(EXHALES)

328
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,403
I JUST WANT TO GO TO BED.

329
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,508
I WANT TO WEAR MY PAJAMAS
AND JUST WISH THIS AWAY.

IN THE KITCHEN, PRINCESS.

331
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,015
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] UH! NO!
NO, GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

332
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,617
I DID NOT JUST HEAR THAT.

333

RATHER BE ASLEEP, BUT...

337
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,165
[RAYNESHIA] I AM
GOING TO AKIHABARA.

338
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,535

339
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,969
[NOBLEMAN] WHAT?
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS...

340
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,037
[KRENDITT] WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS?

341
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:17,938
[KRUSTY] I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

342
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,172
WHY AKIHABARA?

343
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,174

A VOLUNTEER ARMY.

344
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,676
[TAIHAKU, THINKING]
RIDICULOUS.

345
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,310
WHAT CAN ONE GIRL DO?

346
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,012

TO A FOREIGN BAND OF FIGHTERS

347

348
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,683

[KASHIWAZAKI, THINKING]
A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
THE ROUND TABLE

350
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,486
WILL BE ACCOMPANYING HER...

351
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,889
THAT COULD CHANGE
THINGS DRASTICALLY.

352
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,726
ARE YOU SURE? THAT'S
GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS
UNDERTAKING, YOU KNOW?

353
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:40,894
[RAYNESHIA] YES.

354
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,262
AND WHY EXACTLY ARE
YOU INTERESTED?

355
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,330
YOU SAID THAT
ADVENTURERS WERE FREE.

356
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,033
THEY ARE FREE TO DO
AS THEY WISH.

ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICS.

359
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,641
HOWEVER, I WAS TAUGHT FROM
A VERY YOUNG AGE THAT YOU

360
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,143
SHOW RESPECT WHEN YOU ASK
FOR SOMETHING YOU WANT.

361
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,779
AND AS A MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY,

362
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,447
MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER
INGRAINED THIS IN ME.

363
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,783
THAT'S WHY.

364
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,819
I THINK IT'S IMPROPER THAT WE
SHOULD BE HIDING THE TRUTH.

365
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,189
THE FOREMOST TRUTH BEING WE
CAN'T FIND THE IZUMO KNIGHTS!

(REPRESENTATIVES

367
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,093
[TAIHAKU] TOLD THEM
OUR SECRET, OF COURSE!

368
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,395
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO
BREAK UP A PARTY, DON'T YOU?

369
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,197
WHEN I TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY,

370
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,499
I WANT YOU TO
APOLOGIZE WITH ME.

371
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,803
ALL RIGHT. WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU PLANNING, PRINCESS?

372
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:26,006
[RAYNESHIA] I GUESS
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS READ
MY MIND NOW, CAN YOU?

373
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,208
WELL, THERE IS NO PLAN.

374
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,044
IN FACT, I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA PULL THIS OFF,

375
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,114
BUT AS A MEMBER OF
THE COWEN FAMILY,

376
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,283
I CERTAINLY DO NOT WISH TO
BE INSULTING TO EVERYONE.

(CHATTER STOPS)

[SERJIAD] YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

379
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,026
[RAYNESHIA]
THE ADVENTURERS ARE FREE.

380
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,062
THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM THAN ANY
OF US COULD EVER HOPE TO HAVE.

381
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,766
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE AMONG
US WHO IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS
STRONG AS AN ADVENTURER IS,

382
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,603
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE
JUST GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEM WHENEVER WE WANT.

383
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,005
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO EXPLOIT ANYONE ELSE.

384
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:03,109
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE
OR HOW WEAK WE ARE.

385
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,245
THE TIME TO ASK
THEM IS NOW.

386
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,348
BUT I NEED TO GO TO AKIHABARA
WITH AN OPEN HEART.

387
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,252
MASTER KRUSTY SAID THAT EVERY
SINGLE ADVENTURER HAS FREEDOM.

388
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,621
SO IF ANY OF THEM WOULD
AGREE FREELY TO HELP US,

389
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,157
THEN WHY WOULD WE NOT
ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN?

390
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,259
EVEN IF I JUST FIND A DOZEN,

391
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,928
IT HAS TO BE WORTH THE TIME
I SPEND THERE, RIGHT?

392
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,397
MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT ME
THAT THE REAL ART OF SHOWING

393
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,168
SOMEONE RESPECT ISN'T ABOUT
FANCY OR FORCEFUL TALKING.

394
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,703
I WILL GO THERE.

395
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,973
AND I'LL TALK TO EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THEM IF I HAVE TO.

396
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,375

VERY MANY ENEMIES.

WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL,
ALL OF US.

417
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,233
[TOYA] WHAT SCARES ME IS
HITTING SOFT GROUND, ROOTS,

418
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,035
AND ROCKS WHILE I'M
TRYING TO FIGHT.

419
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,738

SO EASY TO LOSE YOUR BALANCE.

[TOYA] I THINK WE'RE ALL A BIT
MORE WEARY OF GOBLINS AT NIGHT,

422

BUT AT LEAST WE CAN
SMELL THEM COMING.

IT'S NOT A GOOD SMELL.

ME WANT TO GO OUT THERE

AND FIGHT EVEN HARDER!

00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,724

GO ALONG WITH THAT.
