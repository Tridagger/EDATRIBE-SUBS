DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY

252
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,829

[MARIELLE] COME ON.
LIKE, COME ON!

282
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,396
LIKE, WHAT DID WE MAKE?

283
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,266
[HENRIETTA] WE EARNED
43,776 GOLD IN SALES.

284
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:26,006
THAT'S 1,159 CUSTOMERS
WHO SPENT AN AVERAGE OF
38 GOLD PIECES EACH.

285
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,909
[HENRIETTA] WE SOLD OUT THE
CRESCENT BURGERS WE PREPARED

286
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,046
AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE,
EXCEPT THE BLACK ROSE TEA.

287
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,081
AWESOME! HA HA.
LIKE, THIS IS SO GREAT.

288
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,720
LIKE, WE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT
5 MILLION GOLD IN NO TIME IF
WE KEEP DOING THIS BUSINESS.

289
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,223
[SHIROE]
ACTUALLY, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT
MORE TIME THAN WE REALLY HAVE.

290
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,891
HUH? IT WILL?

291
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,094
[SHIROE] IT'D TAKE 120 MORE
DAYS BASED ON THOSE SALES.

292
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,130
AND 4 MONTHS IS
WAY TOO LONG.

293
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,934
[MARIELLE] THAT MIGHT BE,
BUT I KNOW WE, LIKE, TURNED
A LOT OF CUSTOMERS AWAY TODAY.

294
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,301
I COULD PROBABLY
SELL A LOT MORE.

LOOK, I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

296

PLAYERS THAT WOULD EAT A
CRESCENT BURGER EVERY DAY.

298
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:08,348
[HENRIETTA] THE PROBLEM IS
NO MATTER HOW HIGH THE
DEMAND HAPPENS TO GROW,

299
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,819
WE CAN ONLY FEASIBLY SERVE
AROUND A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS
A DAY AND NOTHING MORE.

300
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,388

ISN'T BIG ENOUGH.

304
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,994
THIS WASN'T ABOUT STAYING
IN BUSINESS AND MAKING MONEY.

305
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,996
OH, THAT'S
RIGHT! HA HA!

306
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,899
I GUESS ALL THOSE GOLD PIECES
WERE STARTING TO BLIND ME.

00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,438
[SHIROE] THANKS.
[HENRIETTA] UH‐HUH.

310
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,174
[MARIELLE] OK, SHIROE, SINCE
WE CAN'T GET ALL THE MONEY

311
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,376

DO WE DO YOUR OTHER PLAN?

312
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,913

GOT YOU COVERED ON
THE HARD PART.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

317
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,459
[HENRIETTA] YES.
LEAVE IT TO ME, OK?

322
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,070
[AKATSUKI] OH, MY LORD HAS GIVEN
ME A SECRET MISSION TO EXECUTE!

323
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,773
DON'T TRY STOPPING ME! AH!

324
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,843
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE WAS KIND
ENOUGH TO LEND YOU TO ME.

325
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,444
ISN'T THAT JUST WONDERFUL?

326
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:15,749
MY LORD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SOLD ME OUT AGAIN!

327
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,384
NOW, HURRY. PUT THIS ON!

328
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,055
[AKATSUKI] NO WAY!
I'M NOT SOME LITTLE DOLL
FOR YOU TO DRESS UP!

329
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,990
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

330
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,892
[HENRIETTA] AH, AH, AH!

331
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,528
YOU CAN'T ENTER THAT ROOM.

332
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,129
[AKATSUKI]
WHAT'S THAT?

333
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,298
[HENRIETTA] THIS ZONE BELONGS TO
THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

334
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,068
(BUZZING)
AND THAT WAREHOUSE ONLY
PERMITS GUILD MEMBERS.

335
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,904
AND I'M SORRY, SWEETIE,
BUT ARE YOU A GUILD MEMBER?

336
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,107
I GUESS I'LL
HAVE TO...

337
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,678
(BUZZING)
[AKATSUKI] ARE YOU
FREAKING KIDDING ME?

338
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,012
[HENRIETTA]
IT'S USELESS.

339
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,815
I SET IT SO THAT SKILLS
CAN'T BE USED HERE.

340
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,918
AND I CAN ALSO SET COMBAT
PERMISSIONS INDIVIDUALLY.

341
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,687
CLEVER, RIGHT?

342
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,290
(AKATSUKI WHIMPERING)

343
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,059
(SQUEALS)

344
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,694
[ASUKA, LILIANA, AND ASHLIN]
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

345
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,497
[NYAN‐TA] WELL, I'LL BE.
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
FETCHING ON YOU.

346
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:08,301
DEAR GOD! I'M FREAKING
OUT ON THE CUTENESS!

347
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,071
HEY, HAVE ANY OF
YOU SEEN SHORYU?
[HENRIETTA] HM?

348
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,806
HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DONE ALREADY.

349
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:17,210
HE WANTED THE BIG
GAME, SO HE PROBABLY
ISN'T BACK YET.

350
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,013
LIKE, REALLY? I HOPE
HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

351
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,748
[RUMBLING]
OHH...

352
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,449
[LILIANA] OH, MY GOODNESS!

353
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,119
[ASUKA] UM, THERE'S A GIANT
BOAR STUCK IN THE HALLWAY.

354
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,254
[HIEN]
TH‐THAT'S A LOT OF PIG!

355
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,826
MISS MARIELLE, IS THIS
GONNA HELP THE KITCHEN ANY?

356
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:37,163
[SHORYU] UGH!
[MARIELLE] SHORYU! SHORYU!

357
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,499
(SHORYU BREATHING DEEPLY)

358
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,769
HE SAID HE HADN'T HAD
ANY SLEEP FOR A WHILE.

359
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,071
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

360
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,508
OH, POOR GUY.

361
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:50,076
[MARIELLE] THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, EVERYONE.

362
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,179
COMPANIONS LIKE YOU
ARE REALLY A BLESSING.

363
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,782
[HIEN] FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
HE LOOKS HAPPY THAT WAY,

364
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,283
ALMOST DEAD OR NOT.

365
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,853
WELL, I HATE TO CAST
ASPERSIONS ON ALL
YOUR HARD WORK,

366
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:05,692
BUT THE FLAVOR OF A GIANT
BOAR IS ENTIRELY TOO
STRONG FOR WHAT WE DO.

367
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,293
(LAUGHTER)

368
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,831
[MARIELLE] SHH! YOU'RE GONNA
TOTALLY WAKE HIM UP.

369
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:17,137
[SHIROE]
EVERYONE IN CRESCENT MOON IS
SO FRIENDLY AND WELL‐MANNERED.

370
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,375
[SHIROE]
REALLY. THERE'S HENRIETTA
AND MARIELLE.

371
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:27,380
THEIR KINDNESS AND GLOWING
SMILES ARE INSPIRING
AND CONTAGIOUS.

372
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,452
ON TOP OF THAT, I FINALLY WENT
AND CREATED MY VERY OWN GUILD.

373
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,589
I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET
TO MEET THEM SOON.

374
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,560
WE'RE GETTING
EVERYTHING READY.

375
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,229
JUST HAVE A LITTLE FAITH,
AND WE'LL GET THIS DONE.

376
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,231
(MINORI WHINCES)

377
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,838
[SHIROE]
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
I SWEAR IT.

378
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,207
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
OH!

379
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,409
(SHIROE CLEARS THROAT)

380
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,254
[TOYA] SHIROE SAID THAT?
[MINORI] YEAH.

381
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,092
[TOYA]
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

382
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,227
[MINORI] IS IT OK?
[TOYA] HMM?

383
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:18,665
SERIOUSLY? IS ALL
THIS REALLY OK?

384
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,970
[SHIROE]
THIS IS STRANGE, CHIEF.

385
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,371
BACK WHEN I WAS PLAYING,

386
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,373
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS
WERE BACKGROUND ART.

387
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,210
BUT NOW THE HUD SAYS THE
ZONES ARE ALL FOR SALE.

388
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,245
[NYAN‐TA]
IT SEEMS THAT WAY, HMM?

389
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,647
[SHIROE]
THAT'S NOT ALL EITHER.

390
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:37,718
EVERY CITY AND BUILDING IN
THE WORLD IS FOR SALE.

391
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:40,086
THE PRICES ARE JUST
OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH.

392
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,889
[NYAN‐TA] AND IN LIGHT
OF THE FACT THAT YOU
NEED A SMALL FORTUNE

393
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,490
TO BUY A BUILDING
AROUND HERE,

394
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,761
MAYBE TOKYO STATION SHOULD
BE OUR HEADQUARTERS, HMM?

395
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,463
[SHIROE] NOT QUITE.

396
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,602
(OWL HOOTING)
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

397
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,540
[SOJIRO]
YOU GUYS WAIT LONG?

398
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,677
MASTER SHIROE, MASTER NYAN‐TA,
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.

399
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,680
[SHIROE] HEY, SOJIRO.
[NYAN‐TA] HEY, LITTLE MAN.

400
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,616
I HEARD YOU WENT AND STARTED
YOUR OWN GUILD, HMM?

401
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,319
[SOJIRO] YUP. IT'S CALLED
THE BRIGADE OF THE WEST WIND.

402
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,621
[SHIROE] IT'S SMALL,

403
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,422
BUT SOJIRO'S BRIGADE
OF THE WEST WIND

404
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,726
IS JUST AS POWERFUL AS THE
BIGGEST GUILDS OUT THERE.

405
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,727
[NYAN‐TA] MEOW?

406
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,162
[SOJIRO] NOT REALLY.

407
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,464
WE WERE JUST GETTING OUR
FEET WET STARTING THE GUILD.

408
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,668
THEN THE APOCALYPSE CAME AROUND
AND REWROTE ALL OUR PRIORITIES.

409
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,370
I HONESTLY HADN'T BEEN KEEPING
UP WITH THINGS AS MUCH

410
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,607
OR LOGGING IN AS OFTEN
SINCE THE TEA PARTY BROKE UP.

411
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,911
ARE YOU STILL KEEPING
COMPANY WITH THAT DELIGHTFUL
NAZNA AND MISS SAKI?

412
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,580
YEAH! NAZNA'S IN MY GUILD.

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,382
AND SHE'S JUST AS EASYGOING
AS SHE EVER WAS.

414
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,651
SAKI WAS ALSO IN
THE GUILD WITH US,

415
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,254
BUT I GUESS SHE DIDN'T LOG
IN DURING THE DAY OF
THE APOCALYPSE.

416
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,356
SO WHILE I'M STILL
THINKING ABOUT IT,

417
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,925
WOULD YOU HAPPEN
TO BE A...

418
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,494
ARE YOU STILL AS POPULAR WITH
THE GIRLS AS YOU USED TO BE?

419
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,263
[SOJIRO] HA HA. AH,
COME ON. I DON'T KNOW.

420
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,533
[NYAN‐TA] AH! TO BE
YOUNG AGAIN. HA HA.

421
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,401
[SOJIRO] SO TELL ME
SOMETHING, SHIROE,

422
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,303
YOU FINALLY CALLED.

423
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,206
WHAT INSPIRED YOU
TO GET IN TOUCH?

424
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,908
[SHIROE]
WELL, YOU SEE‐

425
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,442
[SOJIRO]
I GUESS WHAT
I MEAN IS,

426
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,412
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE
ME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

427
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,781
HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

428
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:20,020
[SOJIRO]
BECAUSE, WELL, I REMEMBER
ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME,

429
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,355
BUT THEN YOU KIND OF
SAID "NO," YOU KNOW?

430
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,124
[SHIROE] YEAH, BUT
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

431
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,460
I LIKE YOU FINE, SOJIRO.

432
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,896
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE SPENDING ALL THAT
TIME BEING INVOLVED

433
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,264
WITH A GUILD
BACK THEN.

434
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,266
[SHIROE]
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

435
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,036
THE APOCALYPSE MADE THIS
PLACE OUR REAL WORLD.

436
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,672
AND SO THE WAY
WE LIVE HERE IS
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

437
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,041
THAN IT WAS WHEN
IT WAS JUST A GAME.

438
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:46,279
[SHIROE] I CHOSE TO USE THE
POWER I HAVE TO PROTECT
PEOPLE WHO DON'T.

439
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,549
I HAVE MADE A
GUILD OF MY OWN.

440
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,350
WE'RE STARTING OUT,
AND WE'RE KIND OF SMALL.

441
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,486
BUT IT'S NOT A BAD THING
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

442
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,489
BUT I'LL ONLY HAVE
A PLACE FOR MYSELF

443
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,325
AFTER I'VE GIVEN OTHER
PEOPLE THE CHANCE.

444
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,462
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

445
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,265
OH.

446
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,968
SO THAT BRINGS ME BACK
TO WHY YOU CALLED ME.

447
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,603
[NYAN‐TA]
WELL, MY FRIEND,

448
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:13,139
WHAT WE WANT AT THE
MOMENT IS YOUR OPINION
OF AKIHABARA, HMM?

449
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,844
[SOJIRO]
AH. IT'S LIKE A...
A PRISON.

450
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,580
HONESTLY?

451
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,815
[SOJIRO] IT'S NOT
JUST AKIHABARA.

452
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,185
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU
LOOK AT IT, THE WHOLE
WORLD'S A PRISON.

453
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,420
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
EVEN DIE HERE.

454
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,455
[SHIROE]
WELL, I KNOW WE CAN FIX IT.

455
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,825
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

456
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,062
YEAH, I'M IN.

457
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,598
HUH. YOU SURE?

458
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,666
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE AGREEING TO FIRST?

459
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,568
[SOJIRO] I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE NECESSARY.

460
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,071
I JUST HAVE A FEELING IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT SOMEHOW.

461
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:49,442
A SAMURAI'S JOB IS TO
FIGHT ON THE FRONT LINES
REGARDLESS OF THE PLAN.

462
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,612
PLUS, BACK IN OUR TEA PARTY
DAYS, OUR STRATEGISTS ALWAYS

463
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:55,048
SEEMED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING
AMAZING TO GET US THROUGH.

464
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,783
SOJIRO...

465
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,020
[NYAN‐TA] YOU'RE ONE OF THE
GOOD ONES, LITTLE MAN.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

466
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,789
[SOJIRO] COME ON,
YOU GUYS. HA HA!

467
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,593
I GOT MORE
BURGER MEAT HERE.

468
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,094
[CUSTOMER]
3 CRESCENT BURGERS.

469
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,530
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,

470
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,431
LET ME COME AROUND AND GET
YOUR ORDER WHILE YOU WAIT.

471
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,166
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

472
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,701
OH, PLEASE ADD ME
TO YOUR FRIENDS' LIST.

473
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,403
HEY, HOLD YOUR HORSES. HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA COME TO YOU.

474
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,939
SERIOUSLY, BOSS?

475
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,241
ARE YOU REALLY JUST GONNA
SIT OUT HERE ALL DAY LONG

476
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,077
HOCKING BURGERS FOR
THIS SHIROE FELLA?

477
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,646
[SOJIRO]
OF COURSE NOT.

478
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,648
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO IT THAN THIS.

479
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:34,087
I HAVE FAITH IN HIS PLAN.
I KNOW HE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.
