FOR STUPID STUFF
LIKE HARD WORK.

164
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,886
AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S
BUSY SINCE WE BROUGHT
THE BURGERS BACK.

165
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:20,419
WE NEED TO PICK UP ALL
THESE BOXES AND GET MOVING.

166
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,852
OH! NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO!

167
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,986
WHILE I'M ALL
SWEATY AND GROSS!

168
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,319
I GUESS I HAVE
NO CHOICE HERE.

169
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,586
I WANT TO TAKE
A BATH RIGHT NOW!

170
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:29,186
[HENRIETTA]
YES, IT'S ME.

171
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,352
SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

172
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:32,786
[MARIELLE]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

173
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,552
THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH HANDS.

174
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:38,919
WE NEED SOME BIG, STRONG
MEN TO CARRY ALL THESE
BOXES FOR OUR SALE.

175
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,719
[HENRIETTA] YES! OF COURSE,
MARIELLE COULD HAVE JUST
ASKED YOU HERSELF,

176
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:44,919
BUT SHE'S BEING ALL
WEIRD AND HESITANT

177
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,519
AND ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE.
[MARIELLE] HM...

178
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,786
[MARIELLE] WAIT. WHO THE
HECK ARE YOU TALKING TO?

179
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,519
[HENRIETTA] SHH. I'M ON
THE PHONE, SWEETIE...

180
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,819
[MARIELLE] BUT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT ME!

181
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,119
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
BE, LIKE, QUIET? AAH!

182
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,552
[HENRIETTA] OH! I'M SO
GLAD YOU'LL HELP ME!

183
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,852
THANKS, NAOTSUGU.

184
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:00,152
MARIELLE WILL BE VERY HAPPY
TO HEAR YOU'RE COMING OVER.

185
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,786
SEE YOU IN A JIFFY!

186
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,919
[MARIELLE] JEEZ. WHY ARE YOU,
LIKE, ALWAYS SO MEAN TO ME?

187
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,852
HOW IS THAT BEING
MEAN TO YOU?

188
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:09,052
I'M TRYING TO HELP
YOU OUT, YOU KNOW?

189
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:11,519
[MARIELLE] I THINK I'M
GOING TO GO TAKE A SHOWER.

190
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,919
[HENRIETTA]
RIGHT NOW?

191
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,052
DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT,
LIKE, GONNA GO RUN
AWAY OR ANYTHING.

192
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:18,252
(SNIFFS)

193
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:20,319
IT WOULD JUST BE RUDE OF ME
TO BE ALL, EW, STINKY!

194
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:24,219
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
HA HA. SHE ALWAYS KNOWS
WHAT SHE WANTS, DOESN'T SHE?

195
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,352
I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS.

196
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:29,186
BUT I GUESS I KNOW
WHAT I...

197
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,319
OH, NO.

198
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:32,752
NO, NO, NO, NO.

199
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,419
I MEAN, SURE, HE'S AN
ATTRACTIVE GUY AND EVERYTHING.

200
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,619
BUT... AND HE'S ONLY THE
SMARTEST OF ALL THE GUYS I KNOW!

201
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:43,452
UH! OH, MY GOD. WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I THINKING?!

202
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,319
HELLO? EARTH
TO HENRIETTA.

203
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,819
(HENRIETTA SCREAMS)

204
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,519
[HENRIETTA] OH, MY GOD. DON'T
SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT!

205
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,686
YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH!

206
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:51,419
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SENT FOR ME.

207
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,619
UH, OH, YES. YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

208
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,852
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
OR MAYBE...

209
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,652
MAYBE I SIMPLY ACT
TOO INDIFFERENT

210
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,752
WHEN THE TWO OF
US ARE TOGETHER.

211
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:01,686
[AKATSUKI] IS SOMETHING WRONG?
[HENRIETTA] NO! NOT AT ALL.

212
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:04,519
UH! THIS AFTERNOON,
WE WILL BE SETTING UP A STAND

213
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:06,919
TO SELL A LINE OF
LOVELY WINTER CLOTHING.

214
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,686
I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU
COULD HELP OUT, AKATSUKI.

215
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,219
[AKATSUKI] WINTER CLOTHING?

216
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,419
YOU AREN'T PLANNING SOMETHING
EMBARRASSING AGAIN, ARE YOU?

217
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,852
[HENRIETTA] OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

218
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:17,219
YOU'LL JUST BE WORKING BEHIND
THE SCENES, OF COURSE.

219
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,319
[AKATSUKI] THEN IT DOESN'T
REALLY NEED TO BE ME, DOES IT?

220
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,519
OH, AND SHIROE WILL BE STOPPING
BY LATER TO CHECK THINGS OUT.

221
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,386
[AKATSUKI] UH...

222
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,052
FINE... I WILL
CONSIDER IT.

223
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:31,019
AAH! WHAT A POSITIVELY
STRAIGHTFORWARD PERSONALITY!

224
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,519
YOU'RE LIKE A PUPPY!

225
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,619
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, LADIES! UH...
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS
THE LIFE I LIVE!

226
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,586
[NAOTSUGU] WHAT HAPPENED
TO HENRIETTA'S BRAIN?

227
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,086
[AKATSUKI] I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
[HENRIETTA] I JUST LOVE IT!
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

228
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:50,978
[ELISSA] OH, WHAT SHOULD
WE DO ABOUT FOOD?

229
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,811
I MEAN, I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ADVENTURERS

230
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,811
AND WHAT SORT OF THINGS
THEY LIKE TO EAT.

231
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,711
[RAYNESHIA] ELISSA,
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR

232
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,411
AND PUT A FEW MORE
FLOWERS BY THE DOOR?

233
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:01,445
[ELISSA]
YES. UNDERSTOOD,
MY LADY.

234
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,211
AND I THINK THAT'LL
BASICALLY DO IT.

235
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,178
(RAYNESHIA SIGHS)

236
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,578
[KRUSTY] IT COMES WITH
3 MEALS AND A NAP.

237
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:16,078
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?
[KRUSTY] THE DEAL. IT COMES
WITH SOME MAJOR BENEFITS.

238
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:19,878
[RAYNESHIA] HE DID IT AGAIN.
HE TRICKED ME. HONESTLY!

239
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,578
IT'S ALL THAT STUPID
MONSTER'S FAULT.

240
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,711
HE'S THE REASON
THAT I'M SO BUSY.

241
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,811
THAT JERK. I SHOULD REMIND
HIM WHO HAS THE POWER.

242
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,878
I SHOULD REMIND HIM WHO'S
THE PRINCESS HERE.

243
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:32,711
[KRUSTY] I'M ALREADY WELL
AWARE OF THAT, SO NO NEED.

244
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:36,611
[RAYNESHIA] HMM! UH, KRUSTY,
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

245
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:37,911
(ELISSA CHUCKLES)

246
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,545
[KRUSTY] ELISSA WAS KIND
ENOUGH TO LET ME IN.

247
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,978
[RAYNESHIA] SO WHAT IS
IT YOU WANT EXACTLY?

248
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,811
[KRUSTY] WELL, I HEARD
THAT YOU WERE HERE DOING
SOME ACTUAL WORK.

249
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:48,611
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D COME
AND OFFER YOU MY SYMPATHY.

250
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:53,545
(RAYNESHIA SIGHS)
WELL, THAT'S THE LEAST YOU COULD
DO SINCE IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

251
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:57,978
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD,
THE WHOLE TWILIGHT BANQUET
THING WAS YOUR IDEA.

252
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,578
[RAYNESHIA] IT'S MY WAY OF
THANKING THE ADVENTURERS.

253
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,911
ACKNOWLEDGING ALL
THEY'VE DONE FOR US.

254
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:06,311
[KRUSTY] IT WAS A SMART
CHOICE TO USE A NUMBER
OF SMALLER TABLES

255
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:10,778
RATHER THAN A SINGLE
LARGE ONE WHERE PEOPLE
ARE SEATED BY THEIR STATUS.

256
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:14,145
ADVENTURERS AREN'T BIG FANS OF
THE NOBLE SENSE OF FORMALITY.

257
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:18,378
[RAYNESHIA] YES. I THINK I'VE
GROWN TO UNDERSTAND THAT BY NOW.

258
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,811
GLAD TO HEAR
IT, PRINCESS.

259
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,211
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] I CAN'T
TELL IF THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF

260
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,478
HIS SARCASTIC COMMENTS OR NOT.

261
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,645
SO WHY DID HE
COME HERE ANYWAY?

262
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,578
WHATEVER.
(SIGH)

263
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:36,645
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THAT MONSTER'S THINKING
IS A WASTE OF TIME.

264
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,578
I'LL PROBABLY NEVER
UNDERSTAND HIM.

265
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,578
[KARASHIN] SO ARE YOU
REALLY SURE ABOUT THIS?

266
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,045
THIS IS A LOT TO TAKE ON.

267
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:47,945
I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN WORK TO DO, RIGHT?

268
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,178
[MINORI] DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT SOME TIME TODAY.

269
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:51,778
SO TAKE A
LOOK AT THIS.

270
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:54,711
ALL THESE FORMS HAVE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SIZES AND LAYOUTS

271
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,111
AND EVERYTHING...LIKE THIS.

272
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,611
[KARASHIN] IT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND WILL BE COMING

273
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,378
FROM ALL OVER THE
COUNTRYSIDE. HEH HEH.

274
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:03,445
[MINORI] AND EACH TERRITORY HAS
ITS OWN VERSION OF THE FORMS.

275
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:06,745
[KARASHIN] YEAH. IT SURE SEEMS
THAT WAY. WHAT A FRICKIN' PAIN.

276
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:10,311
[MINORI] WELL, I'LL START BY
GETTING THEM ALL ORGANIZED.

277
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,178
[KARASHIN] OK. SO, MINORI,

278
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:14,878
DO YOU HAVE A SUBCLASS
OF SCRIBE OR SOMETHING?

279
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:18,211
NO, MY SUBCLASS
IS APPRENTICE.

280
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:21,278
I'D... LIKE...

281
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:25,611
I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION
ABOUT MAYBE CHANGING MY SKILLS.

282
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:28,911
[SHIROE] YOU WANT TO
CHANGE YOUR SUBCLASS?

283
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:32,811
[MINORI] YES. BUT I DON'T
REALLY KNOW WHAT TO PICK.

284
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:36,711
[SHIROE] HMM. ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THIS, THEN?

285
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:40,145
THERE'S A SUBCLASS,
AND IT'S CALLED "APPRENTICE."

286
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,645
APPRENTICE SUBCLASS?

287
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,711
IT'S JUST WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

288
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:47,345
IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE
SOMEONE'S APPRENTICE.

289
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:51,811
THAT WAY, YOU CAN BECOME
SOMEONE'S STUDENT AND THEN
COPY ALL THEIR SKILLS.

290
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,445
[MINORI]
THAT SOUNDS PERFECT!

291
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:56,578
[SHIROE] BUT THERE ARE LIMITS ON
WHICH SKILLS YOU CAN LEARN.

292
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:58,945
YOU CAN ONLY GAIN THE
SKILLS FOR YOUR LEVEL,

293
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:01,945
BUT YOU DO GET A BONUS,
SO YOU CAN LEVEL UP QUICKLY.

294
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:04,045
AND THE BEST PART IS
WHEN YOU CHANGE CLASSES,

295
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,511
YOU STILL KEEP YOUR
EXPERIENCE POINTS.

296
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,111
UNTIL YOU DECIDE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

297
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:11,045
IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA.

298
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:15,845
[MINORI] IT'S SETTLED. I HAVE
DECIDED TO BECOME AN APPRENTICE.

299
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,811
[SHIROE] HUH! THAT WAS FAST.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR TAILORING SKILL?

300
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,445
YOU STILL HAVE
THAT, DON'T YOU?

301
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:24,845
YEAH. BUT I DIDN'T
PICK THAT BECAUSE I
LIKED IT OR ANYTHING.

302
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:25,945
SO ANYWAY...

303
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,545
UM, SHIROE, I WOULD LIKE
YOU TO BE MY MENTOR.

304
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,311
UH, YOU WANT ME?

305
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,878
[MINORI, THINKING] I CHANGED
MY SUBCLASS FOR A REASON...

306
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,978
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
BE USEFUL TO SHIROE.

307
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,211
AND IF I CAN BE OF HELP TO
THE PEOPLE OF AKIHABARA,

308
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,978
THEN IT ALSO MIGHT HELP
MY MENTOR'S REPUTATION

309
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:45,878
AND EVERYONE IN
THE ROUND TABLE.

310
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,945
AND FOR THAT, I MUST BE
FOCUSED AND DILIGENT.

311
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,645
AND GROW AND MOVE ONE
STEP AT A TIME.

312
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:55,578
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS
MY BATTLEFIELD!

313
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,745
[KARASHIN] HOLY CRAP!

314
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,011
YOU ARE, LIKE,
CRAZY FAST, MINORI!

315
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:06,578
[MINORI] I'M SHIROE'S STUDENT,
AFTER ALL. HEE HEE!

316
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,511
[SERARA] THIS IS GREAT!

317
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,345
[NYANTA] THE TOMATO SAUCE
HERE IS DELIGHTFUL.

318
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,945
[SERARA] NOW I'LL HAVE ENOUGH
ENERGY TO GO BACK TO CRESCENT
MOON THIS AFTERNOON.

319
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,811
NOW, THERE'S THAT
SMILE I LOVE.

320
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,745
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO HELP YOU OUT, BABY.

321
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,811
(SERARA CHUCKLES)
(MAN YELLS, DISHES CRASH)

322
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,878
[WAITRESS] OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO SORRY!

323
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,411
[NOBLEMAN]
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

324
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,078
JUST LOOK AT THIS STAIN!

325
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,811
I'LL PAY FOR IT, SIR.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

326
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,545
[NOBLEMAN]
OH, YEAH, RIGHT!

327
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,345
YOU COULD NEVER
AFFORD IT! HONESTLY!

328
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,245
YOU SEE? THIS IS WHY I TOLD YOU

329
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,345
IT WASN'T WORTH COMING TO
A FILTHY PLACE LIKE THIS!

330
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:42,045
THAT'S AWFUL...

331
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,878
[MAN IN FUR HAT]
WHAT'S THAT DUDE'S PROBLEM?

332
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,711
[BLOND ELF] I THINK PRETTY
BOY'S IN THE WRONG PLACE.

333
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,545
[MAN WITH GLASSES]
HE SHOULD JUST GET LOST.

334
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:50,045
WHICH OF YOU PEASANTS
JUST DARED TO INSULT ME?!

335
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,111
[MAN IN FUR HAT]
THAT WOULD BE US.

336
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:53,545
VERY WELL, THEN,

337
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,578
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TEACH YOU
BRATS A PAINFUL LESSON!

338
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,911
[MAN IN FUR HAT] YEAH.

339
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,645
[BLOND ELF]
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE,
FANCY PANTS?

340
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:00,611
[MAN WITH GLASSES]
'CAUSE YOU JUST FOUND IT.

341
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,711
DO SOMETHING,
NYANTA!

342
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,811
DON'T YOU WORRY YOUR
PRETTY LITTLE HEAD.

343
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:06,645
AH!

344
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,445
[NYANTA] MEOW...

345
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:10,378
[NOBLEMAN] AND WHAT
DO YOU WANT, CAT?

346
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:12,445
[NYANTA]
OH, I'M NO CAT,
GOOD SIR.

347
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:14,678
BUT I AM A PROUD MEMBER
OF THE CAT PEOPLE.

348
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,645
[NOBLEMAN]
YEAH, I NEVER
HEARD OF THEM. UH!

349
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,711
[NYANTA] GUESS IT'S TIME FOR
ME TO ILLUMINATE YOU, HMM?

350
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,378
[NOBLEMAN]
HEY! UNHAND ME
THIS INSTANT!

351
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:24,478
(PATRONS LAUGH)
[NOBLEMAN] LET ME GO.
LET ME GO NOW! AAH!

352
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:25,945
[KNIGHTS] MY LORD!

353
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,245
[NYANTA] YOU REALLY OUGHT TO
TRY MINDING YOUR MANNERS.

354
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:33,045
AKIHABARA HAS A FEW COMMON
COURTESY RULES BY WHICH
WE ALL MUST ABIDE.

355
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,245
[NOBLEMAN] YOU'VE DISGRACED ME,
YOU DISGUSTING ANIMAL!

356
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:36,611
[MUSTACHED KNIGHT] MY LORD,
PLEASE CONTROL YOURSELF!

357
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:37,911
[NOBLEMAN]
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

358
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:39,745
[KNIGHT WITH BLACK HAIR]
PLEASE CALM DOWN!

359
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:41,578
[NOBLEMAN] GET OFF! YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR THIS, I SWEAR TO YOU,

360
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:42,745
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

361
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:45,145
[SERARA, THINKING]
NYANTA'S SO COOL!

362
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,177
MEOW...

363
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,878
[SHIROE] A CONFLICT WITH THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND... AGAIN?

364
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,411
[NYANTA, VOICE‐CHAT]
THAT'S RIGHT.

365
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,445
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BEEF UP SECURITY.

366
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,511
TO A DEGREE, I GUESS
I EXPECTED THIS

367
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:05,678
SINCE THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
LIVE IN A CLASS‐BASED SOCIETY
WHILE WE LIVE FREE.

368
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,578
[NYANTA] THAT'S TRUE.

369
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:11,278
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND'S TRADERS AT THIS FESTIVAL
ARE PROFESSIONALS,

370
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:15,045
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
WHO'S RUNNING A SHOP
IS MERELY AN AMATEUR.

371
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,945
[SHIROE] D. D. D. AND THE BLACK
SWORDS ARE READILY AVAILABLE.

372
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,845
AND, OF COURSE,
NAOTSUGU'S RUNNING
AROUND OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

373
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:23,211
I THINK WE CAN LEAVE
THINGS ALONE FOR NOW.

374
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,411
[PLAYER 1] TEAM 3 HAS RETURNED!

375
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,111
[PLAYER 2]
TEAM 2 HEADING OUT!

376
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,278
[ISAAC] RIGHT. GOOD WORK!

377
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,278
[REZARICK] ISAAC, SIR,

378
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:30,611
HERE'S THE LATEST REPORT.

379
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,211
WE ASSISTED ONE CARRIAGE
STUCK ON A SIDE ROAD,

380
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,578
HALTED 4 ARGUMENTS,

381
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,978
AND DEALT WITH 2 CLAIMS
OF OUTSTANDING PAYMENTS.

382
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:38,978
ALL INVOLVED
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

383
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,911
ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT
TO BE TOUGH AND DRAW THE
LINE WITH THESE CLOWNS.

384
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:44,178
YOU KEEP UP THE
GOOD WORK, REZARICK.

385
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,478
[REZARICK] YES, SIR.

386
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:47,478
[KRUSTY] YOU KNOW,
I HONESTLY NEVER EXPECTED

387
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:48,845
SO MANY WOULD
SHOW UP.

388
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:50,278
[ISAAC] LOOKS LIKE THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND

389
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:52,311
LOVE THEIR
FESTIVALS, TOO.

390
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,445
IN ANY CASE,

391
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,345
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES

392
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:00,045
WAS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT ALL
THIS BUSINESS TO AKIHABARA.

393
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,345
A WHILE BACK, I INVITED
HIM TO JOIN MY GUILD.

394
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:05,711
OH?

395
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,578
THIS WAS AFTER THE
TEA PARTY DISBANDED

396
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,778
AND HE WAS STILL
JUST A SOLO PLAYER.

397
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:14,111
[ISAAC] I'D SEEN HOW
WELL HE FOUGHT WHILE
HE WAS A GUEST OF OURS.

398
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,445
WHAT DID HE SAY?

399
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,845
HE TURNED ME DOWN.

400
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:20,811
[ISAAC] HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS WORTHY OF THE OFFER.

401
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,578
AND SO I LOST INTEREST
AND EVENTUALLY MOVED ON.

402
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,711
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO
WASTE WAITING FOR PEOPLE

403
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:30,011
WHO AREN'T READY TO
FIND AND SLAY ENEMIES.

404
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,178
[KRUSTY] LOOKS LIKE
AFTER THE APOCALYPSE,
OUR FRIEND HAS GROWN UP...

405
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,778
GROWN ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME MAJOR
INFLUENCE ON THE ENTIRE CITY.

406
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:39,078
[ISAAC] AND, MAN, THAT'S
JUST WHAT I DON'T GET.

407
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:43,011
IS THE GUY A STRATEGIST OR
IS HE REALLY JUST A GAMBLER?

408
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:47,045
SOMETIMES I'M NOT EVEN
SURE IF HE FEELS DEAD
OR ALIVE IN THIS WORLD.

409
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:49,711
[KRUSTY] HONESTLY, I THINK
SHIROE IS AT HIS BEST

410
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,111
WHEN ALL BETS ARE OFF
AND ANYTHING GOES.

411
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,645
[ISAAC] "ANYTHING GOES"?

412
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:56,745
I GET THE FEELING HE'S NOT
REALLY A STRATEGIST AT ALL.

413
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,811
I DON'T THINK HE'S
QUITE THAT COMPLICATED.

414
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,811
WHEN HE HAS TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES,

415
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:04,045
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S
NOTHING IN IT FOR HIM,

416
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:07,445
HE'S AS STRONG AS
ANYONE YOU'LL EVER SEE.

417
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,811
(GLASSES SHEEN)

418
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:12,445
SHIROE IS LIKE A CURSED SWORD.

419
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,345
YEAH, I GET THAT.

420
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,811
BUT NOW THAT CURSED SWORD
IS CURRENTLY BURIED BEHIND
A GIANT PILE OF PAPERWORK.

421
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,011
WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHEN HE'LL
BE DRAWN OUT TO BATTLE NEXT?

422
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:25,278
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO
SEEING IT WHEN IT HAPPENS.

423
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,611
(ISAAC LAUGHS)

424
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,245
[HENRIETTA] OH, AKATSUKI,
YOU LOOK FANTASTICALLY,

425
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:32,745
RIDICULOUSLY ADORABLE, SO CUTE.

426
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,345
[AKATSUKI] YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ME BEING

427
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:35,711
IN A FASHION SHOW!

428
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:37,411
YOU SAID I'D BE WORKING
IN THE BACKGROUND.

429
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,711
[HENRIETTA] OH, MY GOD...

430
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,445
[HENRIETTA] OH, THAT'S
RIGHT, HONEY, YOU ARE!

431
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:41,911
THE CLOTHING IS THE
STAR OF THE SHOW.

432
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:43,678
ALL YOU REALLY HAVE
TO DO IS PUT IT ON.

433
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:44,878
(AKATSUKI GROWLS)

434
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,911
[MARIELLE] HERE! YOU
WEAR THIS, SHIROE!

435
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,711
[SHIROE] UH, YOU
CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

436
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,645
[AKATSUKI] THAT'LL LOOK
REALLY GOOD ON YOU, MY LORD.

437
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:52,411
[SHIROE] I'M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

438
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,745
[MARIELLE] OH, MY. I HAVEN'T
SEEN THIS MANY PEOPLE IN, LIKE,

439
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,078
A REALLY LONG
TIME, YOU GUYS.

440
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:57,911
[CONSTANTAN] I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE HEARING ME!

441
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,345
[MARIELLE] HUH?
[CONSTANTAN] I TOLD YOU
I'D PAY FOR IT!

442
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,545
[SHIROE] HUH?
[NEMIMI] I'M SORRY,

443
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,278
BUT THE MONEY ISN'T
THE ISSUE, SIR.

444
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:05,278
[MINORI] HUH, WHAT?

445
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:06,745
[KARASHIN] MINORI?

446
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:08,911
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

447
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:12,045
[CONSTANTAN] I'VE COME ALL
THE WAY FROM THE FAR WEST
TO BUY THIS STUFF!

448
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,711
[NEMIMI] I KNOW.
AND I'M REALLY SORRY,

449
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,711
BUT IT'S ONLY
2 ITEMS PER CUSTOMER.

450
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,745
DON'T YOU
REALIZE WHO I AM?

451
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,945
TREAT ME RIGHT, AND I CAN MAKE
YOU FAMOUS ACROSS THE LAND!

452
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,411
TH‐THAT'S NOT REALLY THE
KIND OF THING WE'RE AFTER.

453
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,778
YOU'RE NOT
MAKING SENSE!

454
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:24,945
[SHIROE] SIR, PLEASE...

455
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,645
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
YOUR POINT,

456
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,545
BUT THESE FOLKS LIVE
BY DIFFERENT RULES.

457
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,278
I MUST ASK
YOU TO LEAVE.

458
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,611
[CONSTANTAN] WHA‐?!

459
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:34,045
MIND YOUR OWN FREAKING
BUSINESS, FOUR EYES!

460
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,545
NOW, BEAT IT!

461
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:39,411
IT'S TIME
YOU LEFT.

462
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:41,678
THERE ARE MANY OTHER
SHOPS TO SEE.

463
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:44,678
[CONSTANTAN] HUH! YEAH!
AND I'M NEVER COMING
BACK EITHER!

464
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,278
GOOD LUCK SELLING
YOUR CRAP!

465
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,445
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MASTER SHIROE.

466
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:50,111
IF HE BOUGHT
EVERYTHING IN THE SHOP,

467
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:52,878
I WOULDN'T GET TO ENJOY SHARING
MY JEWELRY WITH EVERYBODY.

468
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:56,311
[SHIROE] HA HA!
NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.

469
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:57,745
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THAT'S STRANGE...

470
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:00,611
WHY WOULD HE BE TURNED
AWAY SO EASILY?

471
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:02,211
[MAN 1] HEY, HOW LONG DO
I HAVE TO WAIT?

472
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,578
[MAN 2] I AM HERE
TO DO BUSINESS.
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT?

473
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,411
[MAN 3] I'M ASKING YOU
HOW MANY YOU HAVE!

474
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,678
[MAN 4]
JUST GIVE ME THE
REST OF THEM!

475
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,045
[VENDOR] WE REALLY
CAN'T DO THAT.

476
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,511
[MAN 4] I'M NOT GOING
UNTIL YOU SAY "YES."

477
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:12,711
[VENDOR] PLEASE STOP...

478
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,211
[AKATSUKI]
WHAT'S WRONG,
MY LORD?

479
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:16,711
[SHIROE] THE MOOD IS STARTING
TO GET OUT OF HAND.

480
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,945
YES. MORE THAN
I'D ANTICIPATED.

481
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,645
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
SEEM TO BE VERY IMPATIENT.

482
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,845
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT.

483
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:26,611
I CAN'T GET A CLEAR
ENOUGH PICTURE.

484
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,878
I‐I FEEL LIKE I MUST
BE MISSING SOMETHING.

485
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:32,078
(CHIME)

486
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:33,678
[SHIROE] HUH?
[MINORI] SHIROE, IT'S MINORI.

487
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:35,445
I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH THE PAPERWORK,

488
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,678
AND SOMETHING ISN'T
QUITE RIGHT HERE.

489
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:39,445
SOME OF THE
PAPERWORK OVERLAPS,

490
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,745
AND SOME OF IT IS
JUST PLAIN WRONG.

491
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,811
[MINORI] THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF
VERY BASIC ERRORS AND MISTAKES.

492
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:48,211
AND, WELL, MOST OF THEM
SEEM TO BE COMING FROM...

493
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:49,611
FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

494
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,878
[SHIROE] I SEE.
SO THAT'S IT.

495
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,878
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, WHAT'LL
WE DO ABOUT THE SHOW?

496
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,078
[SHIROE] MINORI, DO ME A FAVOR
AND KEEP THIS LINE OPEN.

497
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,611
[MINORI] RIGHT!

498
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:01,145
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI, I NEED
YOU TO FIND ISAAC

499
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:04,378
AND GET AN UPDATED REPORT
ON OUR SECURITY SITUATION.

500
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:06,511
AH.

501
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:07,911
[SHIROE] IT LOOKS LIKE...

502
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:11,011
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE MAY
BE ATTACKING AKIHABARA.

503
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:14,378
[AKATSUKI] "ATTACKING"?
[HENRIETTA] AN ENEMY? BUT WHO?

504
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:16,978
[SHIROE] I'M GOING BACK TO MY
OFFICE IN THE GUILD BUILDING.

505
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:19,245
WE MIGHT HAVE AN
EMERGENCY ON OUR HANDS.

506
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:20,911
[AKATSUKI]
I UNDERSTAND.

507
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:24,345
[HENRIETTA] UH. AN ENEMY?

508
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:26,645
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I LET MY GUARD DOWN!

509
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,511
ALL THE SIGNS WERE RIGHT
THERE IN FRONT OF ME,

510
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,111
BUT I WAS CARELESS...

511
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:33,245
AND NOW... NOW THEY
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

512
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:36,711
(ENGINE HUMMING)

513
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:39,711
[EIJIRO] WE'LL BE ARRIVING
IN APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES.

514
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:42,045
PREPARE TO DISEMBARK...

515
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,778
LORD MARVESS.

516
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,811
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER] THE TOWN
OF AKIHABARA IS UNDER ATTACK.

517
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:21,011
SHIROE SENSES AN ENEMY
AND TAKES ACTION.

518
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,811
BUT HIS GUESSWORK IS OFF,
AND HIS CALCULATIONS FAIL.

519
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:26,278
THE ROUND TABLE
FACES GRAVE DANGER.

520
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,411
WHAT IS THE ENEMY
REALLY AFTER?

521
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:31,211
IN THE HOUR OF GREATEST PERIL,
THE STRATEGIST SHIROE BEGINS

522
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,578
HIS COUNTERATTACK,

523
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,245
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

524
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,878
[SHIROE] WE WILL
CHANGE THE WORLD.
