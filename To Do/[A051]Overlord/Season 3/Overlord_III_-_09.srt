1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,375
There!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,625
[AURA]
'Kay! Massacre is now complete.

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,333
Normally, we'd kill everyone
in the castle, too.

4
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,625
But, we don't know which
one of you is the emperor,

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
so I guess we'd better hold off.

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,333
That said, if the emperor
doesn't apologize

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,958
to our lord, we'll destroy
your whole country.

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,625
Emperor! Step up or
we'll kill you all!

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,041
[JIRCNIV]
Ains Ooal Gown... Who is he?

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,916
No. I don't have
time to analyze.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,083
Don't attack!

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,375
I'm Emperor Jircniv
Rune Farlord El Nix.

13
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,333
I wish to talk.

14
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,958
This guy's kinda gutsy.

15
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,041
Yeah. I'm surprised
he didn't run.

16
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,875
Well... It seems I've
underestimated our foe.

17
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,125
I suppose I'll have to visit

18
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,541
the Great Tomb
of Nazarick myself

19
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,125
if we're to make peace
with its ruler.

20
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,208
[LOUNE]
Majesty. Please.

21
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,708
Apologies, but we
need you to wake.

22
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,000
[yawns]

23
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,208
I've not taken an
afternoon nap in years.

24
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,041
Not since I was a child.

25
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,458
Perhaps I owe
Lord Gown my thanks.

26
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,500
Yeah. You needed a break.

27
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,083
You're always workin'
on one thing or another.

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,708
What's that about?

29
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,583
Personally, I think that
Bloody Emperor's to blame.

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,333
That's a shame.
I thought you were close.

31
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,791
He's fine, but he pushed
through so many new reforms

32
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,500
that now I can barely
keep up with the man.

33
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,125
Right, Vermillion?

34
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,583
True.

35
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,375
And with all the fat nobles
we've purged from office,

36
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,000
the bureaucracy's been
stretched a bit thin.

37
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,500
[FLUDER, BAZIWOOD chuckle]

38
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,500
What a profoundly
stupid man he is.

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,500
[sighs]

40
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,833
However,

41
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,208
if I continue to make laws
at such a hectic pace,

42
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,041
the next emperor will
surely despise me.

43
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,583
[BAZIWOOD]
What do you mean "next emperor"?

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,708
Do you plan to take
a lady of Baharuth

45
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,250
as your empress, or will
you seek one from outside?

46
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,958
I would prefer someone
from another country.

47
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,583
There's Princess Renner.

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,041
Your thoughts?

49
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,875
Her actions have certainly
been praiseworthy,

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,041
but there's something
off about her.

51
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,000
I get the unpleasant
feeling that she makes

52
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,916
mistakes deliberately.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Then have you
considered the Queen

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,916
of the Dragon Kingdom?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,791
She carries the blood of
the Brightness Dragon Lord.

56
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,958
And the Dragon Lords have
access to Wild magic.

57
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,875
Imagine casting resurrection
without the loss of life force.

58
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,500
Give me a break, old man.

59
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,541
She's a crone who hides
her age with magic.

60
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,041
Those two are both
the type of women

61
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,916
I despise the most.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
[knocking]

63
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,916
[LEINAS]
Your Majesty. It's Leinas.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,125
Door.

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,125
[gasps]

66
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,583
Your Majesty. Excuse me.

67
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,541
[JIRCNIV]
What is it? Come in.

68
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,416
Right.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,958
We're close.

70
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,208
Our scouts have already sighted
the Great Tomb of Nazarick.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,291
Assuming that the report
they gave me is accurate,

72
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,500
maids are stationed outside.

73
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,208
Presumably to welcome
us upon arrival.

74
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,833
Really? Maids at a tomb.

75
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,125
The place we're about
to see is a world

76
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,750
that is completely
unknown to us.

77
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,416
If the worst should happen,

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,458
please come to my side
immediately, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,916
Ah, I see.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,083
If needed, we'll escape with
your teleportation magic.

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,458
Well, if it comes
to that, your knights

82
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,000
will buy you as much
time as we can.

83
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,500
[LEINAS]
As always.

84
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,125
I will prioritize my own
safety first and foremost.

85
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
Right. I understand.

86
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,583
You informed me of this when
you first became my knight.

87
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,125
Yes. It's the deal we struck.

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,708
[JIRCNIV]
Now...

89
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,250
Let's find out what kind of man
this Ains Ooal Gown really is.

90
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,833
Greetings, Emperor
Jircniv Rune Farlord

91
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,375
El Nix of Baharuth. we've
been awaiting your arrival.

92
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,125
We bid you and your
retinue welcome

93
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,625
on behalf of Lord Ains.
I am Yuri Alpha.

94
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,291
And my name's Lupisregina Beta!

95
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,625
Lord Ains has proved himself
a gracious host already

96
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,333
by sending such beauties.

97
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,333
You're a most welcome sight.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
Now then.

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,166
First, let us correct
this unacceptable weather.

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,166
What?

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,958
It can't be!

102
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,958
No more clouds. It's
already much warmer.

103
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,083
Speak.

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,083
What magic did they just use?

105
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,583
The most basic Control Weather
is a sixth tier spell.

106
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,583
But I believe this magic
to be of an even higher level!

107
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,666
It's simply amazing!

108
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,416
You all must be tired
after your journey.

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,875
[FLUDER sputters]

110
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
[HOODED STUDENT 06B]
No. This is impossible!

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,041
[HOODED STUDENT 06C]
Th-They're using Death Knights?

112
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,416
[JIRCNIV] Death Knights?
What are these things?

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,208
Are they the same as the
undead you're keeping

114
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,500
below the Ministry
of Magic? Answer me!

115
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,583
Yes, but it's
unimaginable that anyone

116
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,541
could control so
many mighty undead!

117
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,291
Majesty. Look.

118
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,541
Uh. Even with all
four of us here,

119
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,041
I have my doubts that we
can beat one of those things.

120
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,416
Stay back. You're in danger.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,375
You said it's fine
for me to run?

122
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,208
If you think that's for
the best, then feel free.

123
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
However, if you do run,

124
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
you'll cease to be
one of my knights.

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
Which would make you uninvited,

126
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,791
much like the Workers
who came here before.

127
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,416
[gasps]

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,333
[YURI]
No need to be nervous.

129
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,750
The Death Knights you
see here were created

130
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,916
by the hand of
Lord Ains himself.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,666
Created, you say?

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,291
Yes. As such, they
are absolutely loyal

133
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,250
to any order he might give them.

134
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,750
You can rest assured
that they'll do

135
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,166
nothing to harm you.

136
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,791
[laughs]

137
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,250
Such mastery! It's incredible!

138
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,958
Master Paradyne?

139
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,708
What would you like to do,
Your Majesty? Ha!

140
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,083
[FLUDER laughs]

141
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,500
Shall I teleport the
both of us out of here?

142
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,166
I believe it might be possible
for us to escape in that manner.

143
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,375
Of course, that's
assuming the master

144
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,458
of this place allows us to.

145
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,291
That's an interesting
expression, old man.

146
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,375
Let me ask you something.

147
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
Did you truly think I'd run?

148
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,416
Of course not--
I should know better.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,333
My Jircniv is much
braver than that.

150
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,041
We've finished
preparing your table.

151
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
Please relax and
enjoy yourselves.

152
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,791
Would anyone care for
some ice-cold refreshment?

153
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,833
Tasty!

154
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,666
I've never had
anything like this.

155
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,750
It strikes a perfect balance
between sourness and sweetness.

156
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,333
It's soothing to the heart.

157
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,791
[sighs]

158
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,666
I'd say the journey was
worth it just for this.

159
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,375
We thank you for your patience.

160
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,875
Lord Ains has finished
preparing and will see you now.

161
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,916
If you'll please step this way.

162
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,500
[JIRCNIV]
Gold. Status. Power.

163
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:38,666
Both military and magical.
Beautiful women, too.

164
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,541
[JIRCNIV] There is absolutely
nothing I could offer

165
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,541
this Ains Ooal Gown that
he doesn't already have.

166
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,375
There are many who would
equate him to a god.

167
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,916
I'm amazed that
no one's tried to run.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,833
A "victory" for us

169
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,916
would be to make it home alive,
with the Empire intact.

170
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,041
Excuse me, Lord Ains,
but the Emperor of Baharuth,

171
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,625
Jircniv Rune Farlord
El Nix is here.

172
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,958
He's come in response
to your summons.

173
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,708
[AINS]
Emperor of Baharuth.

174
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,333
Thank you for coming.

175
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,166
I am the master of the
Great Tomb of Nazarick,

176
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,708
Ains Ooal Gown.

177
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm pleased to meet
you, Master Ains.

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,041
You've been a most
generous host.

179
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,666
Pardon, Lord.

180
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,916
I cannot abide this blasphemy.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,583
These humans stand here
as if they're your equals.

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,125
I must correct this.

183
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,750
Prostrate yourselves!

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,208
[GROUP gasps]

185
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,500
[AINS]
Enough, Demiurge.

186
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,416
[DEMIURGE]
Uh--

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,208
You're free to stand.

188
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,833
[AINS] It was not my
intention to insult you,

189
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,791
but through my inability
to control my subordinate,

190
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,708
I've done just that.

191
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,458
Please forgive me.

192
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,916
I will bow my head if you wish.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,458
[gasps]

194
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,166
There is nothing
to forgive. Worry not.

195
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,041
This is a common occurrence.

196
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,916
Sometimes our vassals
misinterpret us.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
One of my subordinates
has committed

198
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,541
precisely this offense.

199
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,250
I am most embarrassed.

200
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,166
Allow me to present you with
the head of the foolish noble

201
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,458
who sent intruders to your home.

202
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,125
Will you accept it?

203
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,291
[AINS]
I shall.

204
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm not one for trophies, but I
won't put this gift to waste.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,083
Amazing.

206
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,041
[AINS]
Go. Join the line.

207
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,750
[AINS] Now, Emperor Jircniv
Rune Farlord El Nix.

208
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,625
[JIRCNIV]
Jircniv will suffice.

209
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,000
[AINS]
I see. Emperor Jircniv, then.

210
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,625
Since my subordinate has acted
so rudely towards you,

211
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,166
I in turn will disregard
the trouble your noble

212
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,333
has caused to Nazarick.

213
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,625
[gasps]

214
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,541
[AINS] There is no longer
a need for apology.

215
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,416
You may go home in peace.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,833
[JIRCNIV gasps]

217
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,916
[AINS] We're about to be
rather busy here in Nazarick.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,458
[GROUP gasps]

219
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,291
[AINS] Thanks to your noble,
we now realize that trouble

220
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,791
will come to us even
if we keep to ourselves.

221
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
Armed with that knowledge,

222
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,291
we shall pre-empt any
aggression that may come.

223
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,041
What exactly is your meaning?

224
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,000
[AINS] I will defeat any
who would dare attempt

225
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,791
to bring harm to
the Tomb of Nazarick.

226
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,041
They'll be made to pay
for their arrogance.

227
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,958
This world shall feel my wrath

228
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,083
until the quiet
I love has returned.

229
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,916
An admirable goal!

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,583
Why don't we form an alliance?

231
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,083
As if your pathetic country
could ever be more--

232
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,333
Watch your mouth.

233
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,958
[AINS] Cease this racket.
I demand silence.

234
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,625
Rise up.

235
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,625
Found a country and
rule it as a king.

236
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,916
I can think of no
title more worthy

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,750
for the illustrious
Ains Ooal Gown.

238
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,333
My empire will do
all in its power

239
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,958
to assist you in
this great endeavor.

240
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,791
[AINS] What merit do
you see for yourself

241
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,541
in this, Emperor Jircniv?

242
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,708
I wish only to establish
friendly ties with you,

243
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,666
and the great country
you will someday create.

244
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,083
Let us prosper, together.

245
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:35,333
[AINS] I see. Then I
look forward to it.

246
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,750
[JIRCNIV]
What is he thinking?

247
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,833
He's at an
overwhelming advantage.

248
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,375
If he demanded my subservience,

249
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,041
I'd have no choice
but to accept.

250
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,958
I see. This is wonderful.

251
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,000
In that case,
if there is anything

252
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
we can provide you now,

253
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,083
ask and it will be yours.

254
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,583
[AINS]
Excellent.

255
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,083
I cannot think of
anything at present.

256
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,166
Though it would be
convenient if I had a way

257
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
to contact you quickly.

258
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,000
My secretary can
assist with that.

259
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,583
Meet Loune Vermillion.

260
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,541
[AINS] And for my part,
I'll send Demiurge to you.

261
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,250
[AINS]
Since you were so gracious

262
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,875
as to forgive his rude display,

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,208
I would like to leave
this matter to him.

264
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,125
Demiurge is one of my
most trusted aides.

265
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,833
I'm sure he can resolve
any issue that might arise.

266
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,916
[JIRCNIV]
He's already moved against us.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,875
Sending a demon that can
control men with its voice.

268
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,083
[AINS] This is the birth
date of a new alliance.

269
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,875
Perhaps we'll make it a holiday.

270
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,500
I quite agree. Let's make it so.

271
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,875
Nothing would please me more.

272
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,541
[AINS] Well, the emperor
acted just as expected.

273
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,000
[SHALLTEAR]
Pardon, Lord Ains.

274
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,166
but might I ask
a humble question?

275
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,708
[AINS]
Go on.

276
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,458
[SHALLTEAR] Why are we
treating that human emperor

277
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,541
as an ally when he's clearly
so much weaker than us?

278
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,541
All of our actions
must be justified.

279
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
But why can't we simply
take what we want?

280
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,625
[AINS] We could destroy
Baharuth with ease,

281
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,458
but we would be condemned
for our aggression.

282
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,291
I'll not have the name of
Ains Ooal Gown sullied so.

283
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,625
[COCYTUS]
I see.

284
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,958
Oh, wow, you were really
thinking ahead, Lord Ains!

285
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,541
[laughs] Do all of you truly
believe that the thinking

286
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,500
behind the Supreme One's
plan is that simple? Huh?

287
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,625
[AINS]
Huh?

288
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,791
--[AURA, MARE] Huh?
--[COCYTUS] What?

289
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,958
Is there something we missed?

290
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,416
[laughs]

291
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,916
Oh, goodness. Lord Ains.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,833
I think it would be
beneficial to tell Shalltear

293
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,125
and the others
your true intentions.

294
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,958
They affect our
future plans, after all.

295
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,041
[AINS]
As expected of you, Demiurge.

296
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,875
Along with my overseer of
the floor guardians, Albedo.

297
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,875
You've recognized
my true thinking.

298
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,000
[MOMONGA]
The hell is he talking about?

299
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,708
It's amazing to think how
long you've been planning.

300
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,125
I finally see why
you created Momon.

301
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,291
It's brilliant.

302
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,958
Your political acumen
knows no bounds.

303
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,000
[MOMONGA]
Really?

304
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,000
What does Momon
have to do with it?

305
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,708
I still don't grasp
your meaning.

306
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
[AINS]
Demiurge.

307
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,333
I permit you to explain my plan
as I believe you understand it.

308
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,041
[DEMIURGE]
Yes, My Lord.

309
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,750
[JIRCNIV]
Damn.

310
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,833
That was the castle
of a Demon King.

311
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,583
Death was sitting
on that throne.

312
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,750
[JIRCNIV]
But no. I'm not done yet.

313
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,750
We still have a
chance of victory.

314
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,125
This Ains Ooal Gown is a
monster among monsters

315
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,500
who can make Death
Knights with ease.

316
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,500
Should he become our enemy,
Baharuth will fall.

317
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,750
Even if we seek to appease him,

318
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,291
such a being might kill
the living for amusement.

319
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,625
He's undead, after all.

320
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,958
We're agreed?

321
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,500
Completely.

322
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,791
[HOODED STUDENT 06B]
The situation is just

323
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,958
as you've described.

324
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,458
[BAZIWOOD]
I feel the same.

325
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,333
I've got my doubts
that this is an enemy

326
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,875
mankind can win against.

327
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,208
[JIRCNIV]
From what I've seen,

328
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,750
he rules as an
absolute overlord.

329
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,916
And disregarding his appearance,
he has a king's charisma.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And on top of that,
this fiend is intelligent.

331
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,666
I saw meaning behind every
movement he chose to make.

332
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,291
I've no idea where he
obtained such knowledge,

333
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,833
but he appeared to know a
great deal about our empire.

334
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,750
[gasps]

335
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,458
[JIRCNIV] Ains Ooal Gown
clearly surpasses the old man

336
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,375
as a magic caster.

337
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:40,000
Fluder's obsessed with magic,
yet he left without protest.

338
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,708
Normally he would've
begged to stay behind

339
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,708
so he could glean
new information,

340
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
regardless of the risk.

341
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,541
[JIRCNIV]
He barely seemed curious at all.

342
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,500
[gasps]

343
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,125
[JIRCNIV]
He knew.

344
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,333
[JIRCNIV] He wasn't curious
because he'd seen it before.

345
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,875
Sorry, but are you
all right, Your Majesty?

346
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,416
You look a little pale.

347
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
[JIRCNIV]
How long?

348
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,250
From the beginning? Of course.

349
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,583
Yes, I believe he's
the one who suggested

350
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,833
we send Workers to that
tomb in the first place.

351
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,958
He's a traitor.

352
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,583
[ALL gasp]

353
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,333
Fluder Paradyne has betrayed me.

354
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,583
That's impossible.
Surely this is but a jest.

355
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:27,375
It's no jest. Just how
reliant upon him are we?

356
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,875
If I strip him of power,

357
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,333
how much damage
will it cause us?

358
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,583
The damage would
be unimaginable.

359
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,875
Fluder represents much
of our strength.

360
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,625
No country has a caster
that can match him.

361
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,291
Fluder's power is a
great negotiating tool.

362
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,625
If they learn of his demotion,

363
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,000
our neighbors will
feel emboldened.

364
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,375
There is much we must accomplish

365
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,791
if we're to
overcome this threat.

366
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,333
Our only hope is to gather
together the Empire,

367
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,500
the Kingdom, the Theocracy,
the Council State,

368
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,875
and the Holy Kingdom.

369
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,125
We will have to create
a grand alliance,

370
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,208
to fight against Nazarick.

371
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,625
Ostensibly, the Empire will
act as a faithful ally

372
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,458
while we form a resistance.

373
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,666
It's risky.

374
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
In the event that our
plan is discovered,

375
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,708
our country will be
the first to fall.

376
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,166
Roles reversed,

377
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,000
I would make an example of
our Empire by destroying it.

378
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,166
Oh, yeah.

379
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,875
That does sound like
somethin' you'd do.

380
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,041
I'll take that as a compliment.

381
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
Because of this, the
Empire can't be the first

382
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,166
to suggest an alliance.

383
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,250
The other countries must
band together on their own.

384
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,916
And as we await this.

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
We must seek out an
individual with the power

386
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,000
to threaten Ains himself.

387
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,000
[BAZIWOOD]
You think they exist?

388
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,083
I know it.

389
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,000
I've seen them
standing by his throne.

390
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,958
Yes. That's how he'll think.

391
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,375
We can proceed with confidence
that this is the emperor's plan.

392
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,750
Men of some intelligence,
like himself,

393
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,041
are often easier
to read than fools.

394
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,291
So the emperor's plan
is to turn one of us

395
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,250
against the others while
creating an alliance

396
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,166
of human kingdoms
behind Lord Ains' back?

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,833
Then it's doomed to fail,
'cause none of us

398
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,291
would ever betray Lord Ains!

399
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,416
If the Empire's already
planning to betray us

400
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,041
then maybe we should go ahead
and destroy it right now.

401
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,500
No need for that.

402
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,958
Everything that has transpired
has played directly

403
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,291
into our master's great plan.

404
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,958
Isn't that right, my lord?

405
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,541
[AINS]
Yes. Exactly so.

406
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,583
[GUARDIANS gasp]

407
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,625
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains' gaze

408
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,375
is always set to
the distant future.

409
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,041
If not for the hero Momon,

410
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,125
we would've been forced
to rule E-Rantel

411
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,125
through fear and oppression.

412
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,666
The Golden Princess
may have been

413
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,291
of assistance there,
but such a valuable card

414
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,416
is best kept in reserve.

415
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,708
She was just as I imagined
from Sebas' description.

416
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,458
No. She surpassed
my expectations.

417
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,083
I like her.

418
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,208
If that's the case, I'd like
to meet her myself someday.

419
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,458
I think you'll get
the opportunity soon.

420
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,500
Now then. Supreme One.

421
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,750
In accordance with the plan
that you set into motion,

422
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,791
the stage is now set
for our country

423
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,041
to rise and dominate this world.

424
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,750
[AINS]
Yes. Quite.

425
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,083
I think this leaves us
with one final matter

426
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,875
to be decided at present.

427
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,666
A mere king would
be no different

428
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,125
from any of the worms
we're about to conquer.

429
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,208
I humbly suggest
that we come up with

430
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,958
a more befitting title.

431
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,583
[AINS]
Very well. Do as you wish.

432
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,375
Would anybody here care
to make a suggestion?

433
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,250
Why, yes, I have an idea.

434
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,458
In honor of Lord Ains'
perfect form,

435
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,500
I believe we should call
him the King of Beauty!

436
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,250
[AINS]
Huh?

437
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,458
[AURA]
I've got one!

438
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,708
There's no one who's
stronger than Lord Ains,

439
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,666
so why don't we call
him the Muscle King?

440
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,916
[MARE]
Um, m-may I suggest one?

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,041
Lord Ains is very kind, so um...

442
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,208
What if we called him--

443
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,541
I don't know.
The King of Love, maybe?

444
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,750
[DEMIURGE]
Personally,

445
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,833
I believe we should
call him the Wise King.

446
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,666
In honor of his sound judgement.

447
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,416
[MOMONGA]
"Wise King?" So dorky.

448
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,666
[ALBEDO]
Sebas?

449
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,791
[SEBAS] I for one
believe that "King Ains"

450
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,208
would be sufficient.

451
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
[ALBEDO]
And as for my opinion.

452
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,708
Since he's the one
who stands above

453
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,041
all other Supreme Beings,

454
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
why not the Supreme King?

455
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,625
[GUARDIANS]
Ooh!

456
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,750
[ALBEDO]
What are your thoughts, Cocytus?

457
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,125
[COCYTUS] Hm. Lord Ains
is unrivaled in magic.

458
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,708
The people he rules
should know that.

459
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,125
Therefore, I believe
"the Sorcerer King"

460
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,750
would be a fitting
title for him.

461
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,541
[AINS]
Yes. A fine suggestion, Cocytus.

462
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,458
Once our country is established,

463
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:27,750
I shall be known as Ains Ooal
Gown, the Sorcerer King.

464
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,916
[EMPIRE KNIGHT 06A]
My Lord Fluder. I have news.

465
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,916
A pair of Adamantite
class adventurers

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
wish to meet with you.

467
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,000
They're a team that
calls themselves "Darkness."

468
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,791
You're a-a god.

469
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,416
You're truly an entity
of the tenth tier!

470
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,875
I am undeserving. I know this.

471
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,291
But I beg of you, oh great one.
Make me your student!

472
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,291
I want to see the
chasm of magic.

473
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,791
To tug upon the threads
of creation! Show me, please!

474
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,541
[AINS] And in exchange?
What will you give me?

475
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,000
[FLUDER]
Everything!

476
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,250
All that I have is at
your disposal, my lord.

477
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,708
I kneel before you, O' Deep One.

478
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,750
Wise Master of the Chasm!

479
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,458
Your Grace--

480
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,666
It's fine.

481
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,750
[JIRCNIV] We have to be
both clever and swift.

482
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:45,500
This is no petty border dispute,
but a battle to defend mankind.

483
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,958
To protect our future.

484
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,416
[AINS] The Baharuth Empire
formally recognizes Nazarick

485
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,000
as a sovereign country

486
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,875
lead by the Sorcerer
King Ains Ool Gown.

487
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,041
Jirkniv also demands that
E-Rantel and the lands around it

488
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,583
be returned to Nazarick.

489
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,708
When the leaders of the
Re-Estize Kingdom meet

490
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,833
to discuss thier options,
Gazef advises them

491
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,333
to appease me.

492
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,708
Chapter 10:
"Preparation for War."

493
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,958
It's difficult to lead

494
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,875
when those that serve
you are incompetent.
