1
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,166
[AINS] I have gathered you
here to discuss our future.

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,375
Albedo, Overseer of the
Guardians, and Demiurge,

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,666
our greatest strategist.
I would hear your opinions.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,250
[BOTH]
Lord.

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,875
[AINS] Now that we have put
my initial plans into motion,

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,833
tell us what doctrine
you believe Nazarick

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,833
should follow, moving forward.

8
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,750
If anyone else has an opinion,

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,125
you may raise your
hand to speak.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,416
In order to facilitate
our discussion,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,958
I ask that Demiurge explain
our current situation

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,291
in a way that
all can understand.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,083
Begin with our latest operation.

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,541
As you wish.

15
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,000
[MOMONGA sighs] I may be their
leader, but I don't have

16
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,541
much experience in this
whole conquering thing.

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,833
At least this way, I can
pretend I understood the plan.

18
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,791
What I do know is that
Nazarick's survival

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,541
is our first priority.

20
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,291
Second, would be spreading
the name of Ains Ooal Gown

21
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,583
throughout the world.

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,916
Actually, that's
just my priority,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,833
since I wanna find out
if any of my old friends

24
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,708
are trapped here like me.

25
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,416
But that might have
to take a backseat,

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
especially when we still know
so little about this world.

27
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,625
[DEMIURGE] As you've likely
heard, thanks to the efforts

28
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,500
of Mare's group,
we've subjugated

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,958
all the leaders
of Eight Fingers.

30
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,708
As a result, Nazarick now
has complete control

31
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,958
of the Re-Estize underworld.

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,208
[AINS]
Hm?

33
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,708
This brings us closer
to Ains' ultimate goal.

34
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,208
Which you all know
is world domination.

35
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,541
[AINS]
Mm?

36
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,333
Or I should hope you know
if you're not a fool.

37
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,958
[AINS]
Huh?

38
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,708
[MOMONGA]
Wait, so is that where we're at?


39
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,041
World domination?


40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, okay, don't freak out!


41
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,666
You've gotta act like it
was your idea, after all!

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,708
[gasps]

43
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,000
[MOMONGA]
Actually, world domination

44
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,166
might be a good way to
get our name out there.

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,708
Even if we have
a bad reputation,

46
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,833
at least people will
know who we are.

47
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,041
My friends might be a little
surprised with the direction

48
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,666
I'm taking the guild,
but whatever.

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,625
There will be plenty of time
to explain things later

50
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,291
and that's if I find them.

51
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
[AINS]
Hm?

52
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,666
[AINS]
You remembered.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,416
Of course, my lord.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,458
I remember every last word
you relay to me.

55
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,916
You said taking over the
world might be enjoyable.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,458
[AINS]
Yes, I recall the conversation.

57
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,583
I'm pleased to hear it.

58
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,333
[AINS]
From that one time.

59
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,000
None other, my lord.

60
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,666
[MOMONGA]
What time?!

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,208
[AINS] I see. Your impeccable
memory pleases me.

62
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,416
Your praise is too much.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,958
[AINS] But world domination
is a complicated affair.

64
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,625
I must agree, my lord.

65
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,958
[AINS] How do you suppose
we begin our conquest?

66
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,708
I humbly suggest we announce
Nazarick to the public.

67
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,958
[AINS]
Hm?

68
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,541
Since the ones who
controlled Shalltear

69
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,291
are still moving
behind the scenes,

70
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,291
I fear that staying
in the shadows any further

71
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,250
will only encumber us.

72
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,125
[ALBEDO]
That's my opinion as well.

73
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,666
We can hunt them more
effectively in the open.

74
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
Right now, we're
wasting resources

75
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,000
trying to maintain secrecy.

76
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,750
[AINS]
Mm. An appealing proposal.

77
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,708
There is merit in
controlling the kingdom

78
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,958
from the shadows and striking
fear into the hearts

79
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,583
of their leaders, but in
doing so, we may force ourselves

80
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,750
to answer to the whims
of their throne.

81
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,625
That's not a pleasant prospect.

82
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,375
Frankly, I find their
leadership quite lacking.

83
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,125
Save for one individual.

84
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
There are other
concerns as well.

85
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,875
For example, being tied to one
kingdom limits our movements.

86
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,833
If the ones who targeted
Shalltear have more flexibility

87
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,333
than us, we would be
at a disadvantage again.

88
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,375
Therefore, Lord Ains,

89
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
I propose that the
Great Tomb of Nazarick

90
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,125
enter the stage of the world
as an independent nation.

91
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,916
[GUARDIANS murmur]

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,166
It appears this
came as a surprise.

93
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
But I assure you
Lord Ains has been

94
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
thinking of doing this
for a long time.

95
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,083
[GUARDIANS]
Oh!

96
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,708
[MOMONGA]
What?!

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,458
In the end,

98
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,041
I fear my intellect's rather
trifling compared to your own.

99
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,875
I won't pretend to grasp
the depth of your wisdom,

100
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,791
though I do hope my explanation
skims the surface accurately.

101
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,583
[AINS]
No, on the contrary,

102
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,708
you ascertained
my plans perfectly.

103
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,541
I'd expect no less
of my lead strategist.

104
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
[GUARDIANS]
Ah!

105
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,875
Merely observing your actions
made it crystal clear.

106
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,125
Anyone could have reached
the same conclusion.

107
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,000
[AINS]
Yes, I recall my... actions.

108
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,166
I am pleased to hear it.

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,625
[AINS]
From that one time.

110
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,125
None other, my lord.

111
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,541
[MOMONGA]
What time, damn it?!

112
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,375
[AINS] Well, of the
many actions I've taken,

113
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,916
which do you deem
the most relevant

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to our current discussion?

115
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,458
Your accomplishments in
Carne Village come to mind.

116
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,291
[GUARDIANS gasp]

117
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,458
[AINS] I suppose that did
go rather well, didn't it?

118
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,333
At the risk of
sounding sarcastic,

119
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,166
you did subjugate the
village personally, my lord.

120
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,583
There's no way
it wouldn't go well.

121
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,333
I didn't know that
was you, Lord.

122
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,666
That's the human village, right?

123
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,416
Helpless humans our lord could
have eradicated with ease,

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,875
and yet he decided to rule
over them peacefully instead.

125
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,833
You see?

126
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
Lord Ains considered
that village

127
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,416
a sort of testing ground.

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,208
He's had conquest on his
mind long before today.

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,833
[GUARDIANS gasp]

130
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
[AINS]
Ah--

131
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,500
[KAIJALI] I haven't seen
Nphirea yet, boss.

132
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,583
Ya figure he's still sleeping?

133
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,916
[ENRI]
Yeah, maybe.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,625
He was up late working on
his potion last night.

135
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,208
He's missing out on
this nice weather!

136
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,333
So what's for
breakfast today, boss?

137
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,083
[laughs] Well, Kaijali,
thanks to your hard work,

138
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,625
we've got plenty of meat.

139
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,333
So I'll be whipping up
a nice and hearty stew!

140
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,500
Nice arms!

141
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,500
No!

142
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm still scrawny
compared to you.

143
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,458
Sure, but you've
got great definition!

144
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,583
I mean it!

145
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,916
[VILLAGE CHIEF 2A]
Good morning, Enri!

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
[ENRI]
Good morning, chief!

147
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,500
Nice weather, huh?

148
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,958
Mr. Goblin!

149
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,000
Another hard day at work?

150
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
You bet!

151
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,000
Can't leave all that farming to
you and your husband, now can I?

152
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,625
What would we do without you?

153
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,125
I know I've said this before,

154
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,833
but we really can't
thank you goblins enough.

155
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,250
If you weren't here
to lend a hand,

156
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,500
we'd have been forced to
abandon the village long ago.

157
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,375
I see. So we're short
on people, even now?

158
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,541
[VILLAGE CHIEF 2A]
Mm-hm. I'm afraid so.

159
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,625
Thankfully, the survivors
stuck around,

160
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,166
but we haven't been able
to bolster our numbers.

161
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,041
We've got a long way to go.

162
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,208
And the only person that
moved here from the city

163
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,791
is that ex-adventurer,
Miss Britta, right?

164
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
Can't blame them,
but there aren't many people

165
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,666
crazy enough to move to
a dangerous place like this.

166
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
What have I told you
about being negative?

167
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Things will work out eventually.

168
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,375
You say that, but...

169
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,583
You remember what the
government official said.

170
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,416
We'll have lower taxes and
exemption from civil service

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,958
until the village can pull
itself together again.

172
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,833
It's not going to happen
overnight, and that's fine.

173
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,125
She's right. Give it
some time and I'm sure

174
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,166
that people will
want to move here.

175
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,291
We'll keep working hard
in the meantime!

176
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,666
Fair enough.

177
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,458
Lord Gown did go to the
trouble of saving our lives.

178
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,958
The least we can
do is keep living,

179
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
no matter how lean
the times may be.

180
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,541
Agreed! Someday,
I hope to pay him back

181
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,000
for the kindness he showed us.

182
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,708
[KAIJALI]
Wow, that's some smell.

183
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,750
[ENRI]
Sure is.

184
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,958
Nphirea, we're having
breakfast soon.

185
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,625
Bring your grandmother!

186
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,041
Oh, morning, Enri!

187
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,625
You're not going
to believe this!

188
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,000
[ENRI] You're really
worked up! What happened?

189
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,166
A miracle!

190
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,791
Finally, finally I made
a brand new potion

191
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
and it's all my own!

192
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,458
This is going to
be revolutionary!

193
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,875
You know all those
solutions and herbs

194
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,666
I've been gathering lately?

195
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
Well, I finally got
the right proportions

196
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
and the potion turned purple!

197
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,875
Okay!

198
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,000
That's enough of that,
thank you very much.

199
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,250
[NPHIREA, ENRI]
Huh?

200
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,208
You're clearly high off
your own fumes, kiddo.

201
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,750
Don't worry.

202
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,583
You get breakfast going and
we'll catch up with you soon.

203
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,041
'Kay? I'll splash some
cold water over his head

204
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,125
and he'll snap out of it
in no time flat.

205
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,166
Are you sure?

206
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
Trust me on this.

207
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,666
All right, good luck, then!

208
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,541
[NPHIREA giggles]

209
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,833
You've got to pull
it together, brother.

210
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,958
[sighs] Let's be frank.

211
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,583
You're in love with
the boss, right?

212
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,166
Uh--

213
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,333
Mm-hm.

214
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,666
Then show her!

215
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,625
You're givin' all of your
love to those potions!

216
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,333
It's weird.

217
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,333
All right then. I'll try.

218
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,666
Trying ain't gonna
cut it, brother!

219
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,458
Listen, show off your strength
and she'll fall for you.

220
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,333
I'm afraid "strength"
isn't my strong point.

221
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,833
You got strength up here,
so work with that!

222
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,458
Tell you what,
when the time comes

223
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,250
for you to make
your move, I'll pose!

224
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,541
Like this.

225
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,041
That'll be your cue
to talk smart

226
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,166
n' show her those pearly whites.

227
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
This pose, don't forget it.

228
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,125
And if it looks like you
should press your advantage.

229
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,791
I'll hit'cha with this one.

230
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,666
Uh, okay.

231
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,375
[KAIJALI]
Then I'll do this pose!

232
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,041
If that works, this one.
And then this one!

233
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,833
And after that, this!

234
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,541
I'm tellin' you,
add some more salt!

235
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,041
I ain't givin' up till
Miss Enri marries me!

236
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,375
Lay off!

237
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,041
We took a vow not to make
any moves on the boss,

238
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,041
don't you remember?

239
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,916
That's right!

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,166
She's gotta make the first move!

241
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,291
Too bad for you, then.

242
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,625
I'm the leader, so she's gonna

243
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,750
take a fancy to me
before you punks.

244
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,333
You shut your mouth, Jugem!

245
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,708
Who cares if you're strong?

246
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,500
[GOBLIN 2A]
Punch him and see what happens!

247
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,708
[UNLAI laughs]

248
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,166
[ENRI] They certainly
are worked up today.

249
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,750
[NPHIREA] Ruby powder...
Wings of magic...

250
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,666
[ENRI]
Uh. Hey.

251
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,625
And then, stir it up...

252
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,125
Um, Nphi, you all right?

253
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,291
Uh-huh. In fact,
I've never been better.

254
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,625
Grandma is still too
busy working, though.

255
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,208
Soup time.

256
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,958
Sorry, but the
battle's already won.

257
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,750
And I got the proof
right here on my spoon.

258
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,000
Look!

259
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,250
This handsome goblin got
an extra piece of meat!

260
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,500
[GOBLINS gasp]

261
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,333
[KUUNEL]
That's right. I ate my meat

262
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,416
and at the bottom of the bowl,

263
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
there was more meat
waiting for me!

264
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,458
And as you all know,
that's one more piece

265
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,291
than the allotted amount!

266
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,166
In other words,
it must be love!

267
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,333
It's a lie!

268
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,041
You probably broke
one big piece in two!

269
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,708
Also, did anyone here
witness the first piece?

270
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,916
Perhaps it was actually
just a bite of potato

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,166
and you were mistaken.

272
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,625
Enri thinks you're a creep.

273
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,333
You know this deep
in your heart.

274
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,041
Our god asked us to
ensure Enri's happiness.

275
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,916
"Dear lord, please tell
this creep how wrong he is!"

276
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,458
I thought your god was evil.

277
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,041
--Why do they care?
--[splat]

278
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,125
[GOBLINS gasp]

279
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,916
[ENRI gasps]

280
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,833
[ENRI]
Nphi?!

281
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,666
I think I'd better
take him to bed now.

282
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,083
[NEMU] Isn't the guy
supposed to carry the girl?

283
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,791
[KAIJALI] Some things
are better left unsaid.

284
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,083
--[ENRI growls]
--[GOBLINS, NEMO gasp]

285
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,416
[GOBLINS, NEMU laugh nervously]

286
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,333
[ENRI] Jugem and his friends
do more than just

287
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
protect the village from danger.

288
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,125
They've brought smiles
back to our faces.

289
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,125
And for those who
lost everything,

290
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,208
they're like another family.

291
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
After all they've done,

292
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,250
there has to be some way
I can repay their kindness.

293
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,625
All right, everyone.

294
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,541
Are you ready to do this?

295
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,583
[JUGEM]
Aim.

296
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,875
Fire!

297
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,375
[SHURINGAN]
All right, lookin' good!

298
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,291
A fine row of arrows
like that will send

299
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,250
any intruders
packing in no time!

300
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,500
[VILLAGERS laugh, murmur]

301
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,875
Right. Next wave. Line up!

302
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,375
[NEMU]
Hey! Enri, let me help, too!

303
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,125
I'm fine in here, but if
you could take care of that

304
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,833
job I gave you yesterday,
then that would be great.

305
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,791
Aw. Okay.

306
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
[ENRI]
Not a single complaint.

307
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,666
She used to be so spoiled,

308
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,125
but she's been such
a good girl since then.

309
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,333
--[thud]
--[KAIJALI] Hm?

310
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,083
[ENRI panting]

311
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,958
Heard a bang. Are you okay?

312
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,875
Yes, it's nothing.

313
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,083
It seems I was a little
rough on the knife, though.

314
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
You gotta be careful
with stuff like that.

315
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,916
Since there's no
blacksmith way out here,

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,958
no one can fix it
if it gets dinged up.

317
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,541
Ah.

318
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,333
We can't get maintenance done
on any of our weapons, either.

319
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,333
That must be inconvenient.

320
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Yeah, but we manage
somehow! Hah!

321
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,541
[NEMU grunting]

322
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,791
[ENRI] Working hard!
Got it all ground up?

323
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Uh-huh! Did a bunch! All this!

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,875
Oh, wow. I'm so proud of you!

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,250
That smell...
Pretty intense stuff.

326
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,041
It's like Nphi's potions.

327
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,791
It's bad, but not
that bad. Right?

328
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,125
[NEMU]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

329
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,791
What she's making is
something called "Enkaeshi."

330
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,916
It's a specialty of our village.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,416
These herbs can only be
gathered this time of year.

332
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,916
They're potent medicine.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,625
Sounds like this stuff must
be big business for you.

334
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,291
My apologies, Miss Nemu.

335
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,750
[NEMU] Hm! But look. I'm
almost out of the herbs!

336
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,416
I'll be done with these
by the end of the day.

337
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,958
But I think we've
already covered

338
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,958
all the gathering spots
that I know of.

339
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,708
Aw!

340
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,875
[ENRI]
Kyumei.

341
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,833
Hey.

342
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,208
You got a message for us?

343
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,083
[KYUMEI] Yeah. It seems
like something weird

344
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,708
is happening in Tob Forest.

345
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,208
What do you mean?

346
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,500
It can't be.

347
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,583
Are the people who attacked
the village back?

348
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,000
No.

349
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,416
It's like a disturbance coming
from deep in the forest.

350
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,666
That's bad timing,
because we need to gather

351
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,958
those herbs before
it's too late.

352
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,250
Sorry boss, but that's
way too dangerous.

353
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,083
[KYUMEI] I'd like to send
out a scouting party,

354
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
but it might take a while.

355
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,583
We've got our hands full just
watching over the village.

356
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
I need to go out there
in the next few days.

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,458
The herbs aren't in season long

358
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:52,250
and we'll be in a bad spot
if we can't sell more.

359
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,750
Let's bring this to Jugem
and see what he says.

360
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,791
Good. Thank you.

361
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,625
[JUGEM]
All right, here's the plan.

362
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,750
While Miss Enri and her group
are lookin' for herbs,

363
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,041
the rest of us will spread
out and scout the area,

364
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,333
moving deeper into the forest.

365
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,041
[JUGEM] Report back if
you see anything strange.

366
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,166
As for Miss Enri's bodyguards,
let me see here.

367
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,291
--Gokou.
--[GOKOU] Sir!

368
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,416
--Kaijali.
--[KAIJALI] Sir!

369
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,708
--Unlai.
--[UNLAI] Sir!

370
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,625
[JUGEM]
You ready?

371
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,708
[GOKOU, KAIJALI, UNLAI]
Yeah!

372
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,583
I shouldn't need
to tell you this,

373
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,041
but her safety is top priority!

374
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,041
[UNLAI, KAIJALI, GOKOU]
Yes, sir!

375
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,958
Nphi. We're counting
on you, too.

376
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,791
Show the boss what you're
made of out there.

377
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,375
[NPHIREA yelps]

378
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,333
So now's the time, huh?

379
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,125
[clears throat] Leave it to me!

380
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,750
I'll take good care
of you, I promise!

381
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,000
How kind of you. Thanks, Nphi.

382
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,791
Huh? That's not enough?

383
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,833
I've prepared various
alchemical, uh, concoctions.

384
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,125
So don't worry!

385
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,291
Sure. Sounds great.
Not worried at all!

386
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,625
[NPHIREA]
It's Bebeyamok moss.

387
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,041
If you mix a clump or two
of that in healing potions,

388
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,625
it increases their
effectiveness a bit.

389
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
I never had a clue, wow.

390
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,458
So is it worth a lot of money?

391
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,833
Uh, a little.

392
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,250
Although in this case,
the herb Enri

393
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
is looking for
is worth a lot more.

394
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,625
I can come back here
for some moss any time.

395
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,083
[UNLAI]
Roger that!

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,666
[KAIJALI] Wow, Nphi's really
something, huh, Enri?

397
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,250
[GOKOU] I can't tell any
of these plants apart.

398
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,041
All just green to me!

399
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,125
Does that issue apply
to all goblins?

400
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,708
Like your people just
aren't cut out for botany?

401
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,875
Hell if I know, but I
never met a goblin

402
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,458
who was any good with plants.

403
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,000
We're not much for gathering,

404
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,166
but when it comes to hunting
and skinning, we do just fine!

405
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,291
Lots of shade here.

406
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,625
The humidity is
high enough, too.

407
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,083
This is exactly
the kind of place

408
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,708
that those herbs like to grow.

409
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,041
Let's spread out
and look around.

410
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,583
I found some! You were right!

411
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,375
I'm glad we brought you along!

412
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,041
Call it good luck.

413
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,583
Something wrong?

414
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,958
[ENRI] Mm-mm! I'm just
impressed, that's all!

415
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,541
You found the herbs
right away and you know

416
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,000
how to pick them so
much faster than me.

417
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,916
Well, I am a pharmacist.

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,458
I'd better be good
at this stuff.

419
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,583
I guess so.

420
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,416
Thanks anyway, though.

[rustling]

424
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,916
It sounds like there's
something coming our way.

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,916
Better pull back
and hide for now.

426
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,958
Right.

427
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,875

It's a child.

431
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,833
Just watch and wait.

[growls]

436
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,875
[NPHIREA]
It didn't notice us.

437
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,041
I think the smell of the herbs
must be masking our scent.

438
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,250
Keeping you safe
is our first priority.

439
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,250
If the kid gets attacked,
don't run out there to help him.

440
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,458
It may seem cruel,
but that's how it goes.

441
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,083
He's scared.

442
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,166
[sighs] It's okay.
We'll save him.

443
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,208
[ENRI]
Nphi!

444
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,375
All right, let's think.

445
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,208
Why'd he run all the way here?

446
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,166
If he knows what's
happening in the forest,

447
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,666
then he can warn us before
it affects the village.

448
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,583
Assuming we don't all die!

449
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,000
There's no guarantee we can
win against that thing.

450
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,041
I can't fight, so maybe
I have no right to say this,

451
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,833
but if there's a chance
we can help, we should.

452
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,833
If someone is dying and
we turn our backs on them,

453
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,250
in a way, that's no different
than siding with their killer.

454
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,583
I was saved, so I
have to do the same

455

weaker than me.

00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
it may yet recover.
