1
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,708
[ARCHE] The more I look at it,
the stranger it seems.

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
I can't tell what era
these ruins are from

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,666
or what culture built them.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,916
That's a good sign.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,458
It means we're that
much more likely

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,916
to run into something
interesting inside.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,416
Think that's guaranteed.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Although there's also the chance

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,750
that a terrifying
undead lurks in there.

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,083
[ARCHE]
Still. I'm a bit excited.

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,166
[IMINA]
Same here.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,750
I wanna know why
this tomb was built.

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,583
And what kinda person
got buried inside it.

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,583
Yeah.

15
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,791
There's nothin'
quite as exciting

16
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,083
as exploring a total unknown.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,708
What would excite me is
if it were full of money.

18
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,291
[GROUP laughs]

19
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,041
--[HEKKERAN] Yeah, me, too!
--[ARCHE] What?

20
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,666
Well, I'm sure this'll
be our best job yet.

21
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,166
[HEKKERAN] Once the four
teams have signaled


22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,375
that they're in position,
we'll all move in at once.


23
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,791
Each team will explore one
of the smaller mausoleums.

24
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,000
After that, we'll all meet up
at the larger one in the center.

25
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,791
[GRINGHAM]
Good.

26
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,250
[ERYA]
Simple enough.

27
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,916
[PARPATRA]
That works for me.

28
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,583
[THIEF 7A] That was one
short-lived invisibility spell.

29
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,875
It lasted as long
as needed. Now come.

30
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,083
No traps as of yet.

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,791
Continual Light.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,166
And Continual Light.

33
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,166
[GRINGHAM] Hm. I've not
seen such a crest before.

34
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,375
Have any of you?

35
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,916
[CASTER 7A]
No, don't think I have.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,291
[PRIEST 7A] Doesn't look
like a Re-Estize sigil.

37
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,041
[WARRIOR 7A]
Oh, by the way, Gringham.

38
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,541
You can start acting normal now.

39
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,750
There's nobody else around here.

40
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,750
True.

41
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,541
Man, that crap's exhausting!

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,083
I feel so stupid, talking like
some kind of white knight.

43
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,250
[CASTER 7A]
The other groups bought it,

44
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,500
but you can relax
now that it's just us.

45
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,666
Nah, I'd better keep it up.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,791
If I let myself slip
out of character now,

47
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,750
I'll have a hell of a time
getting back into it later.

48
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,791
I always talk like that
when I'm on the job.

49
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,375
Tricks people into thinking
I'm more talented than I am

50
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,000
and worth more money.

51
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,250
[GROUP laughs]

52
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,250
Now then. Into the fray, men.

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,541
[GROUP]
Right!

54
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,291
[THIEF 7A] This banner is
woven from precious metals.

55
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,708
Amazing.

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,416
I bet this would fetch a
pretty good price on its own.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,916
[THIEF 7A]
Should we go ahead and take it?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,375
[GRINGHAM] It's far too unwieldy
to carry through the ruin,

59
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,375
and besides, we haven't
fully explored this room yet.

60
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,458
[BOTH grunting]

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,333
[GROUP gasps]

62
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,166
[GROUP panting]

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,375
Hey, Gringham. What kept you?

64
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,750
My apologies for
making you wait.

65
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,333
We didn't actually decide
on a rendezvous time,

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,666
so you're good.

67
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,166
Tell me.

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,666
Was there treasure in the
mausoleum your team explored?

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
It was chock full of it.

70
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,416
We're excited. Parpatra
says his was, too.

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,750
I'm glad to hear that.

72
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,958
It seems this ruin has
riches enough for all.

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,583
[HEKKERAN] Doesn't look like
we'll have any trouble

74
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,333
accessing the
lower floors, but...

75
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,958
This place reeks of death.

76
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,541
Yeah, that's my worry.

77
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,458
It's a stench I remember from
my time on the Katze Plains.

78
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,875
I have a proposal
for the other teams.

79
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,166
[WORKERS]
Huh?

80
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
I and the rest of
Green Leaf will go back out

81
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,416
and look for any
secret entrances.

82
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,416
I think it's fairly
likely there are

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,166
other ways to get inside.

84
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,416
The elder makes a valid point.

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,958
If providence wills it,

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,875
he may find a safe
passage that leads

87
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,916
directly to the
center of the tomb.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,208
But I must say.

89
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,125
My team will be taking
a loss, so in exchange,

90
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,291
we'd like to have a share
of any treasure you find.

91
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,083
Let's see... About ten percent
from each team should do.

92
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,416
And if there's a route
to the lower levels,

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,083
how about my team takes
the first crack at it?

94
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,833
We have no qualms with that.

95
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,083
Neither do we.

96
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,583
I myself half a minor objection.

97
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,083
Sharing ten percent of my
treasure isn't a problem. But--

98
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,416
Great! I'm glad everyone agrees.

99
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,375
Good luck down there!
And be careful.

100
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,666
Oftentimes, the most valuable
treasures are booby trapped,

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,958
so feel free to
leave them for us!

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,833
Tch.

103
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,166
All right then. I guess
we'd better get to it.

104
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,958
[ARCHE]
Rober.

105
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,958
Do you sense any undead
magic from these corpses?

106
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,583
No. They're not a threat.

107
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,833
Good.

108
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,541
This ruin is like none
I've ever seen before.

109
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,041
I wouldn't be
surprised if the place

110
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,208
was more than 600 years old.

111
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,083
If it's that ancient,
we'll find more than gold.

112
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,958
Can we move this along please?

113
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,083
I don't know about the rest
of you, but personally,

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,500
I would like to hunt
down some monsters.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,708
[WORKERS gasp]

116
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,541
C'mon, is somebody pullin'
our legs, or what?

117
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,500
[THIEF 7A]
These are the tomb's defenders?

118
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,291
[IMINA] They might as well have
sent a swarm of bugs at us.

119
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,750
[WORKERS laugh]

120
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,291
[WARRIOR 7A]
This is too easy!

121
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,166
We could fight these
things blindfolded.

122
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,416
[THIEF 7A]
All right then.

123
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,083
I guess that rules out
the idea that this place

124
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,833
is ruled by some great monster.

125
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,916
Or if it is, then the thing
must be a complete idiot.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,791
I've never felt this
underestimated before.

127
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,250
These foes are beneath me.

128
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,833
Fine. Then I shall strike first.

129
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,125
[grunts]

130
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,375
We must not become careless.

131
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,291
Steel yourselves
for the possibility

132
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,000
of a powerful undead foe.

133
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,041
And push forward with
the greatest care.

134
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,458
[AINS]
So. They've made their entrance.

135
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,875
[LEADER 7A] That they have.
They may be Workers,

136
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,625
but they're our comrades
till the job is finished.

137
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,208
I hope they all
make it back safely.

138
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
Do you think they'll
run into any trouble?

139
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,250
[AINS]
Does death count as trouble?

140
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:34,916
Huh?

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
[AINS]
Oh, uh!

142
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
[AINS clears throat]

143
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,208
[AINS] I mean, they should have
resolve in the face of death.

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,250
These ruins are a new discovery.

145
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,708
Who knows what lurks within?

146
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,583
It's important to balance
hope with pragmatism.

147
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,583
Oh, I see what you mean now.

148
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,458
Thank you for the
sage advice, sir.

149
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,833
[AINS]
Of course.

150
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,458
Now if you're taking the
first watch, I should rest.

151
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,708
Right! Take all the
time you'd like.

152
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:08,000
[AINS sighs]
All right, Nabe. No, Narberal.

153
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,416
I shall return to Nazarick now.

154
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll send Pandora's
Actor in my place.

155
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,541
I trust you to handle
any problems here.

156
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you, my lord.
I won't fail.

157
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,708
[AINS]
Then, I leave it to you.

158
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,750
[NABE]
Right.

159
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,875
Greetings, my lord.
Welcome home.

160
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,041
[AINS]
It's good to be back.

161
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,041
The intruders should
be entering now,

162
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
just as we planned.

163
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,791
Are we fully prepared
to welcome them?

164
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
Everything is ready, sire.

165
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm certain that
our guests will enjoy

166
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,375
what we have in store for them.

167
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,166
[AINS]
Very good.

168
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,833
I look forward to seeing
your hospitality at work.

169
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,875
You can watch from here.

170
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,708
[AINS]
Hm. And so it begins.

171
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,500
Don't even let one of
them leave unscathed.

172
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
[ALBEDO]
As you say, my lord.

173
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,250
For the crime of entering
the Supreme Being's abode,

174
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,250
these imbecilic thieves
must be punished

175
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,833
in the harshest of ways.

176
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,458
Also, before they're
all torn to bits.

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,333
Have you chosen which
group you'd like to use

178
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,583
as rodents for the
testing of the sword?

179
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,708
[AINS]
Ah, yes.

180
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,916
[HEKKERAN]
Whelp.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,208
This job's goin' a lot
smoother than expected.

182
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,041
That first encounter
was almost too easy.

183
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,416
Shh.

184
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,750
[HEKKERAN]
That's a bother.

185
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,916
[ARCHE] Two of those
skeletons are mages.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,416
They can use first tier magic.

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,000
If we don't take them out fast,
they could be a problem.

188
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,916
But skeletons are tough
to snipe with arrows.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,916
Let me handle this.

190
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,333
Now. Turn Undead!

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,208
Nice work. You took 'em all out!

192
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,583
[THIEF 7B]
I feel like we're gonna lose out

193
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,958
on a lot of treasure.

194
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,541
We're getting priority
on tomorrow's foray,

195
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,583
so it won't be a
complete loss for us.

196
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,375
Besides, if you ask me,
it's dangerous

197
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,375
to be the first group to
explore an unknown dungeon.

198
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,083
Best to let someone
else take that risk.

199
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,250
That's a very
pragmatic approach.

200
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,416
[PARPATRA]
Hm?

201
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,000
Well then. So much for that.

202
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
What do you think
we should do now?

203
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,333
They don't outnumber us.

204
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe we can manage.

205
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,750
Gotta say, with the
shape this tomb's in,

206
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,916
these maids have
really been slacking.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,875
[GUARDIANS growl]

208
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,000
[PRIEST 7B, WARRIOR 7B gasp]

209
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,625
[ENTOMA]
We should kill them.

210
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,000
They need to die.

211
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,125
It isn't enough
to simply kill them.

212
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,125
We should do it in the most
painful way imaginable.

213
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,458
[YURI]
Yes. Yes.

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,500
We planned to kill them
from the start, remember?

215
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,291
Though I am pleased to see
everyone so motivated.

216
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,750
[WORKERS gasp]

217
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
[YURI]
Gentlemen.

218
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,083
I'm afraid circumstances
prevent us from being able

219
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,041
to butcher you with
our own hands.

220
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,625
Which is a shame.

221
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,666
Allow me to introduce the foe
you'll be facing in our stead.

222
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,208
Nazarick Old Guard,
arise. To war.

223
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,625
Say what?

224
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
A pincer attack?

225
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,791
No. It looks like they truly
plan to stay out of it.

226
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,083
[armor clinking]

227
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,416
[gasps]

228
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,208
[THIEF 7B]
Magic weapons.

229
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,250
Isn't this an honor.
To think you'd

230
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
summon so many mighty
undead just for us.

231
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
Tough break.

232
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,500
It would appear that
we've encountered

233
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,500
the most powerful
beings in the ruin.

234
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,041
Seems I'm right.

235
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,208
Which means that, unfortunately,

236
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
my efforts to avoid danger
have put us in the thick of it.

237
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,291
So why don't we just run for it?

238
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,333
Look at those things.
They'll tear us apart.

239
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,125
We lost any chance of escape

240
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,208
as soon as they pincered
us. Push forward.

241
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,166
Yes, I suppose that is
the best chance you have.

242
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,291
Best of luck, gentlemen.

243
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,500
All right. Please begin.

244
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,583
[swords clanging]

245
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,583
Wow, they're bad.

246
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,958
I thought they would
put up more of a fight.

247
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,416
Lord Cocytus thought
the same thing.

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,125
[PARPATRA grunts]

249
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,416
[ENTOMA] I'd hoped we'd get
to see at least a bit of a show

250
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,666
before they died.

251
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,916
[WARRIOR 7B grunts, groans]

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,958
[LUPISREGINA]
Uh-oh.

253
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,125
He's a goner. No dodgin' that.

254
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,916
[WARRIOR 7B groans]

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,500
[YURI]
You'd best get to work, Priest.

256
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,083
Can't you see that your warrior
needs healing right now?

257
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,583
[CZ]
He's already dead.

258
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,750
Which means their party's
frontline has been destroyed.

259
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,083
[groans]

260
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,666
What the hell is this?

261
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,875
[THIEF 7A groans]

262
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,875
[ENTOMA] Oh. Their thief
has gone down, too.

263
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,250
Seems like the
battle's been decided.

264
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,000
[yells]

265
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
[ENTOMA]
He looks delicious.

266
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,916
Restrain yourself.

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,833
Remember, our instructions
are to take the ones

268
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,416
who are no longer able
to fight as prisoners.

269
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,208
[PARPATRA screams]

270
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,500
Right. Heal whoever's
still breathing

271
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,541
and send them to
the torture chamber.

272
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,000
As for the dead:

273
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,958
I'll include them in
my report to Lord Ains.

274
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,333
There's no way we can
beat those monsters!

275
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,791
God's blessings can only
protect us from so much evil!

276
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,958
Have we gained any ground yet?

277
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,083
No! They're still
right on our tails!

278
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,208
[THIEF 7A]
Damn it!

279
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,000
[THIEF 7A]
Hey! I found a door!

280
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,291
[WARRIOR 7A]
This piece of shit tomb!

281
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,000
[BOTH gasp]

282
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,291
[GRINGHAM]
Anyone here?

283
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,125
[THIEF 7A]
Yeah, I am.

284
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,583
[GRINGHAM]
Where are the others?

285
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,875
[THIEF 7A] What the hell
happened back there?

286
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,083
[GRINGHAM]
We got teleported.

287
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,791
C'mon, let's ditch this
place while we can.

288
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
[crunch]

289
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,083
[KYOUHUKOU] That window
of opportunity has passed.

290
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,416
[GRINGHAM]
Who's there?

291
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,958
[KYOUHUKOU]
I am known as Kyouhukou.

292
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:56,000
It is I who guards this area
by decree of Lord Ains.

293
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,083
[THIEF 7A, GRINGHAM gasp]

294
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,083
What the hell are you?

295
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,750
[KYOUHUKOU] Hm. Shall I
introduce myself once again?

296
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,666
No, please forgive me.
I misspoke.

297
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,583
I'll be blunt. I'd
like to make a deal.

298
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,958
I-If you would but release
us from this place,

299
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:12,958
we'd be willing to give you

300
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,125
anything you ask
for in exchange.

301
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,416
[KYOUHUKOU]
Oh. A trade.

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,333
I am most thankful,
but if we're being blunt

303
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,833
then I should confess
my reservations.

304
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,083
"Thankful"?

305
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
[KYOUHUKOU] The problem
is that what I desire

306
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,791
is already in my possession,
and I quite doubt

307
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,083
that you can offer me
something better.

308
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,708
[BOTH gasp]

309
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,208
[KYOUHUKOU] I am thankful for
you because my family and I

310
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,291
have grown weary of cannibalism,
and your arrival here

311
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,541
means that, for the
first time in many years,

312
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,333
we can enjoy a civilized meal.

313
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,666
[yelps]

314
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,083
[KYOUHUKOU] It's a shame that
there aren't more of you.

315
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,583
Please do your best
to nourish my family.

[BOTH yell]

317
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,416
No, damn it, no!
I don't wanna die here!

318
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
[KYOUHUKOU]
You're a spirited one.

319
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,750
Lend my children your strength.

[WARRIOR 7A yelps]

324
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,583
[NEURONIST] I'd ask if you slept
well, but what's the point?

325
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,958
[NEURONIST] You seem to be
stiffening up everywhere

326
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,875
except the part
that counts, dear.

[WARRIOR 7A yelping]

328
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,666
[NEURONIST]
Anyway.

329
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,416
As you might've noticed,
you've been captured.

330
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,625
This is the Great
Tomb of Nazarick.

331
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,375
The illustrious home of the last

332
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,083
of the 41 Supreme
Beings. Lord Momo--!

333
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, um. I meant
to say, Lord Ains.

334
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,958
But let me tell you,
he's a great leader

335
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,083
and a wonderful man.

336
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,458
[WARRIOR 7A whimpers]

337
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,125
He's just incredible!

338
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,333
Say, you can keep
a secret, can't you?

339
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,833
All right, then
between you and me,

340
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,958
if he were to call me to
his bed, I wouldn't mind

341
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,458
letting him be the first
to taste this cookie.

342
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,166
That stupid brat Shalltear,

343
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,916
and the piss-ugly
overseer Albedo

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,125
are both aiming
for his heart, too.

345
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,750
But I'm much more attractive
than either of them.

346
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,083
You agree, don't you, darling?

347
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,208
[WARRIOR 7A whimpers]

348
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,750
Oh, yeah. Right.

349
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,500
My name is Neuronist and I'm
the Great Tomb of Nazarick's

350
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,583
Special Intelligence Collector.

351
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,833
Though, there are those
who call me a torturer.

352
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,083
[WARRIOR 7A whimpers]

353
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,541
The supreme one who brought me

354
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,083
into existence suffered from
an excruciating condition

355
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,833
known as "kidney stones."

356
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,625
So to honor their suffering,

357
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,708
I thought we might start
with this little toy of mine.

358
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,416
[WARRIOR 7A yelping, whimpering]

359
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,791
[NEURONIST] We'll be spending
a great deal of time together.

360
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,708
If you're crying about
this little thing,

361
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,875
then wait till you
see what's next.

362
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,041
[WARRIOR 7A screams]

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,958
Why have you stopped walking?

364
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,208
Move on, or else.

365
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,416
[gasps] I'm sorry, but...
I hear something.

366
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,750
--Interesting.
--[swords clanging]

367
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,208
--[swords clanging]

368
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,333
Finally come to
face me you have,

369
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,791
foolish intruder.

370
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,208
And you are?

371
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,208
[HAMUSUKE] Someone instructed
to greet the intruders

372
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,125
with tail and fang, I am.

373
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,291
To see if my training has
been successful this is.

374
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,291
But slaying you I doubt
will prove much.

375
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,416
What kind of a
magic beast is that?

376
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,875
My apologies, Master,

377
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,666
but I've never seen
such a creature.

378
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,166
Tch. You worthless imbecile.

379
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,166
Now then.

380
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,791
Told I've been,
it's not a problem

381
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,416
if I should slay you
in this duel of ours.

382
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,041
So to the death
this fight will be!

383
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,291
Oh.

384
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,916
The others you see have
come only to observe

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,458
and score our battle.

386
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,166
So rest assured that interfere
in our fight they shall not.

387
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,500
Ill-equipped for battle
those elves seem.

388
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,250
Shall I wait while they prepare?

389
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,958
[ERYA]
There's no need for that.

390
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,708
I'll face you alone.

391
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,666
Then to meet your god, prepare.

392
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,125
Hamusuke I am called.

393
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,500
Declare your name
as well, warrior.

394
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,333
I see no point in
telling a beast my name.

395
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,250
[HAMUSUKE]
If to give your name you refuse,

396
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,291
then erase you from
memory I shall.

397
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,291
For die here you will
as a nameless fool!

398
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,791
Now. Martial Art Shukuchi Kai.

399
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,708
[ERYA yells]

400
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,708
You damn rodent!

401
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,666
Fine. Ability boost.

402
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,416
And then Greater Ability Boost!

403
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,750
Huh.

404
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,875
Keep at a distance until
I understand the abilities

405
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,083
of my opponent,
I think they said.

406
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,208
But also, as a warrior,
I was told to fight,

407
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,291
and warriors must be brave.

408
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,541
Close combat it shall be.

409
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,791
Strike me down
if you can, human.

410
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,833
Don't underestimate me!

411
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,375
So close!

412
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,541
[ERYA grunts]

413
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,291
--[HAMUSUKE] As expected.
--[ERYA] You idiots!

414
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,875
[HAMUSUKE]
A match for my tail you are not.

415
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,583
Do something!
Cast a healing spell!

416
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,041
Don't just stand there,
get on with it!

417
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,583
Can't you see I'm injured?

418
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,208
Middle Cure Wounds.

419
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,375
[ERYA] Not enough. Cast
enhancement magic on me.

420
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,666
All of you!

421
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,291
There's a massive difference
in physical strength

422
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,291
between humans and magic beasts.

423
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,541
But with this, I can
bridge the gap.

424
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,083
Mind I would not if you
chose to attack as a team,

425
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,666
for a better challenge
you might then provide.

426
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,458
Far from your grasp is victory,

427
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,416
but should you fight
together, we could have

428
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,833
a praise-worthy battle.

429
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,875
[growls] Shukuchi Kai!

430
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,166
[HAMUSUKE]
Slashing Strike!

431
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,416
[grunts]

432
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,416
[screams]

433
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,041
You! Heal me! Do it!

434
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,708
[ALL giggle]

435
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,958
Why? Are you--?

436
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,500
Find enjoyment in the
suffering of others I do not,

437
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,333
so end this now I shall.

438
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,041
--Huh?
--[HAMSUKE] Bye.

439
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,166
Master Zaryusu, did
you see what I did?

440
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,541
Indeed, I saw.

441
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,833
Slashing Strike. Good.
You used a martial art.

442
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,875
Most excited to hear that I am,

443
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,833
and continue to train until I
become Warrior Hamusuke I shall.

444
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,958
[ZARYUSU]
Hm?

445
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,500
What are they doing?
Strange it seems.

446
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,166
Is that how elves
mourn their dead?

447
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,166
[ZARYUSU]
Don't know.

448
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,875
[IMINA]
How'd we get here?

449
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,750
I guess that was a magic
trap we stepped on?

450
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,250
[HEKKERAN]
All I remember is the ground

451
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,708
lighting up beneath our feet.

452
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,208
This place seems different
from the others.

453
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,458
[ARCHE]
I know of a similar building.

454
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,500
The Empire's colosseum.

455
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,041
Yeah. This is pretty similar.

456
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,583
So would that lead to the arena?

457
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,875
[HEKKERAN]
Looks right.

458
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,958
And if we were teleported here,

459
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,125
that can only mean one thing.

460
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,208
What?

461
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,625
We were teleported
to the surface.

462
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,791
Good. Then let's escape with
Fly Magic while we ca--

463
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,208
[AURA yells]

464
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,041
Our challengers tonight
are a band of four

465
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,583
foolish human adventurers
that dared to infiltrate

466
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,791
the Great Tomb of Nazarick!

467
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,291
And against them,
we have the Supreme One.

468
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,166
He's the illustrious overlord
of the Great Tomb of Nazarick!

469
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,625
The King of Death itself.

470
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:48,541
His name is Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

471
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,583
[AINS] Every second these
thieves draw breath,

472
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,458
they defile Nazarick
with their mortal taint.

473
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,833
I should erase their every atom,

474
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,833
but when life gives
you test subjects,

475
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,416
you find ways to experiment.

476
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,166
Wait. Thier leader, Hekkeran,
claims he recieved

477
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,000
permission to come here.

478
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,291
Did he speak with
one of my comrads?

479
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,500
No... That's impossible.

480
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,000
Chapter 8: "A Handful of Hope."

481
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,208
You will atone for your
arrogance with death!
