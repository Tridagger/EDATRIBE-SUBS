1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,541
[AINS]
Lupisregina.

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,041
Do you have any idea
why I called for you?

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,000
No.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,833
[AINS]
Hm. Tell me.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,625
Have you heard about
the movements being made

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,041
by the monsters known
as the Giant of the East

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,166
and the Demon Snake of the West?

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,666
I have, but,

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,583
I didn't believe it worth
reporting to the Supreme One.

10
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,458
[AINS sighs]
So you knew?

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,875
--I did, but as I--
--[AINS] You fool!

12
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,708
[AINS] Why did you not
report it at once?

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,208
Was it your aim to
conceal the information?

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,166
No, I promise you!

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,791
I simply thought it was
beneath your notice.

16
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,291
[AINS] No more excuses.
I am disappointed in you.

17
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,666
[MOMONGA] She failed
at basic communication.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,666
That's completely unacceptable.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,791
Wait.

20
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,208
[AINS]
Lupisregina.

21
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,416
I'm curious.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,958
Do you understand
why Carne Village

23
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,958
is valuable to Nazarick?

24
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,250
Well, yes.

25
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,500
You've used it previously
for experimentation.

26
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,916
And, um, there are lots
of fun toys there.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,833
[AINS]
Ah, I see. My apologies.

28
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,958
The mistake here was mine.

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,458
I did not realize you thought
so little of the place.

30
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,208
Allow me to take back my words.

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,000
I should have not
called you a fool.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,833
Forgive me.

33
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,375
Please say no more, my lord.

34
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,333
It was my fault
for being stupid.

35
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,666
[AINS]
Very well.

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,291
Now you know to be more
insightful in the future.

37
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,416
In the meantime, I will tell you
why that village is important.

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,500
[AINS] Carne Village has
some valuable inhabitants.


39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,291
In particular, Nphirea
and his grandmother.


40
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,375
The two of them are in
the process of developing

41
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,250
a new potion for me.

42
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,333
[gasps] Right, I forgot!

43
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,875
Here. I was supposed to
give this to you, Lord Ains.

44
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,041
[AINS]
Oh?

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,125
A potion! A new one
Nphirea created

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,250
and asked me to pass on to you.

47
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,750
[AINS]
Excellent.

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,375
This potion is a prime
example of why Nphirea

49
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,958
and his grandmother
are so important.

50
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,166
[gasps]

51
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,875
[AINS] The potions of
this world are blue,

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,291
and, no matter how high
their quality may be,

53
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,708
they deteriorate over time.

54
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,750
By contrast, the potion
I know from Yggdrasil is red

55
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,625
and does not spoil.

56
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,708
[AINS] Nphirea is currently
trying to develop a potion

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,625
with similar properties
that does not rely

58
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,500
on any items or skills
from Yggdrasil.

59
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,583
However, the discovery
of a completely

60
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:05,625
different potion is certainly
an acceptable outcome, as well.

61
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,458
He is valuable enough
that I would have loved

62
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,041
to imprison him in
Nazarick and have him

63
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,833
perform his research here.

64
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,375
After all, knowledge is power.

65
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,166
Then, Lord, why not
do precisely that?

66
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,708
[AINS] Because earning his
trust and using his gratitude

67
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,541
to chain him will bring us
greater gain in the long term

68
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,125
than forcing him to
labor for us would.

69
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,583
I'm afraid there's
still one thing

70
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,250
I am too foolish and
ignorant to understand.

71
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,250
Forgive me for asking,
but why did you give

72
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,208
a red Yggdrasil potion
to the Britta woman

73
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,833
if they're so valuable?

74
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,166
[AINS]
Britta?

75
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,541
[MOMONGA]
Oh, right.

76
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,166
What do you mean? Explain.

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,500
Well, um...

78
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,041
Narberal's actually the
one who told me about it.

79
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,875
The incident she's referring
to occurred in E-Rantel.

80
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:52,041
Lord Ains gave a red potion
to an adventurer named Britta.

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,000
[AINS laughs]

82
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,083
[AINS] I'll admit,
it was a dangerous move.

83
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,541
However, the risk was
more than worth it

84
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,666
given what I stood to gain.

85
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,041
But... my lord.

86
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,500
I'd thought you
were acting simply

87
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,500
to replace that woman's potion.

88
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,166
[AINS] Did you truly
believe my motivation

89
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,958
would be so pedestrian?

90
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,000
[gasps] Of course
not--I'm sorry!

91
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,208
[AINS]
Nphirea.

92
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't understand.
What about him, Lord?

93
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,291
[AINS]
Consider this.

94
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,250
When a person receives
a potion that they've

95
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,583
never seen before, what are
they most likely to do?

96
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,916
Oh, I know that one!

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,875
They'll ask somebody
for advice about it.

98
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,166
[AINS]
Correct!

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,541
As I had foreseen,
she went to the most skilled

100
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,375
and trusted potion maker
she knew, did she not?

101
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,708
And what happened as a result?

102
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,875
I came into contact
with Nphirea.

103
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,291
So that's why! I see now!

104
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,750
[AINS]
At last, you understand.

105
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,791
[MOMONGA]
They totally bought it!

106
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
That was such a
brilliant plan, Lord Ains!

107
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,041
Is that how you always
decide what to do--

108
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,791
by thinking three steps
ahead of everybody else?

109
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,291
[AINS]
Of course.

110
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,416
After all, I am the ruler of
the Great Tomb of Nazarick,

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,333
Ains Ooal Gown!

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,833
[AINS]
Lupisregina.

113
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,375
[gasps]

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,750
[AINS] The most important person
in that village is Nphirea.

115
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,583
Directly behind him
in value is Enri Emmot,

116
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,458
as his love for her is a
tether that keeps him there.

117
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,958
Last is Nphirea's
grandmother, Lizzy.

118
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,666
The others are
of no consequence,

119
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,583
but you must protect those
three at all cost.

120
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,666
[LUPISREGINA]
Right!

121
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,083
[AINS]
Now that you know my plans,

122
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,125
you won't make the
same mistake again.

123
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,583
Failure is unacceptable.
Understood?

124
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,625
Yes, my lord!

125
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,541
[AINS]
Good. Now go.

126
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,291
Do your duty and
don't disappoint me.

127
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,000
[LUPISREGINA]
Lord!

128
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,250
[NARBERAL]
Farewell, my lord.

129
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,791
[LUPISREGINA squeals]
Lord Ains is freaking amazing!

130
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,750
[NARBERAL]
Be quiet.

131
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,083
--[slap]
--[LUPISREGINA yelps]

132
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,416
Truly, Master.

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,708
You are amazing, but must
she behave like that?

134
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,916
It's embarrassing.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,291
[AINS]
Let it go.

136
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,750
Aura, what do you know
about the Giant of the East

137
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,833
and the Demon Snake of the West?

138
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,583
My lord. I'm sorry,
but I know nothing.

139
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,791
I don't have any
information on monsters

140
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,333
called by those names.

141
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
I mean, I pretty much
combed those woods

142
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,125
for powerful enemies, but
everything there seemed weak.

143
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,000
[AINS] Something of Hamusuke's
level can hardly

144
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,083
be considered strong.

145
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,000
They would have
been easy to miss.

146
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,916
[AURA]
Shall I take care of them?

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,541
I'd be more than happy to.

148
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,541
If I send in a few of
my pets, it'll be easy!

149
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,083
[AINS]
Easy, perhaps, but boring.

150
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,791
I would like to see
the Giant of the East

151
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,583
and Demon Snake of
the West for myself.

152
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,291
And perhaps we can create
a test for Lupisregina

153
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,958
at the same time.

154
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,416
Huh?

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,625
[AURA]
We should be reaching the lair

156
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,458
of the Giant of the East
before much longer.

157
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,625
[AINS]
All right.

158
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,791
So, my lord.

159
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
Have you decided yet
how we shall dispose

160
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,125
of these creatures who
were foolish enough

161
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,833
to go against your wishes?

162
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,583
[AINS] Let us try
talking to them first.

163
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,833
[AURA]
Huh?

164
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,541
[AINS] If the Giant of
the East and Demon Snake

165
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,708
of the West are monsters that
did not exist in Yggdrasil,

166
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,375
I'd like to capture them.

167
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,333
Your kindness always
amazes me, Master.

168
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,750
[AINS]
It does?

169
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,583
However it might appear, Aura,
the truth is that I am

170
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,875
only kind to those
who are worthy of it.

171
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,916
Or those who are from
Nazarick, of course.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,708
When it comes to
beings like Hamusuke,

173
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,666
I merely believe they
may have some worth

174
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,708
and so should not be wasted.

175
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,916
Seize every golden opportunity.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,916
I hadn't realized Hamusuke
was really that valuable.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,041
[AINS]
He is.

178
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,041
He has been a very
useful test subject.

179
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,625
[AURA] Are you talking
about the training

180
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,875
with the Lizard Men?

181
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,125
[AINS]
Yes.

182
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,000
I have him doing some
specialized conditioning

183
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,333
with a Death Knight.

184
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,375
I wish to find out if
they're capable of gaining

185
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,208
new skills or changing classes.

186
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,125
[MOMONGA] It's a long shot,
but if the Death Knight

187
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,375
could become a true warrior
class and learn martial arts,

188
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,291
it would greatly increase
Nazarick's power.

189
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,166
Still, it probably
won't be possible,

190
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,083
and I'm not sure about Hamusuke.

191
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,833
If we only had another
for comparison...

192
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,708
[AINS]
Ah.

193
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,250
Lord Ains, is something wrong?

194
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
[AINS]
Hm? No, it's nothing.

195
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,791
I was just lost in thought.
There's no need to worry.

196
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,416
That's good!

197
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,333
[MOMONGA]
She's so skinny.

198
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,500
Do kids just look smaller
now that my hands are so big?

199
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,958
[AURA yelps] What is it?
Did you need something?

200
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,833
[AINS] I was just thinking that
your waist is quite small.

201
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,208
Are you eating properly?

202
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,333
Yes. I am. Three meals a day.

203
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,250
On a regular schedule,
just as you instructed.

204
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,208
[AINS] Very good. Make sure
you continue to do so.

205
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,083
Right! I'll eat well
and fill out enough

206
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,541
to make old Shalltear blush!

207
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,375
[AINS] I suppose all of you
are bound to form

208
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,750
romantic attachments eventually.

209
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,083
Well, maybe, but it's still
way too early for me.

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,666
I'm only 70 years
old, after all.

211
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,333
[AINS]
Seventy? Oh, yes.

212
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,208
For a dark elf, that means
you're still only a child.

213
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,416
[AINS] So, tell me,
Aura, is there anyone

214
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,375
in Nazarick you like?
Do you have a "type"?

215
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,958
I love you the best out
of everybody, of course!

216
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,625
[AINS laughs]
That makes me happy.

217
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,041
Will you tell me yours now?

218
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,583
Who do you love
the most, Lord Ains?

219
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,875
[AINS]
Hm? I love you, too, Aura.

220
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,333
[gasps]

221
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,083
[MOMONGA] So, the children
are developing emotionally.

222
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,333
If there's a school for dark
elves, perhaps I should

223
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,583
consider sending
Aura and Mare there?

224
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,250
[AURA]
Um. Lord Ains!

225
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,708
[AINS]
Hm?

226
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
What's wrong?
That was quite loud.

227
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,666
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

228
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,625
[AINS]
There is no need to apologize.

229
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,041
Now, then. I've been
thinking about your future.

230
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,833
You have? Really?

231
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,458
[AINS] If ever we find a
dark elf colony or country,

232
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,125
let's visit it together.

233
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,000
What? Oh, of course.

234
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,791
That kind of future, yeah.

235
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,208
Absolutely. I'd be happy
to accompany you.

236
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,666
For right now, though.

237
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,375
We've almost reached
our destination.

238
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,750
[AINS]
All right.

239
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,208
Will you have the creatures
you brought along

240
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,208
stand at the ready nearby?

241
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:52,875
Yes!

242
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,250
Okay. Go, everyone!

243
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,041
[AINS]
This is laughable.

244
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,500
It seems they tried to copy
what you were building

245
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,458
with pathetic results.

246
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,625
Okay, here we are.

247
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,791
That should be their
nest up there.

248
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,750
[AINS] There are no
guards. How careless.

249
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,625
[AURA]
Smells terrible in here.

250
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,250
[AINS]
A gas trap maybe?

251
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,291
No, it could just as
easily be coincidence.

252
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,000
A bunch of footprints.

253
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,416
Judging by these,
I would say that

254
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,666
multiple creatures live here.

255
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,958
[AINS] Clearly, we can't expect
much intelligence from them.

256
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,583
I hope we can at least converse.

257
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:46,250
[OGRES growling, munching]

258
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,708
[AINS]
If I could have your attention.

259
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,625
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

260
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,333
[OGRES roar]

261
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,416
[AINS] As a welcoming committee,
they leave much to be desired.

262
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,250
[OGRE 04A]
Skeleton!

263
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,708
[OGRE 04B]
Skeleton! Enemy!

264
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,416
[AINS]
Aura, stand back.

265
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
[yells]

266
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,333
[AINS]
How filthy!

267
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,708
You not normal skeleton.

268
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,958
[AINS] Kindly refrain
from calling me that.

269
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,083
I am here to see your leader,
the Giant of the East.

270
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,625
Go. Inform him.

271
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,875
[AINS]
Well, I guess I could just wait.

272
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,750
Drat. I may have
overreacted a bit.

273
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,458
But its hand was just so dirty.

274
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,041
It was understandable.

275
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,166
A vile ogre tried to touch you.

276
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,083
You couldn't allow
that indignity!

277
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,500
[AINS]
That's reassuring, thank you.

278
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,083
You know, Punitto Moe once said,
"There are worse ideas

279
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,708
than punching people to
make them listen to you."

280
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,625
Or perhaps it was
Warrior Takemikazuchi?

281
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,000
[AURA]
Well, that settles it, then.

282
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,208
If the Supreme Beings
say so, it must be true.

283
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,291
[MOMONGA]
I don't know if those two

284
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,458
are the best examples.

285
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,541
[rumbling]

286
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,500
[AINS]
A troll.

287
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,625
So, "giant" is a bit of
a stretch in this case.

288
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,541
Although it isn't
a complete lie.

289
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,583
Is he similar in
strength to Hamusuke?

290
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,041
I believe they're
comparable, Lord Ains.

291
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,458
[AINS]
You are the Giant of the East?

292
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,125
In that case, I hope I am
correct in assuming you

293
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,916
are the Demon Snake of the West.

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,041
Yes. I'm referring to you,

295
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,833
the one hiding behind
an invisibility spell.

296
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,916
Concealing yourself
is pointless.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,875
You may as well answer.

298
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,000
[AINS]
I see. You're a naga.

299
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
A type of snake,
I'll grant you that.

300
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,250
Still, the description
was misleading.

301
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,666
If you saw through my
invisibility so easily,

302
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,500
you're no normal skele--

303
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,125
Skeleton, why are you here?

304
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,750
[AINS]
I am not a skeleton.

305
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,500
Yet another
inaccurate description

306
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,750
I must see corrected.

307
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
Well, then, what are you?

308
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,458
Guu, the mighty ruler, feared
throughout the eastern forest,

309
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,291
will allow you to say your name.

310
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,375
[AURA, AINS]
Guu?

311
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,750
[AINS]
What an... interesting name.

312
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,125
Apologies for the
late introduction.

313
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,958
I should return the favor.

314
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,375
My name is Ains Ooal Gown.

315
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,583
[MONSTERS]
Huh?

316
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:26,041
[MONSTERS laugh]

317
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:30,791
Unlike me with my powerful name,
you have the name of a coward.

318
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,916
--Cowa--?!
--[AINS] Easy. Stay calm.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,875
Please, mysterious undead.

320
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,541
These creatures believe long
names signify a lack of courage.

321
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,958
[AINS]
And what about you?

322
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,500
Do you believe me
to be a coward as well?

323
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,333
I don't think as they do.

324
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,541
I have a long name,
too, you see.

325
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,125
I am what you call the
Demon Snake of the West.

326
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,541
My name is Ryraryus
Spenia Ai Indarun.

327
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,208
So what business do you
have with us, weakling?

328
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,208
[AINS] I have ordered a
stronghold to be constructed

329
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,583
in the center of the forest
using golems and undead.

330
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,333
Do you know of it?

331
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,625
Of course I know, intruder!

332
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,083
If it weren't for this
gutless snake's whining,

333
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,625
we would have gone over there
and killed you already.

334
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,125
Now it looks like you
saved us the trouble.

335
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,000
[AINS]
Yes, so it would seem.

336
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,333
Which brings me to
the purpose of my visit.

337
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,333
I've come here because I would
like to negotiate with you.

338
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,125
If you wish to live,
submit yourselves to me.

339
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,708
As if I, the mighty
Guu would ever submit

340
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,791
to a poorly named weakling.

341
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,666
Guu! Be careful what you say.

342
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,500
I think first, I'll
make a meal of you.

343
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,750
Then I'll move on to

344
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,791
--the small one for dessert.
--[AINS laughs]

345
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,125
[AINS] You howl more than
a dog, you sack of flesh.

346
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,250
What was that?

347
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,750
[AINS]
I propose a duel.

348
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,333
Surely you, with your strong
name and boundless courage,

349
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,958
would be willing to
face one you believe

350
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,708
weak and cowardly.

351
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,500
If you're scared, however,

352
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,625
now is your chance to run.

353
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,125
I'll duel you, and there
will be nothing left

354
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,750
by the time I'm finished.

355
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:05,125
[AINS] Very well. Then let's
not waste any more time.

356
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,583
[GUU yells]

357
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,750
[GUU]
Huh?

358
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,250
[AINS]
Something wrong with your sword?

359
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,416
[BLUE TROLL 04A groans]

360
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,916
[AINS] Ah, yes. Trolls
can heal themselves.

361
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,958
[GUU cackles]

362
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,250
[AINS] The strong hold
the power of life and death

363
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,291
over the weak. However,
I found that distasteful.

364
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,458
He's too powerful.

365
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,416
We must work together
to defeat him!

366
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,750
Shut up!

367
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,791
[AINS] Some of us take
pride in our appearance.

368
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,291
I wish you wouldn't
wrinkle my clothes.

369
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,541
Now, are you finished
attacking me?

370
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,083
[GUU groans]

371
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,875
[growls, groans]

372
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,375
[AINS] Possessing a
so-called "cowardly name"

373
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
does not make one weak.

374
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,458
You may have a brain
the size of an acorn,

375
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,833
but surely you've
realized that by now.

376
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,458
[RYRARYUS hisses]

377
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,333
[AINS]
Aura! Don't let that one escape.

378
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,000
[groans]

379
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,375
Yes, Lord Ains.

380
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,750
What would you like me to do
with this weakling now?

381
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,750
You scrawny little brat.

382
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,708
I'm going to squeeze
you to death!

383
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,166
[AURA]
Hey!

384
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,875
You're obstructing my view
of Lord Ains' majestic form.

385
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,958
If you keep resisting,

386
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,250
I may accidentally
crush your throat.

387
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,333
[RYRARYUS groans]

388
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,791
[AINS]
Very good.

389
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,708
Now, take the creature away
from the fighting please.

390
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,583
I do not want him to
become collateral damage.

391
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,500
Right, you're comin' with me.

392
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,916
[AINS]
Now then. All healed up?

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,625
Let us continue
on with our duel.

394
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,583
I don't understand
how you're doing this.

395
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,333
Are you using magic?

396
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,166
[AINS]
Well, now. This is surprising.

397
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,625
Guu, the great king of
the forest and almighty

398
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,458
Giant of the East,
flinching in fear of a coward.

399
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,625
How can this be?

400
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,625
[AURA] He's obviously
quailing before you because

401
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,833
your name is a strong and
valiant one, Lord Ains,

402
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,500
while his not only
cowardly, but weird.

403
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,625
Right, snake?

404
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,708
Yes, that's right.

405
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,333
It's evidence of
Lord Ains Ooal Gown's

406
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,125
undeniable greatness.

407
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,291
[AINS] Indeed, that does
seem a viable explanation.

408
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,125
Damn you!

409
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,666
[AINS]
Silence, you filth.

410
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,708
[GUU groans]

411
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,708
[AINS] The trouble
with fighting a troll.

412
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,583
I could dice you
into tiny pieces,

413
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,208
and you'd likely still
be able to recover.

414
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,708
Though you do feel the pain.

415
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,708
My attacks don't have
any effect on you at all.

416
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,583
What the hell are you?

417
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,958
[AINS]
What am I? I am death.

418
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,125
And I have come for you.

419
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,333
Kill him now!

420
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,208
All of you! Go!

421
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,958
[AINS] I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised that someone

422
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,250
with such a cowardly name
would break his promise

423
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,375
of single combat.

424
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,375
It wouldn't do
for you to escape.

425
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,166
I've played around long enough.

426
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,583
Aura of Despair. Fifth Tier.

427
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,208
[RYRARYUS]
I'll submit to you!

428
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
I wish to serve you with
every ounce of my being.

429
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,916
It would be an honor
to do the bidding of one

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,208
with such a courageous name!

431
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,125
[AINS]
Ah. All right.

432
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,666
I did originally come
here for negotiations.

433
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,875
Have we collected data
on a troll zombie yet?

434
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,375
[AINS]
Hm.

435
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,958
[AINS]
A magic weapon?

436
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,916
It may be useful for
increasing the power

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,500
of an individual
from the village.

438
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,541
Do you have subordinates?

439
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
A troll would be nice.

440
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,750
I do have one, great lord.

441
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,000
[AINS]
Most excellent.

442
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,250
In that case, we can use
him as a substitute.

443
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,041
Although, it may be difficult.

444
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
You will bring your subordinate

445
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,791
and go to the building we are
constructing in the forest.

446
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,541
Aura, free him.

447
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,000
Are you sure, my lord?

448
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,666
[AINS] It will be fine.
If he betrays me--

449
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,083
No! I swear on my life

450
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,166
I would never consider
betraying someone of your power!

451
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,541
Only a fool would!

452
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,333
But I've seen the
terrifying coldness

453
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,041
that lurks in your gaze!

454
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,166
I know I'm nothing before you.

455
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,208
[AINS] Well, all right then.
Now leave, quickly.

456
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,416
And find me more subordinates.

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,291
That is my first order to you.

458
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,500
[RYRARYUS]
Yes!

459
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,375
[DEMIURGE] This seems
to be a menu, my lord.

460
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,291
[AINS]
I wanted to ask your opinion.

461
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,125
It would be a meal for
a human man and woman.

462
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,708
Perhaps a child as well.

463
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,958
Well, if Lord Ains is deigning
to offer humans a meal,

464
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,083
I believe they should eat
anything and everything

465
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,583
that is served,
without complaint.

466
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:11,125
However, I suspect that opinion
isn't what you're looking for.

467
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,916
If there is to be
a child present,

468
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,958
I would steer clear of
a dish like foie gras.

469
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,291
Also...

470
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,208
I would suggest something a bit
lighter and more refreshing.

471
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,500
[AINS] I see. That is
helpful. Thank you.

472
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
[DEMIURGE]
I am unworthy of your praise.

473
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,666
Lord Ains, if I may
be so bold as to ask--

474
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,916
do you plan to invite
guests to the holy place

475
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,750
of the Supreme Beings,
our Great Tomb of Nazarick?

476
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,416
[AINS]
Is there a problem with that?

477
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,666
[DEMIURGE]
Of course not.

478
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,000
Please forgive the implication.

479
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,458
Your will is all, my lord.
I live to obey.

480
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
[beeping]

481
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:46,916
[AINS]
Entoma.

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,375
[ENTOMA]
Yes, Lord Ains.

483
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,333
I have received a report
from Lupisregina.

484
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,416
[AINS]
Excellent.

485
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,583
It seems she's
passed the first test.

486
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,666
[ENTOMA] Also, she has requested
permission to enter battle.

487
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
[AINS]
Granted.

488
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,916
She is to do whatever
is necessary.

489
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,916
I want her to protect
those three with her life.

490
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,958
[clanging]

491
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,208
[gasps]

492
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,291
[NEMU]
What's wrong?

493
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,583
I don't know.

494
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,125
[AINS]
The monsters of the Great Forest

495
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,791
attack Carne Village.

496
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,250
At the main gate,
Jugem leads goblins, ogres,

497
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,750
and human vigilantes in
the defense of thier home.

498
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,541
Meanwhile, Enri and
Nphirea discover a troll

499
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,333
attempting to enter from
the rear of the city.

500
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,750
There's no hope for victory
if Jugem and the others

501
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,708
must fight on two fronts,
so Enri and Nphirea

502
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,041
risk their lives to buy time.

503
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,375
Chapter 5: "Two Leaders."

504
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,333
I am eager to see how
this might resolve.
