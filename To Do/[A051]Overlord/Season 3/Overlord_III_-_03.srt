1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,833
[AGU]
What is this place?

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,000
[ENRI]
Our village.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,833
Why, is something the matter?

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,416
Kinda looks like
the Monument of Ruin.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,291
Sounds like a scary place.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,375
Sure is!

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
If you ask me,
it's the scariest part

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,791
of the whole Great Forest.

9
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,333
It's a big building made of wood

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,083
that's completely surrounded
by undead warriors.

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
Yeah, and whereabouts is it?

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,458
[ENRI] Let's talk more once
we're inside the village, Gokou.

13
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,833
Smart idea!

14
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,666
Huh?

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,916
[yelps] Hey!

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,416
[LUPISREGINA]
Good old Enny.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,958
You still make the cutest little
scream when you're scared.

18
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,875
Oh, Miss Lupis!

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,500
[LUPISREGINA]
So, spill.


20
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,375
How'd this goblin kid
end up with you?


21
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,166
Well... I was just...

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,125
No! Wait, don't tell me!

23
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:32,666
Ooh! You stole Nphy's girl
from right under his nose?

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,333
Well, isn't this a tragedy--

25
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,500
the hopes and dreams of
such a pure-hearted boy

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,000
crushed into the dirt!

27
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,666
This is so hilarious!

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,333
[laughing]

29
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,083
Just kidding.

30
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,250
So...

31
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,666
Why'd you bring this
thing back with you?

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,291
Calm down, I'm not
gonna eat you.

33
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
I found her.

34
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,791
What's up?

35
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,291
Oh. Miss Britta.

36
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,791
We let a hobgoblin
inside our walls?

37
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,166
[gasps]

38
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,250
Hey, my bad.

39
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,833
The thing is, I used
to be an adventurer.

40
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,291
Kinda hard to get
outta that mindset.

41
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,833
An adventurer?

42
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,291
[BRITTA]
That's behind me now.

43
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,083
These days I'm
an apprentice ranger

44
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,875
that lives here in the village.

45
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,500
You'll be okay, Agu.

46
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,708
Carne Village is a place
where goblins and humans

47
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,208
live side by side.

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,541
That's what it looks like,
but I still can't believe it.

49
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,083
Okay, all of us are here,

50
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,083
so let's see what the
little guy has to say.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,541
Well, Agu? Tell us about
this Giant of the East.

52
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,583
Sure. Originally,
the forest was controlled

53
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,458
by the Great Beast of
the South and two others.

54
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,291
The Giant of the East,

55
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,916
and also the Demon
Snake of the West.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,666
The Great Beast of
the South might be

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,916
what we called the
Wise King of the Forest.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,458
But then the Great Beast
disappeared without a trace.

59
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,916
Which left the forest
out of balance.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,041
And not too long after that,
something else took its place.

61
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,916
That's the Monument of Ruin?

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,125
It is.

63
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,583
The master of that place
controls the undead.

64
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,083
We call him the Small Shadow
which Burrows in the Darkness.

65
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,541
And what does
all that have to do

66
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,333
with you getting attacked?

67
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,291
The Giant of the East
and the Demon Snake

68
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,708
of the West are gathering
their forces for an attack

69
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,333
on the King of Ruin.

70
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,333
They seemed to wanna
use all of us goblins

71
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,875
as foot-soldiers.
Or as emergency rations.

72
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,666
So most of us decided
we'd just hide from them.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
But then...

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,125
They must be tough to send
your whole tribe into hiding.

75
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,333
If a monster that
powerful shows up,

76
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
there's no point in
trying to fight it.

77
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,958
We may as well just run
with the non-combatants.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
[LUPISREGINA]
If you're in a bind,

79
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,500
I could always ask
Lord Ains to help you out.

80
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,041
This is our village.

81
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
So let's protect it ourselves.

82
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,750
We won't always be able
to rely on his charity.

83
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,708
Well, then, maybe we
should start by reporting

84
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,208
this to the village chief.

85
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,916
I'll pay a visit to the
Adventurer's Guild in E-Rantel

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
tomorrow and post our
situation as a job.

87
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,333
Hey. Could I come with you?

88
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,000
I've got some herbs to sell.

89
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
Oh. Sure.

90
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll go get the other
militia members up to speed.

91
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, I'm out, too.

92
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,750
Probably gonna go wander
around the village

93
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,750
a bit more before I head home.

94
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,041
[NPHIREA]
Oh, Miss Beta.

95
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,875
Could I take a bit of your time?

96
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
If it's not a bother,
I was hoping

97
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
you could take
this to Lord Gown.

98
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,791
We haven't replicated
a fully red potion yet.

99
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,083
But I think this is a step
in the right direction.

100
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,666
I'm delighted to hear that.

101
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,791
I'm sure Lord Ains
will be equally pleased.

102
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,416
[LUPISREGINA] Wow! I was
right to come visit today.

103
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,541
Also, feel free to
call me Lupisregina.

104
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,083
I'll allow it just for you.

105
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
So, have women always
been the leaders

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
here in the Carne Tribe?

107
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,458
Huh?

108
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,166
Why does Miss Enri
have so much power?

109
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,166
It's 'cause she can kick
our butts in a fight.

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,333
[gasps]

111
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,416
I've seen Miss Enri
beat down a barghest

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
and break its neck
with just one hand!

113
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,000
After that, she drained its
blood into a cup and drank it!

114
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,250
Seriously?

115
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you tryin' to
scare the kid, Gokou?

116
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,416
Hey, Agu.

117
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,833
That Lupisregina girl
is dangerous.

118
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,541
So keep your distance.

119
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,916
What makes her so dangerous?

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,291
Trust me on this.

121
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,500
Best thing you can do
is avoid her attention.

122
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,625
Look, I'm tellin' you this
for your own good, okay?

123
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,458
Uh. Yeah. I get it.

124
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,750
I gotta say though,
this is one crazy tribe.

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,375
Yeah... Like, um... too...

126
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,000
[knocking]

127
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,708
[ENRI]
Oh, hello, Jugem.

128
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,625
[JUGEM]
I'm sorry for waking you.

129
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,083
That's fine. Did
something happen?

130
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, we searched
through the forest,

131
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,958
and we managed to find a few
members of Agu's tribe.

132
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,458
I'm relieved to hear it.
You did great.

133
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,875
But there's more.

134
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
See, we captured the five ogres
who were chasing them.

135
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,750
Ogres?

136
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,875
That's right. And, well...

137
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,708
We told 'em about the
village and they said

138
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,250
they wouldn't mind joining us.

139
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,416
Huh?

140
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,208
So, I have a request
for you, Miss Enri.

141
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,666
[gasps]

142
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,500
[OGRES growling]

143
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,041
Listen up, ogres.

144
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,750
This is our boss, Miss Enri.
Your lives are in her hands.

145
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,500
So you'd better show
respect and hope

146
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,750
she's in a good mood.

147
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,458
[OGRES growling]

148
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,750
[gasps]

149
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:30,833
[OGRES grumbling]

150
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,500
Lower your heads at once!

151
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,458
You scary. Please,
little master.

152
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,333
Did not mean to make you mad.

153
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,875
We attack your tribe.

154
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,000
But now, we sorry.

155
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,541
You are forgiven.

156
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,708
On the condition that you
work hard for my tribe.

157
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, wow.

158
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,791
Now I can see why Miss Enri
is the leader of Carne Village.

159
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,791
That was scary.

160
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,500
I couldn't tell it from
looking at you though.

161
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,416
You know it's not everyone
who can get ogres

162
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,875
to accept them as their master.

163
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm still just an
ordinary village girl.

164
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,208
I only did that because
Jugem asked me to.

165
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,583
Honestly, I spent
the entire time scared

166
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,708
that they would eat me.

167
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,125
I understand, but
even though they say

168
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,708
all ogres are man-eaters.

169
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,791
I think that just means
they're carnivores.

170
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,000
Since the goblins hunt,

171
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,250
I'm sure we'll have
plenty of meat for them.

172
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,166
So there shouldn't be much risk
of them attacking anyone.

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,666
Besides, at the moment,

174
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,916
we need all the help
that we can get.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,666
Maybe we should've had them
pledge themselves to you.

176
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
I think I'm best
suited to supporting

177
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,250
the frontline fighters,
but you can hang back

178
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,666
and base your orders on
what you see happening.

179
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,291
Yeah, I guess. That makes sense.

180
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,791
And, by the way, about
us going to E-Rantel.

181
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,916
Oh, yeah!

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,375
I'm nervous about
going to the city,

183
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,708
but I'll try not
to embarrass you.

184
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
--Sorry.
--[ENRI] Why?

185
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,083
I have to heal the goblins
we rescued from Agu's tribe.

186
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
So I won't be able to join you.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,916
I really wish I could though.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,458
[ENRI]
Wait. I have to go by myself?

189
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,791
The goblins will escort you

190
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
all the way to
the gate, of course.

191
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,333
[ENRI] But, they're not allowed
to enter the city, are they?

192
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,750
I'll tell you what.

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,458
I bet I'm the only person
in the world in this bind.

194
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,875
It's so weird, suddenly
having to act like

195
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,375
I'm above other people.

196
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,791
And on top of that,
I have to go visit places

197
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,291
I've never been and do things
I've never done before!

198
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,208
So. Listen.

199
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,750
I was really just hoping to
sell some medicinal herbs.

200
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,000
First, I'll use Detect Magic.

201
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,708
[MAGIC CASTER grunts]
You'll not make a fool of me!

202
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,250
Reveal the magic item you
tried to sneak into the city!

203
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,083
Do you mean this thing?

204
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
--[SOLDIERS, MAGIC CASTER gasp]
--[ENRI] What?

205
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,583
[MAGIC CASTER]
Appraisal Magic Item.

206
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,375
What demonic relic is this?

207
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,208
It has such an
incredible power level

208
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,166
that my appraisal spell
couldn't measure it!

209
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,833
Madness! Impossible!

210
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,958
Tell us your true
identity, woman!

211
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,458
I thought you seemed
suspicious from the start!

212
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Huh?

213
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
--Yeah, so did I!
--[ENRI] Wait, what?

214
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,375
Cease this frail
attempt at deception!

215
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,791
Tell us how you obtained
that artifact, wench!

216
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, you see...

217
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,041
It was a present I got
from Lord Ains Ooal Gown,

218
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,458
a spellcaster who
saved my village.

219
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,666
You mean you received

220
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
such a terrifyingly
valuable item for free?

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,208
What? Are you saying that this
item would be expensive?

222
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,958
[MAGIC CASTER]
Don't play stupid!

223
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,916
That horn can summon
a horde of foul goblins.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,333
Though I don't actually know
the exact number, persay.

225
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,791
--[SOLDIER 03C] Goblins?
--[MAGIC CASTER] Yes.

226
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,625
It is in equal parts
dangerous and valuable.

227
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,500
It could be sold for
at least 3,000 gold.

228
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,291
No way.

229
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,458
That much?

230
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,791
I could understand if she were

231
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,833
an experienced magic
user, or even just

232
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,041
a highly ranked adventurer,
but this simply makes no sense!

233
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,541
If her claim that
she's nothing more

234
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,208
than a village girl were true,

235
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,791
then she wouldn't
have that item!

236
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,833
She must be planning
something nefarious!

237
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,875
No, I-- I'm telling the truth.
I'm just a village girl.

238
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,708
Move, men, arrest her at once!

239
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,833
You're kidding me!

240
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,958
Don't try to resist!

241
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,333
[SOLDIER 03A]
No sudden moves!

242
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,208
I'm sorry, but you've
made a mistake.

243
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,458
I'm just a girl from
a country village!

244
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,208
I don't know anything
about magic, I swear!

245
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,791
[MOMON]
What's this about?

246
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,958
Huh?

247
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,625
Well, if it isn't Lord Momon.

248
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,000
It's an honor, sir.

249
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,541
[MOMON]
What has she done?

250
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,958
Well, sir, she was in possession
of a suspicious item.

251
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:38,166
[MOMON] Enri. Yes.
It's Enri Emmott, correct?

252
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,208
Uh. Yeah. Have we met, sir?

253
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,541
[MOMON]
Uh--

254
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,750
Oh!

255
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,000
You're the gentleman
who came to my village

256
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,875
with Nphi, aren't you?

257
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,541
But, how do you know my name?

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,666
[MOMON]
Mm... Hm...

259
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,333
Do you want to talk?

260
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,500
[MAGIC CASTER clears throat]
Release the girl at once.

261
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,250
But, why would we do that?

262
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,375
I have just been assured
that her intentions

263
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,875
are good by the Adamantite
class adventurer Lord Momon.

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,625
I understand, sir.

265
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,250
Emmott of Carne Village.

266
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,791
We grant you entry
into E-Rantel.

267
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,791
Oh. Thank you.

268
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,041
You guys have a nice day.

269
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,958
[ENRI]
This is worth 3,000 gold?

270
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,791
It's hard to believe
that Lord Gown would

271
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,458
give these things away
if they're that valuable.

272
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
And I've already
used up one of them.

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,791
[gasps]

274
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,375
Greetings. Mr. Momon
bade me to ask you

275
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,916
a quick question.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,416
Beautiful.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Such flattery will get you--

278
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,416
[ENRI]
Just like Miss Lupisregina.

279
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,541
[gasps]

280
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,125
Oh! That was random.

281
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,375
But, I guess you just remind me
of another pretty person I know.

282
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,291
Your personalities
are different, but--

283
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
You have my thanks.

284
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,916
Huh?

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,458
Anyway, on behalf
of Lor--uh, Mr. Momon,

286
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,041
I ask this question;
please answer with haste.

287
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,458
Miss Emmott.

288
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,125
What business do you
have in E-Rantel?

289
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,416
Well, before I get to that.

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,791
Mr. Momon's the whole reason
I was able to get in.

291
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,541
So please let him know
that I'm very grateful.

292
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,416
[NABE]
Consider it done. Proceed.

293
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,708
Thank you.

294
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,916
So there were a few things
I needed to do here.

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,666
Let's see. First,
I'm gonna visit the temple.

296
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,625
I plan to see if any
of the homeless there

297
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,416
would like to move
to our village.

298
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,541
Then I need to post a job
at the Adventurer's Guild,

299
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,500
sell these medicinal herbs,
and purchase supplies.

300
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,666
I understand. Farewell.

301
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,250
What an interesting lady.

302
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,833
[ENRI] My village needs
defenders against

303
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,833
the Giant of the East and
Demon Snake of the West.

304
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,416
Both of those creatures
are incredibly powerful.

305
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,083
I'm afraid that only
Adamantite class adventurers

306
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,708
can accept your request.

307
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,208
Is one around?

308
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,000
Their services come
at a very high price.

309
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,125
Right, uh.

310
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
Doesn't the capital
give financial aid

311
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
for this kind of thing?

312
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,708
They do.

313
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,916
However, that subsidy
is only able to cover

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,958
a portion of the
total cost accrued.

315
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,833
Thank you for explaining.

316
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,333
Could I get an estimate
of what the cost might be?

317
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,250
[RECEPTIONIST 03A sighs] Give
me a moment to calculate it.

318
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,250
For now, you can take a seat.

319
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,750
[ENRI]
Thanks again.

320
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,125
[sighs] She seemed
really annoyed with me.

321
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,958
I suppose that makes sense.

322
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,541
A customer who can't pay
isn't a customer at all.

323
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,875
[ENRI]
I could always make some money

324
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,083
by selling this horn,
but I got it as a gift.

325
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,583
It would be ungrateful of me
to pawn it off like that.

326
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,791
[sighs]

327
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,250
[RECEPTIONIST 03A]
Miss Emmott? Miss Emmott!

328
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,875
Miss Enri Emmott
of Carne Village,

329
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,833
or no, Lady Emmott!

330
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,791
Um. Yes, ma'am?

331
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,583
[RECEPTIONIST 03A]
About your village's request.

332
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,708
May I ask for some
additional information please?

333
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,750
Yeah, no problem.

334
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,541
If you find the idea agreeable,

335
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,375
we could discuss the
details over a drink

336
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,083
in the reception room.

337
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm begging you!
Tell me every last detail!

338
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,041
I shudder at the
thought of missing

339
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
any shred of information!

340
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,625
Okay?

341
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,875
That was exhausting.

342
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,208
[KAIJALI]
Miss Enri!

343
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,791
[laughs]

344
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,208
[ENRI] The guild lady
had so many questions.

345
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,416
Which is weird, because I felt
like she blew me off at first.

346
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,125
[KAIJALI] Sounds like
you had a rough time.

347
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,916
On the plus side,
the medicinal herbs

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
sold for a great price.

349
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,250
It warms my heart to hear that.

350
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,291
Let us join in prayer
and thank our god

351
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,208
for blessing you on this day.

352
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,250
Then let's join
as husband and wife.

353
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,000
We heard that last part, Cona!

354
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
You know, I still
feel like I should've

355
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,125
accompanied Miss Enri
into the city.

356
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't be stupid!

357
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,250
If one of us goblins
tried to enter the city,

358
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,500
he'd be killed by the
guards immediately!

359
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,833
Heh! I'd like to see them try.

360
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,208
Don't worry, Miss Enri.

361
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,833
I, the mighty Gokou,
will always protect you.

362
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,125
And so will the rest of us!

363
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,833
Oh. That's right.

364
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,625
I was planning to wait
until we got back home,

365
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,125
but actually, I think this
might be the perfect time.

366
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,208
Kaijali.

367
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,416
It's for me?

368
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,125
[ENRI]
Gokou.

369
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,625
Unlai.

370
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,958
Nosuli.

371
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Suigyo.

372
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,875
Cona.

373
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,291
I don't know much about weapons,

374
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,250
so I got someone from
the Adventurer's Guild

375
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,833
to help me pick them.

376
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,208
Finest sword I've had.

377
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,083
Got a nice heft to it.

378
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,666
This can do some damage.

379
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,125
This is a big help.

380
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,916
My last sword had just chipped.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,333
Glad to help.

382
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,708
Wow. Miss Enri.

383
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,708
You picked these
out just for us?

384
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,708
I hope they're to your liking.

385
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,208
These are great gifts,

386
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,625
but I don't really feel
like we deserve them.

387
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,333
[ENRI] Not only did you risk
your lives to keep me safe,

388
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,416
you helped me rebuild
my home village.

389
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I could never do enough
to fully repay you for that.

390
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,875
I know this isn't much, but,
I hope you'll accept it.

391
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,125
I'll always be grateful
for every last one of you.

392
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
You're so kind.

393
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,708
[ENRI]
What?!

394
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,958
Well, I hope you'll
at least consider it.

395
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
I will.

396
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,208
[KAIJALI]
What happened?

397
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,666
I'm sorry, but I
need a little time

398
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,375
to think things over
right now, Kaijali.

399
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,125
Hey-yoh!

400
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,166
Miss Lupisregina! Hi!

401
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
I'm so glad you're
here right now!

402
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
Whoa there, take it easy!

403
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,708
Someone help!

404
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,750
Save me! I'm being assaulted!

405
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,916
Oh, no...

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,583
[ENRI] What? No--
Calm down, I was just--

407
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
Aw, I didn't mean to upset'cha.

408
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,250
I was just makin'
a cute little joke.

409
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,458
It's fine. Could I
ask for some advice?

410
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,541
I'm kind of at
my wit's end here.

411
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
Is something stressing you out?

412
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,083
Well, your big sis Lupisregina's
got your back, okay?

413
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,791
C'mon, ask the question.

414
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,125
[laughs]

415
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,041
Long story short,
the village chief

416
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,291
wants me to take over for him.

417
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,166
A year ago, I was doing
chores for my parents.

418
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,916
I'd be an awful chief.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,541
I'd run the village
straight into the ground.

420
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,791
The worst part is the whole
village got together without me.

421
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,791
And every last one of them
agreed that I should do it.

422
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,750
It's so ridiculous. So, uh...

423
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,416
I should just turn
them down, shouldn't I?

424
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,083
That's a toughie. I don't know.

425
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
I never promised I'd have
an answer for you, Enri,

426
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,416
just that I'd hear the question.

427
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,291
[chuckles] I really
can't help you out.

428
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,333
I can only say this much.

429
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,291
Whoever the village
chief may be,

430
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,666
they're going to make mistakes.

431
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,958
There have only
ever been 41 people

432
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,875
who could make the
perfect choice every time,

433
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,416
and none of us can hold
a candle to them.

434
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,791
There's no need to worry about

435
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,791
whether you'll make mistakes
because you're bound to.

436
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,333
That said,

437
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,250
out of all the denizens of this
village, logically speaking,

438
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,500
you're obviously the
most qualified candidate

439
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,166
for such a position.

440
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,041
Wait. Do you
really think that?

441
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,375
[LUPISREGINA]
I do.

442
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,416
Why don't'cha ask that
young man what he thinks?

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
[chuckles]

444
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,625
[ENRI]
What's that?

445
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,458
[NPHIREA]
It's the ogre's new home.

446
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,958
The goblins got together
and built it for them.

447
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,208
In just one day?

448
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,875
Yeah, Lord Gown
came by and lent us

449
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
a few stone golems to help out.

450
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,708
That's one more way
this village owes him.

451
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,708
So about you becoming chief.

452
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,708
I think... I really
think you should do it.

453
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,458
And why is that? I'm just a--

454
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,916
[NPHIREA] No. You're more
than "just a village girl."

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,583
You lead all the goblins.

456
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,250
And you're good at it, too.

457
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,041
Yeah, but--

458
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,000
[NPHIREA] When I talked to
Mr. Jugem and the others

459
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,041
about protecting the village,

460
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,416
they told me that,
push come to shove,

461
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
they would kidnap
you and escape.

462
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,583
What?

463
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,458
He also wanted me to help
them find and protect

464
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,875
Nemu so that we could
all run away together.

465
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,125
Oh.

466
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,666
But look, if you were
to become village chief,

467
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,500
that would make
this <i>your</i> village.

468
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,375
Knowing that, the goblins
would fight for it.

469
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,333
It might not seem like
much of a difference,

470
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,125
but to them, it really would be.

471
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,250
That magic horn really
makes the goblins

472
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,750
value their summoner.

473
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,375
If you ask me, that's 'cause
of who their summoner is.

474
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,666
Huh?

475
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,333
After all, you value
each and every one of them

476
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,375
as a unique individual.

477
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
Of course they treasure you.

478
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Instead of using them as slaves,
you treat them as partners.

479
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
It's just that simple.

480
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,750
But, it's not like I'm the
only person in the village

481
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,416
who treats them nicely.

482
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,291
The others aren't rude,
but have you ever

483
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,208
heard them call
a goblin by his name?

484
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,416
I know I haven't.

485
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
[gasps]

486
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,041
Me neither.

487
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,541
That's how it is.

488
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,333
If my opinion matters to you,

489
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,916
I think you would be good
at this kind of thing.

490
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,666
And if you become chief,

491
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,666
you'll unite humans and
goblins under one leader.

492
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,625
Well, I suppose everybody
would help me, right?

493
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,916
[NPHIREA]
Of course.

494
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,791
All right then.
Thanks for the advice.

495
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,583
I'm on my way to talk
to the village chief.

496
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,833
Once a choice has been made,
there's no point delaying.

497
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,791
'Kay. I'm rooting for you, Enri.

498
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,583
[LUPISREGINA]
Just as I thought.

499
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,708
She really is doing it.

500
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,666
This is so exciting.

501
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,208
[giggles]

502
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,208
[YURI] Lupis? Lord Ains
has called for you.

503
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,833
Oh, well, if it isn't
my big sis Yuri.

504
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,958
And what is it that has you
in such a pleasant mood?

505
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,208
Just now,

506
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,333
a new leader has been
born in this village.

507
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,000
One with great potential.

508
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,458
Why, she could change history.

509
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,333
Unless, something wicked
was to come along

510
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,500
and snuff out her spark just
as it was about to kindle.

511
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,083
I wonder what
kind of expressions

512
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,375
those villagers would make.

513
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,958
Just the thought of
them screaming out

514
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,958
as they're crushed
underfoot like insects

515
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,958
makes me tremble
with excitement.

516
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:44,166
[YURI] My, my. You are
a sadistic creature.

517
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,875
Yeah, I guess I am.

518
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,625
I just really hope
this village burns.

519
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,458
[AINS] After we built
our Nazarick decoy

520
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,000
in the Great Forest,
the Giant of the East

521
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,250
and Demon Snake of
the West united

522
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,083
and began gathering
forces to oppose us.

523
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,083
The names of these new monsters
have piqued my interest,

524
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,083
so I will journey forth
into the forest

525
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,708
to seek their layer
with Aura at my side.

526
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:11,833
Meanwhile, I have also devised
a test for Lupisregina.

527
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:16,500
Chapter 4: "Giant of the East,
Demon Snake of the West."

528
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,000
If you value your life,
submit yourself to me.
