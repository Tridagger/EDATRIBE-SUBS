1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,583
Our war should begin shortly,

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,625
if I'm not mistaken?

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,291
[gasps]

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,458
[BAZIWOOD]
Hey, kid.

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,416
His Majesty was
asking you a question.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,833
You still with us?

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,416
Uh. Oh! Please excuse me, Lord!

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Yes, I believe our
last advisory warning

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,958
was sent to Re-Estize
just recently.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,833
I was wondering...

11
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,583
Majesty, why did
you ask for help

12
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,375
from that creepy undead guy?

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,333
The Re-Estize forces are
of no real threat to us.

14
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,625
And you told him to use
his most powerful magic,

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,291
right off the bat?
Kinda overkill.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,125
You just want him
to put on a show?

17
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,500
Is that it?

18
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,333
[JIRCNIV] Eventually, we'll
need to form an alliance

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,375
against Ains Ooal Gown.

20
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,250
But no one will bite
until they understand

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,458
how dangerous he is.

22
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,583
Think. Even that dark
elf girl can wipe out

23
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:02,416
over 100 imperial knights
in the blink of an eye.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,083
From what I've seen
of her master,

25
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,666
that's just the start.

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,541
Frankly, if that man killed
3,000 soldiers with one spell,

27
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,916
it wouldn't surprise me.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,250
Three thousand?
I can't imagine!

29
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,041
That's horrifying!

30
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,375
The Demon Gods, or even,

31
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,708
the Thirteen Heroes couldn't
do something like that.

32
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,916
True enough, but I think
we should assume

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,958
the worst in this situation.

34
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,791
It does present us with a
unique opportunity, though.

35
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,750
We'll get to see a demonstration
of his power, firsthand.

36
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,166
Then we'll have more of an idea
of how we might defeat him.

37
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,000
If we can't best him
with strength,

38
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,750
we shall do so with ingenuity.

39
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,375
[BOULLOPE] I'm certain they
received the final warning.

40
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,083
The war should've
started already,

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,500
but the Empire's
just standing there.

42
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,416
Also, there's still no
word from Prince Barbro?

43
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,750
No, sir.

44
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,458
He should have arrived at
Carne Village yesterday.

45
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,375
I have no idea what
could've happened.

46
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,041
No matter, we'll make do.

47
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,666
We 70,000 soldiers
of the royal army

48
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,750
shall change
formation and march!

49
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,375
Let us be the frontline
and first to deal a blow

50
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,791
against the dogs of the Empire!

51
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,000
Heh!

52
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,875
The Empire only has 60,000
troops, Your Highness.

53
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,750
I think, with our 240,000,
we'll wrap this up

54
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,791
and have them begging
for quarter soon.

55
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,375
[MEN laughing]

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,166
Perhaps we should
take this opportunity

57
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,708
to invade the their territory.

58
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,083
[MEN]
Ah!

59
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,208
Well, I have duties to
fulfill back with my unit.

60
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,458
I'll leave the details of this
slaughter to you fine gentlemen.

61
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,000
[MEN laugh]

62
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm not certain I share
your confidence exactly,

63
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,458
but it is reassuring.

64
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,833
[RAEVEN]
Still not moving, huh?

65
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,250
In previous years,
they would mount

66
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,958
their attack when the final
warning had been issued.

67
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,125
[GAZEF]
They're waiting for something,

68
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,250
but I don't know what.

69
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,416
Whatever they're planning,

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,750
I hope we can settle
this matter quickly.

71
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,583
I noticed you're
wielding the legendary

72
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,833
Razor Edge, "whose enchanted
blade can cut through

73
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,041
armor like butter" they say.

74
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,791
[GAZEF grunts]

75
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,250
[RAEVEN]
Ah, and I see the intent.

76
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,333
By donning the four
treasures of Re-Estize,

77
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,625
you have become a symbol
of the Kingdom, itself.

78
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,541
A living treasure.

79
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,750
I'm not worthy of such praise.

80
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,625
I owe everything to our king,
who bestowed such an honor

81
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,583
on a mere commoner like me.

82
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,666
That's true.

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,333
But His Majesty
trusts you completely.

84
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,666
The course of action that
he took with Prince Barbro

85
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,583
is evidence of that.

86
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,458
Huh?

87
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,666
In other words.

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,791
His Majesty believes
that this Ains Ooal Gown

89
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:22,416
you're so wary of must be
every bit as deadly as you say.

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,666
Perhaps His Majesty was
selfish in sending

91
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,708
his child away from this battle.

92
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
In the past, I certainly
would have resented him

93
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,833
for such a decision.

94
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,666
But I was foolish enough
to aim for the throne then.

95
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,583
I know better now.

96
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,083
Because, I understand
how His Majesty feels.

97
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,708
And frankly, if it were my son,

98
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,583
I wouldn't want him
fighting in a war, either.

99
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,583
Indeed. No surprise.

100
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,375
I hear that you're quite
the doting father.

101
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,125
[laughs] Like any other.

102
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,166
A father, busy with work,
but always promising his son

103
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,208
he'll spend more time
playing with him.

104
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe after this
little war is over.

105
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,541
Though I fear
that Prince Barbro

106
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,125
will fail to appreciate
his father's thoughts.

107
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,458
Feels a bit tragic, doesn't it?

108
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,791
Look there.

109
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,125
Seems they're moving,
at long last.

That's him?

114
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,666
The magic caster who could
bring our land to ruin?

115
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,458
The mighty Ains Ooal Gown?

116
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,958
Listen, sir.

117
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,208
I recommend you call your team
of ex-adventurers quickly.

118
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,416
We need their expertise.

119
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,833
[BORIS]
Marquis Raeven!

120
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,541
Something terrible
is about to happen.

121
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,500
Did you feel it, too?

122
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,541

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,708
What now?

125
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,666
I can scarcely
comprehend that power,

126
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,125
let alone hope to defeat it!

127
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm going to return to my unit!

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,875
Protect the king, Master Gazef--
I fear we must order a retreat!

129
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,125
Indeed.

130
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
And I must insist that
we do so immediately.

131
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,125
I concur.

132
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,791
Disgraceful though it may be,
it seems we've no choice.

133
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,166
Marquis Raeven. Good luck.

134
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,333

You as well, Master Gazef.

135

No response.

00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,500
[MOMONGA] In Yggdrasil,
players casting super-tier magic

137
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,291
are the first ones targeted.

138
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,875
But no one is stopping me,

139
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,041
they're all just
staring dumbfounded.

140
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,791
I guess that means
there are no Players

141
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,000
in the Kingdom's army.

142
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,458
In that case, acting as
a decoy is pointless.

143
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,750

Yes.

144
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,708
Now the festival of
destruction can begin.

matter, Master Nimble?

I was merely stunned
by the power

159
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,500
of your spell just now!

160
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,958
It was terrifyingly effective.

161
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,458

[AINS] I'm not offended,
if that's your concern.

165

But you praised the
effectiveness of my spell.

I find that amusing.

167
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,750
Why is that?

168
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,250

was only a means to an end.

you are about to behold.

[AINS] And now I show you
the face of despair.

[AINS laughs] Splendid!
Looks like a new record!

180
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,708
I believe I may be
the first to summon

181
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
five of them at once.

182
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,291
A pity all the sacrifices that
made this moment possible

183
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,500
can't share it with me.

184
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,916
Uhm, congratulations
on your summoning.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,666
I'd expect nothing
less, my lord.

186
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,583
[AINS]
Why thank you, Mare.

187
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,000
Congratulations, Your Grace.

[KNIGHTS whimpering]

190
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,791
[AINS] I know our objective
was to show off my strength

191
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,166
to other countries,
and I do believe we have

192
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,500
accomplished that, but still,
it seems like a waste

193
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,750
to send away the children
before they can play.

194
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,416
Especially after you
set a new record.

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,583
[AINS] Hm... Yes, let's
have a little fun.

196
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,708
Hunt them down, little goats.

197
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,375

[AINS]
But there are three, or rather,

200
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,916
four people who
you must not kill.

them your wrath.

I said, damn it?

Marquis Raeven, you need
to get out of here, too!

213
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm ready! Follow my lead!

214
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,291
I knew he was dangerous,
but this is insane!

Never mind us,
someone this powerful

216
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,125
could tear the
whole world apart!

[RAEVEN]
No, I can't think like that.

218
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,375
We'll come up with something.

219
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,125
We have to protect our
future from this monster.

220
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,750
I think it's chasing
us! Be careful!

Damn it. We gotta take a stand.

this'll go, so keep running

Don't run away!

251
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,708
[AINS] If I recall,
in our original plan,

252
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,000
you were to launch your
attack after I cast my spell.

253
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:51,291
And yet it seems that your
troops have fled instead.

254
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,916
Don't worry,
I'm not blaming you.

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,708
After all, I would feel bad
for the emperor if his men

256
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,791
leapt into the fray and
got trampled to death

257
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,250
by the creatures I summoned.

258
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:06,250
So, this time, I'll be happy
to do your part as well.

the camp in my absence.

Leave everything to me!

Hey. Haven't you killed
enough people today?

263
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,041
Are you a man or demon?

264
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,375
[AINS]
Make no mistake. I am undead.

265
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,625
That is all.

to do a little cleanup.

00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:35,541
Fortunately, it seems
I've found my target.

269
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,208
[VICE-CHIEF 12A] Your Majesty!
We have to get out of here!

270
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,291
[RAMPOSA] I will stay.
You may retreat without me.

271
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,708
But, Your Majesty, why?

272
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,833
My Lord! So few guards.

273
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,541
Where did they all go?

274
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,166
Probably ran away in terror
with everyone else.

275

There is nothing you can
do here, Your Majesty!

hold them at bay!

If there's truly
nothing I'm able

280
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,791
to accomplish here, then...

281
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,333
...I'll go. What's
the next step?

282
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,625
Those creatures seem
to chase down horses.

283
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,208
You there! Take the
king on your back!

284
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,958

285
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,833
And the rest of you?

286
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,541
We'll try to make
a distraction.

287
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,250
I'll lead our horses in
the opposite direction

288
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,208
of your retreat.

289
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,083
I'll be a decoy as well.

290
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,041
Although, I don't know if those
monsters have eyes or not.

291
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,333
If they do, my armor
makes a fine target.

292
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,583
[sighs] In that case, I guess
I'd better stick around, too.

293
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,208
I'm grateful.

294
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,083
Do your best.

295
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,500
Of course.

296
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,708
I can't believe
it's come to this.

Please, return to
E-Rantel safely, men.

any reward you wish.

00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,583
I thank you, but my
life has been saved

301
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,500
by Princess Renner.
I ask no reward.

302
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,291
I don't need
anything for myself,

303
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,916
but I'm friends
with this nice kid.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,750
He seems to get along
great with your daughter,

305
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,958
so it'd make my day if
those two could get married.

00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:05,875
Uh--!

[RAMPOSA laughs]

308
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,000
A rather audacious
request, I must admit!

00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,375
Please tell him
you're just joking!

310
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,958
Well, no promises,
but perhaps we can begin

311
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,458
by granting this friend
of yours a noble title.

312
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,875
I give you my support.

313
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,458
That settles it,
better make it out

315
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,375
I'm counting on you!

[AINS]
Still, it's been far too long.

351
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,958
I feel the weight of
that now. Tell me.

352
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,333
What was your purpose in
reaching out to me here?

353
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,708
Surely you don't hope
simply to reminisce

354
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,875
in the midst of a battle.

355
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,250
[AINS]
You get straight to the point.

356
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,666
And as I don't like
beating around the bush,

357
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,041
I shall return the favor.

358
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,708
I want you to join me.

359
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,708
[gasps]

360
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,416
[BOTH gasp]

361
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,333
[AINS]
If you become my subordinate,

362
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,458
I shall grant you this.

363
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,083
[ALL gasp]

364
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,416
[AINS]
Do you understand now?

365
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,708
[GAZEF]
You've stopped them.

366
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,583
And easily, no less.

367
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,125
[AINS]
Consider it a momentary pause.

368
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,791
Your answer will determine
what happens next.

369
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,916
That is to say, if you
refuse my generous offer,

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,750
I will give a different
order to these children.

371
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,083
And I expect you can guess
what that order might be.

372
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,333
[AINS]
What do you say, Gazef Stronoff?

373
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,125
Will you come to my side or not?

374
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,583
I refuse. I am the
sword of the king.

375
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,708
I owe His Majesty too much.

376
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,208
I cannot turn my back on him.

377
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,541
[AINS] Even if many lives
will be lost as a result

378
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,083
of your decision?

379
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,916
Surely you understand the
weight of what you're saying.

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,791
You're a man who risked his
life to save Carne Village.

381
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,250
Now, when countless other
lives hang in the balance,

382
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,500
you will allow them to be lost?

383
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,333
[AINS] I never took you
for such a fool. Pity.

384
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,291
[AINS]
What is this?

385
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,958
Forgive me.

386
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:03,708
I know I'm still indebted
to you, Master Gown.

387
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,208
But I must challenge
you to a duel!

388
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,791
[AINS] Seventy thousand lives
are snuffed out in an instant,

389
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,583
and the beasts I summoned will
crush countless more underfoot.

390
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,166
In times such as these,

391
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,750
I wonder if this undead vessel
has stripped me of all mercy.

392
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,875
But I still respect strength,

393
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,791
and I see it in the eyes
of the warrior before me.

394
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,916
Gazef Stronoff,

395
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,291
I accept your request.

396
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,666
Chapter 13: "Player vs Player."

397
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,041
This world, and
every person in it,

398
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,958
will soon know of my strength!
