1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,666
[BOTH gasp]

2
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,083
[AINS]
Are you certain?

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,583
[GAZEF]
Of course.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,083
[AINS]
You will die.

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,750
Fortunately, I came
here prepared to die.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,083
[AINS] Then what are you
hoping to accomplish?

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:38,875
All that stands before you on
this path is your destruction.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:43,500
What stands before me now
is the commander of my enemies.

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Therefore, my course is clear.

10
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,000
[AINS]
I may be close in proximity,

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,291
but my power is far
beyond your reach.

12
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,750
[AINS] You can't even
react in time to dodge.

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,750
That is but a fraction
of what I'm capable of.

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,875
Knowing that, do you
really think you have

15
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:12,458
any hope of winning?

16
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,708
[GAZEF]
It's possible, Master Gown.

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,333
[AINS] Do you think
yourself invincible because

18
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,416
I have no desire to kill you?

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,250
I assure you, the thought
never crossed my mind.

20
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,916
I merely wish to fulfill
my duty as Chief Warrior

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,041
of the Kingdom. Surely
that's not a surprise.

22
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,875
[AINS] If you face me, know
that I will strike you down

23
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,375
without hesitation.

24
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:38,041
And I assure you, your
demise will be absolute.

25
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,708
I expect so.

26
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,958
[AINS]
A shame.

27
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm something of a
collector, so it pains me

28
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,208
to kill someone so
rare and valuable.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,000
In the name of my Kingdom,
as Chief Warrior,

30
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,875
I challenge the Sorcerer King,
Ains Ooal Gown to a duel!

31
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,083
I harbor no regrets!

32
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,500
Come! Let us end this!

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,833
[CLIMB]
No.

34
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,500
[BRAIN]
Gazef.

35
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,458
Before we formally begin,
one last thing.

36
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,583
Why don't we have these two
serve as witnesses to our duel?

37
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,583
[BOTH gasp]

38
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,375
[AINS]
Hm.

39
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,666
[BRAIN]
No, please wait!

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,708
I beg of you, Lord Gown.

41
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,916
Although I know this
is a selfish request,

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,583
let me fight beside him!

43
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,166
Even with us both, we can
hardly match your strength.

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,125
So surely, you will allow it?

45
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,958
I won't have you do this.

46
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,750
Do you wish to drag my resolve
as a warrior through the mud?

47
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,166
[gasps]

48
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,000
[AINS] It's irrelevant.
I'll fight any number of you.

49
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,791
They need not enter this fight.

50
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,458
And you need not lay
a finger on them.

51
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,500
[AINS] Those eyes.
I know that look well.

52
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,708
It's the gaze of a man
who has prepared himself

53
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,916
for death, yet steps
forward all the same.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,958
Something I admire.

55
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,208
Fine. I accept your conditions.

56
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,000
[AINS] Do you know what I
call this, Master Stronoff?

57
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,083
"PVP"!

58
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,750
[GAZEF]
Thank you.

59
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,750
[AINS] I will be certain
to return your corpse

60
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,083
in perfect condition.

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,291
With resurrection
magic you may--

62
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,666
No need.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,125
If this battle ends me,
then so be it.

64
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,375
Leave my corpse to lie
amongst my fallen comrades.

65
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,291
Lord Stronoff, why?

66
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,458
Let's begin, shall we?

67
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,333
My friends. This will
be my final battle.

68
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,083
Watch closely.

69
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,666
[GAZEF] Brain. You'll do
that for me, won't you?

70
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,500
This is his dying wish, Brain.

71
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,375
Then I got no choice.

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,791
It's an honor, Gazef.

73
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,458
I'm proud to bear witness
to your courage.

74
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,500
I feel the same.

75
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,958
[AINS]
One last thing, Master Stronoff.

76
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,333
May I have a look at
that sword of yours?

77
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,500
[BOTH gasp]

78
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,458
[GAZEF]
Certainly.

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,083
[BOTH gasp]

80
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,916
[AINS]
Impressive! A fine blade!

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,916
Master Stronoff,
how much do you know

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,083
about the power of this weapon?

83
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
Everything, I believe.

84
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,083
Specifically, the edge of this
blade is uncannily sharp.

85
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,083
It's able to cut through
metal as if it were paper.

86
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,541
[AINS]
How unfortunate.

87
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,625
That is a mere fraction of
this sword's true capacity.

88
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
[GAZEF]
What?

89
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,666
[AINS] The data level,
meaning the level of magic

90
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,500
the sword possesses,
is equivalent to this dagger.

91
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,875
[AINS] As you can see,
a weapon of such weak

92
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,416
magical caliber cannot even
leave a scratch on my body.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,458
However, despite your
ignorance, it is possible

94
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
to harm me with that sword.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,458
More than that, under the
right circumstances,

96
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,333
one might even kill me with it.

97
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,166
That means we've at least
fulfilled the most

98
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,125
basic requirements of a duel.

99
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,291
Now, if I win, may I claim
that sword as a prize?

100
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,916
This is the Kingdom's blade.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,416
I'd die a disgrace
if someone took it.

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,666
[AINS] Hm. I suppose I've
had PVP matches where

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,000
both players retained
their items.

104
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,416
I'll allow it.

105
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,333
I'm grateful, Sorcerer King.

106
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,000
[AINS]
This seems a proper distance.

107
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, you there,
in the shining armor.

108
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,416
Can you give us
a signal to begin?

109
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,083
Uh--

110
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,083
Do it, Climb. Don't worry.

111
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
Yes, of course!

112
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,375
I have some magic
handbells here with me.

113
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,208
Will ringing them be adequate?

114
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,666
[AINS]
Mm.

115
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,083
[GAZEF grunts]

116
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,791
You okay?

117
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,125
A bit nervous, of course.
But I'll be all right.

118
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,458
Good luck, Master Stronoff.

119
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
[bells chime]

120
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
[GAZEF yells]

121
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,625
[AINS]
One note.

122
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,583
You should always
prepare countermeasures

123
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,583
against time spells.

124
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,833
[AINS]
Delay Magic. True Death.

125
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,541
[AINS]
Farewell, Gazef Stronoff.

126
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,291
I'm sorry it had
to end this way.

127
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,000
Wait, what?

128
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,750
What did he just do?

129
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,083
I couldn't see.

130
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,458
Gazef! Hey! Get up!

131
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,375
[AINS]
He's already dead.

132
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,125
[BOTH gasp]

133
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,958
No, it can't be!

134
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,000
[AINS] Seeing him challenge me
to a battle he couldn't win

135
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,583
reminds me of our first meeting.

136
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,291
In honor of your
Chief Warrior's courage,

137
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,958
I will cease the pursuit
of your forces and withdraw.

138
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,416
His body will be returned to you
once it's been purified.

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,041
[BRAIN]
No, he wouldn't want that.

140
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,125
We'll take Gazef
home on our own.

141
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,208
We don't need help from you.

142
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
[AINS]
If you wish.

143
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,041
But be warned that to reverse
the instant death spell I used,

144
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,416
low-level resurrection
magic won't be enough.

145
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,625
[AINS] Also, I have a
message for the people

146
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,875
of your kingdom.

147
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,708
I am not unreasonable.

148
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,125
I offer mercy to all
those who bow to me.

149
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,500
[AINS] If you relinquish
E-Rantel to me

150
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,666
within the next few days,
I will prevent these creatures

151
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,291
from running rampant
in your capital.

152
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,666
Inform your king.

153
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,500
If you don't mind,

154
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,166
I'd like to carry Gazef's
body back, myself.

155
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,458
[CLIMB]
Of course.

156
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,541
And although I don't
deserve such an honor.

157
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,208
I'll bring his sword.

158
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[JIRCNIV]
Seventy thousand?

159
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,708
[sighs] Absurd. So many
men with one blow...

160
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,083
And at the spell's end,
five giant beasts

161
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,875
were summoned to
the battlefield,

162
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,833
causing massive casualties.

163
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,750
Then, Lord Gown
engaged in a duel

164
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,541
with the Kingdom's Chief
Warrior, Gazef Stronoff,

165
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,250
and bested him.

166
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,583
[BAZIWOOD gasps]

167
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,416
While we did take losses,
it wasn't from battle.

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,458
--The cause was mass panic.
--[JIRCNIV laughing]

169
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,958
[NOBLE 13A]
We need to return to the capital

170
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,500
before anything else.

171
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
Where is Marquis Raeven?

172
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,125
[NOBLE 13C] If he fled, he
should have been here by now!

173
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,458
We were fools to think
we could fight that monster.

174
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,125
You're saying we should just
turn E-Rantel over to him?

175
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,250
[NOBLE 10C] It's a small price
to pay if it saves our Kingdom!

176
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,416
Why, Gazef?

177
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,500
You chose death.

178
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,541
And you left me with
this weight in my heart.

179
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,333
It's not fair.

180
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,125
You should have let
me die at your side.

181
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,958
[BRAIN]
Fourfold Slash of Light!

182
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,708
[pants]

183
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,833
I learned that move just
because I admired you.

184
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,958
[BRAIN] But you still didn't
let me fight alongside you.

185
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,791
I wasn't even good
enough to die!

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,125
They say you become
a lot weaker to tears

187
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,666
as you get older.
Seems it's true.

188
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
There's no need for you
to blame your grief on age.

189
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,291
Not when you've lost
someone so dear to you.

190
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,166
Sorry I left all that to you.

191
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,500
I wasn't feeling
up to a meeting.

192
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,916
So, do you mind filling
me in on the details?

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,583
Sure. Since Prince Barbro
has yet to return,

194
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,583
they're hiring some adventurers
to find out what's keeping him.

195
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,333
They'll form a search party
and head out tomorrow.

196
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,541
Huh.

197
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,166
Then they discussed
the fate of E-Rantel.

198
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,083
The nobles and the
king both agreed.

199
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,083
Seems we're handing it over.

200
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,500
I feel sorry for the king.

201
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,833
This won't go well for him.

202
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,291
True.

203
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,625
The noble faction will gain
influence because of this.

204
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
And the king will grow weak.

205
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,041
There something else?

206
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,458
[CLIMB]
I survived.

207
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
But the fear is still
fresh in my mind.

208
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,166
I was completely
helpless back there.

209
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,291
That was true despair I felt.

210
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,166
[BRAIN]
Hey. Let me ask you.

211
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,916
Why do you think Gazef
requested that duel?

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
Huh?

213
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,166
Uh. I mean...

214
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,708
[CLIMB] Maybe I'm being
arrogant, but I think I know.

215
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,375
[BRAIN]
Go ahead.

216
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,166
I believe he wanted
to show us the truth.

217
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,375
[BRAIN]
About what?

218
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,000
The power that Ains
Ooal Gown can command.

219
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,375
[gasps]

220
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,625
He saved us so that we
might find a path forward

221
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,875
for this kingdom.

222
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,708
You think?

223
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,958
Yeah.

224
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,375
He wanted us to return
here with information

225
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,625
so we could plan
a defense someday.

226
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,958
[gasps]

227
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:12,083
Maybe so. We can try.

228
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,625
I mean, he did put
his faith in us.

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,541
[BRAIN] I had hoped I
could fight him someday.

230
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,791
Last time, he defeated me.

231
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,916
But I was always
dreaming of a rematch.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,833
Well... Guess I'll
be a loser forever.

233
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,708
That's not what you are.

234
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,791
What should I do, huh?

235
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:41,166
I mean, with these unanswered
feelings he's left us with?

236
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,416
Wait, no. It's all right. Yeah.

237
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,750
I'll win in my own way.

238
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,291
[BRAIN] Hah! You hear that,
Gazef? Screw your wishes!

239
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,500
I think you took
the easy way out!

240
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,333
You threw your life away
instead of facing me!

241
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,000
Our battle will continue,
even if you're not here with me!

242
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,208
I'm still gonna surpass you!

243
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,708
I think he'd want that.

244
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,250
Hey, Climb. Time we had a drink.

245
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,250
A drink. You mean now?

246
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,208
Uh-huh. After the
fight, as promised.

247
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,750
And one for Gazef, too.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,416
Father, why don't you
take a walk in the garden?

249
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,791
The spring flowers
have come to bloom.

250
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,500
Earlier, as agreed upon,
we officially ceded control

251
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,458
of E-Rantel to the Sorceror
King, Ains Ooal Gown.

252
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,833
No need to fear the nobles.
I'll deal with them.

253
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:01,083
And as for the duties assigned
to my missing brother...

254
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
I'll carry them out
in his stead.

255
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,666
[RENNER]
Say, Climb.

256
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,916
[CLIMB]
My Lady?

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,791
Well, I...

258
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,500
I have a request for you.

259
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,833
I am always at your service.

260
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,125
It's nothing formal.

261
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,750
I've simply heard that
an altar has been made

262
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,541
for those who lost their lives
in our battle with the Empire.

263
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,083
I'd like you to deliver
these flowers there for me.

264
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,916
Although I feel rather ashamed
that I can't do more for them.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,333
[gasps] Your kindness is our
Kingdom's greatest treasure.

266
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,666
They would be grateful.

267
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,625
You're too kind!

268
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,250
Oh. Excuse my outburst.

269
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,416
Um. I'll get to
that. Immediately.

270
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,250
[CLIMB] I don't know
what the future holds

271
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,958
for this world anymore.

272
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,791
But no matter what happens,

273
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,125
I'll protect Princess Renner.

274
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:08,416
[bell tolls]

275
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,750
Give me back my dad!

276
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,125
Give me back my dad,
you monsters!

277
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,791
Please. He's just
a child, I'm sorry!

278
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,250
He didn't know
what he was doing!

279
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,791
Forgive us!

280
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,375
Please have mercy on my son!

281
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm begging!

282
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,875
Lord Ains will not
be disrespected.

283
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,166
It's a crime
punishable by death.

284
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,041
The ignorant must
learn that Lord Ains

285
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,541
is the Supreme Being
of this world.

286
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,375
You'll serve as an
example to the rest.

287
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,000
Who's there?

288
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,291
[AINS]
Ha!

289
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,958
[MOTHER 13A]
Please, help us!

290
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,708
[AINS] You turn to violence
over a tiny pebble?

291
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,541
You'll never land a beau
with that attitude.

292
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,958
Even though this is a farce,
that's a low blow.

293
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,291
[clears throat]

294
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,875
All who disrespect Lord Ains,
regardless of age,

295
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,458
must submit to a
suitable punishment.

296
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,708
Which in this case,
of course, is death.

297
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:32,041
[AINS] And if I said that I
refuse to allow it? What then?

298
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,083
I would see it as treason
against the ruler

299
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,583
of this land and crush you!

300
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,833
[AINS]
I see.

301
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,500
But if you think you can
take my life so easily,

302
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,125
you're mistaken, evildoer!

303
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,291
Greetings, my lord.

304
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,083
I understand, Lord Ains.
As you desire.

305
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,875
I have not asked your
name, armored stranger.

306
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,083
Let it be known.

307
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,458
[AINS]
Momon.

308
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,000
Well then, Momon.

309
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:23,083
Lord Ains has an extremely
generous proposal for you.

310
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,666
He'll grant you the
honor of joining

311
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,541
the ranks of Nazarick.

312
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,916
[AINS]
That's absurd.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,458
How uncouth.

314
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,791
Lord Ains rules this city,
but he does not wish to control

315
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,333
its people through
bloodshed and despair.

316
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,708
This is true.

317
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,458
Although I doubt most
commoners would believe it.

318
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,625
[AINS]
What would you have me do?

319
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,791
When someone here
steps out of line,

320
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
throwing a rock for example,
you track them down

321
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,375
and give them what they deserve.

322
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,125
We can't encourage
lawlessness after all.

323
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,250
If you do this,

324
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,250
you'll personally
ensure that his rule

325
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,250
brings no harm to any innocents.

326
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,583
Not that Lord Ains wants that.

327
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,625
[AINS] You'd make me into
your watch dog, would you?

328
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
I wouldn't put it that way.

329
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,041
You'd be helping the people,
both as a representative

330
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,625
of the city and as
an enforcer of the law.

331
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,125
[AINS]
I will not follow an unjust law.

332
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,291
That's perfectly fine,
as he has no intention

333
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,666
of imposing any.

334
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,250
That said, if you refuse
and raise your sword

335
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
against the ruler of this city.

336
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,791
Then you'll leave me
with no choice.

337
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,583
I'll slay you right here.

338
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,416
And some bystanders may
be collateral damage.

339
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,708
[MOTHER 13A, BOY 13A gasp]

340
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,666
[AINS]
Fine!

341
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,625
I'll accept your offer.

342
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,416
But know this, if you
lay so much as a finger

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,916
on an innocent citizen
of this city,

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,791
you will face this blade.

345
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,458
And it will not relent until
all your heads are taken.

346
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,250
[DEMIURGE]
So the subjugation of E-Rantel

347
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
went smoothly, I trust?

348
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
Everything is proceeding
according to Lord Ains' plan.

349
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,916
Turns out humans are
surprisingly adaptable.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,541
I suppose it's merely
their instinct to survive,

351
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,208
but the weak do tend
to follow the strong.

352
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,583
Either way, it was only
possible because of Momon.

353
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,958
Indeed.

354
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,125
Their faith in this fabricated
character shall keep

355
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
their fears at bay,
it would seem.

356
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,750
And even better, if they
collect information

357
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,875
for Momon and unite beneath him,

358
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,875
we won't have to worry
about outside enemies

359
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,208
gaining ground.

360
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,041
Our supreme leader was
certainly thinking ahead!

361
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,375
For all my scheming,
I'm afraid such thorough

362
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,833
machinations are still
beyond my comprehension.

363
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,208
Yes.

364
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,583
Though I don't lament my
comparably meager intellect.

365
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,541
Rather, I am pleased
to devote it to him

366
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,666
with every fiber of my being.

367
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,583
For he is the ruler of
life and death alike.

368
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,708
The highest existence.

369
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,583
And the man who I hope
to call my lover someday.

370
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
[AINS]
You may raise your heads.

371
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,625
[AINS] Your efforts have
done me a great honor.

372
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,958
My lord! My Sorcerer King.

373
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,875
We are unworthy of such praise!

374
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,416
It is our pleasure to come
running at your call!

375
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Serving you is the greatest
gift we could ever ask for!

376
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
I second those
sentiments wholeheartedly.

377
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
My lord, I await
your next order.

378
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,125
I offer you my strength,
my life, and my body,

379
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,333
to do with however you see fit,
o' noble Sorcerer King.

380
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,541
[COCYTUS] No matter the trial
and no matter the order,

381
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,416
I shall not hesitate.

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,000
So long as we fight for the
glory of the Sorcerer King,

383
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,416
nothing will stop us!

384
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,916
I will give it my best!

385
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
And I'll work hard every day!

386
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,875
Great and mighty Sorcerer King,

387
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,583
as the representatives of all
those who serve under you,

388
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,083
we sincerely congratulate you
for the stride you've made

389
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,500
in taking this city.

390
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,375
[AINS]
Thank you for your kind words.

391
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,458
But we are as close as family.

392
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,250
Indeed, I consider you the
children of my dearest friends.

393
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,291
Therefore, you need
not hide your hearts

394
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,083
in such stifling formality.

395
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,125
No matter my title,
"Ains" will suffice.

396
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,250
As you wish, my lord.
My darling Ains.

397
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,000
[AINS] Nazarick shall hide
in the shadows no longer.

398
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,250
[AINS] This day shall be
known as the founding date

399
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:16,125
of the Sorcerer Kingdom
of Ains Ooal Gown!
