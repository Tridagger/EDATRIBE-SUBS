1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,750
[AINS]
Raise your heads.

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,166
[SERVANTS]
Lord.

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,000
[AINS] You all fulfilled
your roles splendidly

4
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,541
during our operation in
the kingdom of Re-Estize.

5
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,500
[AINS]
Sebas. Solution. Come forward.

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,833
[AINS] I'm certain the
information you gathered

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,958
will prove invaluable.

8
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,541
Therefore, I have
decided to honor

9
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,083
your diligent efforts
with a reward.

10
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,125
Sebas.

11
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,416
Lord.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,541
[AINS] You asked that
I spare Tuare's life,

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,208
and indeed I shall,

14
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,291
but I do so to repay a debt
to a prior associate,

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,583
not in response to your efforts.

16
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,583
Therefore I shall grant
you something else

17
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,750
that you desire, as well.

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,625
[SEBAS] Lord Ains, my only
wish is to devote myself--

19
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,958
[AINS]
If you hope to please me,

20
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,458
then I highly suggest you
accept my generosity.

21
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,291
[SEBAS]
My apologies. In that case,

22
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,875
I would ask for clothes

23
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,583
and other daily
necessities for Tuare.

24
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,583
[AINS] Granted. I shall
provide the necessary gold.

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,291
Perhaps she can accompany you
on a bit of a shopping date.

26
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,833
[SEBAS]
You jest, my lord.

27
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,125
[AINS]
Not at all.

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,500
Then you have my gratitude.

29
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,375
[AINS] Now, Solution,
tell me what you desire

30
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,291
so that I may grant it.

31
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,458
I would like to request

32
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,625
a small selection
of humans, Lord.

33
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,583
If possible, I would
prefer them to be alive.

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,208
And if those humans
were innocent as well,

35
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,875
that would give me
the utmost pleasure.

36
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,000
[AINS]
Living humans, you say? Granted.

37
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,583
However, I will not
allow innocent ones.

38
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,166
Forgive me, but I fear
I cannot grant your wish

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,875
exactly to your specifications.

40
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,125
[SOLUTION]
It's more than enough, my lord!

41
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
[AINS]
Next. Entoma.

42
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,291
[ENTOMA]
Lord.

43
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,000
[AINS] It seems that your
voice has yet to return.

44
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,000
[ENTOMA] Do you find
me repulsive, my lord?

45
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,541
[AINS]
Certainly not.

46
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,541
Your efforts are all
that matter to me,

47
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,083
and they have earned
you a reward.

48
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,500
[ENTOMA]
In that case, Lord Ains.

49
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,750
I would have the voice
of the woman who stole mine.

50
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,166
Should the need to
kill her ever arise,

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,708
I ask that you give me
the order to do it.

52
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,833
[AINS]
Ah, the girl with the mask.

53
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,500
She remains a mystery
to me. But very well.

54
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,333
I will call for you
if such a time arises.

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,000
[ENTOMA] You have my
gratitude, Lord Ains.

56
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,375
From the depths of my heart.

57
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,291
[AINS]
Mm.

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,125
[AINS]
Ah.

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,833
Mm. That's the stuff!

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,916
[AINS]
I had to get a bit creative,

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,333
but I finally found a way
to clean these bones of mine.

62
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,125
[AINS] Who knew a slime bath
would be so refreshing?

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,500
It didn't sound very
appealing at first,

64
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,875
but I wish I'd tried
this ages ago.

65
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,250
I can feel my gooey friend
slithering its way

66
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,250
into every nook and cranny.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,291
[AINS sighs]

68
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
[MOMONGA] This might be
the most Japanese thing

69
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,041
I've done since I
came to this world.

70
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,375
Hot baths are a
national pastime!

71
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,375
I may be all bones,
but a love for bathing

72
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,250
is in my blood for sure!

73
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,791
Well, not that I had
the time or money to enjoy

74
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,166
anything this fancy back home.

75
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,541
[MOMONGA] I wonder if I
embarrassed Sebas back there.

76
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,333
Tuare does dote on him, though.

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,416
Demiurge said they seem close.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
If they go on that
date in E-Rantel,

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,791
maybe I'll wear a
disguise and tail them.

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,500
Just kidding.

81
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,375
[AINS]
Still, as their supervisor,

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,500
it's my job to ensure
that my employees--

83
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,541
or subordinates--
enjoy their time off!

84
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,000
[ECLAIR]
Do not leave a single speck

85
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,791
of dust behind, understand?

86
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,291
--[MANSERVANTS] Yee!
--[MAIDS] Yes.

87
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,666
[ECLAIR] Heh! For, surely,
this Great Tomb of Nazarick

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,541
shall be mine to command soon!

89
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,000
[MANSERVANTS]
Yee!

90
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,458
[ECLAIR]
Mm-hm!

91
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,166
[ECLAIR] Why, I didn't
notice you standing there!

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,000
Lovely weather we're having.
A fine morning!

93
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,375
[ECLAIR]
Hm?

94
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,833
[FOIRE]
Looks like you're in top form

95
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,583
this morning, Cixous!

96
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,708
That's because I'm taking
care of Lord Ains today.

97
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:16,125
[LUPISREGINA] Oh! So you need
the extra calories, huh?

98
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,958
Whoa. Miss Lupisregina!

99
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,833
You just had to sneak up
on us, didn't you?

100
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,458
Goodness, you nearly
made my heart

101
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,708
leap out of my chest!

102
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,750
[giggles] Can you blame me?

103
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,250
That look on all your
faces was priceless!

104
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,041
I'll have to try this
back in the village.

105
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,458
[FOIRE]
What village?

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,000
These days, I've been working
at a human settlement

107
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,666
called Carne Village.

108
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,958
[LUMIERE] Humans, huh?
That must be taxing.

109
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,958
More like a total bore!
I was hoping for a gig

110
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,833
with a little more
excitement, you know?

111
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
[ECLAIR] Unhand me!
Unhand me this instant!

112
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,583
I have highly important
cleaning to do!

113
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,041
--[MAIDS shriek]
--[MAID 1D] It's CZ!

114
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,875
[MAID 1E]
Hey, CZ!

115
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
[CZ]
So there you are.

116
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,416
[ECLAIR] My insides! They're
about to become outsides!

117
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,000
[CZ] I wish you would stop
misusing Complete Invisibility.

118
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,666
I know, sorry!

119
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,083
[CZ] On top of that,
you started without me.

120
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,375
You said we'd have
breakfast together.

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,083
[LUPISREGINA]
Shoot, I forgot!

122
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
That sure did surprise me!

123
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm just happy we got
to see Miss Lupisregina.

124
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,708
[MAIDS chuckle]

125
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,583
[gasps]

126
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,041
[CIXOUS]
Gotta refocus.

127
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,541
I'm taking care of
Lord Ains today!

128
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,125
Okay! It's time to go!

129
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,375
[CIXOUS]
Good morning to you, Lord Ains.

130
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
[AINS]
Mm.

131
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,458
[AINS] Ah, always here
well ahead of schedule.

132
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,250
You are permitted to enjoy your
breakfast at the very least.

133
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,875
To be frank,
serving you is my joy,

134
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
and the greatest
honor in my life.

135
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,541
That goes for the
rest of the maids

136
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,666
and the eight-edge
assassins, as well.

137
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,708
[CIXOUS] We only come
early because, with you,

138
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,875
we treasure every moment.

139
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,208
[AINS] It was not my
intent to reprimand you.

140
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,416
But did you rest well yesterday?

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,416
I did!

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,708
In order to serve
the Supreme One

143
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,541
with every fiber of my being,

144
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,125
I ensured that I rested
most thoroughly.

145
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,458
[AINS]
I see.

146
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,125
[MOMONGA] It's like we're
running a sweatshop here.

147
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,208
[knocking]

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,833
[MOMONGA]
If I don't order them to rest,

149
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,458
they'll work
themselves to death!

150
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,541
Loyalty is nice,
but there's a limit!

151
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,708
And they're alive, so I
can't just reprogram them

152
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,333
like when they were NPCs.

153
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,500
[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains.

154
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,833
Lord Demiurge is here
to meet with you.

155
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,083
[AINS] If you're looking
for Albedo, she's off.

156
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,333
My lord. She's "off"?

157
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,416
[AINS] I requested that she
spend the day in leisure

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,458
with the other female
floor guardians.

159
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,000
And this

160
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,041
is something I put together
for the male floor guardians.

161
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,958
I had hoped to include Sebas,

162
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,041
but he's occupied
with Tuare today.

163
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,166
I'll invite him next time.

164
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,916
What is it?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,916
[AINS]
An information circular.

166
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,375
Come to me, my cavalry beast!

167
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,041
Whoa!

168
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,500
That's way more fancy
than a regular bicorn!

169
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Look his horns. And his
muscles are so taut!

170
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Indeed so!

171
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,125
He's truly worthy of the
title "War Bicorn Lord."

172
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,041
Although, technically,
any level 100 Bicorn

173
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,750
would look like this.

174
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,083
[AURA] I see. So what
do you call him, then?

175
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,958
A bicorn. I just said.

176
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,458
I don't mean its
species! Its name!

177
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,833
[ALBEDO]
Does he need one?

178
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,875
That's up to you
since he's your pet.

179
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,958
He's more of a weapon
than a pet, actually.

180
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,000
Also, I'm not quite certain
that I'm summoning

181
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,458
the same bicorn each time.

182
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,083
Well, you could
always ask Kyouhukou,

183
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,208
since he's so good
at summoning things.

184
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,416
I don't know if that expertise
applies to anything

185
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,041
other than cockroaches, though.

186
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,250
[ALBEDO]
Kyouhukou?

187
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,333
I know he's loyal to
Nazarick, so I feel bad

188
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,083
for disliking him,
but his appearance

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,958
is rather distressing.

190
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,666
Yeah. No kidding.

191
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,583
His family can never behave!

192
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,291
They skitter up in your clothes
and it's just the worst!

193
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,916
I can feel their
little legs now!

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,375
[SHALLTEAR]
That's enough!

195
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,750
You're making me positively
itchy! How vile!

196
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm relieved to see that
everyone is on the same page.

197
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,875
[AURA]
Back to the bicorn.

198
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,083
Are you gonna name him or not?

199
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,541
[ALBEDO] If I did, I would want
it to have a dignified name.

200
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,250
Something that
embodies my passion

201
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,291
and dedication for Lord Ains!

202
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,958
How about "Top of the World?"

203
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,541
[SHALLTEAR sighs]
Lord Ains certainly is

204
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,250
the top of the world, but is it
appropriate to ride on him?

205
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,541
[ALBEDO chuckles]

206
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,375
[growls]

207
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,791
Let's forget the name.

208
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,791
Hey, why don't you take him
for a quick test ride?

209
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,041
[BICORN whinnies]

210
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,750
[ALBEDO]
Am I doing something wrong?

211
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,375
[AURA] Get off for now.
We'll figure it out.

212
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,125
Yes. Right.

213
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,416
I see! You must be too
heavy for the thing!

214
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,750
I am not!

215
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,958
Even taking my armor and
muscle mass into account,

216
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,500
I'm well under the
recommended weight limit!

217
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,291
[BICORN whinnies]

218
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,416
[AURA]
He's acting strange.

219
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,291
[ALBEDO]
What could it be?

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,208
[SHALLTEAR laughs]

221
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,916
I'll look it up for you.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,041
You might drown in your own
ignorance at this rate.

223
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,166
An encyclopedia
by Lord Peroroncino!

224
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,208
This was a gift from
Lord Ains, by the way!

225
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,333
Let's see.

226
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,750
Bicorn.

227
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,708
B... i...

228
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,958
She shouldn't brag.

229
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,083
Lord Ains gave me this
wristband as a gift.

230
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,833
Just like my ring.

231
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,583
Although,

232
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,708
I wish I could receive
something a little more

233
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,125
personal from Lord Ains.

234
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,583
Something special
that's ours alone.

235
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,583
[SHALLTEAR]
I found it!

236
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,583
What's it say?

237
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
Give me a moment.

238
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,500
According to this entry, bicorns
are a symbol of impurity.

239
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,458
In terms of who is
capable of riding them,

240
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,583
they are the
opposite of unicorns.

241
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,375
While unicorns can only
be ridden by pure maidens,

242
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,916
bicorns can only be
ridden by impure ones.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,666
Huh?

244
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,208
[BOTH]
Huh?!

245
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,416
[SHALTEAR] Is there something
you want to tell us, Albedo?

246
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,875
What do you mean?

247
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,083
But you're supposed
to be a succubus.

248
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,625
How does that make sense?

249
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,708
'Kay.

250
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,416
[ALBEDO]
Not "supposed to be," I am one!

251
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,458
I'm sorry, but I don't have
any experience with men!

252
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,875
I've been too focused on
my job as a floor guardian,

253
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,333
waiting in the throne
room, day after day!

254
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,791
I hardly even talk to people.

255
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,000
Who am I supposed
to have sex with?

256
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,833
I'm ashamed to admit
it, but Lord Ains

257
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,250
hasn't summoned me
to his bed even once.

258
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,833
What about you Shalltear,
how is your love life?

259
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,750
[SHALLTEAR yelps]

260
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,791
I've only been
with girls, really.

261
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,666
[AURA]
Whoa!

262
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,083
Well, you know what it's like.

263
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,166
It's impossible
to find a good man.

264
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,416
Or more like the only
good one is a dead one,

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,791
but not if they're decomposing.

266
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,833
Right? Right?

267
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,458
I know I should just
smile and agree,

268
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,041
but this is absolutely twisted.

269
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,958
[ALBEDO] At any rate,
at least we know why I can't

270
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:27,583
ride the bicorn, as humiliating
and ridiculous as it is!

271
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,125
Actually.

272
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,416
Lord Ains might sleep with me
if I tell him it's for work!

273
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,958
[SHALLTEAR]
That's cheating!

274
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,708
Hah! This is all for
the sake of Nazarick!

275
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,375
Surely you wouldn't
let your jealousy

276
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,041
get in the way of our success!

277
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,250
Ha! Why would I be
jealous of a woman

278
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,791
who resorts to that?
It's not even love.

279
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
Just business!

280
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,125
[BOTH growling]

281
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,708
Hey, you two.

282
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,541
I doubt this is how Lord Ains
wants us to spend our day off.

283
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,416
But this is all new to me.
I'm not used to relaxation.

284
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,333
When you're not working,
what do you enjoy?

285
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,250
Admittedly, I spend
most of my time

286
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,416
patrolling the first
to third floors.

287
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,916
If I have a moment left over,

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,375
I might take a bath
or fix up my clothes.

289
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,125
A bath. Yes.

290
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,666
Now that I think about it,

291
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,541
we have a nice spa on
the ninth floor, don't we?

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,208
[HAMUSUKE grunting]

293
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,625
Growing strong, Hamusuke is!

294
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,541
That's great, Hamusuke!
Keep it up!

00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,625
[HAMUSUKE] Becoming a master
of martial arts, I am!

296
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,750
Well, that's not exactly
an easy feat to pull off.

297
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,416
Martial Arts require
an innate talent.

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,458
Give it my best effort, I shall!

299
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,416
Refuse to accept defeat, I do!

00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,333

Submit, you will!

[MARE]
Uh, sorry if I kept you waiting!

302
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,875
[PULCINELLA] Well, if it
isn't Lord Mare. Greetings!

303
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,416
Good to see you,
as always, Pulcinella.

304
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Might I ask what business
brings you here today?

305
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,250
[PULCINELLA] Nothing
complicated, I assure you.

306
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,416
As you know, I'm currently
under the employ

307
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,833
of Lord Demiurge, and he's
sent me here on his behalf

308
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,666
to make a small delivery.

309
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,625
I entrust it to you, young lord.

310
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,250
[MARE]
Uh, thanks for bringing it by.

311
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,583
Um, so, uh, what kind of
work has Lord Demiurge

312
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,583
been focusing on these days?

313
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,500
[PULCINELLA]
Breeding experiments.

314
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,083
Breeding between humans
and non-human species

315
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,750
is impossible, so they say!

316
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,833
A tragic limitation
this world has.

317
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,333
Even with the beauty of true
love binding two species,

318
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,791
their union cannot bear fruit.

319
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,250
My master is diligently
striving to rectify

320
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,500
this mistake of nature.

321
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,583
To give two poor
lovers a chance

to conceive a child!

Sorry. Those were more
details than you asked for.

And since you've received
the information circular,

325
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,208
I best be on my way.

326
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,916
To create such happiness
is a demanding job.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay. Well, thanks and
good luck with work!

328

Whoa. Okay!

00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,916
I better deliver this
to Cocytus right away!

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,166
Yeah.

337
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,791
[AINS] Such infernal discord!
I demand silence!

338
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,083
[AINS]
Silence. Hm.

339
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,625
Is this a good pose?

340
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,125
Might look cooler if I bent
my forearm inwards some.

341
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,250
[AINS]
Such infernal discord!

342
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,625
I demand silence!

343
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,833
[AINS] All right, I can scratch
that pose off the list.

344
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,958
Guess I should practice the
lines I use to buy time.

345
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
[MOMONGA sighs]
I'm just a normal

346
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,458
nine-to-five office drone.

347
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,833
How am I supposed to pull off

348
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,958
this supreme overlord routine
day in and day out?

349
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
[MOMONGA sighs]

350
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,083
[MOMONGA]
What do I do?

351
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,166
I need to present myself
with the admirable air

352
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,375
worthy of a Nazarick overlord.

353
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,291
But I gotta do it without
destroying the image

354
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,833
everybody has of Ains Ooal Gown.

355
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,958
Ah. I need a nap.

356
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,708
Get up, you sloth! Keep working!

357
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,750
[knocking]

358
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,416
[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains? It's time.

359
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,625
[AINS] Well, I suppose
that settles that.

360
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,333
[AINS] Guess I'll put
my practice to the test!

361
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,291
[MOMONGA]
Hell, yes!

362
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,708
Now that is how
a ruler takes a seat!

363
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,166
I mean, not that I know
how a ruler would sit,

364
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,500
but it felt right.

365
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,416
[AINS]
Now, then. Mare.

366
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,958
What've you brought me?

367
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,333
Uh, right!

368
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,208
I, um, well, it's a...
valuable document!

369
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,541
[AINS]
Why are you staring?

370
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,833
Is there something interesting
I'm unaware of on my face?

371
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,791
Wha-- Not at all, my lord!

372
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,125
Honestly, I was just admiring
how cool you are, Lord Ains.

373
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,333
[AINS]
I am? [laughs]

374
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
Well aren't you
adept at flattery!

375
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,291
I'm not trying to flatter you!

376
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,250
Uh. I...

377
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,041
I'm sorry, Lord Ains, excuse me.

378
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,083
It's just that...

379
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,375
I genuinely do
think you're cool!

380
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,791
I mean, right now,

381
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,125
that way you sat down,
your movement was so graceful

382
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,166
and yet so commanding!

383
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,458
[AINS]
I see. Thank you, Mare.

384
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,958
I'm truly happy to hear that.

385
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,416
Your words always
seem to have a way

386
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,583
of filling me with joy.

387
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,500
[AINS] And not only that,
but it fills me with gratitude

388
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,208
for my comrades.

389
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,833
Your comrades? Y'mean
the other supreme beings?

390
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,333
[AINS]
That's right.

391
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,875
I'm thankful that we created

392
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,083
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
together, and equally grateful

393
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
they carried onward
with their endeavor

394
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,041
until they created all of you.

395
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
And, of course, that includes
the two of you as well,

396
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
Albedo and Cixous.

397
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,250
You actually know my lowly name?

398
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,000
[AINS] I consider you all
to be my treasures.

399
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,833
[AINS]
I wouldn't even give you up

400
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,500
to Bukubuku Chagama herself.

401
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:55,541
[ALBEDO panting]

402
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,833
[CIXOUS]
Lord Ains. I can't stay silent.

403
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
And know I speak
for all of Nazarick

404
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,291
when I say this.

405
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,875
But of all the creators
who lived in this world,

406
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,958
we're so thankful you're
the one who stayed behind.

407
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,791
[CIXOUS gasps, grunts]

408
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,208
Forgive my tone.

409
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
I don't mean to
offend our creators,

410
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,416
nor do I mean to
speak so freely.

411
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,041
But. Please accept
our continued fealty!

412
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,500
Please, my lord!

413
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
[AINS]
I shall.

414
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,750
For I am the one ruler of
the Great Tomb of Nazarick,

415
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,500
your exalted master.

416
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,458
The fearsome yet fair,
Ains Ooal Gown!

417
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,458
[ALBEDO gasps]

418
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,416
[AINS] Now then, Mare.
Go wash your face.

419
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,875
[AINS yelps]

420
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,375
Oh, Lord Ains!

421
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,666
I've tried so hard, but I
can't hold back any longer!

422
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125
You are to blame, my lord!

423
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,791
[AINS]
What the-- Wait.

424
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
...after hearing your words!

425
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,375
And I'll be done long
before your assassins

426
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,250
--can try to pry me off of you!
--[AINS] Hang on! Huh?

427
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,916
[AINS] What in blazes
is wrong with you?

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,166
Get off me, Albedo! Hey, stop!

429
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,166
Leave my clothes alone and
quit gyrating like that!

430
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,916
[ASSASSINS]
Gone mad!

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,625
[ASSASSINS scream]

432
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
[ALBEDO moans]
Oh, Lord Ains!

433
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,000
[ASSASSIN 1B] What'd you
expect from the overseer

434
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,250
of the guardians?

435
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,708
[ASSASSIN 1C] Lord Mare,
we could use some help!

436
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,958
[ASSASSINS]
Hey, Lord Mare!

437
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,666
Uh, sure.

438
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,208
[ALBEDO] Give me but
a drop of your mercy!

439
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,958
Beautiful.

440
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,666
[ALBEDO]
Let it flow within me!

441
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,208
--Lord Ains! Lord Ains!
--[AINS] Will you calm down?!

442
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,916
[AINS] So you even look
like that when you bathe?

443
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,041
Well, being naked is his
normal state of being.

444
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,416
[COCYTUS]
Come now.

445
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,250
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't make me sound like

446
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,458
some sort of pervert.

447
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,916
[AINS]
Forgive me, Cocytus.

448
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,333
Your exoskeleton is very regal.

449
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,166
[COCYTUS]
You honor me, my lord.

450
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,458
[AINS]
Thank you, Mare.

451
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,833
I'll wash your back
next, if you'd like.

452
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,125
No! That's far too kind!

453
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,875
[AURA] Quite a mane you've
got down there, Albedo.

454
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,000
[ALBEDO]
You know, Aura,

455
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,708
you don't have to be
so crass about it.

456
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,375
[AURA laughs]

457
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,458
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains is bathing

458
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,583
just on the other
side of this wall.

459
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,666
I wonder if there's
a peephole around here?

460
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,291
[AURA]
Don't the guys do the peeping?

461
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,791
[SHALLTEAR] That doesn't
exactly apply to our situation.

462
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,833
After all, if Lord Ains
wants to see us nude,

463
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,666
he need only command
us to strip.

464
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,875
[AINS]
Uh...

465
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,333
[DEMIURGE]
My deepest apologies, Lord Ains!

466
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,250
The overseer of the guardians...

467
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,333
How dare she speak
in such a manner.

468
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,416
I'll tell her to stop at once!

469
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,916
[AINS]
No! Well. I mean.

470
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Albedo already
has enough stress.

471
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,291
This is her time to
cut loose and relax.

472
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,500
[DEMIURGE]
Of course, understood.

473
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,208
[rumbling]

474
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,000
[AURA]
Whoa, hey, what're you doing?

475
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,541
You can't just jump in
without rinsing off!

476
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,125
[AURA] What the...?
Is that stone lion moving?

477
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,500
[LUCIFER] Those who lack
bathing manners have no right

478
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,166
to enter the baths!

479
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,333
[LADIES scream]

480
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,750
[LUCIFER]
Suffer your divine punishment!

481
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,416
[COCYTUS]
A guardian of the baths?

482
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,541
I had no idea such
a creature existed.

483
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,791
[AINS] They don't.
That's Lucifer's voice!

484
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,291
It's his doing!

485
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,208
[DEMIURGE]
The supreme being?

486
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
[SHALLTEAR]
I can't even crack it!

487
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,166
This is no normal golem! Albedo!

488
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,750
[ALBEDO] Get out of here,
you golem-craft, pervert scum!

489
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,208
[AINS]
Don your armor and weapons.

490
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,375
We shall enter the women's bath!

491
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,541
I assume this is one
of Lucifer's pranks,

492
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,000
but we must rush to
their aid all the same!

493
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,250
[GROUP]
Lord!

494
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,416
[MOMONGA] So much for
our day off, I guess.

495
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
[ALBEDO]
Perish!

496
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,250
[AINS] The floor guardians
and servants gather

497
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,583
in the throne room

498
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,541
so that Demiurge and
Albedo can announce

499
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,708
the future plans of Nazarick.

500
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,875
I've no doubt such a capable
pair will convey our goals

501
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,666
with style and grace.

502
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,458
As a great ruler, my only
duty is to nod benevolently.

503
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,166
Hm? Hold on.

504
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,166
How did they come
to that conclusion?!

505
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,416
Chapter 2: "Carne
Village Once More."

506
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,541
Yes, it will be fine.

507
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,250
Everything will
proceed as planned.
