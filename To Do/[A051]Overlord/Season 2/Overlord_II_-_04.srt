1
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,458
To our glorious victory!

2
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,791
And to the ancestor spirits!

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,500
I fought Frost Pain.

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,083
Even knew about that
fancy ability it has.

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,833
"Icy Burst," you mean.

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,000
The ability's strong
but has limited uses.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,625
Even me knew that.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,750
[SHASURYU]
Hm.

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,166
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, but did you know the
weapon also has the power

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,958
to protect its user from the
most extreme cold possible?

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,125
It's not without
its drawbacks, though.

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,416
Drawback or no,
that do-or-die maneuver

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,125
wouldn't have worked without
Frost Pain's protection.

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,166
He's an amazing warrior.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah. Proud to call him brother.

17
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,291
You did well, too.

18
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,458
Thanks for having his back.

19
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,625
[ZENBERU]
So, it's back to life as usual?

20
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,166
[SHASURYU]
Doubtful.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,625
It's far more likely that we've
pissed off this "Great One"

22
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,208
and they'll decide to
attack us personally.

23
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,958
Then why isn't your
brother living it up

24
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,083
with the rest of us?

25
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,416
Last I checked,
he was still asleep.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,666
He and Crusch were
pretty exhausted.

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,958
We should let them rest
for a while longer.

28
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,875
Heh. Don't be an idiot.

29
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,666
We both know rest ain't
what's happening in that tent.

30
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,375
Don't make a nuisance
of yourself, y'hear?

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,833
[gasps]

32
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,333
[ZARYUSU gasps]

33
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,208
Hey, how's the baby makin'?

34
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,666
[CRUSCH, ZARYUSU yelp]

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,583
[AINS] Thank you for
assembling so swiftly,

36
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,416
my faithful Guardians.
We have much to cover.

37
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,291
Victim, come forward.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,166
[AINS] Take a moment
to introduce yourself

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,833
to the others.

40
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:59,625
[VICTIM] It's a pleasure to
meet all of you. I am Victim.

41
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,291
[AINS] Though you guard
the Eighth floor,

42
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,708
that is not the reason
I've called you here.

43
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,375
We have yet to identify
Shalltear's powerful assailant.

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,333
I doubt we have seen
the last of them,

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,500
and must consider
future incidents.

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,291
Therefore, to protect all
of the Guardians, myself,

47
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,958
and Nazarick. I must
use a powerful skill

48
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,208
that is only invoked
by your death.

49
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,583
I am sorry.

50
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,083
Though, I will bring you
back to life right away,

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
I hope you can forgive me.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,041
[VICTIM] Do not let it
bother you, Lord Ains.

53
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,166
Death is my purpose.
What I was born for.

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,791
If dying would be of use
to a Supreme Being

55
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,166
and the Tomb as a whole,

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,708
nothing would give
me greater joy.

57
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,916
[AINS] There is a motto our
members often lived by.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,916
I'm reminded of it now.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,541
"Greater love hath
no man than this,

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,333
that he lay down his life
for his friends."

61
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,583
Truly a sublime expression.

62
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,500
One that I believe
fits you perfectly.

63
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,791
I am grateful for your love.

64
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,500
[VICTIM] Your words are
more than I deserve.

65
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
[AINS]
Next up, Demiurge 

66
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,083
Lord?

67
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,958
[AINS]
First, allow me to honor you.

68
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,333
You always answer
my calls with haste.

69
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,000
You are too generous, Lord.

70
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,333
It is expected of me,

71
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,166
just as it is for all
of your humble servants.

72
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,625
[AINS]
Indeed.

73
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,791
I've inspected the sheepskin
parchment you provided.

74
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,916
It is evident they will stand
up to use as low-tier scrolls.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,250
Can I count on a
stable supply of it?

76
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,916
[DEMIURGE] Yes. That will
not be a problem, Lord.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,208
I have acquired an
ample number of them.

78
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,708
[AINS]
I see.

79
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,875
What is the name of the beasts
you've been harvesting?

80
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,750
Their name? Ah.

81
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,916
Would "Abelion Sheep" suffice?

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,291
The skin is similar.

83
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,333
As is their role
in your conquest.

84
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,958
[AINS]
"Sheep," huh? Interesting.

85
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,875
[MOMONGA] So, the beasts
are actually chimeras,

86
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,000
or, rather, a subspecies.

87
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,333
In Yggdrasil, chimeras
had the head of a lion

88
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,500
and a goat, and their
tails were snakes.

89
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,000
He must think that
a beast with sheep

90
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,291
mixed in is something different.

91
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,750
I think "Abelion Goat"
would be better,

92
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,541
but very well.
Continue your work.

93
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,041
Now. Shalltear.

94
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,416
[gasps] Yes, Lord?

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,041
[AINS] Regarding the
splinter in your soul.

96
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
Please. Master.

97
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,791
I can't reconcile
the shame of my sin

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,958
with the honor of my
position as Guardian.

99
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,291
I beg of you, punish me

100
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,125
for the reprehensible
monster that I am!

101
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:21,458
[AINS] All right. I will
settle on one later.

102
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,083
Lastly, Cocytus.

103
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,625
[COCYTUS growls]

104
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,625
[AINS]
You ended in defeat.

105
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,666
[COCYTUS]
Yes, Lord.

106
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,791
I am terribly sorry
for my offense.

107
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,833
I have dishonored
Nazarick. I was foo--

108
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,291
Cocytus!

109
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,291
Look your Master in the eye
when begging forgiveness!

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,833
[COCYTUS]
Of course. Sorry.

111
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,208
[AINS] I'm curious. Why do
you think you were beaten?

112
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,208
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains.

113
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,583
I cannot begin to atone

114
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
for losing the army
you entrusted to me.

115
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,333
[AINS] Enough. Let me make
this perfectly clear.

116
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,041
I don't intend to punish you
harshly for this defeat.

117
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,375
[COCYTUS]
Uh?

118
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,750
[AINS] The reason being
that everyone makes mistakes.

119
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,625
I don't care who they are.
That goes for me, as well.

120
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,041
[GUARDIANS gasp]

121
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,958
[AINS] That being said,
I would like to know

122
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,958
how you could have won.

123
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,458
[COCYTUS] I should have
acted more cautiously.

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,500
I underestimated the
Lizard Men's resourcefulness.

125
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,916
[AINS]
Yes, you did.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,416
Never underrate someone,
no matter how weak they are.

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,250
Is there anything else?

128
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,750
[COCYTUS] I think I may have
had insufficient information.

129
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,208
The enemy's strength,
the topography.

130
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,000
I realize that, without
considering such factors,

131
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,000
my chance of victory
was lowered regardless.

132
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,500
[AINS]
Mm.

133
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,166
[COCYTUS] Uh... A lack of
commanders was also a problem.

134
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,791
Since my soldiers
were low-level undead,

135
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,958
I should have placed those

136
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,625
with the ability
to lead in as needed.

137
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,916
[AINS]
Anything else?

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,708
[COCYTUS]
Apologies, my lord.

139
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,625
That is all I can think
of for the moment.

140
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,166
[AINS] Outstanding!
Except for the Elder Lich,

141
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,791
our losses were inconsequential.

142
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,125
Their demise has
absolutely no effect

143
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,041
on Nazarick's power.

144
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,875
And considering what
one of my Guardian's

145
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
has learned from this,
I'd say we've gained.

146
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,833
[COCYTUS] Your benevolence
knows no bounds, my lord--

147
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,833
[AINS] Hold on. The fact
remains that you lost.

148
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,291
For that you must be punished.

149
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,333
[AINS]
Cocytus!

150
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,416
You will personally
mop up that sludge

151
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,416
by exterminating the Lizard Men!

152
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,541
And, this time, you will
rely on no one but yourself.

153
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,208
[COCYTUS gasps]

154
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,083
Fantastic idea, my lord!

155
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,083
He will expunge his sin
and the Lizard Men

156
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:38,208
in one fell swoop! You truly
are a Supreme Being!

157
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,708
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains.

158
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,875
[AURA, MARE]
Huh?

159
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,125
[COCYTUS]
I must humbly make a request.

160
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,041
Please, Lord. Hear me out!

161
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,708
You have brought
defeat and disgrace

162
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,291
to the glory of Nazarick,

163
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,666
and now dare to
petition our master?

164
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,791
You forget your place, worm!

165
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,541
Insolence!

166
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,708
[AINS]
It's fine, Albedo!

167
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,416
You've surprised me, Cocytus,
and piqued my interest.

168
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,750
Lift your head and
make your request.

169
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,875
[COCYTUS gulps]

170
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,500
[AINS]
Don't keep me waiting.

171
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,791
I simply wish to know your mind.

172
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,083
Speak up, and let
it be known to all.

173
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,833
[COCYTUS] I am against
exterminating the Lizard Men.

174
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,375
I beg you, Lord Ains,
show them mercy!

175
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,666
The nerve of you!

176
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,125
Do you realize
you're challenging

177
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,583
the Supreme One's will?

178
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,208
[AINS] Albedo! Do not get
in the middle of this.

179
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,875
I beg your pardon.
Please, forgive me.

180
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,458
[AINS]
I am intrigued.

181
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,958
You must have a
pretty good reason

182
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,166
for making this request.

183
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,416
Something that will benefit

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,333
the Great Tomb of Nazarick
and its denizens.

185
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,791
Tell me what it is.

186
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,041
[COCYTUS]
Yes, Lord.

187
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,916
There is a chance
that valiant warriors

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,583
will appear among
the Lizard Men tribes.

189
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,583
It is my judgement,
that it would be

190
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,166
far more beneficial to have them

191
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
pledge their loyalty
to Nazarick.

192
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,625
Make them our subordinates.

193
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,458
[AINS] That is indeed
a convincing proposal.

194
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,333
If we were to use the
Lizard Man corpses

195
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,875
to create undead, I'm not
convinced they would be

196
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,333
much stronger than if
we used human corpses.

197
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,833
As such,

198
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,500
I see no reason to insist on
using them for that purpose.

199
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,416
[COCYTUS]
In that case--

200
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,625
[AINS]
However!

201
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,833
It would be more
cost-effective to use undead

202
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,833
created by me than to leave
the Lizard Men alive

203
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,666
and rule over them.

204
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,916
[COCYTUS]
Oh...

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,166
[AINS] If you can think
of any other benefits,

206
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,375
now is the time to voice them.

207
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,500
[COCYTUS]
Well...

208
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,250
[AINS]
How about it, Cocytus?

209
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,791
[COCYTUS]
Uh...

210
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,000
[AINS]
If you have nothing more,

211
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,541
then you won't mind
exterminating them, yes?

212
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,750
I see. That's too bad.

213
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,708
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains?

214
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,833
[AINS]
Hm. Speak, Demiurge.

215
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,208
Lord.

216
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,500
Instead of zombies, what if
we used the Lizard Men

217
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,625
in a governability experiment?

218
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,208
[AINS]
Hm. Interesting. Continue.

219
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,541
Yes.

220
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,208
The time will likely come
when we will be handling

221
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,958
different races simultaneously.

222
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,583
Why not practice?

223
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,833
We could use the
Lizard Men to that end.

224
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,750
Work out the kinks, and find
a means, other than fear,

225
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,708
to govern with for
when the time comes.

226
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,250
[AINS]
A terrific suggestion, Demiurge!

227
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,625
Thank you very much.

228
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,416
[AINS] We will then accept
Demiurge's proposal,

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,583
and shift from exterminating
the Lizard Men

230
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,291
to occupying them.

231
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,375
[GUARDIANS]
Lord!

232
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,875
[AINS]
Demiurge. I am impressed.

233
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,791
I appreciate the praise, Lord,

234
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,250
but I'm sure you
were already aware

235
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,625
of my proposal before
I even thought of it.

236
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,625
You were simply waiting
for Cocytus, yes?

237
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,333
[AINS chuckles]
You give me far too much credit.

238
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,833
All I wanted

239
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,375
was for him to display
his own thinking,

240
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,625
no matter what
it might have been.

241
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,833
Listen well, my Guardians!

242
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,750
Orders are not infallible law

243
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,000
that you must blindly
obey and carry out.

244
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,875
You must carefully consider
them before you act!

245
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,041
Always aim for the greatest
benefit to Nazarick!

246
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,833
[GUARDIANS]
We will!

247
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,833
[AINS]
Consequently, we must change

248
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,500
your punishment, Cocytus.

249
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,916
You will govern the Lizard Men,

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,666
and instill everlasting
loyalty towards Nazarick

251
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,458
within their hearts. Rule
through fear is forbidden.

252
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,833
[COCYTUS]
As you wish, Lord.

253
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,791
I swear on my life to
live up to the great mercy

254
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:16,041
you have shown me. Even if
it takes me an eternity.

255
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,333
[AINS] It's time to
move out, my Guardians!

256
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,166
I want one team as a decoy,

257
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,833
and another to flaunt our
power to the Lizard Men.

258
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,000
We'll put on one hell of a show.

259
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
Albedo, make ready our soldiers.

260
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,583
Activate Gargantua, as well.

261
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,208
By your command, Lord.

262
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,500
About the decoy.

263
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm assuming that
someone has enjoyed

264
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,666
peeking on us lately.

265
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,708
So, you're sending out
this dummy unit,

266
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,250
to keep our true intentions
hidden for the time being?

267
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,583
[AINS]
That is correct.

268
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,458
[ALBEDO]
Very good, Lord.

269
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,625
[AINS] All right!
It's time to get moving!

270
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,083
[COCYTUS]
Demiurge, you have my gratitude.

271
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,666
[DEMIURGE] Please. There's
no need for that, Cocytus.

272
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,125
For, you see, this is
probably the outcome

273
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
Lord Ains wanted all along.

274
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,833
[AURA, MARE]
Huh?

275
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,166
You mean everything
that's transpired

276
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,500
has done so according
to his design?

277
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,250
I should've known
that was the case!

278
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,708
But, if so, does that,
well, I mean...

279
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,708
I could be wrong about this,
but, did Lord Ains assume

280
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,625
that Cocytus would
lose from the get go?

281
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,916
Not so much "lose," perhaps.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,583
He may have been hoping
Cocytus would probe

283
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,208
the Lizard Men's strength
and ask for reinforcements,

284
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,125
rather than blindly
follow his orders.

285
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,083
Well, that's our
Lord Ains for you!

286
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,875
Ten steps ahead of the rest.

287
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,250
No wonder he assumed
the role of guild master

288
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,625
for the Supreme Ones!

289
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,708
Truly, no one was more
deserving of the throne!

290
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,666
[AINS groans]

291
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,000
[AINS giggles]

292
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,916
[MOMONGA sighs]

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,708
[MOMONGA]
That was freakin' epic!

294
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,416
Cocytus totally took
me by surprise.

295
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
In Yggdrasil, if you do anything

296
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,416
you don't have the skills
for, you're screwed.

297
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,833
But if Cocytus can gain
tactics and strategies

298
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,125
from this experience,
that just goes to prove

299
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,083
that everyone has a massive
potential for growth!

300
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,333
However, growth means change.

301
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,666
If my Guardians' skills
can change over time,

302
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,791
who's to say their loyalties
can't do the same?

303
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,125
Oh... That's a scary thought!

304
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,541
I wonder if there's
anyone around

305
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,833
who can teach me kingcraft.

306
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,791
[AINS] I suppose it's
about time I got ready

307
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,666
to move out, as well.

308
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,291
[AINS]
Hm?

309
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,875
[AINS sniffs]
There's a floral scent.

310
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,708
Have they been sprinkling
perfume onto my bed sheets?

311
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,333
Perhaps this is what
the wealthy are used to.

312
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,083
If so, I should
keep that in mind.

313
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,375
It could come in handy
when pretending to be rich.

314
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,375
[ZARYUSU]
I knew this might happen, but,

315
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,041
not this soon.

316
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,541
[CRUSCH gasps]
Look at them.

317
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,666
[ZARYUSU gasps]
Impossible.

318
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,166
[ZENBERU]
I noticed it, too.

319
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,500
Every one of them is
covered in magic equipment.

320
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,166
A mythical, undead army.

321
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,625
How'd the wind get
cold so suddenly?

322
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,375
I don't believe it.

323
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,875
[ZARYUSU]
Hm?

324
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,125
The only thing that could

325
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,416
change the air like this
is "Control Weather."

326
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Sixth-tier magic.

327
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,083
You're sure about that?

328
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,750
Ah. So, this must be the
power of the "Great One"

329
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,125
we keep hearing about.

330
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,125
[SHASURYU]
Remain calm!

331
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,208
Don't let fear rule you,
brave warriors.

332
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,000
The ancestors are watching.

333
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,041
Don't think or do anything
that would cause them

334
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,250
to hang their heads in shame.

335
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,875
What do ya think?

336
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,916
They're making their move.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,750
But it doesn't look like
battle preparations.

338
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,291
[ZENBERU]
Then what's the point of this?

339
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,583
Huh?

340
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
[LIZARD MEN gasp]

341
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,625
Is that the ruler of death?

342
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,375
What is that, Crusch?

343
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,375
I don't know. It's
completely new to me.

344
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,625
[LIZARD MEN gasp]

345
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,750
Everyone, to higher ground!

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,375
[ZENBERU]
I'm guessing we can be sure

347
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,166
this is the "Great One"
after that little display.

348
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,708
[ZARYUSU]
Most likely.

349
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,041
Well, I'm sold.

350
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,166
We don't stand a chance
against this thing.

351
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,041
Might as well be dung beetles
from where he's standing.

352
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,041
Am I hallucinating?

353
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,000
[ZARYUSU]
What is that thing?

354
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,833
[LIZARD MEN scream]

355
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,416
Hold on.

356
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,333
[ZARYUSU]
Is this a Royal procession?

357
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,375
[MESSENGER 4A] We carry a
decree from the Great One.

358
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,750
Our glorious master wishes
to converse with you.

359
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,458
[MESSENGER 4B]
Let your delegate step forward

360
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,500
and receive your judgement.

361
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,875
[MESSENGER 4C]
Know that time wasted

362
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,250
is displeasing to the Great One.

363
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,458
Do so at your own peril.

364
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,791
[gasps] He used
all those monsters

365
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,333
just so he could invite
us to speak with him?

366
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,958
That's crazy.

367
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,083
My brother.

368
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,125
Will you walk with me?

369
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:48,916
[ZARYUSU]
Hm!

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,750
[gasps]

371
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,833
[CRUSCH]
Zaryusu.

372
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,208
Don't worry. I'll be back.

373
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,083
You better be.

374
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,875
Thanks for this.

375
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,958
I would never let you
go alone, brother.

376
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,208
Besides, they might take a
single delegate as an insult.

377
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,833
And, if he decides to
make an example of us,

378
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,875
our newly formed tribe will
only have lost one leader,

379
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,791
and a lowly traveler.
I'm fine with that.

380
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,416
I'm Shasuryu Shasha,

381
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,291
representative of
the Lizard Men!

382
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,875
This is our mightiest warrior,

383
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,041
as well as the one
I call brother.

384
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,458
Zaryusu Shasha!

385
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,416
[AINS]
Hm.

386
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
Pathetic, as expected.

387
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,458
Demiurge, please teach
these lower life-forms

388
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,541
the proper posture to
adopt before our Master.

389
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,583
Prostrate yourselves!

390
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,500
Do not resist!

391
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
[SHASURYU, ZARYUSU grunting]

392
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,958
Lord Ains. I believe they
are ready to listen now.

393
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
[AINS]
Good work. Lift up their heads.

394
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,791
You are permitted to gaze
upon the Great One.

395
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
[BOTH gasp]

396
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,625
[AINS] I am the master of
the Great Tomb of Nazarick.

397
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,833
Ains Ooal Gown.

398
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,291
First, I shall express
my gratitude to you

399
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,041
for assisting in my experiment.

400
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,541
Now, onto the main subject.

401
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,416
Your race will
fall under my rule.

402
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,375
[gasps]

403
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,541
[AINS]
However,

404
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,000
I am sure that you do not wish

405
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,458
to come under the
rule of someone

406
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:24,500
against whom you have so
recently achieved victory.

407
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,541
Thus, in four hours,
I will attack again.

408
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,125
The attacker will be one
of my most trusted aids,

409
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,791
Cocytus, on his own.

410
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,791
If you are able to prevail
against him, as well,

411
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,083
then I promise to leave
your people alone

412
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,708
in peace from this day forward.

413
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,083
We surrender--

414
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,000
[AINS] I prefer you fight
instead of giving up

415
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,583
without trying.
That would displease me.

416
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,291
He's toying with us.

417
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,083
[AINS]
My business here is done.

418
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,166
You have four hours.
I suggest you use them well.

419
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,500
[SHASURYU] If I may ask,
will this ice melt away?

420
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,500
[AINS] Mm. That's right.
Fear not, I simply did not want

421
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,625
to dirty myself with your mud.

422
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,125
I will dispel my
magic's effect later.

423
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,250
[BOTH gasp]

424
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,250
[AINS]
Farewell, Lizard Men. Gate!

425
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,875
Till next time, if you live.

426
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:18,916
See ya!

427
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
Try not to get killed out there.

428
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,333
Um, please, take care
of yourselves, I guess.

429
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,291
[VICTIM]
I bid you farewell.

430
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
You are now free to move.

431
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,541
[chuckles]

432
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,041
Do try to enjoy your
last few hours, okay?

433
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,208
Curse all of them!

434
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,166
[SUKYU]
Feels like a ritual sacrifice.

435
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,041
So, what's the plan?

436
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,625
We'll call every warrior class
Lizard Men to arms, at once.

437
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,166
With all of us, we just might...

438
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,791
Could I ask that it
just be five of us?

439
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,333
If their goal is to demonstrate
their overwhelming power,

440
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,166
they are unlikely
to kill us all.

441
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,250
Especially if they
want to rule us.

442
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,791
If that's the case, we will
need a central figure

443
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,000
for the survivors
to rally around.

444
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,375
A sound argument.

445
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,166
Yes.

446
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,208
But... Who stay?

447
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,166
It won't be me. I'd
rather go down fighting.

448
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,833
Then that's what we'll do.

449
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,458
And Crusch will
lead the survivors.

450
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,750
Just a minute!

451
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm fighting, too!

452
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,541
Zaryusu, why are you
willing to be a martyr now?

453
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,458
Because our people have been
given a chance at living.

454
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,916
[CRUSCH growls]

455
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,208
I'll let the two of you
work this thing out.

456
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,166
See you all in four hours.

457
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,583
Crusch. Understand.

458
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,416
There's no way that I could!

459
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,583
We could still win, after all!

460
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:56,708
My powers could keep you alive
until we grasp victory!

461
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:00,875
I refuse to let the female
I love die like that.

462
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,833
[gasps]

463
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,791
Would you please
grant this foolish male

464
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,625
his dying wish?

465
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,875
That's not fair.

466
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,375
Sorry.

467
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,208
You know, you'll
probably die out there.

468
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,083
Yeah.

469
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,666
And you're asking me to sit back

470
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,916
and watch it happen,
after we've become

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,833
so attached to one another?

472
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,750
Yeah.

473
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,875
I'm so happy we met, Zaryusu.

474
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,833
But also, sad.

475
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,041
[gasps]

476
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,666
Huh?

477
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,208
Impregnate me!

478
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,291
[AINS] The Lizard Men have
come into direct contact

479
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,083
with the overwhelming
power of Nazarick.

480
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,250
For the sake of their species,
the warriors step forward

481
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,875
to the final battle.

482
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,708
Cocytus, the guardian
of the 5th floor,

483
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,291
is their one and only opponent.

484
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,833
In this last ditch battle,

485
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,416
he overwhelms them
with terrifying ease.

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,833
Chapter 5: "The freezing god".


487
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,208
The miracle is upon you.
