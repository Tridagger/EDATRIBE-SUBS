00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,583
there's a secondary entrance
somewhere in that building.

All right then.
If you're planning

to launch your attack
from the front,

why don't Climb and I
find the backdoor?

00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,291
He can keep watch
once we do that.

One more thing.

19
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,625
I'll take as many prisoners as
I can, but if anyone resists,

20
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,666
I will kill them
without remorse.

Killing's unavoidable
at this point.

arrest everyone in there.

That said, if one of them
happens to be a captain

them alive instead?

I may be considered your lesser,

181
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,666
at least when it comes
to prowess in combat.

182
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,083
That said, are you
able to discriminate

183
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,875
between reality and
utter fiction?

184
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,000
Multiple Vision.

185
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,375
Martial Art! Ability Boost!

186
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,125
Mental Enhancement!

187
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,166
[CLIMB grunts]

188
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,416
[yells]

189
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,208
[SUCCULENTS]
Scintillating Scotoma.

190
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,541
[CLIMB grunts]

191
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,291
[SUCCULENTS]
Wrong one!

192
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,500
Quick Evasion!

193
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,500
[CLIMB]
This one!

194
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,125
Fifty-fifty shot!

195
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,333
[SUCCULENT grunts]

196
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,458
[gasps]

197
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,958
I guess... I can't
say I've won yet.

198
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,333
But I can apprehend
Succulent, at least.

199
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,041
[grunts]

200
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,375
[SUCCULENT]
Unfortunately for you,

201
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,583
that's not going to happen.

202
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,333
Fox Sleep.

203
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,791
An illusion spell that
kicks in after an injury.

204
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,041
Nice swipe, by the way.

205
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,833
But, I'm afraid you
missed the mark.

206
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,291
And we're out of
time so, say goodbye.

207
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,625
[COCCO DOLL] Are you sure we
can't take him back with us?

208
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,000
[SUCCULENT]
Give me a break.

209
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,791
The kid's pals could come
rushing through the door

210
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,875
any second, and I don't
plan to be here.

211
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,375
You need to let it go--

212
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,083
[gasps]

213
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,875
[panting]

214
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,416
[CLIMB]
I can't quit yet.

215
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Not until I've repaid
Princess Renner.

216
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,458
I owe her too much to die!

217
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,833
How? How'd you...?

218
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,458
That should have been
a mortal wound!

219
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,541
You shouldn't be standing!

220
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,041
Why don't you just die!

221
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,500
What?

222
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,958
Your strength should
be drained by now!

223
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,708
[CLIMB grunts]

224
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,416
[yelps]

225
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,416
[SUCCULENT] Damn it.
I wasn't watching your feet.

226
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,958
[CLIMB panting]

227
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,000
So, you were running
on adrenaline, huh?

228
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,958
Figures. You're not
much of a fighter.

229
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,416
[BRAIN]
Not another step.

230
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,750
Huh?

231
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,416
Just in time I see.

232
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you waiting for?

233
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,916
Hurry up and kill them both!

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
If I try, he'll rush me,

235
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,791
and cut me down with
a single strike.

236
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,583
Ah-- Oh.

237
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,708
Easy now. You're badly hurt.

238
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,166
Do you have any magic items
that can heal the wound?

239
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,458
Uh-huh. In... bag.

240
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,916
Good man.

241
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,958
From here on out,
you'll face me.

242
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,833
And I'll make you pay for
what you did to him.

243
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,500
What should they put
on your tombstone?

244
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,041
I'm Lord Brain Unglaus

245
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,416
Unglaus? You gotta
be kidding me!

246
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,083
No way! It's really him?

247
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
[BRAIN] You know, the
old me might have been

248
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,083
swelling with pride about now.

249
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,083
Most of the people I've
met today already knew me.

250
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,875
But, things are a lot
more complicated

251
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,208
than they used to be.

252
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,458
Hey. We don't have to fight.

253
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,875
Why not call this
whole thing off, huh?

254
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,041
After all, we're two of a kind.

255
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,291
What we want--what we
<i>need</i> is power! Right?

256
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,000
There's a place for you
in Eight Fingers, Brain.

257
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,041
It's the perfect
organization for men

258
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,666
with our kind of
insatiable appetites.

259
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,541
You want magical items?
We've got plenty!

260
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,916
High-value weapons and
protective gear, too--

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,625
Enough with the sales pitch.

262
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,666
[gasps]

263
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,708
[BRAIN]
Is that all you people are?

264
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,916
What?

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
[BRAIN]
Hate to break it to you,

266
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,708
but, our power means nothing.

267
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,333
Not in this world.

268
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,083
Also, there's one
thing I've learned.

269
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,041
Strength on behalf of others

270
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,791
surpasses any one
person's might.

271
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe that lesson's sounds like
nothing special, but still.

272
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,625
I've learned it. Thankfully.

273
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,041
That's a shame, Unglaus, really.

274
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,041
I was hoping I wouldn't
have to kill a warrior

275
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,416
as gifted as you today,

276
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,875
but hey, life just
ain't fair sometimes.

277
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,416
Think that you can?

278
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Then, please, go on and show
me what a sell sword can do.

279
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,000
You've got me curious.

280
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,375
Are you mocking me?

281
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,000
That'll cost you dearly!

282
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,916
I'll kill you, then I'll slice
your little friend bit by bit!

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,333
Be extra careful.

284
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,791
Succulent uses
illusion techniques.

285
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,750
What you see isn't
necessarily reality!

286
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,375
Interesting.

287
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,166
I guess that does make
him a tricky opponent.

288
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,541
I'll finish this...
in one strike.

289
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,875
[SUCCULENTS]
What?

290
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Don't pretend like you
didn't hear me, Succulent.

291
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,041
Bring it.

292
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,583
[SUCCULENTS]
All right. It's your funeral!

293
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,666
[gasps]

294
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,208
[SUCCULENT groans]

295
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,041
[BRAIN]
My Field can detect anything,

296
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,583
even if it's been
turned invisible.

297
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,875
I saw you were going for Climb

298
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,666
while I was distracted
by your duplicates,

299
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,958
but you tried it with
the wrong opponent.

300
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,458
Life ain't fair sometimes.

301
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,041
One strike, just
like I promised.

302
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,875
[CLIMB]
Nicely done!

303
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,666
[SEBAS]
Indeed.

304
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,458
[groans]

305
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,333
[BRAIN]
When did you get here?

306
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,583
Why, just now, Lord Brain.

307
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,791
[CLIMB]
You did? Crazy.

308
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,458
I couldn't detect any
of his movements,

309
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,666
even with my Field up.

310
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,125
Lord Sebas...
who the hell are you?

311
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,500
[CLIMB]
All of the women have been

312
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,458
put in protective custody.

313
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,041
Thank you for all your help.

314
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,291
I have to stay here and deliver
the after-incident report.

315
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,666
I assume you're leaving?

316
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,916
Yeah.

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,666
I worked up a hell of
an appetite in there.

318
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,500
Farewell. Until we meet again.

319
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,125
[SOLUTION]
Welcome back, Lord Sebas.

320
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,541
We've been waiting for you.

321
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,166
Do not dawdle.

322
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,041
Lord Ains is here and does
not wish to be kept waiting.

323
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,916
[RENNER] Is that you,
Climb? Please, come in.

324
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,916
I'm sorry for being
gone so long, Princess.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,916
I was terribly worried.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,208
I couldn't help but
fear the worst for you.

327
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,500
Let's talk.

328
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,041
I want to know everything
that happened today.

329
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,750
[RENNER]
I see.

330
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,708
Tomorrow, or, at least
the day after that,

331
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,083
we'll be staging attacks on
seven of their facilities.

332
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,083
After your raid on the brothel,

333
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,958
we can assume that
Eight Fingers' security

334
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,458
will grow tighter
as more time passes.

335
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm so sorry.

336
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,583
I've jeopardized
your operations.

337
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,916
Please, don't let it bother you.

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,458
We've made our
intentions clear now.

339
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,875
In just one day,
they've lost Succulent,

340
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,875
as well as Coco Doll, the head
of their slave trade division.

341
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,916
This will be enough to
shake the very pillars

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,833
of their organization.
That is why

343
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:02,000
I plan to strike them again,
as soon as possible.

344
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,500
They'll have more
than a bloody nose

345
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,958
before they leave the city.

346
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,041
So how about it? You in?

347
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,000
Always, Princess.

348
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,041
It sounds like tomorrow
will be a rather hectic day.

349
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,000
Please watch yourself.

350
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,291
Right!

351
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,625
[GAZEF]
Wait.

352
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,875
Climb took on a
member of Six Arms?

353
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,125
Yeah!

354
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,375
He was in a bad way
when I got there,

355
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,375
but it looked like he had
Succulent cornered pretty good.

356
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,166
I'll be...

357
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,541
That said, he has no real
talent with the sword.

358
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,250
So much so, that when
I first saw him,

359
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,291
I pegged him as a poor
little kid playing knight

360
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,416
and vainly struggling for power.

361
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,833
But then, he faced
absolute terror.

362
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,375
The kind that rivaled the
monster I ran away from,

363
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,291
and he came out on top.

364
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:55,541
In that regard,
the boy's better than me.

365
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,541
It's hard to believe, ain't it?

366
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,791
Uh-huh. This world's
full of surprises.

367
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,166
The person who gave Climb

368
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,416
this "special" training
you mentioned is one thing,

369
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,000
but this monster you ran into
really piqued my interest.

370
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,208
Her name is
Shalltear Bloodfallen.

371
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,458
A vampire, most likely.

372
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,416
She stopped the technique
I made to beat you

373
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,541
with just one hand. Even yawned.

374
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,208
You don't say.

375
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,666
Do me a favor.

376
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,208
If you see her, don't try
to fight her. Just run.

377
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,166
Well, I appreciate the concern.

378
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,375
But, if anything threatens
my King or country,

379
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,583
I'll happily die to defend them.

380
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,958
Even if it's against this
"Shallty" monster of yours.

381
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,708
That's "Shalltear," got it?

382
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,083
Shalltear Bloodfallen!

383
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,916
Hey, careful. You'll get
some on the bread!

384
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
That's fine by me.

385
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,541
Anything to make these
moldy bricks taste better.

386
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,916
My sense of taste
is shot. I don't care.

387
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,541
Don't tell me yours
is, too, Unglaus.

388
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,458
No formalities. Call me
Brain from now on.

389
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,416
Okay. Only if you'll
call me Gazef.

390
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,416
[BRAIN]
Now that's more like it.

391
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,291
[CLIMB]
I'm off. Good night, Princess.

392
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,458
[RENNER]
Good night.

393
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,166
[RENNER] Now then,
who's the maid on duty?

394
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,125
Ah yes, the insolent wench.

395
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,666
[RENNER] The one I've
overheard making fun

396
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,083
of my precious Climb.

397
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,291
Let's see.

398
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,083
Which face am I
supposed to wear, again?

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,875
This is the smile
I use when receiving

400
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,958
others as a princess.

401
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,541
I think this one will do nicely.

402
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,875
[bell rings]

403
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,666
[knocking]

404
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,750
You rang, my princess?

405
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,333
I would like to take a bath.

406
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,625
Would you kindly draw
one for me, please?

407
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,750
Yes, right away, my princess.

408
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,750
[giggles]

409
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,625
You seem quite cheerful.

410
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,875
For good reason!

411
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,708
My Climb performed
an incredible feat today.

412
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,958
[MAID 7B] I'd say
congratulations are in order.

413
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,166
Agreed!

414
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,666
He put down a group
of terribly evil men.

415
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,791
Then, he freed some
unfortunate souls

416
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,000
who had been held captive...

417
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,166
[RENNER] I'll kill her.
Just like the rest.

418
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,416
[MAID 7B]
That's incredible!

419
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,166
[RENNER] And if anyone
else dares to make fun

420
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,208
of my precious Climb...

421
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,208
[RENNER]
...I'll kill them, too.

422
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,916
I'll have to apologize
to Coco Doll

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,666
next time I see him.

424
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,833
I thought Succulent would
be able to handle things,

425
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,375
but I guess I was wrong.

426
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,750
This place still fell
like a fort of straw.

427
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,666
[EDSTROM chuckles]
Succulent's a fool.

428
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,416
Just say the word,
and he'll breathe his last.

429
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,333
A fool he may be,
but he has his uses.

430
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,583
Reach out to the count.

431
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,375
I want him back on the
streets within the day.

432
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,916
[MALMVIST]
So, what do we do? Step back?

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,333
I see no benefit in retaliating.

434
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,916
The losses we'd take
are too great.

435
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Don't be ridiculous.

436
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,541
We have to make an example out
of those that hit the brothel.

437
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,208
Six Arms has a
reputation, after all.

438
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Don't even consider
losses at this point.

439
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,791
Undead King, Davernoch.

440
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,333
Spatial Slash, Peshurian.

441
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,416
Edstrom, the Dancing Scimitar.

442
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,333
And Malmvist,
of the Thousand Kills.

443
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:39,583
We'll handle this ourselves,
and we'll do it our way.

444
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,125
Whoever attacked us
will soon know

445
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,083
the true meaning of suffering.

446
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,000
By the time we're
through with them,

447
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,000
they'll be begging for
death and hellfire.

448
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,791
[AINS] A report of Sebas's
possible betrayal reaches Ains.

449
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,583
[AINS] It is hard to believe
that the fiercely loyal Sebas

450
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:02,500
would ever betray Nazarick,
but the truth must be confirmed.

451
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,125
Sebas responds to the summons.

452
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,208
Meanwhile, Renner has an
interesting conversation

453
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,708
over tea at the castle.

454
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:15,416
Chapter Ten: "Disturbance begins
in the royal capital."


455
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,791
Tell me what you treasure most.
