a proper chain of command.

brigades centered around

No.

consisting of only the chiefs.

Taking out their leader
may be the only way to win.

170
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,625
And if he's protected
by stronger foes,

171
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,625
it will take our
strongest to do the job.

without commanders, too?

until the enemy strikes.

179
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,666
Make sure no one wastes
a single moment.

180
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,708
[COCYTUS]
Message.

181
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,125
[COCYTUS]
Attention all forces. Advance!

182
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,541
[AINS]
Report.

183
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,708
Has Cocytus begun the
attack on their village?

184
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,875
[ALBEDO] Yes. According
to Entoma's report,

185
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,750
nothing on the field has
exceeded your expectations.

186
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,958
As you ordered, Lord Ains,

187
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,541
Cocytus is remaining
at the command post,

188
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,791
and they are attacking with only
the forces they have been given.

189
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,000
[AINS]
I see.

190
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,375
It isn't the outcome
I was hoping for,

191
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,833
but we may yet get
something out of it.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,250
Ah--

193
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,916
It begins.

194
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,875
Everyone!

195
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,583
We've been preparing
for this moment!

196
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,916
We know, the enemy is great.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,583
But there is nothing
to be afraid of!

198
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,333
For the first time in history,

199
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,583
we have ceased to be
separate tribes.

200
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,083
Through this alliance,
all Lizard Men are now one!

201
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,375
I know our ancestor spirits
are proud of what they see.

202
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
And they will protect us!

203
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
For them, we will
send these bastards

204
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,416
back to the grave!

205
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,291
[LIZARD MEN yell]

206
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,708
To victory!

207
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,416
[LIZARD MEN cheer]

208
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,791
They're using the cavalry
to flank our line

209
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,750
so they can surround
and crush them.

210
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,250
Then it's time for us to make
our first play, as well,

211
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,791
don't you think?

212
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,250
[HEAD GREEN CLAW HUNTER]
Shoot them!

213
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,291
[LIZARD MEN screaming]

214
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,583
[ZENBERU] Are they thumbin'
their noses at us?

215
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,250
[SHASURYU] I can't make
sense of their strategy.

216
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,375
Is it possible they're acting
without a commander?

217
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,500
If so, they must think they
can win by numbers alone.

218
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,375
Bastards are mocking us.

219
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,125
Still, we should
reduce their force

220
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,375
as much as possible before
they make their next big play.

221
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,708
Tch. I hate waiting around.

222
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,583
[KYUKU]
Patience, Zenberu.

223
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,875
We'll reveal the elite
unit once their leader

224
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,458
graces us with his presence,

225
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,541
then you'll have all the
action you can handle and more.

226
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,333
[gasps]

227
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,166
[CRUSCH]
Incredible.

228
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,500
Summoning swamp elementals
that fast isn't easy.

229
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,166
We can do truly amazing
things working together.

230
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,500
Indeed.

231
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
After that last war,

232
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,208
all we did was exchange
bits of information.

233
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,916
Once this battle's behind us,

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,041
there are many things
I would like to try.

235
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,041
[CRUSCH]
I couldn't agree more.

236
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,916
[COCYTUS] I underestimated
the Lizard Men's morale.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
They're resilient.

238
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,958
[COCYTUS]
Message.

239
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,708
Demiurge.

240
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,875
[DEMIURGE]
Hello, my friend.

241
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,541
Why are you messaging me?

242
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,333
Aren't you in the
middle of a campaign?

243
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916
[COCYTUS]
Actually...

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,666
[DEMIURGE]
I see.

245
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,833
Still, that doesn't explain
why you reached out to me.

246
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,583
[COCYTUS]
I need advice.

247
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,791
If this defeat were mine
alone, I could accept it.

248
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,250
But, if this continues,
I will disgrace the Supreme One,

249
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,000
and that cannot happen.

250
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,708
[DEMIURGE] Are you sure
Lord Ains wanted you to win?

251
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,208
[COCYTUS] I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

252
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,083
Think about it.

253
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,750
Why did Lord Ains raise an army

254
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,833
of such low-level
servants for you?

255
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,708
It's possible that
this was a test.

256
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,166
Perhaps he wished for you
to think for yourself.

257
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,833
To gather intelligence
on the enemy

258
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,708
and adjust your strategy
to ensure victory.

259
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,416
This could be a plan
to promote your awareness.

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,958
[COCYTUS]
Hm...

261
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,250
Additionally, Nazarick and
Lord Ains were never mentioned.

262
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,583
And you were forbidden from
joining in the battle yourself.

263
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,250
--Which would mean...
--[beeping]

264
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,000
[COCYTUS]
Hm. Demiurge?

265
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,500
[DEMIURGE]
I'm sorry, Cocytus.

266
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,708
Something urgent has come up
that I must attend to.

267
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,458
I wish you victory.

268
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,166
[COCYTUS] It's too late to
find out anything useful here.

269
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,250
I have no choice but
to send in the reserves.

270
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,500
[COCYTUS]
Elder Lich Iguva.

271
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,791
I have a task for you. Advance!

272
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,875
Show the Lizard Men your might!

273
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,958
[yells]

274
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,625
[HEAD GREEN CLAW WARRIOR]
Okay, get the seriously wounded

275
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,916
back to the village!

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,333
The rest of you, follow us!

277
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,000
We're taking the fight--

Retreat!

281

That one isn't like
the other rabble.

282
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,291
Head back and tell
the chiefs about this!

283
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,708
We'll make sure
you aren't roasted!

[WARRIOR 3A]
Just don't take too long!

285
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,583
Running won't save you, pests.

286
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,000
I will ensure His victory.

00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,416
It looks like we're up
this time, that's for sure.

292
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah. That one is
far more powerful.

293
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,333
Perhaps the commander
we've been waiting for.

294
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,041
Even if it isn't, it's obvious
he's their ace in reserve.

295
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,458
Agreed.

296
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,166
But how are we supposed
to get close enough?

297
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,166
The range of his spells
has to be at least 100 meters.

298
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,041
You're right. There is a way.

301
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,833

will succumb to my hellfire

closes the distance!

Then I'll have to
switch things up a bit.

00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,625
Very well. Summon Undead four!

You ingrate!

325
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,416
That was your last
chance at mercy.

326
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,875
Your suffering will be such

327
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,791
that in the end
you'll beg for death!

00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,541

back to the pit

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,583
I'll feed it to the bugs.

353
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,291
[yells]

354
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,291
[screams]

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,250
Damn you.

356
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,791
I am a servant created
by the Great One himself!

357
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:02,125
I refuse to fall
to a filthy reptile!

358
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,625
I will feel your bones
crush in my hands!

359
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,875
Now, die, Lizard Man!

360
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:19,458
[ZARYUSU]
Rororo. Zenberu. Crusch.

361
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,083
[ZARYUSU growls]

362
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,958
Impossible! How are you moving?

363
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,291
Tell me how!

364
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,458
[ZARYUSU]
You're... finished!

365
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,416
Please. Forgive me, Lord Ains.

366
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,375
[LIZARD MEN cheer]

367
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,166
[LIZARD MAN 3K]
The traveler did it!

368
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
[ENTOMA]
'Scuse me, Lord Cocytus.

369
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,875
Lord Ains has requested
your presence at once.

370
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,958
[COCYTUS]
Understood, thank you.

371
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:18,416
[COCYTUS] Nicely done.
But, it was truly a close one.

372
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,333
[AINS] The Lizard Men
successfully survive the horde

373
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,291
of undead that was
sent against them

374
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,750
and celebrate their
unexpected victory.

375
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,375
Meanwhile, the defeated Cocytus
in summoned back to Nazarick

376
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:07,583
to explain his defeat
before his master.

377
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,125
Ains does not blame the
apologetic floor guardian

378
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,625
for his loss.

379
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,375
[AINS] Chapter 4:
"Army of Death".


380
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,250
What will you gain
from this experience.
