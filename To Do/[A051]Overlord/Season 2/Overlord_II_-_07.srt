00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,708
[AINS] First up, the
supplemental funds for Sebas.

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,625
Next, is the reconstruction

3
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:22,541
and equipment fund for
the Lizard Men villages.

4
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,416
That leaves...

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,666
[MOMONGA]
Freakin' chump change!

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,791
[MOMONGA]
Dammit all.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,875
Why is there never enough money?

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,416
Maybe I should find a merchant
with deep pockets to sponsor me.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,916
No. Momon is highly respected.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,333
I can't have people thinking
he's only in it for the money.

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,416
Still. I really need the cash.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,958
[knocking]

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,208
[AINS]
Enter.

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,375
Do you have news?

15
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,958
Yes, Mr. Momon, sir.

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,916
[AINS]
She's still doing that.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,833
It's become a verbal
tic at this point.

18
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,000
[AINS]
What is it?

19
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,541
Forgive my intrusion,
but I thought

20
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,541
you would like to know
the iron ore you requested

21
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,208
has arrived and the merchant
is waiting for payment.

22
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,333
[AINS]
Excellent.

23
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,625
Take this and thank him for me.

24
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,708
May I ask why you ordered it
from so many different sources?

25
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,500
[AINS]
It's an experiment.

26
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,083
I'm learning how
the Exchange Box

27
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,250
appraises things in this world.

28
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,916
Understood, sir.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,333
Then I will retrieve
the ore and report back.

30
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,458
[AINS]
Good.

31
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,458
And if the situation
should turn ugly,

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,125
how will you handle it?

33
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,583
Safety takes priority.

34
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,666
I will withdraw immediately.
Once I'm clear.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,333
I will relocate to
the dummy Nazarick,

36
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,916
that Lady Aura constructed,
with all due haste.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,708
And, in doing so,
confuse our enemies.

38
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,291
[AINS] Good. Avoid routes
with large crowds

39
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,208
where you can
easily be attacked.

40
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,875
And should any bystanders
accost or cat-call you,

41
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,916
do not injure them severely.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,625
Keep your bloodlust in check,

43
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,625
and refrain from calling
humans "worms" or "insects."

44
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,458
Remember, we are
high-ranking adventurers.

45
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,041
Both our reputations
hinge on your restraint.

46
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,083
Right.

47
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,916
[AINS]
That is all. Good luck.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,333
Sir.

49
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,791

Lord Stronoff.

55
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,708
There's no point in
overdoing it. Rest up.

56
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,625
Yes, you're right, of course.

57
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,583
Am I now?

58
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,583
If you really took
stock in my advice,

59
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,875
I wouldn't have
to waste my breath

60
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,708
reminding you every day.

61
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,916
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

62
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,250
Since you won't rest,
how about a practice match?

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,250
With you, sir?

64
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,708
Just recently,

65
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,458
I was shown how
callow I truly am.

66
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,500
I'd like to train with someone
who has a little resilience.

67
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,875
Callow? You, Lord? No way.

68
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,375
Yup.

69
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,875
If not for the aid of a merciful
and awe-inspiring caster,

70
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,083
there's a good chance

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,125
I wouldn't be standing
here right now.

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,875
What sort of magic
caster could do that?

73
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,166
His name is Ains Ooal Gown.

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
He is incredible.

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,000
Even the Baharuth Empire's
freakish wizard

76
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,750
wouldn't stand a chance.

77
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,833
At least, that's what
I think of him.

78
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
I'll be sure to remember him.

79
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,375
You can count on that, my lord.

80
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,666
But are... you sure
you wanna train

81
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,000
with someone as
inexperienced as me?

82
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,125
It's not training.
Just practicing with swords.

83
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,791
Whether you learn something from
it or not is entirely up to you.

everything you've got.

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,916
If you won't, that's fine.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,166
I will!

Just because a sword
is all I'm carrying

92
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,416
doesn't mean you should
focus your attention on it.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,666
Change that, or you'll
wind up on the floor again.

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,291
Right.

95
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,666
Oh.

Very good, Climb.

been done after that.

on me for safety.

Fine. Then stop waiting for me!

Thank you very much, my lord.

00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,416
You really are amazing,
you know? How did you...?

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,208
If you're asking how
I got this strong,

129
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,291
you're out of luck.

130
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,708
I don't have a good
answer for you.

131
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,041
I simply have a talent
for the art of combat.

132
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,250
But, Climb, you have
that same talent.

133
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,958
All you have to do is hone it.

134
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,583
[CLIMB]
You think so?

135
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,791
Yeah.

136
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,166
But that formal training
is holding you back.

137
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,333
You can't help but focus on
fighting with the sword alone.

138
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,375
That'll get you killed
in the heat of battle.

139
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,625
The sword is just one
means of attacking.

140
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,125
Try to incorporate your hands,
feet, knees, elbows--

141
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,583
your whole body
into your method.

143
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,333
like a muddy
adventurer, that is.

144
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,083
I learned a lot from you today.

00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,708
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,083
That strike from above
is one of your best abilities.

147
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,833
However, you should think about

148
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,375
what you're going to do
next as a follow through.

149
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,125
Right! I will!

00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,250
[VICE CHIEF]
Chief Warrior.

00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,125
If you'll excuse me.

152
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,125
What is it, Vice-Chief?

153
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,083
This is bad, sir.

00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,500
The boy is bodyguard
to the Princess.

155
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,750
If word got out that he fought
the chief royal warrior,

156
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,416
and either of you lost,

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
the Noble Faction
would have a field day.

158
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,625
I just wanted to
spar with someone

159
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,875
who could keep me
on my toes for a bit.

160
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,458
[VICE CHIEF] Well, I don't
think anyone saw you,

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,083
but you should be more
careful from now on.

162
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,875
His common heritage
is only compounded

163
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,541
by the fact that he's an
orphan from God knows where.

164
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,791
The Noble Faction's antipathy
toward him is pretty strong.

165
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,791
So, do you think you
can help him improve?

166
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,666
Sadly, he's as strong
as he's ever going to be.

167
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,166
He's what adventurers would
call "capped at gold."

168
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,125
But while he's limited
by his ability,

169
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,916
he's not limited by experience.
Only time will tell.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Hold on.

171
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,666
Gazef, is that Prince Zanac
with Marquis Raeven?

172
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
Why would someone
of the Noble Faction

173
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
be with the Prince?

174
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,666
Does he intend to switch
to the Royal Faction?

175
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,833
Very possible--

176
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,500
that Marquis is a
shameless opportunist.

177
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,791
Wouldn't shock me
to see him anywhere.

178
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,500
Who knows what he's
working behind the scenes.

179
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,000
[gasps]

180
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,958
Ah, the ever-dutiful Climb.

181
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,208
On your way to visit
that monster, I presume?

182
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,250
I am.

183
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,041
With all due respect, Highness,

184
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,833
Princess Renner is a kindhearted

185
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
and beautiful treasure
of the kingdom.

186
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,958
I'm not the one who
called her a monster,

187
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,458
and I will deny anyone
who says otherwise.

188
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,375
[gasps]

189
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,541
But a "beautiful
treasure," well,

190
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,000
considering the money
she's wasted on commoners

191
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,166
and the prohibition
of transit-tariffs.

192
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,708
I hardly think "treasure"
is appropriate.

193
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,000
Highness.

194
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,791
I believe Princess Renner
proposed the measure

195
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,875
that abolished the slave
trade within the kingdom.

196
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,208
Surely that has merit.

197
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,833
A rare exception, that.

198
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
But what about
the others, Marquis?

199
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,875
She knows her goal
is impossible,

200
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,208
so she throws darts in the dark
with no regard to who she hits.

201
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm certain she wouldn't
do such a thing, Lord.

202
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm sure you are.

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,875
Would you deliver a message
to that monster for me?

204
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,791
If given the chance,
our elder brother

205
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,833
will use her as a
political instrument,

206
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,583
but if she works with me,
he will graciously relieve her

207
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,791
of her title as Princess
and grant her a comfortable

208
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,750
plot of land out
in the frontier.

209
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,333
[gasps] Surely you jest, Lord.

210
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
I'll pretend I didn't
hear that, for your sake.

211
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,750
What a shame. I thought
it was quite good.

212
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,333
[ZANAC]
One more thing.

213
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,416
Marquis Raeven and I
are of the same mind

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,041
when it comes to that
girl and her "policies."

215
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,541
I dare say our joining
forces will prove to be

216
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,291
the last nail in Renner's
proverbial coffin.

217
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,666
Prince Zanac.

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,333
Don't worry about it, Marquis.

219
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,833
I'm fairly certain that
monster is quite aware

220
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,791
of our opinion of her.

221
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,833
[MAID 7A] Goodness, what's
a commoner doing in here?

222
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,000
[MAID 7B]
The princess has bizarre tastes.

223
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,291
[MAID 7A]
Definitely.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
[sighs]

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,250
[CLIMB]
Pardon me.

226
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
I was wondering where you were.

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,791
Morning, Princess.

228
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,166
Sorry I'm late. Lady Aindra.

229
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,750
Uh.

230
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,041
Oh, her. She's a
member of my team.

231
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,500
[RENNER]
This is Tina.

232
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,291
My apologies. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

233
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,000
My name is Climb.

234
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,916
I'm well aware
of your exploits--

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,958
of all Blue Rose's
members, in fact.

236
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
You're practically
living legends.

237
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,416
[TINA]
Pleasure.

238
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
Thanks for looking after
my fiendish boss' friend.

239
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,208
We were just getting to
the meat of the discussion.

240
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,500
Why don't you join us?

241
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,375
I'm your bodyguard.
It would be inappropriate.

242
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,250
[LAKYUS]
It makes no difference to me.

243
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,750
My lady. I couldn't possibly.

244
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,916
Enough with formality.
Just call me Lakyus.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,125
Special men get that privilege.

246
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,250
"Special"?

247
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,875
Please don't joke
like that, my lady.

248
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Wait, she was joking?

249
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,083
'Course I was, sweetie.

250
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,916
I mean, Climb is special,
don't get me wrong,

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,666
but it's because he's your man.
I was just having fun.

252
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,166
You're incorrigible.

253
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,958
Now, sit down and drink
before your tea gets cold.

254
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,916
Don't worry, Tina's
the only one who bites.

255
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,166
[RENNER] Now, back to
what we were discussing.

256
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,166
About Eight Fingers, right?

257
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,500
Where'd we leave off?

258
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,458
I'm pretty sure I covered
how we burned the fields

259
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,291
they used for producing
Black Dust materials.

260
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,750
Yes.

261
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,291
On that note, I can't thank
you and Blue Rose enough.

262
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,875
My brother and the
nobles do nothing

263
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,208
but quarrel among themselves.

264
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,416
If they keep allowing
Eight Fingers to secretly

265
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,458
do business in the
kingdom's shadows,

266
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,000
it will fall into ruin.

267
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,833
Our nation will crumble
from the inside out.

268
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,875
However,

269
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,291
I don't have any
influential backing

270
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,208
or a military force
at my discretion.

271
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,291
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,750
It's just, since
Eight Fingers has ties

273
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,458
to the noble and royal factions,

274
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,208
I must put the burden on
adventurer's like Blue Rose.

275
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,791
No need for apologies.
We're friends, after all.

276
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,208
Tina, give her the parchment.

277
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,041
[LAKYUS] We found this in
the village where they were

278
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,708
producing Black Dust.
Know what it is?

279
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,583
It's a substitution cipher.

280
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,208
[BOTH gasp]

281
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,666
Interesting.

282
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,291
I wonder why they
left it behind?

283
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,125
A trap? Or for
some other reason?

284
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,291
And if it was a trap,
why use something so hard?

285
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,416
Be right back.

286
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,916
I have a hunch that
cracking this code

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,625
will prove fairly easy.

288
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,875
Unbelievable.

289
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,166
You got that right.

290
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,500
I don't understand
why she thinks

291
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,458
she's powerless to help anyone.

292
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,416
Of all the people I know,
she's the only one

293
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,208
I would call a genius
and mean it.

294
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,708
Well, it isn't orders from
their higher ups, sadly.

295
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,500
But it is a list of
villages and buildings.

296
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,750
Seven of which
are in the capital.

297
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,541
Do you think they're
Black Dust stockpiles

298
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,000
or other critical
production sites?

299
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
I doubt they'd leave
anything that important

300
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,625
at a production site or
written in such an easy code.

301
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,666
I think... it was bait.

302
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,041
[BOTH]
They tricked us?

303
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,583
[RENNER] Not exactly.
Eight Fingers is divided up

304
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,416
into eight different
organizations, right?

305
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,250
Yeah, that's the rumor, anyway.

306
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,958
There's smuggling,
slave trading, gambling,

307
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,166
illegal drugs and each
one has its own chief.

308
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,916
Then I believe these are bases
for the other organizations.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,791
They need our
attention diverted

310
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
until they can get
things back on track.

311
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,125
And they're using their
own partners as bait?

312
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,916
That underground brothel's
not on the list.

313
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,041
[LAKYUS]
What is it?

314
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,333
I'm confused.

315
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,041
I thought that
such establishments

316
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,541
had been done away with
thanks to the princess.

317
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,791
Mostly.

318
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,291
Abolishing the slave trade
did a lot of good.

319
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,916
But, unfortunately,
one Eight Fingers brothel

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,708
is still active
here in the capital.

321
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,333
Tell me, Renner,
what would you say

322
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,791
to Blue Rose raiding the place
and putting an end to it

323
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,208
once and for all?

324
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,208
If it turned up some
evidence as a result,

325
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,416
it would strike a powerful
blow against the nobles

326
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,458
who are in bed
with Eight Fingers.

327
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,958
I appreciate your willingness,
but I would hate

328
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,416
to create trouble for
you and your family.

329
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,166
On the other hand,
it would be too much

330
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,708
for Climb to handle alone.

331
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm terribly sorry for my
lack of strength, Princess.

332
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
Forgive me, Climb,
that was careless!

333
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,375
That isn't what I was
implying at all, okay?

334
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,791
I rely on you more
than anyone, Climb.

335
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,083
I can't begin to thank you
for how hard you work,

336
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,083
even when you don't
think I'm looking.

337
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,875
Just, please, don't do
anything too foolhardy.

338
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,625
In fact, I order you not to.

339
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,416
You see, if anything
happened to you, I'd...

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,750
I would...

341
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,625
[clears throat]

342
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,208
In any case, while we
can't ignore the brothel,

343
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,791
we should discuss the other
locations on this paper

344
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,375
and what to do about them
before they catch on.

345
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,375
You're right. We should take
advantage of the opportunity.

346
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,458
They still haven't
realized we're responsible

347
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,000
for the village attack.

348
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,875
However, they have got to
know that this information

349
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,250
has been leaked by now.

350
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,333
Is it okay if we borrow
Climb for a little while?

351
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,166
I'd like him to tell
Gagaran and the others

352
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,000
that we're making
our move right away.

353
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,958
Understood, Lady Aindra!

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,166
[LAKYUS muffled] Come to think
of it, Tina's investigation

355
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,916
turned up the names
of several nobles...

356
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,458
My, my.

357
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,291
Sounds like the Princess is
doing something reckless again.

358
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,166
Must be tough on those
Blue Rose ladies.

359
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,583
I'm afraid that one of
those nobleman's daughters

360
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,000
is currently serving
me as a maid.

361
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,375
Well, it doesn't
seem likely that

362
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,333
she was sent here just
to spy on you, but still.

363
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,833
Yes, I know.

364
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,083
I'll have to tell Climb to be
extra careful from now on.

365
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,583
Welcome back, my lord.
I've been waiting.

366
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,291
That's very thoughtful of you.

367
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,833
I trust there were no
problems with your work?

368
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,333
[TUARE]
No, none.

369
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,666
Well done, Tuare.
I'm glad to hear it.

370
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,250
Have you decided what we're
having for dinner tonight?

371
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,458
A stew, Lord.

372
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,250
Made with chopped potatoes.

373
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,333
If it proves to be as tasty
as your previous dishes,

374
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm looking forward to it.

375
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,625
You don't mean that.

376
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
I wouldn't lie to you, Tuare.

377
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,125
Are you sure you have all
the ingredients for the dish?

378
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,250
No. Sorry, I'll
check on it later.

379
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,041
We can go shopping
together if you like.

380
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,833
[TUARE]
No, that's all right.

381
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,916
Do not worry.
I understand your fear.

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm not angry.

383
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,916
You must be terrified
of going outside.

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But, please, rest assured.

385
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,875
I made a promise to
protect you, Tuare.

386
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,500
No matter what perils
may come your way.

387
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,666
I will dash them to pieces.
You have my word.

388
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,583
Tuare, keep moving forward.

389
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,333
If you're scared, I don't mind
if you close your eyes to do it.

390
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,291
All I ask is you trust
me to lead the way.

391
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,375
Lord Sebas, you
aren't being fair.

392
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
You aren't.

393
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,666
There is no way I could possibly
say no to you after that.

394
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,458
And don't worry about me.

395
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,541
I may not look it but
I'm strong, I assure you.

396
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,041
As a matter of fact,

397
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,166
there are only 41 others
who are stronger than me.

398
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,666
At least, they're the
only ones I'm aware of.

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,583
Is that a lot? Forty-one?

400
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,958
[chuckles]

401
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,125
[knocking]

402
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,708
I've returned and am at
your service, my lady.

403
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,208
Very good. Thank you, Sebas.

404
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,416
Are you certain we should not
inform Lord Ains about her?

405
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,041
I imagine he requires you
to be in daily contact with him.

406
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
Could you not simply make
mention of that woman

407
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,916
the next time you report in?

408
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,250
First off, I have an
extremely high regard

409
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,875
for her culinary abilities,
Solution. Secondly,

410
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,375
if any humans were
to see us living alone

411
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,500
in this mansion,
it might raise suspicion

412
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,833
and spur them to
scrutinize our presence.

413
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,583
So, she's part of
a diversionary tactic?

414
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,500
[SEBAS] Yes and if I
were to seek permission

415
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
from Lord Ains over
a matter as simple

416
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,916
as maintaining our cover,
he's likely to snap

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
and tell me to think for myself.

418
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,708
[STAFFAN] I am Staffan Havish,
a constable charged

419
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,458
with keeping the peace here
in our glorious capital.

420
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,541
What can I do
for you, Constable?

421
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
[STAFFAN]
There's an establishment, well,

422
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,083
his establishment, actually.

423
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,625
Call me Succulent.

424
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,583
A pleasure to meet you, my lady.

425
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,750
I received a disturbing report
from an eyewitness recently.

426
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,583
Apparently, someone with
a scroll bearing the seal

427
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,125
of the magicians' guild,
gave him an exorbitant

428
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,625
amount of money and made off
with one of his employees.

429
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,166
Sounds like a clear violation

430
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,625
of our slave trade
prohibition. So, my lady.

431
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,666
Has someone in your house
been especially naughty?

432
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,041
This is boring.

433
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,166
[STAFFAN]
Huh?

434
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,125
[SOLUTION]
I will let my butler, Sebas,

435
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,166
deal with this touchy matter.

436
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,291
I'm sure he can handle
things from here.

437
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,958
Good day, gentlemen.

438
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,333
Now then, as my
lady has ordered.

439
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,083
I will listen to
what you have to say

440
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,333
and take whatever
action is necessary.

441
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,708
[STAFFAN] Well, from the
circumstantial evidence alone,

442
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,916
it is beyond a doubt that
you have committed a crime.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,791
Fortunately for you
and your mistress,

444
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,541
he's a benevolent man and is
willing to offer you clemency

445
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,416
which will, naturally,
take the form of consolation

446
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,125
payments and commissions.

447
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,750
[SEBAS] I see. And how
much will that cost?

448
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,375
Five hundred gold.
Not a copper less.

449
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,833
That is beyond extortionate.

450
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,958
The girl was in a terrible
state when I found her.

451
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,458
If you were to
take her away now,

452
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,500
she might very well die from it.

453
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
You don't say. How tragic.

454
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,125
In the interest of my
dear employee's welfare,

455
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,250
what would you say to loaning us
the lady of your house, instead?

456
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,916
While the girl recovers.

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,958
Oh, indeed!

458
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,166
Your lost income
must be compensated!

459
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,916
Your excessive lust must
be a problem for you.

460
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,291
Ah! How dare you! Lust has
nothing to do with it!

461
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,625
I am merely upholding the law

462
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,541
that came at the noble
behest of the eminent

463
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,791
Golden Princess Renner!

464
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,083
I will not stand here
and suffer your insults!

465
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,416
Now, now, there's no reason

466
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
to let your blood
boil, Lord Havish.

467
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,083
We'll return the day after
tomorrow for your decision.

468
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,708
I hope, for your sake,
it's the right one, Sebas.

469
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,041
We'll see, won't we?

470
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,458
May I ask what you plan to do?

471
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,625
[SEBAS] I think I'll go for a
short stroll and think it over.

472
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,583
[SOLUTION]
Message.

473
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,666
Hello? Lord Ains?
Can you hear me?

474
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
[AINS]
Solution?

475
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,333
I'm surprised to
have you contact me.

476
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,791
Is something wrong?

477
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,166
I think...

478
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,666
...there's a chance that
Lord Sebas has turned on us.

479
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,708
[AINS]
Mm... U-Uh, really?

480
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,041
[AINS clears throat]
No kidding around.

481
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,333
If you don't have proof
of this accusation,

482
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,750
punishment will be swift.

483
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,166
Is there any?

484
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,750
Yes, Lord.

485
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,666
[AINS] In search of the
strength to protect his master,

486
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,875
Climb puts forth
relentless effort.

487
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,166
In the eyes of those
stronger than he,

488
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,625
Climb has no potential
physically or with magic.

489
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,458
Knowing this, Climb presses on,
until eventually,

490
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:11,500
his search for strength brings
him to meet a powerful old man.

491
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:16,500
Chapter 8: "A boy's feeling".


492
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,958
If you wish for strength,
show your resolve.
