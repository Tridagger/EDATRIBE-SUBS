Henceforth, death's
gaze is upon you!

00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,291
The Great One has
mobilized an army

00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,791
to destroy your pitiful race!

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,208
Nevertheless,
you have graciously

whatever desperate resistance

Eight days from now,

upon this land,

The second?

00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,833
[MESSENGER 1A]
Offer your pathetic resistance,

15
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,500
so that the Great One may
take delight in your failure,

16
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,333

[HEAD GREEN CLAW PRIESTESS] We
all saw those malevolent clouds.


20
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,958
That was likely
fourth tier magic.

00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,000
The spell is "Control Cloud."

22
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,666
Fourth tier magic, huh?

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,291
It takes a truly powerful

24

spells of that magnitude,

25
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,000
even I can only manage
as high as second tier.

26
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,875
We should evacuate
with all due haste.

Well, between

It would be unwise
not to listen to him.

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,791
[ELDER 2B] Chief Shasuryu,
you shouldn't be giving him

special treatment just
because he's your brother.

Failing to heed the words

of the foolish and prideful.

46

[SHASURYU]
Hm. So, why should we fight?

50
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,000
Because it's our only choice.

51
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,625
Can we win?

52
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,958
Of course we can!

53

No. Not if things stay
the same as they are now.

54

What are you talking about?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,333
I believe this foe is confident

56
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,958
because he is aware
of our lack of forces.

57
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,958
If that is the case,

58
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,208
we need to throw
his reckoning off.

Now.

'Course we do.

[HEAD GREEN CLAW PRIESTESS]
There's no way we could forget.

63
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:52,291
This marsh was the
home to seven tribes.

64
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,333
There was our tribe, Green Claw.

65
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,875
The skilled hunters
of Small Fang.

66
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,250
Razor Tail, whose
defenses were legendary.

67
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,708
The war-loving Dragon Tusk.

68
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,583
The moderate Yellow Speckle.

69
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,833
The great fighters
of Sharp Edge.

70
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,958
And Red Eye with their
priestly abilities.

71

Then the food shortage struck.

72
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,500
All seven tribes ended up
competing with each other

73
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,500
for what little there was.

74
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,916
Until, finally,

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,041
it turned into an all out war,
and we made an alliance

76
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,708
with Small Fang and Razor Tail

77
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,958
against Yellow Speckle
and Sharp Edge.

78
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,375
The three of us claimed victory,
and the two defeated tribes

79
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:36,250
were absorbed into Dragon Tusk,
who stayed out of the fighting.

80
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,875
And why does that matter?

00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,916
That thing said this village
would be the "second."

00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,250
You're suggesting
we join forces again.

85
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,125
But is eight days long enough
to mount a meaningful defense?

86
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,416
I'm fairly certain
our former allies,

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,416
Small Fang and
Razor Tail will form

88
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,625
an alliance with us once again.

89
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,666
Let there be no mistake.

90
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,416
What I'm suggesting
entails all the tribes.

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500

to form an alliance

92

We can't!

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
Dragon Tusk now consists

95
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,333
of the survivors from the two
tribes we beat in the last war.

96
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,416
There can be no
alliance between us.

97
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,291
Plus, we have no
interaction with Red Eye.

98

to these two tribes?

because I'm a traveler,

become chief instead of me.

If that would've
happened, I never

117
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,625

which means I wouldn't know

how to farm fish
for the village.

119
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,083

such things now?

some of the similarities

between now and the past war,
such as diminishing

increased population.

Not if we want to avoid
a repeat of the last war.

to make an alliance with us?

I do understand. It's the
survival of the tribe.

142

But what happens
if the man in charge

143

that possibility?

him to the village,

too big to handle.

so I must work twice as
hard to make up for him.

180
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,500
That's why I just
finished making

181
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,291
specific arrangements
with Lady Albedo.

182
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,583
I guess you're right.

183
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,666
Now that he's gone,
Nahzareek's ninth floor

184
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,250
is safe in your more than
capable flippers, eh?

185
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,625
Correct!

186
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,833
I treat this extra work
as preparation for when

187
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm finally calling the shots,

188
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,375
and ruling the Great
Tomb of Nazarick.

189
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,166
Right you are.
Keep at it, little guy.

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,291
After all, your creator,
Lady Ankoro Mocchi Mochi,

191
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,750
did design you to act that way.

192
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,125
So then.

193
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,541
How exactly are you planning
on achieving that goal?

194
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,416
[ECLAIR]
By cleaning, of course.

195
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,708
I dare say there's
no one in Nazarick half

196
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,708
as thorough at cleaning as me!

197
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,125
After I'm done
with the restroom,

198
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,750
it's safe to eat off both
the floor and the toilet!

199
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,416
[gasps] Truly outstanding!

200
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm Zaryusu Shasha
of the Green Claw tribe!

201
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,166
I wish to speak to the
tribal chief of Red Eye!

202
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,125
Zaryusu Shasha of Green Claw,

203
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,416
the one who holds the tribe
together will see you now.

204
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,208
Huh. I wonder why
it's not the chief.

205
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
Right through here.

206
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,250
[ELDER 2C] The one who holds the
tribe together has requested

207
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,750
to speak with you one-on-one.

208
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,083
I am Zaryusu Shasha
of the Green Claw tribe.

209
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,416
I bring an urgent request.

210
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,541
[CRUSCH]
Come in.

211
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,958
[CRUSCH]
Thank you for coming today.

212
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,958
[gasping]

213
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,000
[CRUSCH chuckles]
Even the bearer of Frost Pain,

214
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,625
one of the Four Great
Treasures appears

215
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,916
to find my body bizarre-looking.

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,166
Uh, is something the matter?

217
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,500
[squeals]

218
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,791
[gasps]

219
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,541
[yelps] Please, excuse me.

220
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,916
Think nothing of it.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,208
I am the acting chief
of the Red Eye tribe.

222
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,666
It's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Crusch Lulu.

223
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
[ZARYUSU grunts]

224
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,375
Now, may I ask what
brought a member

225
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,333
of the Green Claw tribe
over to our village?

226
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,208
Please marry me.

227
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,375
U-Uh...

228
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,416
Huh?

229
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,791
M-Marry you?

230
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,416
That isn't the reason
I came here, mind you.

231
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,666
I realize it's probably
confusing that I didn't

232
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,041
settle that matter first before
offering up such a proposal.

233
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,166
But I cannot ignore such
strong feelings of love.

234
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,708
Love?

235
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,041
But, we... Huh?

236
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,958
A-Again, excuse my rudeness.

237
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,375
Feel free to give me an answer

238
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
once we get to know
each other better.

239
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,208
Know each other?

240
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,666
Uh--

241
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,250
[CRUSCH] It comes as
quite a surprise to me

242
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,708
that you're not afraid of my
white body, like others are.

243
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,708
You see, every now
and then an albino,

244
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,333
such as myself, is born
into the Red Eye tribe.

245
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,041
They always exhibit an
aptitude for some talent,

246
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
and in my case that talent

247
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,833
turned out to be
priestly powers.

248
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,333
That's the reason
we always end up

249
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,958
second in command
under the tribal chief.

250
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,083
As white as the snow
blanketing yonder mountains.

251
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,125
[gasps]

252
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,125
Beautiful color.

253
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,375
What did you say?

254
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,291
[growls]

255
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,041
[ZARYUSU grunts]

256
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,166
[BOTH panting]

257
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,333
Why would you touch me
without asking first?

258
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,625
I've fallen in love with you.

259
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,666
And odds are, we could
both get ourselves killed

260
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,541
in this upcoming battle.

261
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,541
I don't want any regrets.

262
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm at a loss.

263
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,250
The bearer of Frost Pain
is actually prepared to die?

264
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,333
Did you see the monster
that delivered the message?

265
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,416
I did.

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,125
That horrible creature
emitted screams

267
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,833
that rattled the mind,
neutralizing almost any attack

268
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,291
by non-enchanted weapons.
Terrifying indeed.

269
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,166
Last time I encountered it,
I had no choice but to flee.

270
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,958
We druids can help with that.

271
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,875
We possess the
power to temporarily

272
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,916
imbue swords with magic.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,666
Are you able to ward against
mental attacks as well?

274
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Most priests can, in fact,
bolster one's resistance.

275
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,958
However, protecting the mind
from confusion is different.

276
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm the only one who can do so.

277
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,500
[gasps]

278
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,708
What number did it
say your tribe was?

279
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
It said we were fourth in line.

280
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,208
I see.

281
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,083
Tell me, what are you
planning to do about it?

282
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,833
Uh...

283
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm going to be
straight with you.

284
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,666
[ZARYUSU]
If the Red Eye tribe evacuates,

285
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,541
will you be able to
carry on your lifestyle

286
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,583
in a strange location?

287
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,875
[CRUSCH]
It would be difficult.

288
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,791
[ZARYUSU] So then, if all
five tribes in the area

289
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,000
were to evacuate at once.
What would happen?

290
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,791
What if we couldn't
find enough food?

291
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,041
What if the fish we
depend on grew scarce?

292
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,166
Would we end up killing
each other off this time?

293
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,500
You don't mean
that fighting a battle

294
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,625
we may not win
would be a better...

295
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,708
Indeed.

296
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,625
I'm taking into
account depopulation,

297
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,375
including the other tribes.

298
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,958
Crusch Lulu,

299
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,666
Green Claw requests an alliance
with the Red Eye tribe.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,708
Please think this through.

301
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,250
If you were to refuse us,

302
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,166
we'd have to challenge
your tribe to battle first.

303
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,375
To prevent a tribe
from running away

304
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,375
and establishing a
numerical superiority

305
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,041
in a new land, correct?

306
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,375
My hope is, if we
form an alliance,

307
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,250
and are then defeated,

308
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,875
that once we settle
in a new land

309
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,958
the chances of intertribal
warfare are decreased.

310
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:29,958
Uh?

311
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,875
We won't be separate tribes.

312
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,791
Instead, we'll be
allies who bravely

313
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
fought alongside each other.

314
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
That makes sense.

315
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,875
I have to know.

316
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,166
Red Eye abstained from fighting
during the last battle.

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,708
How did your people
manage to not starve?

318
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,458
Do I really have to
answer that question?

319
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,041
I need to know.
Was it priestly power?

320
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,708
Or by some other means
you've kept hidden from us?

321
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,916
It may prove to be
our salvation.

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,458
Definitely not.

323
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,708
[gasps]

324
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,125
It won't be our salvation.

325
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,041
What we engaged in
back then was cannibalism.

326
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,291
We fed on the meat
of our fallen friends.

327
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,625
[gasps]

328
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,041
At that time,
our tribe found itself

329
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,375
in a dire situation due
to the shortage of food

330
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,750
and unwillingness
to fight for it.

331
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,333
But then, one day,

332
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,041
our chief came to the
village with food.

333
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,291
Bright red fresh meat.

334
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,333
I'm not going to lie to you,

335
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,041
we were vaguely aware
of where it came from.

336
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,250
Because, whenever the
chief brought us meat,

337
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,666
it was always after he expelled
families from the village

338
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,250
for breaking our laws.

339
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,666
We all simply closed our eyes
and ate the only food we had.

340
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,458
In order to survive.

341
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,625
But yet, it wasn't
as though we could

342
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,208
live like that forever.

343
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,000
The pent-up frustration
soon came to a head,

344
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,333
and manifested into
the form of mutiny.

345
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,083
As the second most
powerful leader in the tribe,

346
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,333
I became the banner
they rallied to.

347
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,041
And we rose in revolt
against the chief.

348
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,375
The fighting divided
the village in two,

349
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,291
but we managed to
secure a victory

350
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,416
thanks to our greater numbers.

351
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,708
The chief refused to back down
even at the very end.

352
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,000
He was on the verge of death
after countless wounds.

353
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,166
And at the moment he was
struck by a fatal blow,

354
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,083
he looked into
my eyes and smiled.

355
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,583
It was a genuine, sweet
smile without any anger.

356
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,375
Through the death of the chief.

357
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,000
Our tribe was brought
back together.

358
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,083
And with our new
decrease in numbers,

359
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,666
came the great gift of recovery

360
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,250
from our dwindling
food situation.

361
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,958
But our rebellion was
in the wrong, wasn't it?

362
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,375
The chief faced reality,
and found the only logical way

363
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,375
through our grave circumstance.

364
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,958
I can't ever shake
those thoughts.

365
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,291
We're neither omniscient
nor omnipotent.

366
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,500
Who knows. I might have
done the same thing you did.

367
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,125
Crusch, you don't
need my solace.

368
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,500
There are no right answers.
We all live with regrets.

369
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,333
And now, the only
thing left to do

370
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,750
is just keep walking.

371
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
Even as we afflict
woe unto our feet.

372
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,375
You, too must keep walking.

373
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,291
At least, that's what I think.

374
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,041
I apologize for my disgrace.

375
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,416
I see no disgrace in you.

376
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,291
What's more, do I
look like someone

377
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,375
who's foolish enough
to judge others?

378
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,083
When they're doing their best
to move on from their past,

379
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,166
and being tormented
by old actions?

380
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,916
Your soul is beautiful.

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,208
[gasps]

382
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,416
You have a way with words.

383
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,916
Let me ask again.

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,875
Which policy will
Red Eye adopt this time?

385
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,416
We had a tribal meeting
and decided to evacuate.

386
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,583
Really?

387
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
Are your feelings
the same, Crusch Lulu.

388
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,916
After talking with me today?

389
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,041
It is your decision to make.

390
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,166
The previous chief smiled
at you during his death,

391
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,416
meaning he was leaving the
tribe's future in your hands.

392
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,333
If true, it is time
to fulfil that calling.

393
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
I have but one question.

394
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,666
How many do you plan on
letting escape as refugees?

395
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,250
Well...

396
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,250
One hundred of the females
and 70 males, 12 hunters,

397
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,666
ten warriors, three priests,
and the children.

398
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,666
And what about the rest?

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,750
If we fail, they will die.

400
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,625
I see how it is.

401
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,625
Let me make one thing clear.

402
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,541
We're not fighting this
battle just to die.

403
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,000
We're fighting to claim victory!

404
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,875
I was hoping to hear
you say such things.

405
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,208
The Red Eye will fight
beside Green Claw.

406
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll make sure the
chief's last smile

407
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,250
was not meaningless.

408
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,458
This alliance will ensure
that the Red Eye tribe

409
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,625
have enough survivors
to carry on.

410
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,333
[ZARYUSU]
I'm grateful.

411
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,958
[yawns]

412
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,458
[CRUSCH]
Good morning.

413
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,250
Uh, yeah. 'Morning.

414
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,125
Looks like you were able
to bring the tribe around

415
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
without any issues.

416
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
[CRUSCH] I'm grateful that you
stayed up so late last night

417
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,208
talking them through it.

418
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,833
Our warriors should be equipped

419
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,875
and ready to leave
within the day.

420
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,041
The evacuees will be
gone soon, too.

421
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Zaryusu. What are you
planning to do?

422
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,041
I'll be heading over to the
Dragon Tusk tribe next.

423
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,958
So, question. What's
with the getup?

424
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,125
Does it look bad on me?

425
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,500
Would you like me to say
that it looks good?

426
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,458
I will.

427
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,708
[CRUSCH]
You're so silly.

428
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,208
This is how I protect my
fair skin from sunlight.

429
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,458
Are you planning
on coming with me?

430
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,250
[CRUSCH] If I'm not mistaken,
the Dragon Tusk

431
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,125
have the greatest force
of arms within the tribes.

432
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,291
Right.

433
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,625
But we haven't dealt
with them in a while

434
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,208
so things may have changed.

435
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,375
[CRUSCH] Then I think it's best
if I accompany you there.

436
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,708
It's dangerous.

437
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,250
[CRUSCH] Is there anywhere
around here that isn't?

438
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,208
Huh. You're right,
of course. Sorry.

439
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,583
Crusch Lulu, I'll gladly
accept your help.

440
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,625
Thank you.

441
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,375
[CRUSCH]
Sounds good to me, Zaryusu.

442
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,958
I'll do what I can.

443
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,541
[ENTOMA] These are the
teleportation scrolls

444
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,875
I was instructed to deliver,

445
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,416
and the "Message"
scrolls as well.

446
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,833
Lord Ains informed me
they were constructed

447
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,250
from parchment that
we obtained through

448
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,041
the grand efforts
of Lord Demiurge.

449
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,708
He said we should
report back to him

450
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,083
if we have any problems
using them correctly.

451
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,875
[COCYTUS]
I see. Understood.

452
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,333
So, once again, Demiurge
has overshadowed me.

453
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,541
[ENTOMA]
There's more.

454
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,750
[COCYTUS]
Hm?

455
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,166
[ENTOMA] We have been
directed to stay put

456
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,916
and monitor the
outcome of the battle

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,958
with the Lizard Men
from this location only.

458
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,750
[COCYTUS]
I understand.

459
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,458
Your orders are to
see this fight through,

460
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,458
and deliver an absolute
victory for the Supreme One!

461
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,416
Don't let me down!

462
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
I'm Zaryusu Shasha.

463
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,916
I've come here on behalf
of the Green Claw tribe.

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
I wish to speak with your chief.

465
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,916
[CRUSCH] I am acting chief
of the Red Eye tribe,

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,083
Crusch Lulu.

467
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,625
I am also here to meet
with your chief.

468
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,083
[ZENBERU]
Possessor of Frost Pain!

469
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,750
What a pleasant surprise.

470
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,208
[ZENBERU]
Whoa.

471
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,166
Didn't realize the Red Eye
were led by a plant monster.

472
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,791
Don't be ridiculous!

473
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, please, learn to
take a joke, will ya?

474
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,708
I am the Dragon Tusk chief
you seek, Zenberu Gugu.

475
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,291
Call me Zenberu.

476
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,958
Feel free to call me
Zaryusu. Now let's get--

477
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,083
[ZENBERU] I can already guess
why you traveled this far.

478
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,541
However, our tribe only
trusts those who are strong.

479
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,958
Show me that you are.

480
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,291
[AINS] Zaryusu and Crusch
visit the village of the Dragon

481
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:58,083
Tusk tribe to seek an alliance.
However, the tribe chief,

482
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,750
Zenberu, declares that he
will only follow someone

483
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,416
stronger than himself and
proposes a one-on-one duel.

484
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,416
Meanwhile, the razor tail tribe,
the first of the Lizard

485
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,958
Man clans marked for death,
prepares itself for

486
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,708
battle under
Shasuryu's direction.

487
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,666
Chapter 3:
"Lizard men gathering"


488
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,166
Finally, the signal for battle.
