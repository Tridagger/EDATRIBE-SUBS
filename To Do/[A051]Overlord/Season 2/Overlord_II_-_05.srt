1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,166
[VICTIM]
If that is all, Lord Ains.

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,583
I will take my leave
and return to my duties

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,083
in the Great Tomb.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,416
[AINS]
Outstanding work, Victim.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,916
Keep the first floor of
Nazarick safe until we return.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,083
[VICTIM]
With my life, if needed.

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,125
[AINS]
Gate.

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,500
[AINS]
Hm.

9
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,875
[AURA] Sorry the place
is so shabby, Lord Ains.

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,166
When I heard you
would be coming,

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,250
I kinda panicked and
turned it into a rush job.

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,750
[AINS]
There is no need to apologize.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,333
You built this place for me
out of love and devotion.

14
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,708
In my eyes, it is on par
with even Nazarick.

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,125
Thanks!

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,458
[AINS]
That being said,

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,666
I have to ask: what is that?

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,083
[DEMIURGE]
Plain though it may be,

19
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,375
it seemed only right to
prepare a throne for you.

20
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,208
[AINS]
And the bones?

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,458
[DEMIURGE]
We assembled the best parts

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,791
of various animals.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,666
Griffons, wyverns, and the like.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,000
[AINS]
That's not what I... Nevermind.

25
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,208
[MOMONGA]
I don't care what he says,

26
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,625
those are human skulls.
I can't sit on that!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,208
[AINS]
Shalltear.

28
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,500
I promised you
punishment, didn't I?

29
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,250
This is the perfect
time to administer it.

30
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,416
Your humiliation.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,625
Get down on your
hands and knees.

32
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,291
[pants]

33
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,541
[growls]

34
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,458
Brilliant, my lord. I'm in awe!

35
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,833
[AINS]
Sorry, Demiurge, the throne

36
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,541
will go to waste for now.

37
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,625
It could never
compare to this, Lord.

38
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,500
A Guardian as your throne?

39
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,833
Truly, such a seat is
worthy of the Supreme One,

40
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,833
for it could be
claimed by no other!

41
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,416
This is inspired!

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,625
I never would have
thought of it!

43
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,958
[AINS]
Is that so?

44
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,541
[ALBEDO] Lord Ains. May I
be excused from the room?

45
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,958
I will only be a moment.

46
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,083
[AINS]
If you must. Go on.

47
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,750
[ALBEDO]
Thank you very much.

48
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,416
--[ALBEDO growling, screaming]
--[crashing]

49
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,166
I am refreshed,
and ready to serve.

50
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,166
[AINS]
Uh. Great!

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,625
[ALBEDO]
Ah yes, Aura.

52
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm afraid when I left I
accidently bumped into the wall.

53
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,958
It appears to have been damaged.

54
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,583
Could you fix it up
for me, later?

55
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,916
Sorry for the inconvenience.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,208
No biggie.

57
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,083
[SHALLTEAR panting]

58
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,958
[AINS]
Hm. Shalltear, is this too much?

59
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,958
If so, I could...

60
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,416
It is not too much
at all, my lord!

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
I take it as the grandest
of rewards, in fact!

62
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,333
Uh--

63
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:04,458
[MOMONGA] No. I should see
this punishment through.

64
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,458
My... lord....

65
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,916
[MOMONGA]
Besides,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Shalltear's slip-up was a
direct result of my failure.

67
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,791
If I have to suffer through this

68
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,833
in order to punish
myself, so be it.

69
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,666
Still, Peroronicino.

70
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,041
Just how kinky did
you make this chick?

71
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,958
[SHALLTEAR moans]

72
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,250
[AINS]
All right, down to business.


73
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,625
Do you think we effectively


74
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,000
scared the hell out of them?

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,625
We were so awesome
it almost scared me!

76
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,750
Without a doubt, Ains my lord.

77
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,708
Their faces were riddled
with delicious fear.

78
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,916
[AINS]
Very good.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Then I suppose we can
call the first stage

80
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,333
of Coctyus' demonstration
a success.

81
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,291
We've set the stage
perfectly for him.

82
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,291
Now.

83
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,708
Why don't we see
how the Lizard Men

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,750
are spending their time?

85
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,875
[AINS]
Utterly wasting it.

86
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,625
[AINS]
Save for the Chiefs.

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,041
Hm. I don't see the white lizard

88
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,333
or the one with
the magic weapon.

89
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,083
He said his name
was Zaryusu, right?

90
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,083
[AINS]
Ah, yes. I believe you're right.

91
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,583
Maybe he's inside
one of the houses.

92
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,583
[AINS]
It's quite possible.

93
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,250
[AINS]
The Mirror of Remote Viewing

94
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,291
can't offer a view indoors.
At least, not normally.

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,833
However, using magic,

96
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,833
I can create a sensory organ.

97
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:05,333
Then, by linking the two,
we should be able to...

98
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,875
[gasps]

99
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,000
[AINS grunts]

100
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,208
[DEMIURGE]
I can't abide these Lizard Men!

101
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,000
[MARE] Were they wrestling?
I don't get it.

102
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,625
[SHALLTEAR] Repulsive!
They should be punished...

103
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,791
[MARE]
Why are we so angry?

104
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,625
--Wait, were they...?
--[AURA] Totally gross!

105
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,416
--Oh. <i>Oh</i> . Wow.
--No one wants to see that!

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,291
[ALBEDO]
One of these days...

107
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,375
[AINS] Well, they <i>are</i> about
to die. In these situations,

108
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,000
the instinct to preserve
the species kicks in.

109
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,000
If movies are to be
believed at least. Hmph!

110
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
[DEMIURGE]
Yes, it's only natural.

111
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,083
[ALBEDO]
This much can be forgiven.

112
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,000
[AURA]
Right? Totally fine!

113
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,833
Leave it to Lord Ains
to know what's up.

114
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,583
[AINS]
All of you, quiet!

115
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,833
[GUARDIANS gasp]

116
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,958
[AINS] That took the wind
right out of my sails.

117
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,041
[MOMONGA]
Oh, crap!

118
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,750
Was that too soon
for Aura and Mare?

119
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,833
What am I supposed to tell them

120
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,125
if they ask where
babies come from?

121
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,541
Turn to Albedo? No, bad idea.

122
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,541
Demiurge? He would
explain it clinically.

123
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,375
Solid choice.

124
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,833
Shalltear?

125
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,958
Huh. Actually, that doesn't
sound as bad as I thought.

126
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,625
Whatever. That's a
problem for future Ains.

127
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,458
[AINS clears throat] Aura, since
we have yet to see any activity

128
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,291
from them at this stage,
it is highly unlikely

129
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,083
that we will run into
whoever attacked Shalltear.

130
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,250
But a slim chance
is still a chance.

131
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,583
Be vigilant and mind
your surroundings.

132
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,875
[AURA]
Right!

133
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,375
[AINS]
If there is an Yggdrasil player

134
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,500
on the Lizard Men's
side we will give them

135
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
one chance to ally with us.

136
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,083
If they refuse,
we must destroy them

137
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,833
to keep information
from getting out.

138
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,208
[ZARYUSU, SHASURYU]
That monstrosity is Cocytus?

139
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,291
[COCYTUS]
Listen carefully.

140
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,708
Do not hold back,
no matter what happens.

141
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:41,458
Lord Ains is watching, and only
your best will satisfy him.

142
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,333
But, before we start...

so please forgive any affront
my next statement might cause.

Beyond this gate
lies your death.

to step beyond it,

know that it will be your last.

151
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,416
You should stay back, for now.

152
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,166
In fact, go back to the village.

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,250
[WARRIOR 5A]
Wha--? No!

154
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,916
Let us fight with you,

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,875
It's not cowardly to withdraw!

156
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,250
Nor is living!

157
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,375
[WARRIOR 5B]
Then let us--

158
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,458
But some of us don't
have that option!

159
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,125
You would not accept
us as your Chiefs

160
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,458
if we refused to fight.

161
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,916
In fact, I hope you would
cut us down yourselves.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,333
But we want to fight!

163
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,916
Please, don't rob
us of the honor!

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,833
Let us old timers have this.

165
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,791
You'll all get your
chance at honor someday.

00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,708
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Cocytus!

167

[COCYTUS]
I hate to do this to warriors,

170
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,833
but I must reduce
your numbers quickly.

172
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,083
[COCYTUS]
Hm... Seems about right.

00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,375
[COCYTUS]
Ranged weapons won't hurt me.

All the Guardians of Nazarick
have acquired items

175
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,083
or skills that grant
us full resistance.

176
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,791
[KYUKU yells]

177
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,375
[COCYTUS]
God Slaying Emperor Blade!

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,125
Martial Art.
Iron Natural Weapon.

179
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
Iron Skin!

180
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,041
[groans]

181
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,583
[COCYTUS] Not bad at all.
The sword, I mean.

182
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,291
[pants]

183
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,291
[groans]

184
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,916
[COCYTUS]
You're just in the way.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,166
[ZARYUSU yells]

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,791
Maximize Magic!
Mass Slight Cure Wounds.

187
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,458
[gasps]

188
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,208
[COCYTUS grunts]

189
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,000
[grunts] Damn.

190
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,666
[COCYTUS] You still
have the will to fight?

191
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,416
Then I shall return this to you.

192
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,458
[COCYTUS] That's getting
annoying. Piercing Icicles!

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,333
[groans]

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,250
[yelling]

195
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,916
[gasps]

196
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,000
[panting]

197
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,000
[COCYTUS] Amazing.
Lord Ains predicted this.

198
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,958
That the two of you
would last till the end.

199
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,916
And sure enough,
here you are. Be proud.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,666
How are you holding up
over there, brother?

201
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,333
Bad, I'm afraid. The pain
is still throbbing.

202
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,958
But don't worry, I got
a few more swings in me.

203
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,291
All right. Then that'll
have to be enough.

204
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,208
That last spell really
took it out of me,

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
my magic power is drained.

206
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,083
One more cast and I'll pass out.

207
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,291
You always did push yourself
too hard, brother.

208
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,125
But, all the same.

209
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,416
As long as I have a drop
of blood left to give,

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,791
Frost Pain and I won't give up!

211
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,916
[COCYTUS]
That was a fine war cry.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,875
You always did have
a way with words, brother.

213
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,041
We will meet our death together.

214
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,416
Now, come.

215
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,916
Let's not keep our guest
waiting any longer.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,458
[COCYTUS]
I am in no rush.

217
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,750
Far be it from me to
get between brothers

218
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,666
saying their goodbyes.

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,791
[COCYTUS] Prepare yourselves.
No, forgive me.

220
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,708
You were prepared for death
long before we crossed blades.

221
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,458
May I have your names
before we finish?

222
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,708
Shasuryu Shasha.

223
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,166
Zaryusu Shasha.

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,541
[COCYTUS] I shall
remember you as warriors.

225
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,416
As long as I live,
you will not be forgotten.

226
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,416
Also, I must
apologize yet again.

227
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,333
Normally, I would face
you with a weapon

228
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,708
in each hand, but you
are not strong enough

229
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,000
for me to draw them.

230
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,083
It would be an insult
to go all out.

231
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
To both of you.

232
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
That's a damn shame, isn't it?

233
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,791
It sure is. Let's go!

234
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,666
I'm on it. Earth Bind!

235
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,625
[COCYTUS]
My defense cannot be penetrated

236
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
by one whose magic
level is inferior.

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,041
Don't waste your time!

238
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,333
[ZARYUSU]
Icy Burst!

239
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,125
[ZARYUSU yells]

240
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,875
[SHASURYU yells]

241
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,458
[COCYTUS]
Want to take me by surprise?

242
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,250
Then don't scream
like a banshee!

243
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:20,458
[COCYTUS] Hm? Blood? You did
all of that for this?

244
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,958
[COCYTUS]
Magnificent.

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,791
[COCYTUS]
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,541
I have a skill that
temporarily negates any attack

247
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
from weak magic weapons.

248
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,875
Unfortunately for you,

249
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,916
that means, as long
as it's activated,

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,916
your effort was
meaningless at best.

251
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,333
[COCYTUS]
Well fought!

252
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,708
[blow lands]

253
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,666
[AINS] Cocytus, you fought
admirably today.

254
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,916
[COCYTUS]
And I always will, Lord.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,291
[AINS] That being said,
giving them the stick

256
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,083
is no longer permitted.

257
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,541
You must lead them
only by the carrot.

258
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,750
It must not be
a reign of terror.

259
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
[COCYTUS]
I understand, Supreme One.

260
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,166
[AINS]
Very good.

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,333
Lift your heads, Guardians,
and hear my words.

262
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,208
The rule over the
Lizard Men villages

263
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,208
is assigned to Cocytus.

264
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,958
If he ever requests
your support,

265
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,250
assist him to the
best of your ability.

266
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains.

267
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,208
If I may, what do you intend
to do with the bodies

268
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,541
of those Lizard Men?

269
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,458
[AINS]
Could you be more specific?

270
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,791
[COCYTUS]
Sorry.

271
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,541
The one called Zaryusu
and his brother Shasuryu.

272
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,958
[AINS] Ah, yes. Let's
recover their bodies.

273
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,083
I would like to see the kind
of undead they would make

274
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,125
if they were not
created using my skill.

275
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
[COCYTUS]
I think we can do better.

276
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,500
[AINS]
What's on your mind?

277
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,500
[COCYTUS]
I admit they were weak.

278
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,083
But I also cannot deny they
possessed the brilliance

279
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,625
of true warriors.

280
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,666
I truly believe they
have the potential

281
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,625
to become stronger
than we assume,

282
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,291
if given the chance.

283
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250
Unless I'm mistaken,
you have yet to conduct

284
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,791
any more experiments
with resurrection.

285
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,541
What if you were
to use them for that?

286
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,500
[MOMONGA] The brilliance
of warriors, is it?

287
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,250
[AINS]
I see.

288
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,916
They're too precious
to waste, then?

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
Is there anyone
who can represent

290
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,458
the Lizard Men villages?

291
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,708
[COCYTUS]
There was one who did not

292
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,500
participate in the fighting.

293
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,875
The white female lizard
with powerful druidic magic.

294
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,666
[MOMONGA]
That one? Interesting.

295
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,916
[AINS]
All right.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,958
How long will it take
to bring her before me?

297
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,083
[COCYTUS]
Forgive me.

298
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,958
I had assumed you
would ask that.

299
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,583
She is already waiting
in the next room.

300
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,625
[AINS]
Well done. I'm pleased, Cocytus.

301
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,208
Your judgement was
right on the mark.

302
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,125
Please, show the female in now.

303
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,375
[COCYTUS]
Lord.

304
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
[AINS]
Tell me your name.

305
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,708
[CRUSCH]
Of course.

306
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,875
Whatever you wish,
Lord Ains Ooal Gown.

307
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,833
Supreme ruler of death.

308
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,041
I am priest and
guide to the tribes.

309
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,708
Crusch Lulu.

310
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,791
[AINS]
Thanks for coming.

311
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,833
Of course, my lord.

312
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,791
Please, accept the absolute
allegiance of my people.

313
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,541
We will serve you
without resistance.

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,208
[AINS]
Hm.

315
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,083
[gasps]

316
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,583
[AINS]
Now that that's done.

317
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,041
I have a special
request for you.

318
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,250
If there is anything this
humble servant can do,

319
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,500
you have but to ask it,
Lord. I'm listening.

320
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,833
[AINS] This isn't an order.
More a "favor."

321
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,666
Accept it, and I will
return Zaryusu to life.

322
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,666
Is that possible?

323
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,291
[AINS]
Life and death are nothing more

324
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,041
than states of being.

325
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,166
To move someone between the two

326
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,666
is a simple matter
to one such as I.

327
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,750
I see. Then, what is
it that you desire?

328
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,583
How can this slave serve you?

329
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,541
Do you wish to
partake of my body?

330
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,291
[growls]

331
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,708
[growls]

332
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,125
[AINS]
No. Not exactly.

333
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,541
[AINS clears throat] Nothing
like that. It's quite simple.

334
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,166
I want you to keep an eye
on your fellow tribesman.

335
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,458
Make sure there are none
who would betray me.

336
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
There are no such
Lizard Men, I assure you.

337
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,750
[AINS] I am not foolish
enough to believe that.

338
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,958
Not even for a second.

339
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,875
[AINS] I'm offering you
a miracle, Crusch Lulu.

340
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,625
But I cannot wait
for you to decide

341
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,666
where your loyalties truly lie.

342
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,208
Seize this moment
and do as I ask,

343
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,708
or lose the chance forever.

344
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,958
What is most important
to you now?

345
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,208
I want you to think hard on
that while I present my offer.

346
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,083
Then I expect an answer.

347
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
I want you to
covertly keep watch

348
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,875
on your fellow Lizard Men
from the inside.

349
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,541
I will cast a special
magic spell on Zaryusu

350
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,083
when I revive him.

351
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,916
If at any point I feel
that you have betrayed me,

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,208
the spell will
kill him instantly.

353
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,166
And I'll make sure
you see it happen.

354
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,625
Spying on your people
is a small price to pay

355
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,291
to have the love of your
life back, wouldn't you say?

356
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,875
[MOMONGA] Too bad that spell
doesn't really exist.

357
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,541
[AINS]
Time's up, Crusch Lulu.

358
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,875
What is your decision?

359
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,416
[AINS whispers] Even if
she declines, do nothing.

360
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,375
[AINS]
Well? I'm done waiting.

361
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,583
Make your choice.

362
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,375
[CRUSCH muffled]
Zaryusu. Zaryusu!

363
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,333
[CRUSCH]
Come back.

364
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,250
[CRUSCH]
Please. Open your eyes!

365
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,333
Zaryusu?

366
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,416
Zaryusu!

367
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,958
[garbled speach] Crusch?
Why are you...?

368
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,916
Is this the afterlife?

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,250
Were you killed by that monster?

370
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,125
[AINS] You're alive, but the
confusion will last for a while.

371
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,375
Apparently you've lost
some levels, as well.

372
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,541
I guess I can reason that

373
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,791
little has changed
from Yggdrasil.

374
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,375
[gasps]

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,458
[ZARYUSU]
Wh-What in the...?

376
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,208
[AINS] Zaryusu Shasha, first,
allow me to congratulate you

377
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,791
on your resurrection.

378
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,291
What? Resurrection?

379
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,916
You can bring the
dead back to life?

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,333
Truly, your power
cannot be rivaled.

381
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,541
[ZARYUSU]
Great One.

382
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,250
I humbly pledge my
eternal allegiance to you.

383
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,666
[AINS]
Very good.

384
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,583
In the name of Ains Ooal Gown,
I accept your fidelity.

385
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,166
All we ask in return,
is to prosper.

386
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,166
[AINS]
Is that it? Fear not.

387
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,083
I can definitely promise
prosperity to all under my rule.

388
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,500
I offer my thanks.

389
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,041
[AINS]
Your speech is still faltering.

390
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
A little rest
should remedy that.

391
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,583
Take some time to recover,

392
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,166
then speak with Cocytus
about what is to follow.

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,583
[ZARYUSU]
Just a moment, Lord.

394
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,875
[AINS]
Hm?

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,458
What about Zenberu
and my brother?

396
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,333
[AINS] Their bodies
should still be around.

397
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,958
[ZARYUSU]
Please, Great One.

398
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,791
May I ask you to bring
them back, as well?

399
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,541
[AINS] I don't see what
I would gain from it.

400
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,958
Then, why did you
only resurrect me?

401
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,000
Zenberu and my
brother are strong.

402
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,916
I'm certain that they could
be of great use to you.

403
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
[AINS]
I see.

404
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,916
Safeguard their bodies.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,083
I'll consider your request.

406
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,291
Aura, time to go.

407
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,541
Right!

408
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,291
Could I play with the
Hydra sometime, my lord?

409
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,333
We managed to survive.

410
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,625
Some more than others.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,166
[ZARYUSU sighs]

412
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,375
You'll be fine, love. I swear.

413
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,416
Just try to focus on recovering.

414
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,083
We can worry about
everything else

415
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,791
when you have
your strength back.

416
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,625
[ZARYUSU]
Yeah.

417
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,708
As long as I can
rest in your arms.

418
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,958
[AINS] Sebas and Solution
continue to collect information

419
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,541
in the capital of Re-Estize.

420
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,458
Working with extreme caution,
they seek to uncover

421
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,333
the identity of those
who attacked Shalltear.

422
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,625
But they have yet to
find even a shadow.

423
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,000
The days seem peaceful
on the surface, 

424
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,375
at least until Sebas
meets a certain girl

425
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,708
on a dimly lit street.

426
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,708
Chapter Six: "Those Who Pick Up,
Those Who Are Picked Up".


427
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,000
Miracles do not happen to
those who merely pray.
