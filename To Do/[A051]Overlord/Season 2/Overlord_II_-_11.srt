1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,291
[SEBAS] I will have to offer
my gratitude to Lord Ains.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,041
I did not expect this level
of support from the Tomb.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,208
Yes, command of this
operation will fall to me.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,041
If you have any objection
to the supreme one's decision,

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,416
voice it now, please.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,125
[SEBAS]
No, of course not.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,416
[DEMIURGE]
Then I hope you are not under

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,208
any mistaken impressions.

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,416
We've assembled to cull
Eight Fingers from existence.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,041
They've spit in the collective
faces of the supreme ones

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,333
with their brazen actions

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,500
and must be dealt
with accordingly.

13
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,375
I understand perfectly.

14
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:46,666
Rescuing Tuare is insignificant
next to avenging Ains Ool Goan.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,333
Now that that's clear,

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,541
please know that I also hope
for Tuare's safe return.

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,208
Should the poor thing perish,
I doubt her body could withstand

18
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
the intense strain
of resurrection.

19
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,000
How kind of you to say so.

20
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,500
Do you have a plan for
finding Eight Fingers?

21
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,541
There's no need for such a plan.

22
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,208
I've already
attained information

23
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,416
on seven of their bases.

24
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,500
Sorry, Sebas, but you
do not need to know.

25
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,208
The success of our plan relies

26
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,916
on compartmentalizing
certain components.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,750
Once Tuare is safe,
you will return with her

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,041
to Nazarick, and leave
the rest to us.

29
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,916
I understand.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,083
[DEMIURGE] Solution, back up
Sebas for the time being.

31
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,000
[SOLUTION]
Very well, Lord Demiurge.

32
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,166
What I'm about to tell you

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,458
is a matter of great
importance. Entoma?

34
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,375
[ENTOMA]
Acknowledged.

35
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,833
Killing this person
is strictly forbidden.

36
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,000
Understood, Shalltear?

37
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,166
Oh, ha, ha!

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,833
Poke fun at the vampire,
why dontcha? Jerk.

39
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,708
[DEMIURGE]
What is it, Shadow Demon?

40
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,958
Excellent.

41
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,583
It appears we now have
one more Eight Fingers base

42
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,125
to attack tonight.

43
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,416
Mare.

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,125
You and Entomah will focus
on the new location.

45
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,625
Um. Kay, I'll do my best
not to disappoint you.

46
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,750
This is a grand opportunity.

47
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,625
Use this mission
to show Lord Ains

48
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,375
your unwavering
devotion and love.

49
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,041
Failure is forbidden.

50
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,625
See that you provide results
that will wipe the slate clean

51
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,625
of any mistakes, understood?

52
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,666
So, uh, what about me?

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,666
Sorry, but you'll
have to stand down.

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,041
I'm concerned you'll lose
yourself to your Blood Frenzy.

55
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,625
You know what, I am not
even mad about it.

56
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,583
Not one little bit!

57
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,708
Now, then. Phase two
of plan "Gehenna."

58
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,708
It's a tad complex,
so do pay attention.

59
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,500
That mythril must've
cost a pretty copper.

60
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
You sure you wanna dye it?

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,416
It does mean a lot since
Renner gave it to me,

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,583
but it just stands out too much.

63
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,750
However, it's virtually silent.

64
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,041
So, I think it's perfect
for infiltrating.

65
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,708
All captains, gather 'round!

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,833
We're going to go over the plan!

67
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,666
Ah!

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,041
[LAKYUS]
All right.

69
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,125
This operation's goal
is to raid eight buildings

70
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,041
in Eight Finger's possession
and take control of them.

71
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,291
But we only have seven squads.

72
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Once we've taken control
of our assigned buildings,

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,833
everyone here will head
for the last location,

74
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,166
so don't dawdle.

75
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,791
In other words, it's
first come first served!

76
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,583
I'm sure you're all
aware of our enemy's

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,041
overwhelming strength.

78
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,125
Don't let your guards down.

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,750
[BRAIN] The squads look
fairly competent.

80
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,333
Even the Marquis' men.

81
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,791
They're a full group of former
orichalcum class adventurers.

82
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,791
Name's Lockmeyer.
Nice to meet you.

83
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,875
[GAGARAN]
Hey, virgin!

84
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,291
[CLIMB] Miss Gagaran.
Is something wrong?

85
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,666
You tell me, kid.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
Thought you might be nervous
and figured a playful

87
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,083
pat on your tight little
tushie would loosen ya up.

88
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,750
You must be Brain Unglaus.

89
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,458
I guess you'll do.

90
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,833
I'm glad I passed the test.

91
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,958
She was measuring me up,
trying to figure out

92
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,083
whether I was a warrior she
can entrust with you or not.

93
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,333
Is that true, Gagaran?

94
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,875
Absolutely not!

95
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,125
If you died tonight, I wouldn't
lose any sleep over it.

96
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,708
But with him there,
things'll be easier.

97
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,750
I wouldn't be so
certain of that.

98
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,833
There are monsters in this world
you couldn't even fathom.

99
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,083
Huh. So you're the prudent type.

100
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,708
I'm not totally adverse
to a man like that.

101
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,208
How about a little
one-on-one in the sack?

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,625
I think I'll pass.

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,333
The pressure might crush me.

104
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,958
You're probably right.
That's too bad.

105
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,875
Watch yourself out there, okay?

106
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,208
Uh, yes ma'am!

107
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,041
[BRAIN]
She's a nice lady.

108
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,375
[CLIMB] Everyone in
Blue Rose is just as kind.

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,250
Well, time to get going.

110
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,250
Right.

111
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,291
[LOCKMEYER]
Wait, hold on, it's me!

112
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,375
I just got back! So jumpy.

113
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,291
I scouted the place
with invisibility magic.

114
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,250
There's a young woman being
held captive in a prison cell.

115
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,791
and about five people who look
like they fit the description

116
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,500
of Six Arms members.

117
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,791
Five of them?

118
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,208
Sucks for us, but it
might be a good thing.

119
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,875
If Six Arms is gathered here,
then the other locations

120
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,666
should fall without much
of an effort on our part.

121
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
What are we gonna do?

122
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,041
[CLIMB] It's going to be
impossible to take this place

123
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,958
without significant force.
Let's fall back.

124
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,958
Fine with me. Let's...

125
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,291
[CLIMB]
No way.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,041
What a coincidence,

127
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,208
running into you
here of all places.

128
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,083
Lord Sebas, what are
doing around here

129
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,208
at this hour?

130
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,375
As it happens,
the woman I mentioned

131
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,125
rescuing has been taken
by Eight Fingers.

132
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,083
I was instructed to meet
them at this location.

133
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,875
[CLIMB]
Then she must be...

134
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
Can you tell me more
about the woman you saw

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
in the prison cell?

136
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,333
That's good to know.

137
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
Having most of Six Arms here

138
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,333
will make my job
a fair bit easier.

139
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,750
Does that mean...
you're willing to help us?

140
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,208
I know it's a lot to ask,
but we really need you.

141
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,666
I'd be happy to.

142
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,958
Even If you weren't here,
my duty would be unchanged.

143
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
I will deal with
the Six Arms members

144
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,125
and provide you cover.

145
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
You have our thanks, Lord Sebas.

146
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,333
I will go in through
the front entrance.

147
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,708
While I'm keeping their
attention away from you,

148
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,458
I would appreciate if you
would rescue Tuare for me.

149
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,833
You can count on it.

150
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,958
What should those
without stealth do?

151
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,375
If it's just the three of us,

152
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,875
our magic caster should be
able to make us invisible

153
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
long enough to get
past the front.

154
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,416
[BRAIN] I was more concerned
with the others.

155
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,458
Their armor is so noisy they
couldn't sneak past the dead.

156
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,250
I swear, we'll bring
Tuare back safely.

157
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,416
I would be much obliged, Climb.

158
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,250
[MAN 11A] Right on schedule.
They're waiting.

159
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,166
[SEBAS]
Hm?

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,833
[MAN 11B]
The main event.

161
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
[MAN 11C]
Better put up a good fight!

162
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,500
Aren't there supposed
to be five of you left?

163
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,833
[EDSTROM]
We're more than enough

164
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,875
even for one of your strength.

165
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,416
Though, I didn't think the
one who beat Succulent

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
would be someone of your age.

167
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,208
[MALMVIST]
That just proves he's worthless.

168
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,166
Not only did he fail, he failed
in front of Cocco Doll,

169
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,083
a client.

170
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,166
He's embarrassed
us beyond words.

171
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,958
[PESHURIAN] Well, he insisted
that he was beaten

172
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,208
by Brain Unglaus,
not an old man.

173
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,958
[DAVERNOCH] Either way,
this imprudent butler

174
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,583
had the audacity to
start all this trouble.

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,208
so he will die first.
Look up there.

176
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,541
[MALMVIST] Some of our Noble
patrons like a little

177
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,416
entertainment with their dinner.

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,833
We'll torture you for a while,

179
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,541
then finish you off just
in time for dessert.

180
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,458
Is that Zero fellow watching
from there, as well?

181
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,958
Why, yes, he is in fact.

182
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,583
[EDSTROM]
What was that about, old man?

183
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,208
Trying to challenge our leader?

184
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,041
[SEBAS]
Pay it no mind.

185
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,333
Where is she?

186
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
What have you done
with young Tuare?

187
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,958
What if I said she was dead?

188
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,750
From what I've seen,
I doubt you would be that kind.

189
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,000
[DAVERNOCH cackles]
Got me there.

190
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Even in life, I lacked mercy.

191
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,250
Lucky for her, she's meant
to be a gift for Cocco Doll.

192
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,875
She's safely secure until then.

193
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,250
Then I won't keep
you or your patrons

194
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,666
waiting any longer.

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,541
Attack me all at once,
and you might last ten seconds.

196
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,416
You're either insane or
have a death wish, human.

197
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,416
He's probably never met someone
who was truly strong before.

198
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,083
[MALMVIST] Either way,
I'm happy to oblige him.

199
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,833
Malmvist of the Thousand Kills.

200
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,750
[EDSTROM]
Of the Dancing Scimitar.

201
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,500
I am Edstrom.

202
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,583
[PESHURIAN]
Peshurian of the Spatial Slash.

203
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,750
[DAVERNOCH]
And Davernoch the Undead King.

204
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Is that so? You poor fool.

205
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,833
That title is far
beyond your reach.

206
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,083
[yelling]

207
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,916
There's only one
person who can claim

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,458
to be the Ruler of Death.

209
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,375
And you couldn't
fathom his power.

210
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,583
Your deserved far worse
than a quick death

211
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,375
for your arrogance.

212
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,750
Did you manage to
find Zero, Solution?

213
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
He does not appear
to be here, my lord.

214
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,458
[SEBAS] Hm. Then I have another
ten seconds to spare.

215
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,750
[LOCKMEYER]
Here it is.

216
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,666
[bell rings]

217
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Are you Tuare?

218
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,291
[gasps]

219
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,125
[HILMA]
What is going on?

220
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,166
[HILMA]
Excuse me, little girl?

221
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,833
[HILMA]
Or boy?

222
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,750
What brings you here
at this hour, little one?

223
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,833
I'm trying to find the
most important person

224
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,041
in the mansion.
Is that you, lady?

225
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,083
No, I...

226
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,125
Actually. Yes, I am.

227
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,125
Now could you tell me
how you got in?

228
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,958
[sighs] Thank goodness,
I thought I screwed up.

229
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,541
[door opens]

230
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,125
--[gasps]
--[MARE] Uh.

231
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,708
I need you to come
with me now, okay?

232
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
[screams]

233
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,583
You broke it!

234
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,958
Stop! That hurts!

235
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,625
Let go! Please, let me go!

236
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,833
There's no time, lady.
We're late enough as it is.

237
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,666
I'll let you handle
things from here.

238
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,958
[ENTOMA]
'Kay!

239
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,708
[ENTOMA] Get that stuff home
as quickly as you can!

240
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,333
It will be of great use to us!

241
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,541
[ENTOMA]
There's still some left!

242
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,166
Whoopsie daisy.

243
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,666
[ENTOMA]
Mm!

244
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,041
Nothing beats well-muscled
man meat when you're dieting.

245
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,375
Hey, you.

246
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,291
What kind of meat makes
a creepy crunch like that?

247
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,583
[ENTOMA]
Human.

248
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,458
Down to the bone.

249
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,208
How interesting.

250
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,708
I didn't think Eight Fingers
kept monsters around.

251
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,750
This'll be fun.

252
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,208
[ENTOMA]
Actually, could we pretend like

253
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,750
we never saw each other?

254
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,125
I'm in a hurry.

255
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,541
[GAGARAN]
No can do.

256
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,125
I'm one of the top
adventurers in the Kingdom.

257
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,375
I can't catch a man-eating
monster in the act

258
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,291
and just let it go.
Sorry, creepy.

259
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,125
[ENTOMA]
This is so much trouble.

260
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,000
Still, you're strong.

261
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,000
Maybe I'll preserve you
for a midnight snack.

262
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,208
[GAGARAN yells]

263
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,958
Come on! I'm gettin'
bored here!

264
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,583
[ENTOMA] Oh! You're quick
with that hammer!

265
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,041
Whoosh whoosh!

266
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,791
I'll crush you!

267
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,166
[ENTOMA]
Ah.

268
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,166
[ENTOMA]
You dare to soil the uniform

269
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,166
my creator gave me?
I will end you.

270
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,916
[GAGARAN]
What was that?

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,625
[ENTOMA]
Hard Armor Bug!

272
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,875
I'm an entomancer, see?

273
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,375
I summon all kinds of fun
little insects, like this one.

274
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,958
[ENTOMA]
Blade bug!

275
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,416
[ENTOMA] And then I put
them to work for me.

276
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,791
I'll kill you now.

277
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,041
I really didn't want to,
just so you know.

278
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
But you're in my way!

279
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,166
Finally taking this seriously?

280
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,958
Good, bring it on!

281
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,791
[GAGARAN yells]

282
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,041
[gasps]

283
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,583
Thanks for the save, Tia.

284
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,333
[ENTOMA]
Ninja skills?

285
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,291
So, your blood does
in fact flow red.

286
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,416
What a surprise.

287
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,583
Of course it does,
what did you expect?

288
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,208
I just thought it
would be blue by now,

289
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,166
like some kind of cool power up.

290
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,708
It could happen.

291
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,375
[GAGARAN]
I didn't change races.

292
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,250
[TIA]
All right, then a class change.

293
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,041
[ENTOMA]
Are you done wasting my time?

294
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
Spider Talisman!

295
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,875
Shadow Clone Technique!

296
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
[ENTOMA]
Hard Bullet Bugs!

297
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,208
[gasps]

298
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,625
Adamantine Shield Technique!

299
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,958
[yells]

300
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,958
What's with her?

301
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,125
She defended without
looking at me!

302
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,541
Wide field of view?

303
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,458
It's something else, but I
can't put my finger on it.

304
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,916
This is bad.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,541
I don't think we have the
slightest chance of winning.

306
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,125
[ENTOMA]
I don't need these bugs anymore.

307
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,333
[ENTOMA]
Come on, it's your turn!

308
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,041
[ENTOMA]
Oopsie!

309
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,791
I thought I'd eaten my fill
earlier, but I'm hungry again.

310
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,875
These two morsels should
really hit the spot.

311
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,250
[ENTOMA yells]

312
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,583
Flame Burst!

[ENTOMA]
Thunderbird Talisman!

315
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,791
This is so gross.

316
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,125
I can't stand
things that slither!

[GAGARAN]
No!

Creepy punk!

[ENTOMA]
I had planned to eat you first,

328
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,125
but she looks tasty
on top of filling,

329
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,250
so I guess I'll spoil
myself just this once.

330
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,500
[EVILEYE]
Don't get any closer to her!

331
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,916
[ENTOMA]
Who are you?

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,083
[EVILEYE]
Back at you.

333
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
Is a man-eating monster
in a maid uniform

334
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,958
some kind of sick joke?

335
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750
I can't imagine
anyone would be happy

336
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
with something like you
attending to them.

337
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,166
You smell of blood
and cockroaches.

338
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,416
[ENTOMA]
What did you say?

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,833
[TIA]
Evileye.

340
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,875
[EVILEYE]
Good grief, you're hopeless.

341
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,166
You need to size up your
opponent next time!

342
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,916
This one is stronger
than you two.

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
That said. I'm
stronger than her.

344
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,208
You picked on the wrong
girls, worm breath.

345
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,541
Time to swat you!

346
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,708
[ENTOMA]
No one would be happy

347
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,416
to have me attend to them?

348
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
How dare you.

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,333
None of you will
leave here alive!

350
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,041
[EVILEYE] What a foolish
attack. Reverse Gravity!

351
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,583
[yelps]

352
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,458
[EVILEYE]
You're in the way!

353
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,583
Heal Tia's wounds or something!

354
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
[EVILEYE]
Are you with that Demon God?

355
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,000
In that case. Vermin Bane!

356
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,791
[ENTOMA]
Huh?

357
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,625
[ENTOMA screams]

358
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,041
[TIA]
What did you use?

359
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,541
[EVILEYE]
Insecticide magic.

360
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,500
A spell of my own design.
I call it "Vermin Bane."

361
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,500
[TIA]
Her face is melting.

362
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,291
[EVILEYE] You're kidding.
It was a mask all along?

363
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:19,375
[ENTOMA whimpering]

364
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,833
[TIA]
A Lip Bug!

365
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,291
It devours the vocal chords
of its human victims

366
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,458
and perfectly imitates
their voice.

367
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,708
[ENTOMA]
How dare you. How dare you!

368
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,916
[GAGARAN]
You sound a lot more endearing

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,333
like that, y'know?

370
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,666
I think I prefer
your voice this way!

371
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,416
[ENTOMA]
Damn humans!

372
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,833
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

373
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,375
[ENTOMA]
That cursed spell.

374
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,166
You're the only one I need
to fear. If I kill you,

375
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,333
everything else will
go down like a simple job,

376
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,916
and I can feast!

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,708
Paralysis Technique!

378
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,375
[ENTOMA grunts]

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,625
[GAGARAN yells]

380
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,250
[EVILEYE]
Crystal Lance!

381
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,166
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

382
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,666
[ENTOMA grunts]

383
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,541
[EVILEYE gasps]
This is different. Crystal Wall!

384
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
[ENTOMA grunts]

385
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,666
Did you hear the
sound that made?

386
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,791
Her little outfit
is as heavy as my armor.

387
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,416
How's that possible?

388
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,083
[ENTOMA] That stingy spell
of yours is getting annoying!

389
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,583
What now, boss?

390
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,208
[EVILEYE] Attack her with
full force and wear her down.

391
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,291
Now that's the type of
plan I can get behind.

392
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,541
Give me the chance,
and I'll squash her!

393
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,333
[GAGARAN yells]

394
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,166
[EVILEYE]
Acid Splash!

395
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,083
[ENTOMA]
Explosive Talisman!

396
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,041
[TIA]
Adamantine Shield Technique!

397
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,541
[EVILEYE]
Vermin Bane!

398
00:19:54,958 --> 00:20:00,958
[GAGARAN panting]
We did it.

399
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,666
[ENTOMA grunting]

400
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,083
[TIA]
I'll finish her.

401
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,083
[EVILEYE]
Right.

402
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:06,750
[TIA gasps]

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,916
[EVILEYE gasps]

404
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,250
[DEMIURGE] I'd appreciate it
if you stopped there, ladies.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,958
[GAGARAN] Hey is he...
Is he like you, Evileye?

406
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,500
[DEMIURGE]
Are you all right?

407
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,500
I will handle things
from here on out.

408
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,291
Please, head back,
heal up, rest a bit.

409
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,958
[EVILEYE]
Leave.

410
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,833
That is a monster
among monsters.

411
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,250
What are you gonna do, shorty?

412
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,541
[EVILEYE]
Don't worry.

413
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,416
Once I've bought you
enough time to escape,

414
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,125
I'll get away using
teleportation magic.

415
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,333
[DEMIURGE]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

416
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,041
Shall we get started?

417
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,041
[EVILEYE]
Go! Now!

418
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,666
[DEMIURGE] It would grieve me
to part so soon after meeting,

419
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,041
so I'll block
all teleportation.

420
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,708
Dimensional Lock.

421
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
[EVILEYE]
Maximize Magic! Shard Buckshot!

422
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,458
[EVILEYE]
Nullification?

423
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,458
[DEMIURGE]
Hellfire Wall!

424
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,791
[EVILEYE gasps]

425
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
[EVILEYE growls]

426
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,791
[DEMIURGE]
My deepest condolences.

427
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,541
I didn't think that level
of flame would kill them.

428
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,416
I assumed they were
at least as strong as you.

429
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,291
Why would you team up with them?

430
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,541
If that did them in,
they were obviously weaklings.

431
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,083
[EVILEYE]
Don't you dare call them that!

432
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:33,333
[DEMIURGE]
Aspect of the Devil: Demon Arm.

433
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,541
[EVILEYE gasps]

434
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,750
[EVILEYE]
Translocation Damage!

435
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,208
[EVILEYE]
Penetrate Maximize Magic!

436
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,916
Crystal Dagger!

437
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,583
[EVILEYE] It went right through
his defenses, and nothing?

438
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,208
[DEMIURGE] Aspect of the
Devil: Razor Sharp Claws!

439
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,791
[EVILEYE] I can't get away
while carrying their bodies.

440
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,833
Which means...

441
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,708
So be it. Let's do this!

442
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,125
[EVILEYE gasps]

443
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,333
[DEMIURGE gasps]

444
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,375
[AINS]
Evening.

445
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,666
So which one of you
will be my foe?

446
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,750
[AINS] A powerful, masked
demon known as Jaldabaoth

447
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,125
suddenly appeared
in the royal capital.

448
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,958
Evileye, a member of Blue Rose,
realizes she is outmatched

449
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,791
and prepares to die.

450
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,750
However, the reinforcement
hired by Marquis Raeven

451
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,750
arrives just in time.

452
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:11,708
An adamantite adventurer,
the black-helmed Momon.

453
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,125
Chapter Twelve: "The Final
Battle of the Disturbance."


454
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,041
What in the world are
you trying to do?
