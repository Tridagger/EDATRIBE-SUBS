1
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,958
[HEAD PRIEST]
Nigun Grid Luwin.

2
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,541
As captain of the
Sunlit Scripture,

3
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,958
one of the six scriptures

4
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,375
of the Six Great Gods, you
are called upon to serve.

5
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,791
[NIGUN]
With honor.

6
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,125
[HEAD PRIEST] You will go
to the Re-Estize Kingdom.

7
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,125
Locate Gazef Stronoff,
and eliminate him.

8
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,500
[grunts]

9
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,083
[HEAD PRIEST] This treasure
contains a miracle of the Gods.

10
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,708
Use it only if necessary.

11
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,875
[NIGUN]
Attention, all units.

12
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,708
Our prey has entered the cage.

13
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,791
Devote yourself to the Gods,
and carry out their will.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,000
[GAZEF]
There they are.

15
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,416
It looks like
they've surrounded us

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
in equal intervals.

17
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,250
[AINS] Do you have some
idea of who they are?

18
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,250
Only the Slane Theocracy
could send out

19
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
this many magic casters at once.

20
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,041
And they're part of
a special ops unit

21
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,208
directly under the Head Priest.

22
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,000
It must be one of
the six scriptures.

23
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,708
[AINS] Then the men who attacked
the village earlier...?

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,041
Theocracy soldiers, no doubt.

25
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,500
Looks like they dressed in
Imperial armor to throw us off.

26
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,875
[AINS]
As I thought.

27
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,333
Does this village hold
some significant value?

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,125
If you don't know
why they're attacking,

29
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,458
then I'm assuming
they're not after you,

30
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,666
which means one thing.

31
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
[AINS] It would appear that
you are quite despised,

32
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,583
Chief Warrior.

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,875
Indeed. Well, lucky me.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:39,000
To think, even the Slane
Theocracy wants me dead.

35
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,125
[MOMONGA] But those creatures
look like Archangel Flames.

36
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,666
Why is a monster
from Yggdrasil here?

37
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,458
[GAZEF] Sir Ains.
I would like to hire you.

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,208
Name your price and I'll
make sure you get it.

39
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,958
[AINS]
Sorry, but I have to decline.

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,916
Very well.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,875
Then, please take care
and thanks again.

42
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,291
This village owes
you gratitude. As do I.

43
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,708
[AINS grunts]

44
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,083
I am grateful, which is
why I hesitate to ask.

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,541
I know this is
a selfish request.

46
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,375
Please, grant these people
your protection one more time.

47
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,583
I have nothing to offer
you now, but, I beg you.

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,708
Please-- 

49
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,583
[AINS] There is no need for
you to go that far, Gazef.

50
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:30,375
I understand. I will be sure
to protect the villagers.

51
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,375
I will even put the name of
Ains Ooal Gown on the line.

52
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,750
Then, I will have
nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,458
Instead, I will focus
on the task before me.

54
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,500
[AINS]
Take this. I insist.

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:48,958
[gasps] You're giving me a gift?
I gratefully accept it.

56
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,666
Thanks.

57
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,250
[AINS]
Good luck.

58
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,333
Ha!

59
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,166
[AINS sighs] When I first
met the humans here,

60
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,375
I saw them as no more
than insects, as you do.

61
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
But, the more I speak with
them, the fonder I grow.

62
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Like a child among
helpless animals.

63
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,375
[ALBEDO] Is that the reason
you were willing to promise

64
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,125
the honor of your great name
to his request, my lord?

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,000
[AINS]
Perhaps.

66
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,833
[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Lord Ains!

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,708
Those marauders are
still out there.

68
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,750
Why is the Chief
Warrior leaving?

69
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,875
[AINS] Because he was their
true target, not the village.

70
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,625
Then, should we just
stay here and wait

71
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,541
for him to deal
with those brigands?

72
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
[AINS]
That would be unwise.

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,958
Once the Chief Warrior and
his men disrupt their lines,

74
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,500
we will make our escape.

75
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,541
He will cause as much
commotion as he can

76
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,791
to make a clear path for us.

77
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,708
[BOTH sigh]

78
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,791
We'll attack them head on!

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,500
Break through the soldiers
and lead the enemy

80
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,166
away from the villagers!

81
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,458
After that, continue to retreat!

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,000
Timing is crucial here!

83
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,458
[SUBORDINATES]
Understood, sir!

84
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
Now, then.

85
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,666
Let's paint the ground with
their God-loving guts!

[GAZEF]
Magic really pisses me off.

98
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:59,541
All right. It's done.
This is all according to plan.

99
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,750
It's up to you, Sir Ains.

Huh?

Stay by Gazef's side...!

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,625
[SUBORDINATE 4B]
We're the ones who will protect

104
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,791
this country!

[SUBORDINATES yelling]

106
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,125
I told you to retreat!

107
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,791
What are you doing
coming back for me?

108
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,208
You're all damn fools.

109
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,625
But your fools I'm
proud to fight beside.

110
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,291

Huh?

[SUBORDINATES grunting, yelling]

115
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,708
There's too many. They'll
completely overtake us.

116
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,458
[GAZEF] But, if we take out
their commander, it's all over!

117

Impressive.

Mastering that many
skills isn't easy.

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,541
Sadly, it won't save you.

130
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,833
Summon another set of angels.

131
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,250
Focus all of your magical
attacks on the Chief Warrior.

132

We're in trouble.

I lose to the likes of you!

Yes, you will die,
and you'll only have

your blaspheming tongue
to blame for it.

There's nothing you
can do to stop us.

Once we're through with you,
we'll massacre the villagers.

and just lie down
like a good dog.

Yeah, you and your little army.

When the man in the

00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,625
it will be a massacre.

Kill him, angels.

[VILLAGE CHIEF] This is the

00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,791
Lord Ains set up
a magical barrier

to keep us all safe.

00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Is he here?

170
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,416
He was, but he just vanished

171
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,791
right in front of our eyes.
Then you appeared in his place.

But, please, call me Ains.

179
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,333
[AINS] I have something
of a relationship

180
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,916
with those villagers.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,791
Have you come to
beg for their lives,

182
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,958
or just your own?

183
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,250
[AINS]
No, no. You misunderstand.

184
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,333
[SLANE PRIESTS]
Hm?

185
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,958
[AINS]
I overheard your conversation

186
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,958
with the Chief Warrior.

187
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,625
You really have a lot
of balls, don't you?

188
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,791
Huh?

189
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,625
[AINS] I spent my
precious time and energy

190
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,291
saving those people,
and you brazenly declared

191
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
your intent to massacre them.

192
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,291
I can't imagine
anything more offensive.

193
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,208
You're being rather
brazen yourself,

194
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,166
for a meager magic caster.
So, what do you plan to do?

195
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,166
[AINS] Offer your pitiful life
to me without resistance.

196
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
Do this and there
will be no pain.

197
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,000
However, if you refuse,
I swear, here and now,

198
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:23,291
you will die painfully and in
despair for your imprudence.

199
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,583
Have the angels
attack this fool!

200
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,916
[gasps] Is that all you had?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,500
I expected more after
a bluff like that.

202
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,500
Huh?

203
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,041
[AINS]
Did you not hear me?

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,958
I said to offer your
life without resistance.

205
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,666
By the time I'm
through with you,

206
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,916
you'll wish you had listened.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
[SLANE PRIEST 4C]
A trick!

208
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,750
[SLANE PRIEST 4D]
Yes! It has to be!

209
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,041
[AINS] High Tiered
Physical Nullification.

210
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,083
It's a passive skill
that completely nullifies

211
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,166
the physical attacks

212
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,333
of low-leveled
weapons and monsters.

213
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,458
[gasps]

214
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,916
[AINS yells]

215
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,125
[AINS]
As I thought.

216
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,666
They really are the Archangel
Flames from Yggdrasil.

217
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,458
[AINS] The fact that you can
use magic and summon spells

218
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,583
from Yggdrasil intrigues me.

219
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,291
I want to know why
they exist here,

220
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,541
and how you could
have learned them.

221
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,458
But, for now, I'll
focus on killing you.

222
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,958
It's my turn.

223
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,416
You wanted a massacre?
You'll get one.

224
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't just stand there.
Attack him! Hurry!

225
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
[AINS]
Albedo, stand back.

226
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,000
[ALBEDO]
Lord.

227
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,166
[AINS]
"Negative Burst"!

228
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,625
[SLANE PRIESTS gasping]

229
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,708
[gasps] That's not... possible!

230
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,333
[GAZEF] When the man in
the village comes for you,

231
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,041
it will be a massacre.

232
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:55,125
[SLANE PRIESTS shouting spells]

233
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,375
[AINS]
Hm.

234
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,250
It would seem they know
more Yggdrasil spells

235
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,708
than I initially thought.

236
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,250
Tell me! Where did
you learn that magic?

237
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,833
[SLANE PRIEST 4A yelping]

238
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,250
What just happened?

239
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,708
[AINS]
Albedo.

240
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,166
You're well aware that these
pitiful, low-level spells

241
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,958
would have done me no harm.

242
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,708
There was no need
for you to interfere.

243
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,791
[ALBEDO]
I beg your pardon, Lord Ains.

244
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
but if someone wishes
to fight a Supreme Being,

245
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,708
such as you, they should
at least be able to best me.

246
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,500
These men are mere pebbles
fighting a mountain.

247
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,791
[AINS laughs] I'm afraid they
wouldn't meet your requirements

248
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,666
in ten lifetimes.

249
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Now...

250
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,958
Principality of
Observation! Attack!

251
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,458
[AINS] My, my. I guess
I should fight back.

252
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
"Hell Flame."

253
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,375
[SLANE PRIESTS gasping]

254
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,500
[NIGUN]
That was... one hit!

255
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,125
That's impossible!

256
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,625
There's no way a high level
angel could be destroyed

257
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,125
using only one spell!

258
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,333
[SLANE PRIEST 4C]
Captain Nigun, sir!

259
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,958
What should we do now?

260
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,625
We'll summon the
highest-level angel!

261
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,083
[SLANE PRIESTS gasp]

262
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,458
[MOMONGA]
Is that...?

263
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791
[MOMONGA] Based on how it
glows, it's a sealing crystal

264
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,375
that can hold any magic
other than top tier spells.

265
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,916
So, they even have
Yggdrasil items.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,958
[AINS] Albedo. I believe
your skills may be required.

267
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,125
[ALBEDO]
Understood!

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,750
Behold! The shining form
of the highest of angels!

269
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,208
Dominion Authority!

270
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,583
[SLANE PRIESTS cheer]

271
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,000
[AINS]
Wait.

272
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,708
You're telling me this is
your strongest trump card?

273
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,375
That's right.

274
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,125
I didn't think I'd have to call
on it, but you proved worthy

275
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,541
of its divine greatness!

276
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,166
[AINS] I'm at a complete
loss for words.

277
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,666
Regretting your folly?

278
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,125
I wouldn't blame
you if you were.

279
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,416
[AINS]
This is stupid.

280
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,583
What?

281
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,041
[AINS] I can't believe
I put up my guard

282
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,916
for this sort of child's play.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,125
What was that?
You can't be serious!

284
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,750
No way. You're, lying!

285
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,208
Mankind can't compete
with its might!

286
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,833
I'll show you!

287
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,916
Smite him with
your divine power!

288
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,125
Dominion Authority
is the holy product

289
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,000
of seventh tier magic!

290
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,833
Nothing can survive it!

291
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,166
Now, receive the Gods'
judgment and repent!

292
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,416
[AINS laughs]

293
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,458
Huh?

294
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,708
[AINS laughing]

295
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:06,041
[AINS] So this is how it feels
to take damage. This is pain!

296
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,833
[gasping]

297
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,291

299
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,958
[ALBEDO]
You lower life form!

[screams]

301
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,333
[ALBEDO]
That's my love!

302
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,458
My beloved Lord Ains, the
ruler of my heart and soul!

303
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,416
You caused him pain!

304
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,875
And for that,
you will know hell!

305
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,333
[AINS]
Calm down, Albedo.

306
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,125
[ALBEDO]
But, Lord Ains!

307
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,458
[AINS]
It's fine.

308
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,875
Aside from the surprising
weakness of the angels,

309
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,458
everything is going exactly
as I had foreseen it.

310
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:41,416
[AINS] It's my turn
again. Know despair!

311
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,291
"Black Hole"!

[SLANE PRIESTS gasp]

313
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,291
[NIGUN] Even demons don't
have this kind of power.

314
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,291
Just who in the world are you?

315
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,166
[AINS]
Ains Ooal Gown.

316
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,791
In the past, there
was no one alive

317
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,625
who did not fear this name.

318
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,625
Hey, what was that?

319
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,166
[AINS]
It seems that someone was using

320
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,916
reconnaissance magic
to watch you from afar.

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,291
I'm guessing the Theocracy.

322
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,416
But my defense barrier
counteracted it,

323
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,291
so I doubt they saw very much.

324
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,333
My country was watching me?

325
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,083
[AINS] If that's all you had,
it's time to end this.

326
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,291
[NIGUN]
No! No, no, no please, wait!

327
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,166
I beg of you, Sir Ains. I mean,
Lord Ains! Spare my life!

328
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
The rest of these
men don't matter!

329

[SLANE PRIESTS yell]

330
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,125
[NIGUN] I'll give you
anything you wish! Name it!

331
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,833
I will do whatever it
takes to appease you!

332
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,041
[ALBEDO]
I think you're confused.

333
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,291
Huh?

334
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,958
[ALBEDO] Lord Ains has
no need for sniveling

335
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,625
lower life forms. Humans like
you should bow their heads

336
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,541
and give thanks to him for
ending their miserable lives.

337
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,333
What's that mean,
"humans like me"?

338
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,875
[AINS]
What was it you said to Gazef?

339
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,833
"Cease your futile resistance

340
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,250
and just lie down
like a good dog."

341
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,708
As an act of mercy,

342
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,750
I'll make sure your
death is painless."

343
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,958
[MOMONGA]
I wonder...

344
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,041
Did I live up to
Albedo's expectations

345
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,750
as the Lord of Nazarick?

346
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,291
So cool! Lord Ains
is such a badass.

347
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,541
[AINS]
Hm? Did you say something?

348
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,416
[ALBEDO]
Hm? Nothing, my lord.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
But, if I may ask, why did
you save that human soldier?

350
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,125
You even gave him
that important relic.

351
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,541
[MOMONGA]
Actually, it was a gimmick item

352
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,791
from a lottery machine.

353
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,750
More importantly, you
could have sent me

354
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,541
to fight in your place.

355
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,041
I am your shield.

356
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,291
There was no need to personally
risk your life like that.

357
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,208
[AINS]
I know your strength, Albedo,

358
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,291
and I trust your devotion.

359
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,666
However, until we know
more about this world,

360
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,041
we must proceed with
the utmost caution.

361
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,291
Believing the enemy is stronger
than us keeps us safe.

362
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,666
So you tested their power
by using him as a pawn!

363
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,958
Your use of humans is
truly impeccable, my lord.

364
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,250
Uh, however...

365
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,708
I fail to see how taking
that last angel's attack

366
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,708
head on counted as "caution."

367
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,333
[AINS]
Is that so?

368
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,000
Watching you feel pain
was more than I could bare.

369
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,916
I knew you would come through
it unscathed, but still.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,333
No woman wants her
true love to get hurt!

371
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,416
[AINS]
Oh, right.

372
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,875
Let's go home, Albedo.

373
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,333
[ALBEDO]
With pleasure, Lord Ains!

374
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,583
[AINS]
Everyone.

375
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:40,125
I want to apologize for
leaving the Tomb on my own.

376
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
There will be time
to fill you in

377
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,666
on all that has happened.

378
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,500
However, there is a
more pressing matter

379
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,750
I want to attend to.

380
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,250
"Greater Break Item"!

381
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,208
[GUARDIANS gasp]

382
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,583
[AINS]
I have changed my name.

383
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,250
From this day forward,
I will be known as:

384
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,666
Ains Ooal Gown!

385
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,791
You shall call me Ains!

386
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,375
If you have any objections,
stand and voice them!

387
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,666
We have heard your
precious name, lord.

388
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,708
And devote ourselves to it
with unwavering loyalty.

389
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
Glory to Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

390
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041
[GUARDIANS] Glory to Lord
Ains Ooal Gown! All hail!

391
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,791
We give ourselves to you,

392
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,083
utterly and without
any hesitation!

393
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,541
[BOTH] To the most
powerful Supreme Being!

394
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,958
Everyone in this world will know

395
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,541
of your greatness, and
fear your undying wrath.

396
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,791
[COCYTUS] Our king, who
rules over all, forever.

397
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,833
Glory to the Overlord,
the supreme ruler of death!

398
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,125
[AINS]
This is an absolute order!

399
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,291
Make the name Ains Ooal
Gown an eternal legend!

400
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,791
[GUARDIANS cheer]

401
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,208
[MOMONGA] Across the land,
through the sky,

402
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
and over the sea.

403
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,875
I will spread the name
of Ains Ooal Gown

404
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,708
to every corner of
this strange new world.

405
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,500
If any of my friends
have come here as well,

406
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,875
they'll know they're
not alone and find me.

407
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,500
[ALBEDO] Demiurge,
please tell everyone about

408
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,125
your conversation
with the master.

409
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,500
I was with Lord Ains
the first night we arrived

410
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,666
in this world and
he told me this:

411
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,666
"The stars glitter like jewels.

412
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,416
I was sent to this land to
obtain those jewels for myself,

413
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,791
along with every treasure
that shines beneath them."

414
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,041
Then, after a moment,
I heard him say:

415
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,125
"The most enjoyable
thing now might be

416
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,875
taking over the world." Yes.

417
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,416
[ALBEDO]
Hear that?

418
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Let it be known, here and now,
that this is our final goal.

419
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,958
As servants of the
Tomb of Nazarick,

420
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,875
we will present this
world to Lord Ains,

421
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,125
without fail!

422
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,583
[GUARDIANS cheer]

423
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,625
[AINS]
In order to collect information

424
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,541
about this new world, there's a
need to live among the humans.

425
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,875
To this end, I've hidden my
skeleton body in a suit of armor

426
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,541
and entered the Adventurer's
Guild under the name "Momon"

427
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,125
with Narberal at
my side as "Nabe."

428
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,208
If I make a name
for myself here,

429
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,125
I'll be able to make some money
and gather vauable intel.

430
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,416
It's a completely perfect plan.

431
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,666
But I couldn't have foreseen

432
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,041
that even Narberal hated
humans so pasionately.

433
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,125
Chapter five: "Two Venturers."
