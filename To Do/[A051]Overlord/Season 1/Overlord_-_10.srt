1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,041
[SOLUTION] You call this a
meal?! It tastes like dog food!

2
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,541
My apologies, madam.

3
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,875
[SOLUTION]
Enough!

4
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,791
I do not wish to stay here
a moment longer, Sebas.

5
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,666
Understood, my lady.

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,083
[SOLUTION]
Hmph.

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,000
[SOLUTION]
Zach!

8
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,458
Yes, Miss?

9
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,083
Stop stuffing your face
and get the carriage.

10
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,875
I want this town at my
back within the hour.

11
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,541
Please, return to your meals,
ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,625
[knocking]

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,458
Excuse me, Miss.

14
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,916
I'm afraid I took the
performance too far.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,333
Please, forgive me.

16
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,000
There is no need to lower
your head to me, Solution.

17
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,083
I am supposed to be
your butler for as long

18
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,708
as we continue this charade.

19
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,208
Yes, that is true
for this mission.

20
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,375
However, as a member of
the Pleiades, I am your

21
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,500
subordinate first and
foremost, Master Sebas.

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, Lady Shalltear has
most certainly grown anxious

23
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,250
to play her part in all of this.

24
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,416
I will let her know the
time has finally come.

25
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,125
By the way, is Zach
performing as we expected?

26
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,416
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,708
As we speak, he is meeting with
a filthy man in the back alley.

28
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,875
[ZACH]
She's perfect.

29
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,000
[SOLUTION]
They are planning to attack us

30
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,583
somewhere outside the city.

31
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,375
And use me for all manner
of unspeakable things.

32
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,416
I am happy to hear it.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,041
Everything is unfolding exactly
as Lord Ains predicted.

34
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,291
One more thing, master.

35
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:28,041
I'd like to have that man
once he's no longer useful.

36
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,208
It would be best to ask
Lady Shalltear first,

37
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,250
but I'm sure it will be fine.

38
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,166
[SOLUTION]
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,125
And why are you
so interested in him?

40
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,541
[SOLUTION] He thinks he will
get to enjoy a piece of me.

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,875
So, I thought I'd
let him have a taste.

42
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,083
A little slice of heaven
before he sees hell.

43
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,791
[chuckles]

44
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,625
[SHALLTEAR]
Let me guess, Sebas.

45
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,583
Our unfortunate prey finally
took a bite of the bait?

46
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,666
[SEBAS]
Yes. Wonderfully.

47
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,375
[SHALLTEAR]
It's about time.

48
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,083
With any luck, we will find
a magic or martial arts user

49
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,250
that will suit Lord Ains, and
we will return to him soon.

50
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,041
If I may, my lady.

51
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,750
There is something
I've wanted to ask you

52
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,791
for some time now.

53
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,166
Go on.

54
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,000
[SEBAS] It's quite apparent
that you and Lady Aura

55
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,750
do not get along well.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,541
I was wondering if there was
a special reason for that.

57
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,583
I always thought
we got along fine.

58
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,541
There is no bad blood
between the two of us.

59
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,583
I simply tease her
because my creator,

60
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,458
Lord Peroroncino,
decided that I should.

61
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,750
You see, that flat-chested
insect's creator,

62
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,708
Lady Bukubuku Chagama,
is actually the sister

63
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,000
of Lord Peroroncino.

64
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,375
I never knew about this!

65
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,458
I happened to overhear
my blessed creator

66
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,166
talking about it with
Lord Ains one evening.

67
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,666
[PERORONCINO groaning]

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,375
[MOMONGA]
Is something wrong, Peroroncino?

69
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
[PERORONCINO] My sister is
the lead voice in the new

70
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,666
H-Game I just bought.

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,958
[MOMONGA] Well, Bukubuku
Chagama is a popular

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,166
voice actor these days. But I
totally feel your pain, man.

73
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,625
[PERORONCINO] I was itchin'
to hit it hardcore, too.

74
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,958
[MOMONGA] Better save those
tissues for another day.

75
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,208
What is a "voice-actor"?

76
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,416
Apparently, voice actors have
an incredibly important job.

77
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,458
They imbue souls into beings
that are otherwise soulless.

78
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,875
To put it plainly,
they bring things to life,

79
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,916
like any decent god should.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
I see.

81
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,708
Thank you for sharing all of
that with us, Lady Shalltear.

82
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,083
You honor us both.

83
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,708
Learning more about
the Supreme Beings

84
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,916
is truly humbling.
Especially from you, my lady.

Why don't you come outside?
We wanna play with ya!

88
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,625
You'll let me have a
go afterwards, right?

89
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,750
I mean, I am the one
who brought them here.

This ain't your lucky
night, sweetheart.

00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:48,125
Just go along with it and we
won't take your life, okay?

94
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,625
You got a hell of a
pair for a little girl.

95
00:06:55,708 --> 00:07:00,625
As if I would let you defile
me with your dirty hands.

96
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,666
Oh god, what the hell
happened to my hand?

97
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,583
Humans make far too much racket.

[MERCENARIES gasp, whimper]

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,083

This is already boring.

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,416
Do me a favor and
clean up the rest of them.

103
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,041
But how? Who the hell
are these people?

Mister Zach. This way.

[SHALLTEAR] It looks like
we've managed to do nothing

114
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
but waste our precious time.

115
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,750
[BRIDE 10A]
Lady Shalltear, we have found

116
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,500
the nest of these humans.

117
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,750
There is a man among
them, called Brain,

118
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,250
who is adept at
martial arts skills.

119
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,333
Apparently, he fought
on equal terms

120
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,041
with Gazef, the royal head
warrior of this kingdom.

121
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,625
I know that name.

122
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,666
I believe he's considered the
strongest fighter in Re-Estize.

123
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,666
This "Brain" sounds like
the perfect candidate.

124
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,166
Indeed, he does.

125
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,041
However, Solution and I must
part ways with you here,

126
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,000
as we have a mission
to collect information

127
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,333
in the capital for Lord Ains.

128
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,833
May we meet in the

Brain, thank the Gods!

135
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,875
We're being attacked!

136
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,625
Yeah, that much is
obvious. How many?

137
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,916
[MERCENARY 10F] Oh, right.
There are two of them.

138

Both women.

than my God Flash strike.

[gasps] How? There's no way!

176
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,125
I think you just realized
how futile this is.

177
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,250
I may be a petite and
beautiful little monster,

178
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,541
but I'm also cold,
cruel, and ruthless.

179
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,125
If you have another attack,
you should try it now.

180
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,791
[gasps]

181
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,666
What's the matter?

182
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,458
Was that all of the
martial arts you know?

183
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:41,375
Martial arts? Is that what
you think I was doing?

184
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,791
[BRAIN yells]

[SHALLTEAR yawns]

187
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:03,041
What's wrong?
Are you tired already?

188
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,083
I thought you'd have
more stamina than this.

189
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,083
Huh?

190
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,250
How strange.

191
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,166
I thought you used
martial arts to increase

192
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,291
your strength and speed.

193
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,541
[BRAIN gasps]

194
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,125
[SHALLTEAR] But I don't
notice any difference.

195
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,166
You're just as weak as you
were before we started.

196
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,750
If you want to make
a good impression,

197
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,083
you, sir, are going to have
to work a lot harder than that.

[BRAIN sobs]

199
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
There is still hope for you.

200
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,625
The fact that you know
martial arts means

201
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,916
you might be of minor use
to my beloved master.

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,458
I am such an idiot.

00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:47,166
[yells]

204
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,958
[SHALLTEAR] Oh, my. Are we
playing a game of tag now?

205
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,625
You really like to
fool around, don't you?

206
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,125
Too bad.

207
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,875
[SHALLTEAR] I've wasted enough
time with you as it is.

00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,666
let's play hide and seek!

I'm sorry for intruding,

00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,208
but there are humans
heading this way.

Don't look into her eyes!
We must fight to escape!

241

[SHALLTEAR]
I know I have to capture them.

242
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,833
But I want to kill them!

243
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,750
I want to rip them
limb from limb,

244
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:35,541
and bathe in their blood!

you precious, sweetie?

her to me alive!

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,125
Look in my eyes!

265
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,250
Where did you get this potion?

266
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,458
[BRITTA] A man clad in
black armor gave it to me

267
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,541
at one of the inns in E-Rantel.

268
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,833
Could she have been given orders
by the Supreme One? No.

269
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,375
He was probably
making connections.

270
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,916
What were you and your
party doing out here?

271
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
It was for a job.

272
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,458
We were hired to find a group
of soldiers turned mercenaries.

273
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,541
When we sensed that something
was off, we split up.

274
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,333
Split up? There are more?

275
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,500
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,750
We had a ranger
stationed further away,

277
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,875
in case we were ambushed
or the worst happened.

278
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,000
He's probably on his
way back to E-Rantel.

279
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,833
Then, the scream I heard was...

280
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm such a fool! Come, children!

281
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,500
[SHALLTEAR] Find every last
human in this forest

282
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,291
and devour them!

[sobs] How could I let
this travesty happen

284
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,500
on my watch? Lord Ains will
reprimand me for sure.

285
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,625
My children were
defeated that easily?

286
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,583
[growls]

287
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,750
[SHALLTEAR]
That one is strong.

00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,250
[SHALLTEAR growls]

289
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,625

00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,833
[SHALLTEAR]
You're in my way!

291
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,500
[SHALLTEAR yells]

292
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,416
[SLANE THEOCRACY CAPTAIN 10A]
Lady Kaire!

293
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,875
[ALBEDO]
I'm afraid I must report that

294
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,541
Shalltear Bloodfallen
has betrayed us.

295
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:02,208
[AINS]
"Master Source, Open." I see.

296
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,208
This is why you believe
Shalltear betrayed Nazarick?

297
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,166
After we lost contact with her,

298
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,041
I checked the Master
Source and discovered

299
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,958
this abnormality.

300
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
And the vampire brides
that accompanied her

301
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,291
have both perished.

302
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,166
[AINS] Is there a chance
Shalltear has died as well?

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
If that were the case,

304
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,250
her name would
disappear from the list.

305
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,208
Unfortunately, that
hasn't happened.

306
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,500
[MOMONGA]
She's got a point.

307
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,416
If we were still in Yggdrasil,
this status marker would

308
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,083
indicate that a third party
has used mind control magic

309
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,833
and temporarily turned
our NPC into an enemy.

310
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,541
But that should be impossible.

311
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,750
Since Shalltear is undead,
she has a passive skill

312
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,416
that nullifies all forms
of mind control instantly.

313
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,916
[AINS] From what we've
gathered, there are talents

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,625
and martial arts in this world
that did not exist in Yggdrasil.

315
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,916
Is it possible she has
fallen under the influence

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,541
of one of them?

317
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,083
[ALBEDO]
I do not know.

318
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,541
However, it does not change
the fact that she has revolted.

319
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,208
I suggest we send
a hunting party

320
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,958
to deal with her, immediately.

321
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:04,958
[AINS]
Hm...

322
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,958
[ALBEDO]
I will lead our forces.

323
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,958
Cocytus and Mare will accompany
me as vice-commanders.

324
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,541
We will need that much
to take Shalltear down.

325
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,708
Her strength is formidable.

326
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,958
[AINS] No. I feel that
would be too hasty.

327
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,000
First, we must confirm
whether she has revolted

328
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
of her own free will or not.

329
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,125
[MOMONGA] If something like
this can happen to the NPCs,

330
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,166
I need to find out what it
is and how to counter it.

331
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,250
Or Nazarick will crumble.

332
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,791
[AINS sighs]
If she betrayed us

333
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,791
because she is
displeased with me,

334
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,500
or our treatment of her,
I would understand.

335
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,083
Displeased?

336
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,125
If she truly thinks that after
you've been so merciful to us,

337
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,875
I won't allow her to live!

338
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,791
[AINS]
Please, Albedo, calm yourself.

339
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,791
Remember, my old
comrades created

340
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,875
all of your personalities.

341
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,250
They made you with
all of their hearts.

342
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,708
That includes the bad qualities,
as well as the good.

343
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,250
You are made exactly
as they wanted you.

344
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,708
And I love all of you for that.

345
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,541
--So, if Shalltear has indeed
--[ALBEDO] Loves? He loves us.

348
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,125
--Peroroncino laid out for her.
--So... He loves me!

349
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,416
Loves me. Loves me.

350
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,750
He loves me!

351
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,958
[AINS] Uh-- Hey, Albedo.
Weren't you listening?

352
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,625
I said "all of you." 

353
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,791
Yes, I know.

354
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,833
But "all" includes me,
doesn't it?

355
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,250
Am I right, my lord, Ains?

356
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:29,041
[AINS]
I, w-well, yes, I suppose so.

357
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,666
--Lord Ains said he loves me!
--[AINS] Albedo, wait.

358
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,916
--Lord Ains said he loves me!
--That's not what I--

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,666
[ALBENDO] This is the
greatest day of my life!

360
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,333
[AINS] Anyway! Before
we do anything else,

361
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,666
we must find Shalltear.

362
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,708
[AINS]
An emergency announcement

363
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,375
has come from the
Adventurer's Guild.

364
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,500
According to the Guild Master,
a vampire in the form

365
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,000
of a young girl has appeared
not far from the capital.

366
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,666
In order to minimize
Shalltear's exposure,

367
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,625
I volunteer to hunt
her down myself.

368
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,041
Any embers that may fall upon
Nazarick must be destroyed.

369
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,416
Utterly... Completely...

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,083

and Understanding."
