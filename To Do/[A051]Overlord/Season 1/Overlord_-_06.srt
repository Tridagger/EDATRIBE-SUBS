1
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,708
Um. Mr. Peter?

2
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,958
Yes?

3
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,458
Why don't we take a break,
around that area?

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,208
[PETER]
Good idea.

5
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,791
Mr. Momon.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
[AINS]
I understand.

7
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,375
[PETER]
Enjoy this.

8
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,416
Things will get a little
dangerous from here on out.

9
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
[AINS] Don't worry about
us. We'll be careful.

10
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,583
[MOMONGA] I'll have to be,
considering I can't use

11
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,583
most of my magic in this armor.

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,791
Playing the tank role was
never really my speed.

13
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,625
[MOMONGA] If things start
to get out of hand,

14
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,083
Narberal will use
fifth tier magic.

15
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,791
I'm not sure what
we'll be facing,

16
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,541
but hopefully, that
will be enough.

17
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,125
If not, I may have
to get serious.

18
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,083
Try not to look
so worried, Nabe.

19
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,083
Everthing'll be fine
as long as I'm here.

20
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,041
I'm the best set of eyes
and ears this side

21
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,166
of the Re-Estize Kingdom 

22
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,250
Don't be shy. You can praise me.

23
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,875
Can I squash him yet?

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,125
[AINS]
Nabe.

25
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,583
Mosquitos should be
handled without mercy.

26
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,291
Please, sir.

27
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,625
Harsh!

28
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:14,500
But it's okay, gorgeous,
I so can tell you want me.

29
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,500
[PETER, NINYA, DYNE
laugh nervously]

30
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,416
You know, I just
realized something.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,583
We've crossed into the Wise King
of the Forest's territory.

32
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,291
[AINS]
Who is this "Wise King"?

33
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,958
It's a very old and
powerful magical creature.

34
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,500
At least, that's
what the legends say.

35
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,375
Not only can it cast magic,
but it's physically strong.

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,583
And if its four razor claws
don't finish you off,

37
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,083
its snake tail will.

38
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,583
[AINS] Interesting. I think
I'd like to meet it.

39
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,875
[DEMIURGE breathes deeply]

40
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,750
[door clicks]

41
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:40,041
[ALBEDO sighing, moaning]

42
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,375
[DEMIURGE]
Albedo.

43
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,541
[ALBEDO gasps]

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,166
You have your
own accommodations,

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,166
why are you in Lord Ains' room?

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,666
I was rubbing my scent
into everything I could.

47
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,500
I wanted it to be the
first thing he smelled

48
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,708
when he finally returns.

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,500
[DEMIURGE] Considering he
doesn't require sleep,

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,208
I doubt that will happen.

51
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,083
Fine, just, don't overdo it.

52
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm sure I don't
know what you mean,

53
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,500
but we'll try. Right? Lord Ains?

54
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,250
Uh-- Ugh.

55
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,791
Is that... a life-sized
body pillow?

56
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,833
Yeah. Isn't it great?

57
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,500
--[DEMIURGE sighs]
--[ALBEDO] I made it myself.

58
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,166
Now I'm working on
the socks and clothes

59
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,791
for our first child.
I need to be prepared.

60
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,458
It won't be much
longer. I can feel it.

61
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,333
I've made enough for
the first five years.

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,000
Boy or girl,
they'll have everything

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,791
they could ask for.

64
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,083
Wait a minute, what if the
child doesn't have a gender?

65
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,000
If the elf twins
are any indication,

66
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,666
the Supreme Beings have no issue

67
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,416
with their
servants crossdressing.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,208
Yes! You're right.

69
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
Thank you, Demiurge.

70
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,208
That's exactly what
I needed to hear!

71
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,375
[sighs] I'm always
happy to help.

72
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,750
[AINS] Such things are
actually possible?

73
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,041
[NINYA]
Yes.

74
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,083
You can make a lot
with creation magic,

75
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,708
even basics like salt and sugar.

76
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,916
There are also spells like
Alarm that can warn you

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,541
when danger is nearby.

78
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,083
[AINS]
I see. May I ask something else?

79
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,708
[MOMONGA] The more I know,
the more questions I have.

80
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,541
It seems their technology level
is that of the Middle Ages,

81
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,250
but the sophistication
of their magic

82
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,666
is on a completely
different level.

83
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,250
[LUKRUT]
I just realized.

84
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,666
You always seem
super relaxed, Nabe.

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,291
Is it because you know
that I'm keeping you safe?

86
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,125
It has nothing to do with
you. I'm with Mr. Momon.

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,291
[LUKRUT] So, what you're telling
me is that the two of you

88
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,583
are lovers after all?

89
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,791
[gasps] No, I never said that!

90
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,541
Stop putting words in my mouth!

91
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,416
Lady Albedo is the
only one he needs...!

92
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,625
[AINS] Stop, Nabe!
What are you thinking?

93
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,833
Uh...

94
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,000
[AINS clears throat] Mr. Lukrut,
please stop looking into

95
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
our personal lives.

96
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,375
Sure. My bad. Though,
from the sound of it,

97
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,583
you're one lucky
man, Mr. Momon.

98
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,333
[PETER] I'm sorry. He can be
really idiotic sometimes.

99
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,500
Please forgive him.

100
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,916
I promise he doesn't
mean any harm by it.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,291
[AINS] It's fine. As long as
he's careful from now on.

102
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,791
We'll have no trouble.

103
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,750
You really need to stop delving
into people's business--

104
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,625
They're on the move.

105
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,500
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

106
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,458
From where?

107
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,416
Just past the tree line.

108
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
I don't think we'll be
able to avoid this fight.

109
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,333
It's going to get
rough very quickly.

110
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,750
The best thing you can do
is stay hidden in the cart.

111
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,250
'Kay. My life is in your hands.

112
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,333
Mr. Momon, what's the best
way to split the group up?

113
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,125
[AINS] All of you should
stay close to Nphirea.

114
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,166
I'll show him that our
services are worth every coin.

115
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,833
That sounds good to me.
But we're not just gonna watch.

116
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,375
You'll have all the extended
support we can muster.

117
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,625
[NINYA] If we go completely
defensive, most of them

118
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,375
will escape back
into the forest.

119
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,916
In that case, I say
we do the usual.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,375
Pull the turtle's head out
of its shell and cut it off.

121
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,291
It's a sound strategy,
but still flawed.

122
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,375
Even though Mr. Momon will take
the brunt of their attack.

123
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,750
What about the ones
that get through?

124
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,166
That's easy.

125
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,916
I'll use my Fortress martial art
and hold back the ogres.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,250
The goblins are yours.

127
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,416
I was hoping you'd say that.

128
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,625
[PETER] Ninya, you'll protect
me with defensive magic.

129
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,625
Once I'm clear, focus on crowd
control and attack spells.

130
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,125
Right. No prob.

131
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,000
Lukrut, you'll take care
of any wayward goblins.

132
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,041
And if an Ogre gets
past me, take it out.

133
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,250
Leave it to me.

134
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
Does all of that work
for you, Mr. Momon?

135
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,708
[AINS]
Yes.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,541

Here goes.

He's stronger than I thought.

Could he be orichalcum,
or maybe adamantite level?

About time.

[AINS]
They're a skilled party.

166

They're aware of
each other's strengths

167
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,583
and work well together.

[OGRES groan]

176
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,666
Uh!

177
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,375
[LUKRUT]
Hey!

178
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
Don't let them escape!

179
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,125
"Minor Healing Light."

180
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,916
[AINS]
Are the ears valuable?

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,833
Not on their own, but
you can exchange them

182
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,041
and other parts for a
reward from the guild.

183
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,791
It can be pretty lucrative.

184
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,958
[AINS] So crystals or
rare trinkets don't just

185
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,958
randomly drop from them?

186
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,708
To be honest, I've
never even heard

187
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,500
of ogres carrying
crystals or trinkets.

188
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,000
[AINS]
I see.

189
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,166
You were pretty
amazing back there.

190
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,500
The two of you are far more
skilled than we expected.

191
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,291
[LUKRUT] I wouldn't mind
having a sword like that.

192
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,000
I've seen incredible
fighters before,

193
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,916
but I wouldn't be surprised
if you're stronger

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,541
than the royal head warrior.

195
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,291
Far stronger.

196
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
It's moments like
these that remind me

197
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,500
there is always a
bigger fish in the sea.

198
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,666
[AINS]
Don't worry.

199
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
In time, your team
will be able to defeat

200
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,541
even greater odds with ease.

201
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,958
[NINYA]
Uh?

202
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,083
[DYNE, PETER, LUKRUT chuckle]

203
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,750
[ADVENTURERS laughing]

204
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,333
[DYNE]
I think you got the worst of it.

205
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,375
[LUKRUT]
Oh, yeah?

206
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,291
Well, you didn't
see the other guy!

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,166
[DYNE chuckles]

208
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,375
[NPHIREA laughs]

209
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,250
[MOMONGA]
Crap. What should I do?

210
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,333
If I drink it, it'll
go between my bones.

211
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,208
What's the matter?
I-Is the soup too hot?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,708
[LUKRUT] If that's the
case, I can let it cool

213
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,416
in my mouth first and
feed it to you that way.

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,208
Uh...

215
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,416
[AINS] The food's fine,
we're just observing

216
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,416
a religious custom. In our
faith, it's considered impolite

217
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,291
to eat with several
people the same day

218
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,083
we take another's life.

219
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,125
Oh. You believe in some
interesting teachings,

220
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,666
Master Momon. I respect that.

221
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,000
[AINS]
I've been wondering.

222
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,333
Where did the name "Swords
of Darkness" come from?

223
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,666
Oh, that. Tell 'em, Ninya.

224
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,875
Don't make me!
I was young and stupid!

225
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,625
It really is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

226
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:08,208
That's easy for you to say.
You didn't come up with it.

227
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,750
[PETER]
Anyway.

228
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,625
It's a reference to the old
legends, The Thirteen Heroes.

229
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,125
We named our party
after the swords

230
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
of one of the fabled warriors.

231
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,500
[MOMONGA]
Huh? Is that all?

232
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,833
Crap. He must expect
me to know it.

233
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,041
What do I do?

234
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,541
I don't know them. Who are they?

235
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,875
[MOMONGA]
Oh, thank you!

236
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,041
Here I thought everyone
knew the legends.

237
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,666
Among The Thirteen Heroes,
there was one called

238
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,166
the "Black Knight" who
wielded four powerful swords

239
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,083
known only as "The
Swords of Darkness."

240
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,333
See, when we started
our little group,

241
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,166
our ultimate goal was
to find the swords

242
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,041
for ourselves someday.

243
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,375
But, we needed a
symbol in the meantime.

244
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,291
So we carry these
daggers as placeholders.

245
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,541
I don't care that these
aren't the real deal.

246
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
They represent the
creation of our team,

247
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,791
and that's more important to
me than any mythical blade.

248
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,250
You know, I think that's
the first time Lukrut

249
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,375
has said something
mildly meaningful.

250
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,083
[LUKRUT]
Hey! Take that back!

251
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,583
[PETER] Who are you and
what'd you do with our friend?

252
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,750
[LUKRUT]
Shut up!

253
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,583
I'm a silver-tongued
fox and you know it.

254
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,833
[MOMONGA]
I used to be like them.

255
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,875
I adventured with my friends,
collected materials,

256
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,708
and helped build Nazarick.

257
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,291
You all seem very close.

258
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,958
Is it common for
adventurers to get along?

259
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,833
Yeah! We all trust
each other with our lives.

260
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,625
[LUKRUT] It helps that our
team is nothing but guys, too.

261
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,666
Throwing a girl into the
mix would be distracting.

262
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,500
I think our greatest
strength comes from

263
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,666
sharing a common goal.

264
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,041
It keeps us focused
on the future.

265
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,541
[AINS]
You're lucky.

266
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,333
Amazing things happen when
everyone shares the same goal.

267
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,958
Were you on a team, Mr. Momon?

268
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:54,041
[AINS] It wasn't as an
adventurer, but, yes, I was.

269
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,625
Once, when I was weak
and alone, a holy knight

270
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,916
clad in white armor
saved my life.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,791
He led me to the people
I would eventually

272
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,666
call my comrades.
It changed me forever.

273
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,500
[AINS] They were the best
allies I could ever hope for.

274
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,041
More than that.
They were friends, family.

275
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,416
I will never forget the
days I spent with them,

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,875
as long as I live.

277
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,125
[MOMONGA] Ains Ooal Gown,
you were the world to me.

278
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,916
Mr. Momon. Don't worry.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,333
I'm sure that you'll find
more allies just like them,

280
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,333
one of these days.

281
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,500
[AINS]
That day will never come.

282
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,333
[AINS]
Excuse me.

283
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,041
[AINS]
Nabe, I'm eating over here.

284
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,041
Yes, I think I'll
join you as well.

285
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,041
I hope you enjoy it.

286
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,000
[NINYA] I think I might
have insulted him.

287
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,125
[DYNE] Mm. Something bad
must have happened.

288
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,375
[PETER] If I had to guess,
they're probably all gone.

289
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,791
He has the aura of someone
who's lost all of his comrades.

290
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,291
That feeling stays with you.

291
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,041
[LUKRUT]
I bet. It's hard to imagine.

292
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
You can't take back
what you've said,

293
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,083
so don't fret over it.

294
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,375
All you can do from this point
is atone through your actions.

295
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,541
Work hard to paint over this
mistake, and move forward.

296
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,416
[NINYA]
Mm-hm. I'll do my best.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,958
[NINYA]
I don't understand

298
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
how I could have
been so thoughtless.

299
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,125
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

300
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,833
Right, sis?

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
That fight was intense

302
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,375
and Mr. Momon was incredible!
Who knew he was so strong?

303
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
I know! He was something else.

304
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,708
I've never seen
anything like it before.

305
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,833
[NPHIREA] He stopped that
ogre with one strike.

306
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,208
It must take serious
skill to pull that off.

307
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,666
Yeah, serious skill.

308
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
Momon could probably give
even the Royal Head Warrior

309
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,083
a run for his money.

310
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,291
[NPHIREA]
Huh?

311
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,375
But that would make
him adamantite class!

312
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,416
Do you actually believe
he's the same level

313
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,208
as the strongest
adventurers in the world?

314
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,583
That's what I'm saying.

315
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,708
--[NINYA] Mm-hm.
--Yes.

316
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,708
[NPHIREA]
Amazing.

317
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
[PETER] I didn't think much
of him when we first met.

318
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,666
Well, I was a bit jealous of
his full set of plate armor.

319
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,375
[LUKRUT] Fess up, you were
ogling Nabe like the rest of us.

320
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,791
Yeah, right.

321
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,083
But now, after seeing
his skills first hand,

322
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,083
I can't help feeling inadequate.

323
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,208
Hey, he's got a
few years on you.

324
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,291
It's entirely possible
that he's been training

325
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,666
for much longer.

326
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,333
Hold on, how do you know
that he's older than Peter?

327
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,416
Back in town, he
took his helmet off

328
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,833
for a moment, and
we got a good look.

329
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,125
[NPHIREA]
What country is he from?

330
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,458
I need to know!

331
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,833
Sorry, we didn't
ask for specifics.

332
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
He's the same race
as Nabe, which might be

333
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,500
why they're together,
but she could get easily

334
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,958
get someone much hotter.

335
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,125
I doubt that his
looks are an issue.

336
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,750
Besides, with skills like that.

337
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
I'm pretty sure he doesn't
have trouble getting

338
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,958
with women of any race.

339
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,166
Women instinctively flock
to men with strength,

340
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,958
no matter their looks.
It's a fact of life, my friend.

341
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,250
[sighs]

342
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,166
[DYNE] Master Nphirea?
Is something wrong?

343
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,916
[NPHIREA] It's really
not all that important.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,250
I just feel a bit uneasy.

345
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,958
[NPHIREA] Is Mr. Momon
really popular with women?

346
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,958
Putting aside his
physical looks,

347
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,125
his strength is the real deal.

348
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,333
And, judging by the quality
of his swords and armor,

349
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,833
he's obviously quite wealthy.

350
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,541
Oh...

351
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,333
All right, spill it.

352
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,500
[NPHIREA]
Well. There's this girl.

353
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,875
I can't help being afraid
that she might fall for him

354
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,625
once we get to Carne.

355
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,333
It's stupid, I know.

356
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,416
Is that all?!

357
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,041
Don't worry, I'll teach
you all the ways

358
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,375
to make a woman's knees bu--

359
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,916
Zip it! Or else!

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,250
Ow!

361
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,833
That's my money-maker
you just assaulted, jerk!

362
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,125
Uh--

363
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,000
What kind of person is she?

364
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,125
Just keep trying. If you
give up, it's all over.

365
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,166
[PETER] We'll even help support
you, at no extra charge!

366
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,750
--[LUKRUT] Come on!
--[PETER] You can do it!

367
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,583
You guys...

368
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,583
[DYNE]
Be persistent!

369
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,583
[ADVENTURERS laugh]

370
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,208
[laughs]

371
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,541
[CLEMENTINE humming]

372
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,375
[groans]

373
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,958
[CLEMENTINE humming]

374
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:57,083
[INFORMATION BROKER 6A whimpers]
Why are you doing this?

375
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,333
Because you peddle
information, and I need

376
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,708
some on a talented pharmacist.

377
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,500
You want Nphiera Balear.

378
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
There, I told you.
Now please, let me go!

379
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,041
[CLEMENTINE]
Oh, silly man.

380
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,875
You could be lying to me.
I should be thorough.

381
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,125
If you want proof,

382
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,958
all you have to do is
ask the other brokers!

383
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,125
They'll tell you the same
thing, I'm sure of it!

384
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,375
[CLEMENTINE] You're taking
the fun out of this.

385
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,875
Fine, I'll put it another way.

386
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,208
Huh?

387
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375
[CLEMENTINE]
I... love... killing.

388
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,083
Bloodshed is my one
true passion, my art.

389
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,000
And I need practice.

390
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,041
Oh! Did I mention torture?

391
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,833
[whimpers]

392
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,500
Hey! I didn't say
you could leave!

393
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,791
[panting]

394
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,333
What the hell is wrong
with that woman?

395
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:44,500
--[groans]
--[CLEMENTINE laughing]

396
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,875
My, my, that looks painful.

397
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:52,583
[INFORMATION BROKER 6A laughs]
It is. But I feel fantastic.

398
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,458
Good. Very good.

399
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:58,083
Now tell me what I want to know.

400
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,333
[KHAJIT]
"Create Undead."

401
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,458
[MAN 6A groans]

402
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,583
[CLEMENTINE] That Jewel
of Death sure is great

403
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,541
at making zombies.

404
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,916
But, I think you might be going
a little overboard with it.

405
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,416
Because you keep playing around.

406
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,166
I like my work.

407
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,458
[KHAJIT]
You need to focus, Clementine.

408
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,166
I've spent years
preparing to turn E-Rantel

409
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,833
into a city of death.

410
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,291
But, for my plan to work,
I need its people to be alive.

411
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,708
[CLEMENTINE] Oh, right.
That Spiral of Death, thingy?

412
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
[KHAJIT]
Precisely.

413
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,208
The same ritual that our
exalted leader once tried.

414
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,541
If done correctly,
it will turn the capital

415
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,416
into a pit of undeath overnight.

416
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,041
If I use this to collect
the power of death

417
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
that's left in its wake...

418
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:54,083
...my dream of immortality
will, at last, be realized.

419
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,833
[KHAJIT] If your antics
continue to cause me trouble,

420
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,375
you'll be the next
zombie I create.

421
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,083
[CLEMENTINE]
Hm.

422
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,916
[CLEMENTINE cackles]

423
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,125
You're more foolish
than I thought.

424
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,208
Don't be mad.

425
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,000
That was nothing
more than a love tap.

426
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,750
[KHAJIT]
We both know that's a lie.

427
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,500
[sighs]

428
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,666
You always manage
to impress, Khaji.

429
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,625
It's sexy.

430
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,416
[KHAJIT grunts]

431
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,958
[CLEMENTINE]
Oh, almost forgot.

432
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,500
I'll be sure not to bring
my playthings home.

433
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,583
That work for you?

434
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,583
[KHAJIT sighs]

435
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,375
[CLEMENTINE humming]

436
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,375
[KHAJIT] Hard to believe she
was once a Black Scripture.

437
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,000
Her power earned her the
ninth seat of their order,

438
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,458
but that corrupt personality
made her troublesome.

439
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,250
I'll have to keep an eye on her.

440
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,833
[AINS] The bodyguard mission
is going smoothly,

441
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,333
but I need something
more than this

442
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,625
if I want to make
a name for myself.

443
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,208
According to Nphirea,

444
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,583
the forested area
outside of Carne Village

445
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,166
where he gathers
his herbs is home

446
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,041
to a wise and powerful creature

447
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,500
that has lived for
hundreds of years.

448
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,041
Conquering such an
ancient creature

449
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,000
could be exactly what I
need to raise my status.

450
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,625
So, I order Aura to
locate it at all costs.

"Wise King of Forest."
