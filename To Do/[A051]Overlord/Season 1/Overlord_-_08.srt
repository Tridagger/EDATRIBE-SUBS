00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,916
[door creaks]

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,625
[CLEMENTINE] It's about
time you showed up,

3
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,625
I was starting to get worried
something bad had happened.

4
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,041
Shame on you for making me wait.

5
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,250
Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,916
The shop will open
in the morning.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,041
Hey! Do you not know
who this woman is?

8
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,666
[CLEMINTINE cackles]
'Course he doesn't.

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,708
Or he'd be running away.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,250
Huh?

11
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,958
Nphirea! Get behind us.

12
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,375
Your affinity for
magical items is exactly

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,125
what I need for my plans.

14
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,708
I want you to summon an army
of the undead just for me.

15
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,625
What?

16
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,208
Whether you like it or not,

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,625
you'll wear the Crown of Wisdom.
So you might as well come along.

18
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:19,250
It'll be fun. Whaddya say?

19
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,666
Who the hell are you?

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,666
[CLEMENTINE]
I'm the last person

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,625
who's going to see
you boys alive.

22
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,125
After you've all suffered
a slow and painful demise,

23
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,166
your friend and I are
going to cast a spell.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to release
an undead army together.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,500
There's no way to
control the amount

26
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,625
of creatures that I'm planning
on raising from the grave,

27
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,916
so be prepared for utter chaos.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,750
I've waited so long
for this power!

29
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,291
[yells]

30
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,083
Leave now. Run away
as fast as you can.

31
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,041
I can't.

32
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,291
Ninya. You need to flee as well.

33
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:47,958
Huh?

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,500
Take the boy and go!

35
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,083
We won't allow this lady
to capture either of you.

36
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,083
They're right.

37
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,166
Your big sister
is counting on you

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,833
to rescue her from
those aristocrats.

39
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,833
Slip away while you
still have a chance.

40
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,000
You guys...

41
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,750
[laughs] This is just
the saddest scene.

42
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,916
As if anyone could escape.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,166
There's not even the slightest
chance that it could happen.

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,708
[ADVENTURERS gasp]

45
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,250
Stop playing around.

46
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,666
[CLEMENTINE whines]
Oh, all right, fine,

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,875
but did you place the spell

48
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,625
that will cover
up their screams?

49
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,833
I'd like to take my
sweet time playing with

50
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,958
one of them at the
very least. 'Kay?

51
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,208
[whimpers]

52
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,000
[NINYA]
Save us, Momon.

53
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,916
[AINS]
Sorry that took so long.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,458
I don't mind waiting.

55
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,250
[AINS]
The request was approved.

56
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,833
From now on, you shall
be called Hamusuke.

57
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,250
Take great pride
in the name, I shall.

58
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,000
It talks!

59
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:19,666
[gasps]

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,000
How cute!

61
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
How can a copper plate
even afford that creature?

62
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,125
Well, I've heard that
he's wearing a disguise.

63
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,666
And he's actually
a famous adventurer.

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,083
[LIZZY]
Hey, I know you.

65
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,541
Aren't you the man my grandson
hired to accompany him

66
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,083
on his herb gathering trip?

67
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,625
[AINS]
Hm?

68
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:39,291
I am Nphirea's grandmother.
The pharmacist Lizzy Ballear.

69
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,541
[AINS]
Oh, yes.

70
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,625
You are correct, we were
the ones who traveled

71
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,125
to Carne Village with him.

72
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,708
I am Momon and this
is my partner Nabe.

73
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,500
This animal is-- 

74
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,500
Hamusuke. My name, it is.

75
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,458
The Wise King of the
Forest, I used to be.

76
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,833
Absurd, you're an
overgrown rodent.

77
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,875
Am I supposed to believe
this is the legendary

78
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,958
King of the Forest?

79
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,750
[FOREST KING]
Mm-hm!

80
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,916
[AINS]
It is.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,375
He was out of control
and confronted us

82
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,583
during our mission
with your grandson.

83
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,666
But I beat him into submission.

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,875
Shocking. Did Nphirea
make it back okay?

85
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,375
[AINS] Yes, he should be at the
store by now with his herbs.

86
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,291
We were about to make our
way over there to collect

87
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
the payment for a job well done.

88
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,541
That's where I'm heading.
Care to escort a fair maiden?

89
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,833
[AINS]
It would be my pleasure.

90
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:29,125
[LIZZY] Nphirea! Mr. Momon
is here for his reward.

91
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,541
Where is that boy hiding?

92
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,416
[AINS]
Something's not right.

93
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,958
[gasps] What's wrong?

94
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,625
[AINS]
Where does this lead?

95
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,708
To the room where we
store medicinal herbs.

96
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
[AINS gasps]

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,458
[LIZZY gasps]

98
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,125
These men have been murdered!

00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:05,791
[ADVENTURERS groaning, growling]

100
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,041
They're zombies!

--[AINS grunts]
--[DYNE groans]

104
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't see Nphirea.

105
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,041
[AINS]
That's because he's not here.

106
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,916
[LIZZY]
Nphirea!

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,916
[AINS]
Keep Lizzy safe.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,416
[NARBERAL]
I'm right behind her.

109
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,666
[AINS]
Ninya.

110
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,416
[AINS] Why leave only
him alive? What the...

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,666
[LUKRUT]
"Throwing a girl into the mix

112
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,958
would be distracting." 

113
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,208
[AINS]
So that's how it was.

114
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,250
[AINS]
Whoever did this... will pay.

115
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,833
[AINS]
Stabbed through the head.

116
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,625
[LIZZY] I've looked everywhere!
My grandson isn't here.

117
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,333
[AINS] It doesn't look like
the perpetrators stole

118
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,125
anything from their packs.

119
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,458
So that means Nphirea was
the only thing they came for.

120
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,166
Who were these poor
men that got killed?

121
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,916
[AINS] Adventurers that
came along with us

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,333
on your grandson's quest.

123
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,833
I'm sorry about your friends.

124
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,375
[AINS]
I barely knew them.

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,083
This was the first job
we ever did together.

126
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,333
Oh.

127
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,250
[AINS]
How do you want to handle this?

128
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,375
Whaddya mean?

129
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,041
[AINS]
You want to find Nphirea, right?

130
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,000
We're dealing with at least
a third tier spell caster.

131
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,500
One that decided to use
Create Undead on these men

132
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,750
instead of just
hiding the bodies.

133
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,583
Which is odd, since that
would have given them

134
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,666
a bigger head start.

135
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,291
The culprits were confident
that they would get away.

136
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,500
And wanted to advertise
the power they possess

137
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,500
and are willing to use.

138
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,166
These are dangerous people.

139
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,125
We need to act quickly
if we want to find them.

140
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,958
You need to make a request.

141
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,208
Huh?

142
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,625
[AINS] The right person
would make quick work

143
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,500
of this spellcaster.

144
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,500
What happened here
was a tragedy.

145
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,791
But you are lucky,
Ms. Lizzy Balear.

146
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,375
I happen to be the only
adventurer in town strong enough

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,791
to rescue your grandson.

148
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,916
And I'm currently
in between missions.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,791
If you want to save
Nphirea, make a request

150
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,375
and I may just
accept your offer.

151
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,791
You can have whatever you want.

152
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,541
Just go save him,
bring my Nphirea home!

153
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[AINS] I will. But my
services are not cheap.

154
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,875
Do you have the
means to pay my fee?

155
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,625
How much would you
charge an old lady?

156
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,875
[AINS]
Everything.

157
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,958
What?

158
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,250
[AINS]
I'll take all that you possess.

159
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,875
You fiend!

160
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,708
I've heard tales of demons
that make deals with humans

161
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,541
for their very souls.

162
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,125
Is that what you're
asking of me now?

163
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,375
Are you two really demons?

164
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,375
[AINS] Would you not be
willing to pay that price

165
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,041
for his life? It would
be a shame to lose

166
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,750
such a talented young man.

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,083
[growls]

168
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,375
[AINS] Time's ticking away
and I need an answer.

169
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,125
Make it quick.

170
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,125
You win. Consider
yourself hired, devil.

171
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,458
Take whatever you want from me.

172
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,875
[AINS] The first thing
we need to do is locate

173
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,875
where Nphirea is being held.

174
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,375
[NARBERAL]
How will we figure that out?

175
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,041
[AINS]
The criminals made one mistake.

176
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,916
Although they didn't
steal any valuables,

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,583
they took the time to remove
each man's adventurer plate.

178
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,958
Any guesses why that is?

179
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,916
The plates are worthless.
So I'm not sure.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
--[AINS] I'll explain.
--[beeping]

181
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,333
[ENTOMA]
Lord Ains?

182
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,500
[AINS]
Entoma.

183
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,208
[ENTOMA]
I have some information.

184
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,916
[AINS]
You caught me at a bad time.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,458
I'm in the middle
of something right now,

186
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,500
but I'll notify you
when I'm available.

187
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,208
[ENTOMA]
Certainly, master. Also,

188
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,500
Lady Albedo asks
that you contact her.

189
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,125
[AINS]
As I was saying.

190
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,625
The plates were taken
as hunting trophies.

191
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm assuming the culprit
collects them as souvenirs.

192
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,500
Which is lucky for us
since we now have

193
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,750
something to track. We'll use
the Locate Object scroll.

194
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,833
[AINS]
You already know how to use it.

195
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,833
Let's find ourselves
some plates.

196
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll activate it now.

197
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,083
[AINS]
Hold on.

198
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,833
The enemy may have set the
counter spell Detect Locate.

199
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,708
So we need to cast Fake Cover
and Counter Detection

200
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,541
to break through any defenses
they may have prepared.

201
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,458
[AINS]
Hm. There's no way

202
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,583
for them to hide from
all these spells.

203
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,958
So, start whenever
you're ready, Narberal.

204
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,875
"Fake Cover."

205
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,500
"Counter Detection."

206
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,166
[MOMONGA]
We have to be careful.

207
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,083
Collecting information
with magic is dangerous.

208
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,416
This encounter may
end in a Player Kill.

209
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,250
And if that happens, we need
to be overly prepared for it.

210
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,916
The Player's Handbook that
Punitto Moe wrote taught me

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,458
the importance of
attacking hard and fast.

212
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,416
[NARBERAL]
"Locate Object"!

213
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,125
[NARBERAL]
Right here.

214
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,375
[AINS] That's in the
middle of the cemetery.

215
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,041
A fitting choice.

216
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,250
Please cast Clairvoyance
and Crystal Monitor

217
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,750
at the same time.
I want to see for myself.

218
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,208
"Clairvoyance"!
"Crystal Monitor"!

219
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,625
[AINS]
I see Nphirea. Among the undead.

220
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,125
And I can sense the ones
that stole the plates.

221
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,625
They are nearby.

222
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
What are your orders?

223
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,625
We could teleport there
and attack immediately.

224
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,000
Or use magic and launch
an assault from the sky.

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,291
[AINS]
Don't be foolish.

226
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,375
[gasps]

227
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,958
[AINS]
An army of the undead is ready

228
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,833
for such a reckless attack.

229
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,666
Whoever woke up that many
men from their graves

230
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,500
has something big planned
for them. That's good news.

231
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Our names will spread far and
wide once we save Nphirea,

232
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,625
and stop whatever grand scheme
they're trying to pull.

233
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,083
[AINS] Unfortunately,
we have to move fast

234
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,500
and have no time to research
their plan further.

235
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
We've finished.

236
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,541
What have you discovered?

237
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,541
[AINS] They have fled
into the cemetery.

238
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,916
Is my grandson there?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,291
[AINS]
Yes.

240
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,666
He's being guarded by a
large legion of the undead.

241
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,875
[gasps]

242
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,375
[AINS]
Don't be scared.

243
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,916
Nabe and I can handle
them, but a few undead

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,916
may escape the grounds.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,625
That's why we need you
to let the townsfolk

246
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,375
and Adventurer's Guild
know what's happening.

247
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,875
We are headed to the cemetery
now, so you need to be quick.

248
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Hold it. Just how do
you plan on defeating

249
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,958
such a large army of the undead?

250
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,833
[AINS]
With this weapon right here.

251
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,375
[SOLDIER 8A] Looks like
another uneventful night.

252
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,625
It's been awhile since
we've seen any action.

253
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,666
--Even the undead
--[groaning]

254
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,250
--have been quiet.
--[groaning]

255
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Huh? What was that noise?

256
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,291
Nice try, man, stop trying to--

257
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
Be quiet. I think
I heard it again.

258
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,000
It's just in your head.

259
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,750
[SOLDIER 8C]
Hey! Something's coming!

260
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,833
I don't believe it.

261
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,250
[SOLDIER 8A]
It's an entire army.

262
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,666
[CAPTAIN 8A] I've never seen
this many undead at once.

263
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
There's at least 1,000 of 'em!

264
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,833
Notify the reserves, quickly!

265
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,875
We'll try to hold them off
the gate until backup arrives.

266
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,958

276
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,916
Huh? An adventurer?
Thank goodness.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,750
Damn, he's just a
useless copper plate!

278
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,000
Leave before you get killed!

279
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,833
[AINS]
Nabe. My sword.

280
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,041
Look up. You'll
want to see this.

281
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,041

[CAPTAIN 8A]
Uh... Who are you people?

286
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
[AINS]
Open the gate.

287
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,958
You have a death wish?

288
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,541
There's an entire legion of
undead on the other side!

289
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,041
[AINS]
I know.

290
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,875
Don't worry about a thing.
Momon is here to save you all.

291
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,125
Huh?

292
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,625
[AINS]
Fine then.

293
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,458
If you won't open the gate,
I'll just have to improvise.

294
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,083
[FOREST KING]
Don't worry 'bout me!

295
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,208
I'm right behind you, Lady Nabe!

296
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,250
Through thick and thin,
Hamusuke will be by your side!

297
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,708
That he shall!

[SOLDIERS, CAPTAIN 8A gasp]

299
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,916

Wait. It can't be.

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,541
[gasps]

301
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,916
What is it?

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,666
The voices of the
undead just... stopped.

303
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
[SOLDIER 8B]
It's not possible.

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,708
There's no way they
defeated that many undead

305
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,541
all by themselves.

306
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,541
[SOLDIER 8C] That man.
What was his name again?

307
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,541
Momon, I think. I've never
heard of him before.

308
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,500
And we're sure he was
only a copper plate?

309
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,666
Seems wrong.

310
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
Well, I wonder if
he's the fabled

311
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,583
adamantite plate I've
heard rumors about.

312
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,916
[CAPTAIN 8A]
Whatever he is,

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,416
we just witnessed
a myth in the making.

314
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,041
The legend of a
raven black warrior

315
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,708
who becomes a hero!

316

[FOREST KING]
So sorry.

320
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,541
Cause you this much trouble,
I did not mean to.

321
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,833
Stop wiggling around, will you?

322
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,708
It's hard enough to
carry you as it is.

323
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,708
[AINS] All undead creatures
are naturally drawn

324
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,208
towards the living.

325
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,791
If you were down here,
they'd try to overwhelm us.

326
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,333
So embarrassing, this is.

327
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,500
[UNDEAD ARMY groaning]

328
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,083
[AINS]
Damn.

329
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,541
It's going to take us forever
to cut through this pack.

330
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,625
I agree.

331
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,625
We should ask
Nahzahreek to send help.

332
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,041
[AINS]
Definitely not.

333
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,500
That would defeat
our entire purpose

334
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,208
for accepting this quest.

335
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,833
[NARBERAL]
If we wish to become renowned,

336
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,125
shouldn't we wait
for an incident

337
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,916
that claims more human lives?

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,750
People would have a greater
respect for our power

339
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,375
in a situation like that.

340
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,083
[AINS] The enemy's goal
is to take over the town.

341
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,125
The capital is too important
to be under the control

342
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,208
of an outlaw. I would
have approached

343
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,166
this situation differently
if I'd been better informed.

344
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,041
But there was no time to spare.

345
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,291
Yes, of course.

346
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,083
You are right as
usual, Lord Ains.

347
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,208
Please forgive me for
questioning your strategy.

348
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,083
I should have expected
this level of foresight

349
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,416
from a Supreme Being
like yourself.

350
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,541
By the way, would
you mind alleviating

351
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,458
my naivety on another
related matter?

352
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,291
I don't understand
why we didn't send in

353
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,708
forces with stealth
skills ahead of us.

354
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,708
They would have killed
most of the undead,

355
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,583
then we could have swooped
in and finished off

356
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:24,708
the strongest opponents
at our leisure.

357
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,625
[AINS] How will you ever
learn if I always tell you

358
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,750
the answer, Nabe? Try
figuring it out yourself!

359
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,333
Yes. I will endeavor to improve.

360
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,416
[AINS] That said, we don't
have time for leisure now.

361
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,166
We need to make a path.

362
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,166
And I think I know
what will do the trick.

363
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,375
"Summoning second tier
undead. Jack the Ripper"!

Wow. Unstoppable, they are.

Now then. Let's continue.

Master! Creepy place, it is.

374
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,250
Scared to be left alone, I am.

[KHAJIT FOLLOWER 8A]
Master Khajit, they're here.

376
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,083
[AINS]
Nice. Now I have a name.

377
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,333
Greetings! Are you
enjoying your night, Khajit?

[AINS] Go have fun and
stop wasting your time

381
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,166
on a dull ritual.

382
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,166
[KHAJIT] Hmph. There's nothing
dull about this ritual.

383
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,125
As you'll soon witness.

384
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,291
Since you now know my name,
how about sharing yours?

385
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,833
[AINS] We're just adventurers
out doing a job.

386
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,333
I'm sure you've seen the
boy we're looking for.

387
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,000
Make it easy and show
us where he's hidden.

389

While you're at it,

390
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,291
point me in the direction
of your friend.

391
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,625
The one that carries
the piercing weapon.

392
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,208
Surely they're not too
scared to face me.

393
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,708
Or maybe they are only brave
enough to fight the weak?

394
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,708
[CLEMENTINE] You took the
time to examine the corpses.

395
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,041
Smart guy.

396
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,500
Go back in.

397
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,083
Khaji, this fella
has figured us out.

398
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,916
There's no point
in hiding anymore.

399
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,250
Aw, come on.

400
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,541
Don't you wanna tell sweet
lil' ole' me your name?

401
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,750
Huh? My name's Clementine.

402
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,041
The pleasure's mine.

403
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,916
[AINS] I'm your executioner.
Call me Momon.

404

Oh! You're confident.

405
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,625
Tell me, how you figured out
that we came to the cemetery?

406
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,958
[AINS]
Why, it was you who led us here.

407
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,375
Open up your cloak.

408

Whoa! Hey!

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,916
Now you're making me blush.

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,458
And I like it.
Looking for these?

411
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
[AINS] Those plates are
the reason I was able

412
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,416
to track you so easily.

413
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,458

Nabe.

414
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,958
Sir.

415
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,291
[AINS] Please exterminate Khajit
and his followers for me.

416
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,291
I'm going to take care
of this woman myself.

417
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,208
It will be done.

Let's finish our business
over here if you don't mind.

422
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,125
Okay!

423
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,500
This girl is harmless.

How annoying.

Why don't you just
roll over and die

430
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,375
like a good little rodent?

[CLEMENTINE humming]

432
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,958
I guess those men
I killed in town

433
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,291
were friends of yours,
is that right?

434
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,500
Did you come here to avenge them
or something stupid like that?

435
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,291
[giggles] Did you notice
the magic caster

436
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,416
was really a girl? She kept
insisting that someone

437
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,416
would come to rescue them.

438
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,083
But I got bored
of waiting around.

439
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,000
[AINS]
I barely knew those adventurers.

440
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,041
Really? That's disappointing.

441
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,291
I was so looking forward
to all the whining about

442
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,875
how they meant so much to you
and I had no right to kill them.

443
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,291
Please say you're
not going to have

444
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,416
one of those boring deaths.

445
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,166
I can't get hard
if you're not angry.

446
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,333
[AINS]
This isn't vengeance.

447
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,666
They were in your way and
needed to be dealt with.

448
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,833
I would have done the
same thing in your shoes.

449
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,416
It would be hypocritical
to condemn you.

450
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,916
That being said, by killing
them, you've robbed me

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,708
of valuable assets. They were
vital components in my plans.

452
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:44,666
In other words...
You're in my way!

453
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,958
[CLEMENTINE]
Fabulous.

454
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,958
I promise there's no
way you can defeat me

455
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,291
by yourself, though.

456
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,458
It's a shame you left your
spellcaster with Khaji.

457
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,291
He gets to kill her.
No fun for me.

458
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,416
[AINS] Nabe can take you out
just as easily as I can.

459
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,958
You're hilarious!

460
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,833
All it takes is a slice
and a quick stab.

461
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,500
I've killed plenty of
magic users that way.

462
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,791
[AINS]
Impressive.

463
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,458
I know all the
people strong enough

464
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,958
to fight me in this country.

465
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,083
There's a person from Blue Rose
and one from Drop of Red.

466
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:16,666
Then probably Gazef Stronoff.
And maybe Brain Unglaus.

467
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,458
[AINS]
Ha. Thanks for the information.

468
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,833
Sounds like you need
to be given a handicap.

469
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,875
Consider it a sympathetic
parting gift from me to you.

470
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,833
[growls] You must not
have a brain underneath

471
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,916
that helm of yours if you
think you can talk to me

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,166
like that and get away with it.

473
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,166
The inhuman Lady
Clementine doesn't

474
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,041
lose brawls to
nobodies like you.

475
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,791
You're about to learn
why people fear me!

476
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,375
[AINS]
I see nothing to be scared of.

477
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,875
You're a joke.
Now shut up and fight!

478
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,541
[AINS] I finally find the
person that I had been seeking.

479
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,458
She's hiding deep within
the heart of the cemetary.

480
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,125
The fool who destroyed
The Swords of Darkness,

481
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,833
some of my most valuable
assets thus far,

482
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:32,333
is a psychotic female
fighter named Clemintine.

483
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,208
She uses her
signature, "Stiletto,"

484
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,458
to torture and maim her prey,
and even claims her skills

485
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,083
have surpassed
human limitations.

486
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,750
Well... I'll have to show
her what it really means

487
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,791
to be inhuman.
