1
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,791
[AINS]
Aura. Mare.

2
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,000
This is where we part ways.

3
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,833
Scout the area for enemies
as soon as we do. Understood?

4
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,208
[AURA, MARE]
Lord.

5
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,708
[AINS] But, if you find
yourself outnumbered by even

6
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,958
the smallest degree,
retreat to Nazarick at once.

7
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,541
Understood, Lord Ains.

8
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,375
We will do as you command.

9
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,166
[AINS] Excellent.
Make sure that you do.

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,875
Remember, your retreat
is an important part

11
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,000
of my overall plan. Also,

12
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,833
the Depiction of Nature
and Society and Avarice

13
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:23,083
and Selfless are world class
items, treasured by Nazarick.

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,333
They must never
be taken from us.

15
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,083
Depending on the situation,
they are more important

16
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,625
than your lives.

17
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,583
[BOTH]
Yes, lord!

18
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,958
[MOMONGA]
Strange.

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,208
I used magic to detect
the owner of the world item

20
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,166
that's controlling Shalltear,
but they aren't nearby.

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,041
Did they really just
leave her out here alone?

22
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,375
It doesn't make sense.

23
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,291
[DEMIURGE]
I've returned.

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,125
Now then. Care to
tell me what's going on?

25
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,250
You already know
the answer to that.

26
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,708
Everything Lord Ains told me
was conveyed over "Message." 

27
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,958
I was referring to why you
let him go without support.

28
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,250
It was the master's call.

29
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,333
I simply obeyed it.
As I hope you intend to.

30
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,333
Why did you not protest?

31
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,041
We could have sent in minions
in case this is a trap.

32
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,708
If all the Guardians
fought together,

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,625
there isn't a force
that could overtake us.

34
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,416
I couldn't begin
to guess the reason

35
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,791
behind his decision.

36
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,875
But it is obvious that
Lord Ains was lying to us.

37
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,208
Don't pretend that
you didn't notice it!

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,375
Yes. It is as you say.

39
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,291
Then why did you allow him
to leave without support?!

40
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,458
When Lord Ains planned
to go to E-Rantel

41
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,250
without a Guardian escort,
you strongly objected to it,

42
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,208
so why would you possibly
be okay with him

43
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,375
doing the same thing now?

44
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,791
Because he was quite adamant

45
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,583
about defeating Shalltear
with his own two hands.

46
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,541
[gasps]

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,500
Ah...

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,875
[AINS]
If that's what you need,

49
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,208
then I promise you,
I will come back alive.

50
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,083
But first, I have
to defeat Shalltear.

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,916
His pure determination
was intense.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
And, as a woman, seeing
my love so resolute,

53
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,416
I simply couldn't
bring myself to oppose

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,000
my dear Lord Ains'
wishes any further.

55
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,333
It may have been
irreverent of me,

56
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,708
but I've decided
I don't really care.

57
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,625
Besides, Lord Ains promised

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,416
he would return to us. I know in
my heart he will do just that.

59
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,416
So you made your
decision on emotion

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,416
instead of logic. Did you
forget he is the last

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,833
of the Supreme Beings
that created us?

62
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,083
It is our duty to
keep him from danger.

63
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,208
Even if that danger comes
from his own actions.

64
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,875
He may scold, or even
kill us for it,

65
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,916
but we must do something!

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,666
And where do you
think you're going?

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,375
I'm sure it's obvious.

68
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,375
My subordinates and I will--

69
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,791
[DEMIURGE sighs]
I see.

70
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,250
Now I understand why you
ordered me to meet you here

71
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,958
the moment that I arrived.

72
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,541
This was your plan
from the beginning.

73
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,416
That's correct.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,833
You're a fool!

75
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,750
What if Lord Ains perishes
as a result of this folly?

76
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,833
Are you prepared to face the
consequences of that outcome?

77
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,000
We pledged our loyalty to him.

78
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,083
Once he is gone, there will
be no one left to serve.

79
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,541
He will return to us.
I'm sure of it.

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,333
You can't possibly know that!

81
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,708
You should believe
in your master.

82
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,958
As a Guardian, is that not
also one of your duties?

83
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,333
[grunts]

84
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,583
All right.

85
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,708
But, if something were
to happen to Lord Ains,

86
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,458
I will demand that you step down
as leader of the Guardians!

87
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,416
[COCYTUS] You would have
her relinquish a position

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,708
the Supreme Beings
placed her in?

89
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,875
That is blasphemy, Demiurge,
of the highest caliber!

90
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,833
As you wish. Tell me, Cocytus.

91
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,958
What do you think are the odds
of Lord Ains being victorious?

92
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,625
[COCYTUS] Three to seven.
Three in Lord Ains' favor.

93
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
[gasps]

94
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,666
I see.

95
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,416
Then, let's watch
as the battle unfolds

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,083
and witness our glorious
master beat the odds.

97
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,875
[AINS]
Dammit!

98
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,291
[AINS] I wanted to spread
the name of Ains Ooal Gown

99
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,625
so that my comrades
might find me.

100
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,375
I planned to do
whatever was necessary.

101
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,291
Still, I made sure
to move in secret,

102
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
so that I could avoid
unnecessary fighting

103
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,958
along the way.

104
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,625
So, how?

105
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,666
How could something
like this happen?

106
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,416
I don't know who did this yet.

107
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
But, when I do,
I will destroy them.

108
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,541
I'll make sure
they deeply regret

109
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,416
standing in my way.

110
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,958
They've started a fight
with Ains Ooal Gown,

111
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,041
and that is the fastest
way to the grave.

112
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,208
[MOMONGA]
I'm so stupid.

113
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,041
I know there are better
ways of handling this.

114
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,250
Aura and Mare seemed
to be convinced,

115
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,958
but I'm pretty sure Albedo
saw through my lie.

116
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,125
As for you, don't you think this

117
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,416
is a huge gamble
as well, Shalltear?

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,250
I don't even know if the
resurrection mechanics

119
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,750
back in Yggdrasil
exist in this world.

120
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:40,291
But I'm about to start a battle
with our lives on the line.

121
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,458
Because...

122
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,500
I'll be the one
to kill her instead.

123
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
[MOMONGA] Because I couldn't
bear to watch any of you

124
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,375
try to kill each other.

125
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,458
[MOMONGA]
And...

126
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,041
[AINS]
I am the great Ains Ooal Gown.

127
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,166
This sacred name can never
be tarnished by defeat!

128
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,791
"Body of Effulgent Beryl"!

129
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,833
[AINS laughs]
As I suspected.

130
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,041
Unless I pull aggro
with an actual attack,

131
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,291
you won't go into
combat mode, will you?

132
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Just like any MMO boss fight.

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,250
[AINS]
Sorry, Shalltear.

134
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,333
But I'm taking full
advantage of this.

135
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,916
You'll have to wait
a little longer.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,375
"Fly." "Blessing of
Magic Caster."

137
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:34,125
"Infinity Wall."
"Magic Ward, Holy."

138
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,166
"Life Essence."
"Greater Full Potential."

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,625
"Freedom." "False Data, Life."

140
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,458
"See Through."
"Paranormal Intuition."

141
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,000
"Greater Resistance."
"Mantle of Chaos."

142
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,583
"Indomitability."
"Sensor Boost."

143
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,583
"Greater Luck." "Magic Boost."
"Draconic Power."

144
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,458
"Greater Hardening."
"Heavenly Aura."

145
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,458
"Absorption." "Penetrate Up."
"Greater Magic Shield."

146
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,833
"Mana Essence."

147
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,000
"Triple Maximize Magic,
Explode Mine."

148
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,875
"Triple Magic,
Greater Magic Seal."

149
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,583
"Triple Maximize Boosted
Magic, Magic Arrow"!

150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,875
[AINS]
Let's begin.

151
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,291
[AURA]
What's that?

152
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,958
I... think it's maybe
super tier magic.

153
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,208
That's supposed to be even
stronger than tenth tier.

154
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,708
Isn't it a little
early for that?

155
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,541
It's more like a skill.
It doesn't use any MP.

156
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,666
[COCYTUS] It may be free
to cast, but, once it's used,

157
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,875
he won't be able
to cast it again.

158
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,166
A bold tactic, to say the least.

159
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
What is his plan?

160
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,041
Perhaps he wants to diminish
Shalltear's HP quickly,

161
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,625
so she won't have
time to counter him.

162
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,208
[AINS]
Still no enemies. Interesting.

163
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,000
They could be hiding
in wait for me.

164
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,208
But I can't waste this
opportunity to attack.

165
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,750
Goodness. I'm really
going in blind here.

166
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,833
[beeping]

167
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,291
[BUKUBUKU CHAGAMA]
I'll set that timer for you,

168
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,750
Big Brother Momonga!

169
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,041
[MOMONGA]
Bukubuku Chagama.

170
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,958
I wonder why I can't mute
the voice on this watch.

171
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,125
[MOMONGA]
I will borrow some strength.

172
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,666
From all of you.

173
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,625
[AINS]
Now then. Let's go.

174
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,708
Super Tier Magic! "Fallen Down"!

175
00:10:55,625 --> 00:11:03,708
[laughing]

176
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,208
Be careful, Lord Ains!

177
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,041
I might think you're trying
to kill me! Nice try!

178
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,000
[AINS]
It wasn't much of a present,

179
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,958
but I hope you that
you enjoyed it.

180
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,083
Oh. I most certainly did!

181
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,791
What a treat this will be.

182
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
I get to enjoy killing a
powerful man like Lord Ains

183
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,458
with my own two hands.
How wonderful!

184
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,291
[AINS] Interesting. Why are
you still calling me that?

185
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,333
Oh, come on, isn't it obvious?

186
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,125
You are still one of the
Supreme Beings, Lord Ains.

187
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,916
Calling you anything
less than that would be

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,125
the height of arrogance.

189
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,166
[AINS]
Who is your master, Shalltear?

190
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,125
What kind of question
is that, lord?

191
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,666
[gasps] This doesn't make sense.

192
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,916
Why do I want to kill
my beloved master?

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,125
Because I was attacked?
Because I feel compelled to?

194
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,125
I have to use all of
my strength to counter

195
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,583
and destroy whoever
tries to bring me harm.

196
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,083
But why him?

197
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,875
I don't know what's going on.

198
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,791
But, now that I've been
attacked, I have no choice

199
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,916
but to tear you limb
from limb, master.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,416
[AINS]
I see. Very well, then.

201
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,916
[MOMONGA]
I know what's going on here.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,250
[SHALLTEAR]
You seem a tad underdressed

203
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,875
for the occasion, master.
Did you actually think

204
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,250
you'd be able to beat me
wearing nothing but dirty rags?

205
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:23,125
[AINS] Ha! Ains Ooal Gown
does not know defeat.

206
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,500
Before the day is done,
you will bow down

207
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,083
before me again, Shalltear.

208
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,666
[laughs] Oh, I'm just
aquiver with fear!

209
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,041
[AINS]
Watch your step.

210
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,125
[gasps]

211
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,666
[AINS]
You should be more careful.

212
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,625
I've cast the Triple Maximize
Magic, Exploding Mine

213
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,500
in the area surrounding me.

214
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,375
"Maximize Magic,
Gravity Maelstrom"!

215
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,833
[SHALLTEAR grunts]
"Wall of Stone"!

216
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,416
[AINS]
"Maximize Magic, Hold of Rib"!

217
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,583
[gasps]

218
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,666
[AINS] By the way,
I forgot to mention this.

219
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,583
I've littered the ground
with all kinds of traps.

220
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,708
Why don't you flap
those wings over to me?

221
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,125
Shame on you.

222
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,125
I will not be provoked
that easily, Lord Ains.

223
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,208
I'm sure you've made the air
around you equally as deadly.

224
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,625
[AINS]
Was it that obvious?

225
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,791
Of course. I'm no fool.

226
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,458
[MOMONGA]
She bought it.

227
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,708
That was the only
mine spell I cast.

228
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,500
I don't have enough
MP to waste on magic

229
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:35,458
that might not give results.
I have to play this smart.

230
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,166
I wonder how much I'll
be able to damage her

231
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,791
before I completely drain my MP.

232
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,875
[SHALLTEAR]
As expected of Lord Ains.

233
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,833
If I continue to rush in, it's
not going to get me anywhere.

234
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,958
However, as a magic caster,

235
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,333
his strength only exists
as long as he has MP left.

236
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,416
If I can force him to use
it all, he won't be able

237
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,833
to counter my constant
physical attacks.

238
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,041
He'll be finished.

239
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,791
This Pipette Lance
allows me to heal

240
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,333
myself whenever I land
a hit on an opponent.

241
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,166
And the amount of HP
I receive is equal

242
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,083
to the damage caused.

243
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,708
Because of that,
Lord Ains cannot

244
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,333
summon a creature to fight
on the front lines for him.

245
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,166
He knows that weak level
monsters will only

246
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,291
feed my Pipette Lance and
keep me alive indefinitely.

247
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,125
His spells are his only option.

248
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,083
Aw, my poor, beloved, Lord Ains.

249
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:26,250
He has to fight me all alone.
It must be so frustrating.

250
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,000
That said...

251
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,083
"Mana Essence."

252
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,875
He has a staggering
amount of MP.

253
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,708
How did he manage to
obtain this much power?

254
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,166
Fortunately, his
specialization in necromancy

255
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,375
won't give him the fighting
edge. I still have a chance.

256
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,041
It bothers me that
he's not wearing

257
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
his usual god level items.

258
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,000
But a staring match
will get us nowhere fast.

259
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,458
I should heal and prepare
for the long haul.

260
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,500
"Regenerate"!

261
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,125
[AINS]
I won't make it that easy!

262
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,125
"Maximize Magic,
Gravity Maelstrom"!

263
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,041
"Greater Teleportation"!

264
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,875
[SHALLTEAR gasps]
How did he stop me?

265
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,125
[AINS]
"Drifting Master Mine"!

266
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,583
[AINS]
Not good enough!

267
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,625
"Maximize Magic,
Astral Smite"!

268
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,375
[AINS] "Maximize Magic,
Thousand Bone Lance"!

269
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,125
[SHALLTEAR]
"Greater Teleportation"!

270
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,541
[AINS]
Get back here!

271
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,833
"Negative Impact Shield"!

272
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,208
[AINS]
What?

273
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,625
You look so surprised.

274
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,791
Did you not know that
I had a skill like this

275
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,458
in my arsenal, Lord Ains?

276
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,958
[AINS]
No. But it won't save you.

277
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,708
[laughs] I love watching
you try to play tough.

278
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,000
It's absolutely adorable.

279
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,500
[SHALLTEAR] Do you know
about my Purifying Lance,

280
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,416
or should I explain it, too?

281
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,833
[AINS]
It summons a holy object.

282
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,166
[AINS groans]

283
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,416
[SHALLTEAR laughs] For a weapon
meant to battle magic casters,

284
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,416
it doesn't disappoint, does it?

285
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,333
I don't think I've seen anything
work so well against you.

286
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,291
[AINS groans]

287
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,333
[AINS]
Don't underestimate me!

288
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:17,250
"Maximize Magic,
Reality Slash"!

289
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,333
[grunts]

290
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,875
[AINS] That wasn't
normal recovery magic.

291
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,291
What did you do?

292
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,708
What's the matter, Lord Ains?

293
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,916
It seems like you're
losing your composure.

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,916
Don't worry, I didn't cheat.

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,583
That was another one
of my special skills.

296
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,458
Lord Peroroncino saw fit to
grace me with many of them.

297
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,916
I dare say his foresight proves
that he was far superior to you

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,625
as a Supreme Being.

299
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,875
[AINS]
Is that how you truly feel?

300
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,875
Huh?

301
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,458
[AINS]
Let's do this, Shalltear.

302
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,083
It doesn't matter how many
special skills you have.

303
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,708
My magic will
always be stronger.

304
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,250
Well, if it's a
shoot-out you want,

305
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,208
I'd be happy to play along.
Don't cry when I win.

306
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,958
[SHALLTEAR] I can only
use these so many times.

307
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,208
[AINS]
"Maximize Magic, Reality Slash"!

308
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,041
"Purifying Lance"!

309
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,500
[SHALLTEAR, AINS groan]

310
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,916
Be careful, Lord Ains.
You're running low on MP.

311
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,750
[SHALLTEAR]
I may have used up my skills,

312
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,041
but I still have
plenty of MP left.

313
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's see how you
handle my spellcraft!

314
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,625
"Maximize Magic,
Vermillion Nova!"

315
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,708
[AINS] "Triple Maximize Magic,
Call Greater Thunder"!

316
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,416
[SHALLTEAR screams]

317
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,833
[AINS grunting]

318
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,791
[SHALLTEAR] He's undead!
Fire should have finished him.

319
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,166
[SHALLTEAR]
Let me guess.

320
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,458
You used magic to protect
yourself against fire.

321
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,208
[AINS] Compensating for
your weaknesses is basic.

322
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,041
[SHALLTEAR] True, but he can't
prepare countermeasures

323
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,916
for all elemental weaknesses.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,875
In that case, I'll have
to stick with the element

325
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,541
that hurts him most.

326
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,875
"Cast Maximize Magic,
Brilliant Radiance"!

327
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,875
[AINS]
"Maximize Magic, True Dark"!

328
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,708
[groaning]

329
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
[AINS groaning]

330
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,708
Looks like holy
magic really does

331
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,958
a number on you!

332
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,375
[AINS groaning]

333
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,416
Cocytus! What's
happening to him?

334
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,083
[COCYTUS] The holy element
is a fatal weakness.

335
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,500
Even to undead of
Lord Ains' level.

336
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:21,083
Since his equipment focuses
mainly on protection from fire,

337
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,625
he has no way of guarding
himself against it completely.

338
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,416
[panting]

339
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,166
[SHALLTEAR] I used one holy
spell after another against him.

340
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,541
But, in a battle of magic,
Lord Ains is still far superior.

341
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,208
Thankfully, I've managed to
make his MP drop quite a bit.

342
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,375
[AINS]
"Body of Effulgent Beryl."

343
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:52,041
Must be defensive magic.
Good. I was bored anyway.

344
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,208
It will be much more fun to
rip you apart with my lance!

345
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,666
[AINS]
You truly have me cornered.

346
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,750
Huh? Then why
don't you run away?

347
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,250
At this point, it seems like
your only chance for survival.

348
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,125
[AINS]
You might be right about that.

349
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,208
But, truth be told,
I don't care.

350
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,875
I'm a selfish man, and
stubborn beyond measure.

351
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,166
I don't want to run.

352
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,333
It's funny.

353
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,000
I feel strangely fulfilled
as guild leader.

354
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,458
But, given the
current circumstances,

355
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,916
I don't quite
understand why that is.

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Perhaps no one can.

357
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,625
Maybe it's because
that, while I held

358
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,416
the position of guild leader,

359
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,208
I mainly dealt with
day-to-day business

360
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
and administrating regulations.

361
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:41,500
But, right now, I am fighting
on the frontlines for my guild.

362
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,625
It may just be
self-satisfaction.

363
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,000
So it's pride?

364
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,750
Here I thought you were
beyond such human feelings.

365
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,125
[AINS] Who knows? You might
be right about that.

366
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,375
Look at me, I've really
dampened the mood

367
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:58,791
with this, haven't I? Why
don't we continue our duel?

368
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,708
Now, "Summon Household"!

369
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,125
[AINS]
"Sharks Cyclone"!

370
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,125
[SHALLTEAR yells]

371
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
[AINS yells]

372
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,083
[AINS groans]

373
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,291
[SHALLTEAR]
Heh.

374
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,416
[AINS] "Body of Effulgent
Beryl, Activate"!

375
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,375
[gasps]

376
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,375
[AINS]
"Wall of Skeletons"!

377
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,083
"Maximize Magic,
Force Explosion"!

378
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,541
[gasps]

379
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,500
[AINS]
"Greater Magic Seal, Release"!

380
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,625
[yelps]

381
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,708
"Magic Destruction"!

382
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,666
[AINS]
"Fly"!

383
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,833
She recovered!

384
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,250
"Triple Maximize Magic,
Reality Slash"!

385
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,500
[SHALLTEAR grunts]

386
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,541
"Negative Impact Shield"!

387
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,708
[AINS]
At last. She's using it.

388
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,583
Shalltear's final trump card.

389
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
[AINS]
Einherjar!

390
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,708
"Summon Household."

391
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,250
[MOMONGA] These numbers
are a bit of a problem.

392
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,250
But one well-placed spell should
be enough to take them out.

393
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,958
Einherjar, on the
other hand, will be--

394
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
[AINS gasps]

395
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,750
[AINS gasps]

396
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,125
[MOMONGA]
That's so cheap!

397
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,291
I know friendly fire is
allowed, but I can't believe

398
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,083
she'd sacrifice her
household to heal herself!

399
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,875
[AINS groans]

400
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,750
[AINS grunting]

401
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,583
[AINS] "Skill, The Goal
of All Life is Death"!

402
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,583
"Widen Magic"!
"Cry of the Banshee"!

403
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,958
[gasps, growls]

404
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,875
[clock chimes]

405
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:35,125
[clock ticking]

406
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,083
[AINS]
Game over.

407
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,083
[AINS] That must have been
quite an experience.

408
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,833
How did you enjoy your first
foray into death, Shalltear?

409
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,833
[SHALLTEAR] I expected
no less of you, my lord.

410
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,583
For a moment, I actually
thought I would share

411
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,833
in my household's dark fate.

412
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,375
But, thanks to the resurrection
item Lord Peroroncino

413
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,166
gave me, my HP is at max,
and I'm fresh as a daisy

414
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,291
and ready to go another round.

415
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,291
However, your MP should be

416
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,375
running on empty, meaning
your offensive ability

417
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,041
is next to nothing.

418
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,458
And, whatever spell
you can muster

419
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,750
would never take my
HP down from full.

420
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,208
[AINS]
You're right.

421
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,083
[SHALLTEAR] Still, you
were amazing, and I also

422
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,416
have no MP left.

423
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,250
I had to use my
most powerful skills

424
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,250
just to keep you
on the defensive.

425
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,791
I couldn't imagine
it would be possible

426
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,291
for it to have been
a closer match.

427
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,625
For being at a disadvantage,

428
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,500
you did very well
to get this far.

429
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,333
[AINS] Honest praise.
I'll accept it graciously.

430
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,625
Now then.

431
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,500
Do you have any last
words before I end you?

432
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,666
[AINS]
Let's see.

433
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,666
I suppose I could go
on and on about how

434
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,916
I'm defenseless without my MP.

435
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,083
Or I could commend
you for so expertly

436
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,791
backing me into a corner.

437
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,791
Instead, I think I'll
thank you for fighting me

438
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,416
with everything you had.
And ensuring my victory.

439
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,833
[gasps]

440
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,125
[AINS] If you had fought
me any other way,

441
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:14,958
I would have never been able to
execute my plan so flawlessly.

442
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,666
[AINS] Shalltear's powerful,
heavy attacks have taken my MP

443
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,291
down to nothing.

444
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,583
She grins, assured
of her victory.

445
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,791
I suppose this is
as good a time as any

446
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,583
to bring my plan to light.

447
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,791
Everything is revealed.

448
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,375
I am the Overlord!

449
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,125
The one who rules over
the Tomb of Nazarick!

450
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:39,208
Face me and you face the
power of Ains Ooal Gown!

451
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,583
You will see it soon enough!

452
