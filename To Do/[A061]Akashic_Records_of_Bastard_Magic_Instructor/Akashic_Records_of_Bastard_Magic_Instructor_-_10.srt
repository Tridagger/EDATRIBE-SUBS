Hell yeah.

Look at all those swimsuits!

do you believe the powers
of Princess Ermiana

00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,125
Yes.

Sistine that Leos was coming

Oh! I forgot too.

[laughs]

152
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,166
We made a promise to each
other when we were children.

Don't you remember that?

154

really serious, right?

156
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,041
I mean, you can't be!

00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,333
If you want to
pair off with her,

158
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,750
I'll give you a shovel,
'cause you'll be digging

159
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
your own grave.

160
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,833
You shut your cake hole.

161
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,375
I'll ask you kindly to refrain

162
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,458
from insulting
my future wife, sir.

163
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,916
I will defend her.

164
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,041
Hold on, Leos.

165
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,708
He's just joking, okay?

166
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,250
The professor's
just really, dumb.

167
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,958
The Professor?

168
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,625
Does that mean--?

00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,833
Are you... Glenn Radars?

"Most Wanted" list now?

There's been a lot
of talk about you

00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,416
at the Kleitos Magic Academy.

173
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,333
That's the school where I teach,

People can't help but gossip.

00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,416
They say unlike
the current trend,

178
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,125
to cram in as many
spells as we can by rote,

179
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,291
you are more focused on
a deeper comprehension

180
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,250
of the fundamentals,

181
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,208
There's even talk
of original spells.

182
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,875
That would be rare.

183
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,916
I would love to sit in on
one of your lectures sometime.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,250
I don't know.
There might be a waiting list.

186
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,875
He's a candidate to be the
next head of the countdom.

187
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,208
[HALLEY] Sure, from the
Imperial United Society!

188
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,708
He's famous!

189
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,500
I told his school
about our professor's

190
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,541
medical leave of
absence on a lark.

191
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,958
I didn't expect them to send

192
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,958
one of the greatest professors
they have to help us!

193
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,375
I'm so excited!

194
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,625
We're so lucky!

195
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,708
But you're right to be
surprised, Headmaster.

196
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't you think them
sending him here is bizarre?

197
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,375
Suppose so.

198
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,541
Don't give me that.

199
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,333
You're just worried
this actual talent

200
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,166
is going to overshadow
that loser apprentice.

201
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,875
I wish that was the case.

202
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,708
It would make this
a lot more simple.

203
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,833
Maybe it was only
a child's game to you,

204
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,000
but not to me.

205
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
I love you profoundly, Sistine.

Wow, congratulations, white cat!

I had you pegged as a

Man! Just goes to show

Oh, you've got
some planning to do.

Well I'll be happy to
give a toast at your wedding,

Sistine's so mad.

218
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,291
Why is that?

219
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,625
[RUMIA chuckles]

220
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,541
I think this is turning
into a pretty big deal.

221
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,166
[LEOS] And that is the
simplest way to explain

222
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,791
Zaiser's formula

224
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,583
Up until recently,
most attack spells

225
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,291
employed by the
Imperial military

226
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,833
were one of three types.

227
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,875
Heat, cold, or shock.

228
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,375
I hope now, with this
elegant formula in mind,

229
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,666
you can understand why.

230
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,333
Take Shock Bolt, for example.

231
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,041
It's perhaps our
most basic spell.

232
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,958
Yet if you can
apply these lessons,

233
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,458
you can increase its
output significantly.

234
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,500
Since wind spells
don't function this way,

235
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,166
they have less military use.

236
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,625
Yet they do have other merits,

237
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,750
which I will be discussing
in our next lecture.

00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,375
[GLENN] That was
pitch-freaking-perfect.

243
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,125
He made the Material
Force Theory

244
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,541
totally accessible
to these kids,

245
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,458
and that's a concept half
the common mage troops

246
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,541
in the military don't
fully understand.

247
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,916
But even if they can learn now,
that doesn't mean they should.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,083
If they're smart and follow
the theory to its end,

249
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,958
they'll realize even
Shock Bolt can kill

250
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,750
if you boost it enough.

251
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,583
They're learning to
harness huge power

252
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,291
without learning the
judgment to back it up.

253
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,083
They don't know
what power means.

254
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,916
What it can do to you--
what consequences feel like.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
They just know it exists.

00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,166
I'm guessing you
don't really approve

257
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,625
of this lesson, do you,
Professor Radars?

258
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,958
[GLENN]
You guessed right.

259
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,375
You tell us not to be dumb,

260
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,208
and to always think hard
before we summon

261
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,458
any new power.

262
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,166
To learn to use magic
and not let it use us.

263
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,583
I think I finally
understand your point.

264
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,708
Well you don't have to worry.

265
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,208
I don't think any
student you've taught

266
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,625
will make that mistake.

00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,541
You've made sure of that.

It takes work to keep
a friendship close.

If we don't make
a conscious effort,

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,333
then soon we'll just be
fond memories to each other

To do that, I've got a lot
more to learn about magic,

to be pulled two ways.

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
but no one has
ever accomplished it,

359
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,916
and the Sky Castle is
the most opaque of all.

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,416
Devoting your talents
to the same fool's errand

361
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,708
would be a meaningless,
tragic squandering.

362
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,625
A fool's errand?

363
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,375
Your grandfather was brilliant.

364
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,625
If he hadn't been
obsessed with that castle

365
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,541
imagine how much more
he could have contributed

366
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,000
to a useful field.

367
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,666
Please, Sistine.

368
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,250
Listen to reason
and join me in my work.

369
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,083
With your assistance
we could revolutionize

370
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,458
military magic.

371
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,541
I'm sorry, Leos.

372
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,125
You're a great mage and
you have wonderful dreams.

373
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,333
But so do I and
I won't give them up.

374
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
I want you to have dreams.

375
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,333
I simply don't want you
to waste your life.

376
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,916
Stop trying to tear
her down, you shitbag!

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,291
Professor?

378
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,458
[GLENN] Walk the path
you believe in, white cat!

379
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,333
And never forget,
in your own life story,

380
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,833
you're the main character,
not this douche!

381
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,000
[chuckles] Nailed it.

382
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,791
You're sticking
your nose in again?

383
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,458
And spying on us, too?

384
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,291
I beg your pardon, colleague,

385
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,583
this is not your business.

386
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,625
So stay out.

387
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,708
[GLENN]
Oh...

388
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,291
You're wrong.
It is his business.

389
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,833
Uh... I'm sorry, what?

390
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,458
Explain, Sistine.

391
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,916
What are you telling me?

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,666
[SISTINE]
Well, uh...

393
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,291
I'm saying...

394
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,333
I'm saying the
professor and I, uh...

395
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,250
We're madly in love, okay?

396
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,041
And secretly engaged!

397
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,291
[gasping]

398
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,541
[SISTINE] That's why
I can't marry you, Leos.

399
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,916
[GLENN chuckles]

400
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,250
Well, I guess the
white cat's out of the bag!

401
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,375
[laughing]

402
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,750
[LEOS]
Lies!

403
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,583
My Sistine would never
fall for a buffoon like you!

404
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,666
You're wrong, pal!

405
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,208
She fell and fell hard.

406
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,375
In fact she just fell into my
bed last night--it was hot.

407
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,291
Shut up, you moron!

408
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,708
Stop exaggerating!

409
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,458
All we've done is kiss, okay?

410
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,000
Kiss?! You kissed that cretin?

411
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,833
I'm lying, though,
not technically,

412
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,708
if you count mouth to mouth.

413
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,958
Face it, goocher.

414
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,708
White cat's gonna marry me.

415
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,666
So give it up.

416
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,916
I will not.

417
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,750
Anyone who truly
cares about Sistine

418
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,125
would try to help her
see the truth

419
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,583
before it's too late.

420
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,541
You're not fit
to be with this lady.

421
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,125
And yet somehow I'm the one
she's actually picked.

422
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,166
Them's the breaks, cyclops.

423
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,958
Steel yourself, Glenn Radars.

424
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,875
You're going to regret
making an enemy out of me.

425
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,666
Let's all calm down.

426
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,708
Wow.

427
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,500
You're showing your true colors.

428
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,250
You'd be bad news for her.

429
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,083
I guess we have
to make this official.

430
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,583
What's that mean?

431
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,666
[GLENN] We'll settle this
the old-fashioned way.

432
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,208
Let's duel!

433
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,541
You got the balls to accept?

434
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,333
Nothing would please me more.

435
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,291
We can agree on
the details later.

436
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,791
I've got a class to teach.

437
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,250
Excuse me.

438
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
Well, that was fun!

439
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,208
Can you be serious for once?

440
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,708
Hey, come to think of it...

441
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,625
This is actually a sweet plan!

442
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,916
If I'm your husband,
I won't have to work at all!

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,583
I can be a kept man!

444
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,416
[SISTINE]
Idiot!

445
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,166
So, that's the gist!

446
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,500
I'll get hitched to white cat,

447
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,250
live off her money and
spend the rest of my days

448
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,375
as a shut-in who
never wears pants!

449
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,625
We just need to win!

450
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,166
So I'm training you all
for mage squad combat!

451
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,083
[STUDENTS chattering]

452
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,416
Uh, Sistine, is he joking?

453
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,458
If it's your duel,
why do we have to fight?

454
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,333
Yeah, we didn't
challenge the guy!

455
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,916
Well, the terms are his call.

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,250
Which sucks, I know.

457
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,083
Damned tricky weasel
wants it to be a battle

458
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,625
of our teaching skills.

459
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,708
Sorry to be blunt,

460
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,291
but doesn't that
mean you're screwed?

461
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,625
He's like a teaching prodigy.

462
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,291
Just means we'll
have to cram harder!

463
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,041
[STUDENTS]
What?!

464
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,750
Hey, I'll make it
worth it, I promise.

465
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,666
Once I'm stinking rich,
I won't forget you guys.

466
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,625
[ALBERT] Sounds like you're
right back in the deep end.

467
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,791
Competing for a woman
you don't even love.

468
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,708
You're despicable.

469
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,291
Have you even stopped
to think what she wants?

470
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,708
I'm more worried for me.

471
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,166
Can you imagine me
working the rest of my life?

472
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,541
Enough about that.

473
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,041
Why'd you call me here, anyway?

474
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,958
[ALBERT] I've received word
that "Angel's Dust"

475
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,833
has been smuggled
into this city.

476
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,041
No way!

477
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,500
I thought the means
to create that junk

478
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,958
had been destroyed during
that whole thing last year.

479
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,625
Yes, we thought so as well.

480
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,500
That drug turns
people into husks,

481
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,000
mindless puppets, to control.

482
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,291
That case disgusted me.

483
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,666
Answer's no.

484
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,333
I haven't even asked you yet.

485
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,666
You don't have to.

486
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,541
I knew how you'd react.

487
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,625
So, I came to tell you
not to get involved.

488
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,583
[ALBERT] Honestly, hearing
that it's being used again

489
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,000
makes me wonder if
Sara died for nothing.

490
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,541
I'm not gonna let that
happen again, Albert.

491
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,000
Not this time.

492
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,416
This time?

493
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,625
Wow.

494
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,750
[chuckles]

495
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,958
I was right.

496
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,166
You do see Sara in that girl.

497
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,416
[GLENN]
Shut up.

498
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,333
[SARA]
Don't be embarrassed, Glenn.

499
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,375
I like it.

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,375
I think it's a beautiful dream.

501
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,000
[SARA] A mage of justice,
always coming to the rescue.

502
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,750
I often wish there were
someone like that in the world.

503
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,958
You should take
pride in that dream,

504
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,500
and cling to it.

505
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,958
That's what I think.

506
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,250
[GLENN] All right, white dog,
don't make it a thing.

507
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,583
[SARA laughs]

508
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,791
Given the job we do,

509
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,833
who wouldn't welcome
a hero in their corner?

510
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,500
You're fine, Sara,
don't worry about a thing.

511
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,833
I'll always protect--

512
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,375
[GLENN] W-Wait.
Is that not what you...?

513
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,375
[SARA] Finish!
What were you about to say?

514
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,750
[GLENN] Nothing,
I said nothing, forget it!

515
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,041
[JATICE]
How did it play out, Leos?

516
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,375
Exactly the way you predicted.

517
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,375
[JATICE chuckles]

518
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
I mean, really.

519
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,041
It was most uncanny.

520
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,166
Right after I proposed,
Glenn challenged me to a duel.

521
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm starting to think
you're some kind of prophet.

522
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,250
[JATICE]
I just know people.

523
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,541
Leos.

524
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,208
Dance your best
against Glenn for me.

525
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,458
You will be laying down
the foundation of my justice.
