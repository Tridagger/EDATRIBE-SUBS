1
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,583
[ZELOS] The Alzano
Imperial Magic Academy?

2
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,375
Didn't they just suffer a
violent attack the other day?

3
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,875
Why would she go there now?

4
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,333
You are aware,
Commander Zelos, aren't you?

5
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,375
The woman at the center
of the incident was

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,833
our own Princess Ermiana.

7
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,666
So then Her Majesty is concerned
about the Princess's safety?

8
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,125
[ALICIA'S MAID 4A] Queen Alicia,
I've brought the grand commander

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,208
of the imperial guard,
Mr. Zelos, to see you.

10
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,958
I'm here regarding
your impending visit

11
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,583
to Alzano Imperial
Magic Academy.

12
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,916
Yes.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, ma'am, I shall do
all I can to keep you safe

14
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,875
throughout your travels
and the competition itself.

15
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,750
I appreciate that.

16
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,708
If I may beg your pardon,
at the school is--

17
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,375
[ALICIA] Is the girl we
declared to be dead.

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,750
[ZELOS]
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,583
As of now, very few
individuals within the Empire

20
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,125
are aware of that fact.

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,750
However, if this visit were
to somehow bring it to light...

22
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,833
[ALICIA]
Zelos.

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,375
I apologize for overstepping
my bounds, ma'am.

24
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,375
Thank you.

25
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,416
I shall keep your
advice in mind.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,458
Ma'am.

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,666
[ALICIA]
It's been three years now.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,083
And I...

29
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,916
I imagine that girl must
hate me for what I did to her.

30
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,208
Still, even if she hates me,

31
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,916
even if she can
never forgive me,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,208
so long as she's
alive and healthy...

33
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,083
That's all I
could ever hope for.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,041
[SISTINE] So who wants to
compete in the flying race?


35
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,916
How about the
transmutation event?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,583
[SISTINE sighs]
This is bad.

37
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,625
You guys,
the competition is next week.

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,208
Hey, let's all just try
to do our best, okay?

39
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,333
No way.

40
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,208
If we enter,
we're just gonna lose.

41
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
Well, winning isn't
the only reason to enter,

42
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,208
you know.

43
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,583
Eh, I'll pass, guys.

44
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,708
I just don't really feel
like competing right now.

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,875
Yes, but this is
a rare opportunity.

46
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,083
[SISTINE] And some of you
didn't participate last year.

47
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
Please, there's no need
for us to go out of our way

48
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,125
to humiliate ourselves
when the queen herself

49
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,333
will be there watching.

50
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,041
This is what happens
when you try too hard

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,541
to be nice and include everyone.

52
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,500
Oh, c'mon!
Are you serious here?!

53
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,791
Of course.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,750
[GLENN] Just leave everything
to me, Glenn Radars,

55
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,791
the greatest teacher
who ever teached!

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,416
Oh, great, here we go.

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,791
[GLENN]
What's the problem?

58
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,208
Still having trouble filling
out the event rosters?

59
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,250
Here, give me the list,
white cat.

60
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,666
[SISTINE sighs]

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,541
I told you to stop calling me
that demeaning nickname.

62
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,291
I'll use my
ultra-intuitive judgment

63
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
as your super
charismatic instructor

64
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,250
to put the squad together.

65
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,500
And I'll make sure
that you guys win!

66
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,666
No messing around.

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,333
We will win!

68
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,375
[chuckles]

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,375
[GLENN] All right. The duels
with their higher point values

70
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,333
go to...

71
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,166
White cat, Gibul, and Kash.

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,291
We'll entrust Wendy
with speed deciphering.

73
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,250
Rodde and Ky can
take the flying race.

74
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,916
Let's give magic
sniping to Cecil,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,125
and long-range
weightlifting to Teresa.

76
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,500
Of course,
Rumia's the only choice

77
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,875
for mental defense.

78
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,875
We'll have Lynn handle
transmutation. And then...

79
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,833
[RUMIA] Professor Radars is
making sure we all have a spot!

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,125
Okay, that about settles it.

81
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,750
No way! This is so not cool!

82
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
How can you just
pull me out of the

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,958
dueling competition like that?

84
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,333
[GLENN] While your repertoire
of spells is incredible,

85
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,958
you can be a little slow
and clumsy sometimes.

86
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,041
[WENDY gasps]

87
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,625
Them's the brakes, champ.

88
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,916
That's why we're
going with Kash,

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,625
who has great
judgment and reflexes.

90
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125
But you, Wendy,

91
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,750
are a cut above the rest when
it comes to Read Language,

92
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,208
so I think you can
run up the score

93
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,875
in speed deciphering.

94
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,333
Well, if that's
the case, then fine.

95
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,458
The flying race relies
on gravity manipulation

96
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,750
black magic.

97
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,666
Which Rodde and Ky
oughta be able to handle.

98
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,666
Teresa, you may not
realize it yet yourself,

99
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,291
but you have an affinity for
long-range manipulation spells.

100
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,041
Alf, Bix, Cycer.

101
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,375
Granzia is more about
teamwork than skill.

102
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,875
Since you three
are always together,

103
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,166
I figure you're the best suited.

104
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,750
Plus you're all pretty
good at synchronization.

105
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,250
[SISTINE]
I don't believe it.

106
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,291
He's actually been paying
close attention to us.

107
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,083
Professor Radars
may be a total slacker,

108
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,208
but I guess he has
another side to him, too.

109
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,666
Now then, anything else?

110
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,125
Awesome. We're all set!

111
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,666
[GLENN]
Hell yeah!

112
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,250
I'm killing this teacher thing!

113
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,791
[GLENN]
I'm broke! I'll starve!

114
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,833
You gotta give me an advance
or an allowance or something!

115
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,166
[RICK]
Sorry, son,

116
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,291
but you know we can't
pay you in advance.

117
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,458
You reap what you sow!

118
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,166
So take care of this
problem on your own!

119
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
[GLENN] Jeez, do you
hear this, Headmaster?

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,458
This is precisely what's
wrong with Celica!

121
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,208
[CELICA] Oh, yeah?
And how exactly am I the one

122
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,458
to blame for this, huh?

123
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,541
Hey! You'll crush my skull!

124
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,791
Save me, Mama!

125
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,666
Well, now,
there is a special bonus

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,875
you could potentially earn.

127
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,125
Special bonus?

128
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,416
That's right.

129
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,833
The instructor who's
responsible for the class

130
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,125
that wins the magic competition
traditionally receives

131
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,833
some financial compensation.

132
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,541
You know, an incentive
to reward good teaching.

133
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,583
Oh, yeah, that's it!

134
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,041
[GIBUL]
Professor, could you just stop?

135
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,708
Huh? You know a better
way to organize the team

136
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,000
so that we can win?

137
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,458
Then let's hear it.

138
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,708
[GIBUL] Yeah, it's simple,
Professor Obvious.

139
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,083
Use only the best students
and have 'em cover all events.

140
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,458
That's standard procedure.

141
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,625
It's what all the
classes do every year.

142
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,666
Huh?

143
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,083
[GLENN]
Seriously?

144
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,041
We can just use the good
students over and over again?

145
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,208
And that's totally okay?

146
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,625
[SISTINE]
No, Gibul!

147
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,708
What's the point of winning

148
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,791
if only a few
students participate?

149
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,833
Professor Radars promised he
would lead our class to victory.

150
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,875
And the best part is
he thinks the whole class

151
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,000
can do it together.

152
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,541
[GIBUL]
Okay, have fun losing.

153
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,166
Am I right, Professor?

154
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,583
Uh, yeah, sure.

155
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,083
You really nailed it.

156
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,625
Oh, I don't think they're
on the same page here.

157
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,208
[GLENN]
I'm screwed.

158
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,791
Figures all the other
classes would only

159
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,666
be sending the best of the best.

160
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,083
Now I remember
the magic competition.

161
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,541
I'd forgotten all about it
since I never entered.

162
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,083
[STUDENT 4A]
Child of flame, pay heed,

163
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,083
and light a fire
at my fingertips!

164
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,333
[GLENN]
Oh, well.

165
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,416
[KASH] You class one
clowns need to back off!

166
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,833
[KREISS] Well, you class
two losers are in our way!

167
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,416
Oh, yeah? Well, screw you!

168
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Class one's supposed
to be practicing here now,

169
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,458
so beat it!

170
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,375
[KASH]
I'm gonna beat you--

171
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,541
All right, okay, just chill out.

172
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,666
[HALLEY]
Kreiss!

173
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,458
I told you to secure
a location for us!

174
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, hey, there!

175
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,041
If it isn't my old pal, Harlem.

176
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,208
Halley! Halley Astry!

177
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,708
Are you mocking me?

178
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,375
Uh, so, Hal-whatever-it-is,

179
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,916
is your class practicing
for the competition, too?

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,708
Naturally, and as long
as I'm leading them,

181
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,750
anything short of
victory is unthinkable.

182
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,708
Wow, that's awesome, Big Guy!

183
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,458
Good luck!

184
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,458
Okay, whatever.

185
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,750
Just clear the area.

186
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,375
Okay, we'll move
back by that tree.

187
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,125
That'll give you guys
enough room, right?

188
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,375
You don't get it.

189
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,875
I want everybody from class two

190
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,791
to get out of my sight
right this instant.

191
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,041
--[STUDENTS gasp]
--Come on, now, 

192
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,250
that's just a little excessive,
don't you think?

193
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,791
Glenn Radars,
I hear that you intend

194
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,416
to have everyone in
your class participate.

195
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,750
[GLENN]
Yeah, that's right.

196
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,458
[HALLEY] A class that's
throwing the competition

197
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,916
by using its least capable
students is a nuisance,

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,541
and taking up space
in the practice area

199
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,166
that should be reserved
for serious teams!

200
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,583
[GLENN]
With all due respect,

201
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,250
this here is the best
possible lineup for our class.

202
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,583
And we've got our
sights set on serious victory,

203
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,291
so don't get yourself caught
off guard by underestimating us.

204
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,000
You talk a big game, but--

205
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,083
Care to make it interesting?

206
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,166
Huh?

207
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,166
[GLENN]
I'll bet three months' salary

208
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
on my class winning this thing.

209
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,166
What do ya say?
Will ya take the bet, Big Guy?

210
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,708
[GLENN]
Oh, crap!

211
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,625
I just blurted that out
'cause he was pissing me off!

212
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,041
[HALLEY] Magical research
requires vast sums of money.

213
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,291
Now, I don't intend to lose,

214
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,916
but on the off-chance...

215
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,916
All right.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm confident enough in my class
to wager on them, as well!

217
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,375
Three months' salary it is!

218
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,916
Ya got guts, Harry,
I'll give you that.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,583
[GLENN]
Oh, man! Time to grovel!

220
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,625
Gotta put everything I have
into my unique magic,

221
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
the brown nose Jumping Grovel!

222
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,041
That's enough!

223
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,375
Professor Halley,

224
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,416
I don't see any
justification for your claim

225
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,583
to the practice field.

226
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,958
If you continue this
unsportsmanlike behavior,

227
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,416
I'll be forced to bring this up
with the Academy leadership.

228
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,458
Understood?

229
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,625
[HALLEY]
Damn noble-born brat.

230
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,375
Besides, Professor Radars
won't be intimidated.

231
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,875
[GLENN]
Huh?

232
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,375
We're going to fight fair
and square at the competition

233
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,583
with everything we've got

234
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,375
to earn the victory
the right way.

235
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,750
Am I right, Professor?

236
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,583
[GLENN]
Uh, yeah, sure.

237
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,041
[HALLEY]
Heed this!

238
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,291
I will make sure you regret
ever daring to oppose me!

239
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,583
Did you all hear
how much faith

240
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,208
Professor Radars has in us?

241
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,041
There's no way we can lose!

242
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,500
[STUDENTS cheering]

243
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,208
Let's win this, shall we?

[STUDENTS chattering]

245
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,666
[GLENN]
No problem.

246
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,416
Yeah, I really don't think
they're on the same page.

247
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,666
[RUMIA] Hey, Professor Radars
is pretty cool, isn't he?

248
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,958
He's usually such an oaf.

249
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,041
He should try being serious
like this more often.

250
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,125
[RUMIA giggles]

251
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,791
You're not being
honest with yourself.

252
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,541
What are you talking about?

253
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,208

Don't leave me!

257
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,916
I'll be a good girl!

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
Please, please don't hate me!

Hey, don't cry. Keep quiet.

[RUMIA]
I don't wanna die.

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
Help me! I don't wanna die!

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,708
Please!

264
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,916
It's all right.

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,625
I'm on your side, okay?

266
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,208
There's still some bad guys.

267
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
So you can be as frightened
of me as you want,

268
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,208
but if you'll just stop crying,
then I can try to save you.

Rumia?

270

Dinner's ready.

Oh, uh, thank you, Sisti.

Anyway, tomorrow's the
big competition, right?

276
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
Even the queen herself
will be there,

277
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,333
so we all have to do our best.

Rumia, about tomorrow.

279
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,208
Um...

00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,083
[RUMIA] Look, thanks a lot
for worrying about me,

281
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,458
but I already know
who my true parents are.

282

They're your parents, Sisti.

Sorry, girls.

We had some last-minute
work come in for tomorrow.

287
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,000
We were really looking
forward to being there

288

to see you both have
your big moment, but...

289
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,416

We understand.

You guys can't help it
if you're both busy with work.

291
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,500
Yeah, please don't
worry about it.

I'm gonna cry!

No, goddesses!

They must be--Agh!

we just can't get out of.

Oh, yeah, we get it.

301
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,208
But next time, girls,
I promise you,

302
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,916
I'll find a way
to thre--[laughs]

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,291
I mean, request time off.

304
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,291
[RUMIA laughs]
That's not necessary.

305
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,291
[SISTINE, RUMIA sigh]

306
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,250
Now, now.
Hang in there, my dear.

You're in an awfully good mood.

308
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,583
That's because today,

309
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,083
I'll get to see her,
even if it's from afar.

310
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,833
Now, ma'am, about
that pendant there.

311
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,291
[ALICIA]
Of course.

312

this one instead?

in the name of Queen Alicia
the Seventh of Alzano,

316
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,750
let the annual magic
competition hereby commence.

[STADIUM cheering]

318
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,583
[HALLEY] Hmph! To think my
class will be the one to win

319
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,583
before the queen...

320
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
[stomach growls]

321
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,375
[GLENN] I can feel the applause
echo in my empty stomach.

322
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
[RUMIA]
Figures.

323
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,208
Now they're rounding
the final corner!

324
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,666
Here comes Ky with the baton
pass to Rodde, and Rodde...

325
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
There he goes,
third through the goal!

326
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,708
Class two is third
in the flying race!

327
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,166
What a shocking upset!

328
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,208
We did it!

329
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,291
Rodde and Ky
actually came in third!

330
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,541
[GLENN]
No way!

331
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,416
Professor, did you have
a trick up your sleeve?

332
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Why, of course I did!

333
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,375
But really, it's just a matter
of some simple math equations.

334
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,708
Since this was a
long-distance race...

335
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,791
...pacing's more
important than speed.

336
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,833
So I just ran some
calculations to figure out

337
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,125
the magic power they'd expend.

338
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,291
We might really pull this off
if we just follow Profess--

339
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,708
Don't get so carried
away just 'cause

340
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,583
by some miracle
you came in third.

341
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,750
[KASH]
What did you say?!

342
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,333
Stop it, Kreiss.

343
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,458
Let them have
this one tiny moment.

344
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,541
[KREISS]
Yes, Professor.

345
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,583
This was Professor
Radars' strategy!

346
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,000
Long as we've got
him on our side,

347
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,333
we can't lose to class one!

348
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,250
Right, you guys?

349
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,333
[ALF]

Well done, class two!

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,125
Is that appropriate, Professor?

00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,541
Oh, my bad.

357
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,333
Sorry 'bout that, Queenie.

[ALICIA'S MAID 4A]
Miss Celica,

360
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,541
you're being
quite disrespectful.

00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,833
[ALICIA]
It's all right.

362
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,833
She's an old friend.

having fun, Celica.

Yeah, I am, Alice.

00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,041
It's pretty refreshing,
actually.

00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,458
Is this man truly
all that incredible?

367
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,083
[CELICA]
He's just an average guy,

368
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,916
but always manages to do
something unexpected.

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,875
He's been that way
forever, right?

370
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:29,916
Yes.

Hey. Girlie.

Jaill from class five,
aren't you?

Well, you're so kind
to worry about me,

but everyone else
has been doing their best,

Yeah, so what?

Well, my class

[GIBUL] Professor Radars,
you wouldn't by chance

a sacrificial pawn

00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,791
in mental defense,
now, would you?

408
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,000
[GLENN]
Huh?

409
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,625
[GIBUL] Rumia excels
at healing white magic,

410
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,041
but she's not as adept
with other kinds.

411
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,083

is certainly the logical move.

Wow, I had no idea that
Rumia was this strong!

465
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,791
Mind Up is a spell
that can be used

466
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,541
to boost one's mental fortitude.

467
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,291
The stronger your nerves are,
the more effective it is.

468
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,666
Now see, Rumia's mindset--

469
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,458
hell, her mind itself isn't
like a normal person's.

470
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,000
It's kinda like she's
always prepared to die.

471

It's freaky.

00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,333
Which is why I thought this'd
be an easy win for Rumia,

473
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,750
but that Jaill
is something else.

Oh, well.

00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,791

seem the time has come

to move on to Mind Break.

00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,541
One of the most advanced

[ZEST]
Here I go!

481
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,666
Listen to the warble
of wicked birds,

How 'bout that.
Not bad for a girl.

[RUMIA giggles] This might
get pretty rough, huh?

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,625
[JAILL]
You could always just quit.

490
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,166
[RUMIA] Aw, you don't
have to worry about me.

491
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,375
I'll be fine. I can't quit.

492
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,708
And I can't afford
to lose, either.

493
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,625
Professor Radars promised
we would win this!

494
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,333
He made us all believe we
can come together as a team.

495
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,250
That sub everyone's
talking about?

496
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,875
Ridiculous.

497
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,625
[RUMIA]
He's taught us a lot, actually.

498
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,291
So...

499
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,125
I can't let my classmates down!

500
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,791
[JAILL]
That so?

501
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,625
[ZEST]
In order to settle this match,

502
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,625
I'll increase the power.

503
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,791
Are you two mentally
prepared for that?

504
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,125
Here we go!

505
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,541
[ARS] Oh! Just like that,
Rumia falls to her knees!

506
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
Do you wish to surrender?

507
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,125
No, no, I'm fine.

00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,875
--I can--
--[GLENN] She forfeits.

00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,583
It's all right.
I can keep going.

512
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,916
[GLENN]
You hung in there like a champ.

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,041
But Professor!

514
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,458
No, that's enough now.

515
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,625
Rumia.

516
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,041
If it's painful,
you don't have to do this.

517
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,375
You did great, kid.

518
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,333
You were just up against
the wrong opponent.

519
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,208
I never anticipated
someone like him.

520
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,666
Sorry about that.

521
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,625
No. Don't be. I had fun.

522
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
And I really felt
like I was fighting

00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,208
on behalf of the
whole class, too.

524
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,750
[GLENN]
Oh, yeah?

525
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,958
Hey, Jaill,

526
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,708
now that you've won
in mental defense again,

527
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,291
do you have any words?

528
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,875
[ZEST] It appears Jaill
is unconscious on his feet!

529
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,125
[ARS]
Uh...

530
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,291
Meaning what?

531
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,083
Victory belongs to Rumia.

532
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,791
Even if she withdrew,

533
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,583
she already cleared the
previous Mind Break beforehand.

534
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,666
[ARS]
Unbelievable!

535
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,583
The winner is
Rumia of class two!

536
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,583
Rumia!

537
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,541
Congratulations, you did it!

538
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,500
Thank you!

539
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,208
[ALICIA] She's been blessed
with good friends

540
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,458
and a good mentor.

541
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,583
I'm so very happy
that I was able to be here

542
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,583
to see her smiling like that.

543
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,541
You know, if you had
mentioned anything to me,

544
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,541
maybe I could've
worked something out.

545
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,791
No, it's fine.

546
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,625
I know that the fact
that I abandoned her

547
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,583
isn't going to change.

548
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,333
Still, I feel very
satisfied today.

549
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,708
Especially after seeing her.

550
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,541
Seeing my Rumia like this.

551
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,208
[CELICA]
Is that really enough?

552
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,458
Just seeing her from afar--
is that enough for you?

553
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,708
Please, ma'am.

554
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,250
Why don't you try being
honest with yourself,

555
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,083
if only for today?

556
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,375
That's right!

557
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,916
[chattering, laughing]
