1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,750
Why are you doing this?

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,875
Talk to me, Re=L!

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,541
[RE=L]
I wish I had another choice.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,833
But if I'm not dedicating
myself to my brother

5
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,291
and this cause,
then what am I living for?

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,166
Please help me.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
It's you.

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,750
I'm too late.

10
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,250
[GLENN gasps]

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,250
[groans]

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,208
[ALBERT] You're as
resilient as ever, Glenn.

13
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,958
I guess I owe you pretty big.

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,833
[ALBERT]
You should thank Miss Fibel.

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,583
Without her assistance,
the Reviver spell

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,041
never would have worked.

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,125
[ALBERT]
Her mana capacity is impressive.

18
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,250
[GLENN chuckles]

19
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,166
I've had my
suspicions for a while.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,541
You really are amazing,
white cat.

21
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,541
A pain in my ass, but,
most the good ones are.

22
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,708
[ALBERT] We may be able to
count on her in our mission

23
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,083
to free the princess.

24
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,375
Let's not be stupid.

25
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,875
She's a kid, Albert.

26
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,166
She stays.

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,208
So what are we up against?

28
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,458
[GLENN]
Damn it, Re=L.

29
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,083
[ALBERT] I warned you to be
careful when it came to her.

30
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,708
What else did you see coming?

31
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,041
Did you think the Researchers
of Divine Wise-Assery

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,416
might show up here too?

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,750
I did.

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,625
One of our investigations
revealed a suspicious

35
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,666
flow of money.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,375
Someone sending
a lot of new funding

37
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,000
to the white alchemy lab.

38
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,125
We probed further,
and found a likely connection

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,250
between the Researchers
and the lab's director,

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,458
Burks Blaumohn.

41
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,583
Then why didn't you tell me
the last time we talked,

42
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,500
when you knew we
were coming here?!

43
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,541
[GLENN]
Oh, of course.

44
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,041
Because you were
using Rumia as bait

45
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,500
to draw them out.

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,041
Did that come from
military command?

47
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,041
Or your precious leadership?

48
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,791
Damn you!
You could have helped!

49
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,333
I'm sure you know
why I couldn't object.

50
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
'Cause if they turn
their eyes on you,

51
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,875
they could learn
the truth about Re=L.

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,125
I get you were in a bind,

53
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,125
but that doesn't excuse
you letting this happen.

54
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,333
Rumia's been through so much

55
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,250
and now you've used her
for convenience!

56
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,500
My superiors are dishonorable
for issuing this order.

57
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,000
Going along with it
makes me just as bad.

58
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,541
I don't deny it.

59
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
But I've given Re=L her chance,
and now I'm done with mercy.

60
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,958
If she continues to stand
on the wrong side,

61
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,750
then I will destroy her.

62
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,166
No, that's not the answer.

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,833
Re=L's just confused.

64
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,625
We have to show her the truth.

65
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,208
I should have done
that two years ago

66
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,500
back when I found her.

67
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,833
But now she's siding
with her brother, right?

68
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,125
You honestly think she's
going to listen to you?

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,625
I'll make her!

70
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,583
She's gonna listen even
if I have to pound it

71
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,750
into her stubborn little head!

72
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,500
You've got some nerve
playing the hero.

73
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,750
You ran away.

74
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,791
Abandoned your comrades
without a single word.

75
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,750
If you want to understand
Re=L's betrayal,

76
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,541
then you should
start with your own.

77
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,750
You broke her heart.

78
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,125
I'm not sure you even
deserve to save her.

79
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,083
You blame me.
Well blame yourself!

80
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,666
Look, I know,
and I'm not gonna argue

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,375
with any of that, okay?

82
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,541
I screwed up.

83
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,541
I know don't deserve
to be her friend!

84
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,166
But I am her teacher
and she needs my help!

85
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,583
You haven't changed.

86
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,958
And that why's
despite all else,

87
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,291
I keep choosing to
put my faith in you.

88
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,541
[GLENN grunts]

89
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,041
[GLENN] You ass!
What was that for?

90
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,791
That was for you disappearing.

91
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
Now I can forgive you.

92
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,125
Whoa, you kept it?

93
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,875
[ALBERT] My priority is
rescuing the princess.

94
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,875
If the situation requires
me to kill Re=L to do that,

95
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,958
I'll shoot without regret.

96
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,041
And I warn you
not to complain.

97
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,458
[GLENN] You always were
a tough nut to crack.

98
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,791
Mr. Serious-pants over
here says you helped me.

99
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,125
Thanks, Sistine.

100
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,333
Once again.

101
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,791
[KASH] Hey. What's the
professor up to now?

102
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,416
And that soldier who's with him.

103
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,875
[SISTINE]
Professor?

104
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,958
I couldn't stop her
from taking Rumia.

105
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
I just froze.

106
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
[RUMIA whimpering]

107
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,333
[RUMIA yells]

108
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,458
[BURKS laughing]

109
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,791
Yes! Ha!

110
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,583
Look! It's working!

111
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,041
Project Revive Life
will succeed at last!

112
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,916
With me at the helm!

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,583
Though I can't take sole credit.

114
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,666
You gathered all three elements.

115
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,250
And you even
persuaded an enemy

116
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,708
to switch sides and
bring us the Amplifier.

117
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,458
I have to say, you're quite
a resourceful young man.

118
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,583
You honor me with
your praise, Director.

119
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,666
I just knew we had to capture
the Amplifier somehow.

120
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,458
Since we lack the
original spell-caster,

121
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,083
it was the only way.

122
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,000
You should feel privileged
you're contributing

123
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,208
to this important work,
young lady.

124
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,833
[RUMIA whimpering]

125
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,500
[BURKS] I'm surprised you
still have the energy

126
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,541
to look at me.

127
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,041
In that case, enjoy the view!

128
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,708
Like most people,
you probably think

129
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,208
the Researchers of
Divine Wisdom are evil.

130
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,416
But as I see it,
the Imperial Family

131
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,916
are the true purveyors
of terror in this land.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,916
It's enough to make me sick!

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,541
[BURKS chuckles]

134
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,541
An empire led
by a family like that

135
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,500
deserves a swift downfall
if you ask me.

136
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,875
That's enough, Burks.

137
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,625
You've had your fun.

138
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,416
What do you know about them?

139
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,666
What have they done
that's so wrong?

140
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,000
[RUMIA yelling]

141
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,625
You'll lose. I know it!

142
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,083
[RUMIA yelling]

143
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,416
How are you feeling, Re=L?

144
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,833
Everything all right?

145
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,833
How clever.

146
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,583
So that's what he's up to.

147
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,000
[GLENN]
Magic signals?

148
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,250
[ALBERT]
Yes.

149
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,625
After the incident at
the magic competition,

150
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,375
I planted the first
on the princess,

151
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,750
to tell me her
whereabouts at any time.

152
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,375
[GLENN] So that's how
you know where she is?

153
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,125
[ALBERT] No, unfortunately
that one was dispelled.

154
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,041
But I planted another one.

155
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,916
On Eleanor Chalet.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,375
[ELEANOR]
Impressive work, Mr. Frazer.

157
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,208
The Professor!

158
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,083
[BURKS] They will not
impede our progress.

159
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,875
One of my creations
will make sure of that.

160
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,000
[GLENN]
No security, huh?

161
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,375
That's nice of them.

162
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,541
[ALBERT] This will go
quickly if that's the case.

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,583
[GLENN]
Hello, nurse!

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,791
[LION CHIMERA growling]

165
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,333
[ALBERT]
Roar, flame lion!

166
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,875
[ELEANOR chuckles]

167
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,208
Surely you didn't think
the beast would stop them.

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,041
They've been trained by the
Mage Corps, Mr. Blaumohn.

169
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,458
Curse them both!

170
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,166
[SISTINE] What was the
point of all that training

171
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,666
with the Professor if I can't
even help when it counts?

172
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,083
[knocking]

173
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,833
[door opens]

174
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,958
[WENDY]
Sistine, what happened?

175
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,500
Where's Rumia?

176
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,000
This is bad, isn't it?

177
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,875
[GLENN]
So how's your chimera trivia?

178
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,625
[ALBERT] The military
experimented with them

179
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
for a while.

180
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,708
But they were so dangerous
the project was shelved.

181
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,458
You think you know a tour
guide and then he tries

182
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,583
to kill you.

183
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,291
Hmph. Well, looks like we're
getting a two-for-one deal.

184
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,583
[TORTOISE CHIMERA growls]

185
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,916
Someone put on
big boy pants today.

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,833
[TORTOISE CHIMERA growling]

187
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,791
[BURKS laughing]

188
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,000
Look at them!

189
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Fleeing like roaches
from my jeweled beast!

190
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,666
Professor...

191
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,250
Like I told you, Eleanor.

192
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,708
They're powerless
against my alchemy!

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,291
We'll see about that.

194
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,750
[TORTOISE CHIMERA roars]

195
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,791
[GLENN] Now return thyself
to the cycle of providence,

196
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,750
the five elements to elements,

197
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,791
and sever the link
woven between images

198
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,041
and the truth.

199
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,041
I declare that all
creation shall perish here

200
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,000
at the distant ends of the void.

201
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,250
Extinction Ray!

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,958
[TORTOISE CHIMERA growls]

203
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,500
What? That can't be!

204
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,500
[ELEANOR chuckles]

205
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,250
You clearly don't
know your enemy.

206
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,708
Professor Radars
continues to impress.

207
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,250
[BURKS]
Professor, please!

208
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,000
He's a substitute, isn't he?

209
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,750
I'm not scared of some
magic teacher temp!

210
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
I'll make him breathe his last!

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,083
[ELEANOR]
Take note.

212
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,208
I'll leave the rest to you
and your little sister.

213
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,708
Understood, ma'am.

214
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,541
After all, I can't die here.

215
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,083
There's too much work to do.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,791
[KASH]
What do you mean?

217
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,791
You're being totally vague!

218
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,291
[SISTINE]
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

219
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,083
But the Professor's handling it.

220
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,291
We just need to stay
here until he gets back.

221
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,791
Can we really just wait?

222
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,500
What if Rumia and
Re=L don't come back

223
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,875
while we're twiddling
our thumbs?

224
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,833
[WENDY]
Don't talk like that!

225
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,916
They'll come back!

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,125
[CECIL]
You don't know!

227
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,875
Yeah, and waiting
here won't help!

228
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,208
We should look for them too!

229
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,500
No, it's too dangerous!

230
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,125
[KY] So we abandon them
'cause we're scared?

231
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,166
She didn't say that.
She means searching blind

232
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,500
could make things worse!

233
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,458
We know the Professor
can be lazy and annoying

234
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,125
and sometimes even a bastard.

235
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,750
But he's shown us all
that we can trust him

236
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,958
when it counts, right?

237
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,125
But we don't know
what's going on

238
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,541
or what happened to the girls.

239
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,750
What if this time it's something
he can't handle alone?

240
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,666
Or what if he picks now to be
the moron version of himself?

241
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,208
[ALBERT] Re=L and the
princess should be up ahead.

242
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,833
[GLENN]
Look who's come to greet us!

243
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,166
I feel so V.I.P!

244
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,333
[BURKS growls]
Now you die!

00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,250
[BURKS (MONSTER) roars]

246
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,041
[GLENN]
He's even changed his own body.

247
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,708
Alchemy addicts are sad.

248
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,250
I'll stay here and
handle this monstrosity.

249
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,500
You go on.

250
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
Aw, thanks.

251
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,416
Just try not to have
too much fun.

[BURKS (MONSTER) growls]

254
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,000
I suggest you focus on me.

[BURKS (MONSTER) growls]

256
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,708
[KASH]
Enough talk!

257
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,458
I'm ready for action!

258
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,625
[GIBUL] Tsk!
Oh spare us the theatrics, Kash.

259
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,291
If the bastard didn't
want our help,

260
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,250
we shouldn't be trying
to give it to him.

261
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,500
You're just too cool
for anything, aren't you.

262
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,958
Don't you care
about our friends?

263
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,708
[SISTINE]
That's not it, Kash!

264
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,958
He means the Professor
had a reason.

265
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,500
For not wanting us to come.

266
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,625
Right, Gibul?

267
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
I'm worried about
Re=L and the professor,

268
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,458
and Rumia is like
a sister to me.

269
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,416
So yeah.

270
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,708
Waiting here feels like torture.

271
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,083
But if we go, what are
we going to accomplish?

272
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,333
We know magic!

273
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,291
We could help with
whatever's out there!

274
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,750
Doubtful.

275
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,166
We'd turn into more
people he has to save.

276
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,500
[SISTINE]
I know it's hard, for everyone,

277
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,000
but the professor
asked us to stay.

278
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,916
So I'm begging you to trust him.

279
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,916
Yeah, okay, we get it already.

280
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,083
Sorry. I guess
I'm just a worrier.

281
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,291
It's probably less of
a crisis than I think.

282
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,208
Even if it is serious,
the professor can handle it.

283
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,666
Remember how he took
out those terrorists

284
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,041
all by himself?

285
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,875
I believe in him.

286
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,083
Thanks, guys, really.

287
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,791
[WENDY]
Why are you crying, Sistine?

288
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,125
Is there something else?

289
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,000
[SISTINE]
No.

290
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,458
It's just the stress.

291
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,916
[RAINER]
It's almost complete.

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,708
But I fear those two vicious
mages will be here soon.

293
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,458
You'll defeat them.
Won't you, my dear sister?

294
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,833
And keep me safe?

295
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,916
Of course.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
You're my only
reason for living.

297
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,416
Good girl.

298
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,666
Professor!

299
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,250
Hey, Rumia! What's hanging?

300
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,291
And that's a pun I
immediately regret.

301
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,791
Thank goodness you're safe.

302
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,500
I've been worried sick, sir.

303
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,458
Strung up like a slab of meat
and she's worried about me?

304
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,833
[GLENN]
Re=L!

305
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,416
Enough with the mute routine!

306
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,708
Aren't you gonna say something
after literally backstabbing me?

307
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,708
And you, Lord Derpy Face.

308
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,666
Did you have to dangle my
hottie student in chains?

309
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,291
'Cause I'm not saying
I have a bondage fetish,

310
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,625
but if I did that
would be distracting!

311
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,958
'Kay?

312
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,958
Our director does have
a flair for the dramatic.

313
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,041
He like dramatic
beat-downs too?

314
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,125
Stop there.

315
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,083
Don't come any
closer to my brother.

316
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,166
Thanks, Re=L.

317
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,083
I knew I could count on my sis.

318
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,541
Make sure he doesn't
interfere with our work.

319
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,833
I understand.

320
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,291
I beseech creation.

321
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,333
Grant unto my hands
a great blade.

322
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,833
[GLENN]
Come on, Re=L.

323
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,500
You sure you want to fight me?

324
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,916
I'd say you've taken this
little prank far enough.

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,375
Talk all you want, Glenn.

326
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,583
I'll protect my brother
to the very end.

327
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,583
[GLENN]
You idiot!

328
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,250
This is all just a trick!

329
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,583
Your brother's as dead as
this chode's about to be!

330
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,708
Shut up!

331
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458
Yelling at me won't
make it less true!

00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,791
How can you deny it when
he's standing right there?!

333
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,250
Listen, Re=L, you're confused!

334
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,041
[RE=L]
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

335
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,541
[GLENN] Damn it, she doesn't
want to listen to me.

336
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,958
How do I make her see?

337
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,583
[GLENN]
Come on, Re=L.

338
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,083
Bring it on!

[RE=L yells]

[GLENN]
Albert's right.

341
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,666
It's my fault for not
telling her the truth,

342
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,541
and for running
away without her.

343
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,166
But I'm not running now.

344
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,625
She just has to hear me!

345
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,708
[RE=L yelling]

346
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,083
Hey! Stop!

347
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,750
Don't do this, Re=L,
I know he's trying to help you!

348
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,833
Don't hurt him!

349
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
He's too important!
To all of us!

350
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,166
And you're important
to us too, Re=L.

351

We care about you.

[RE=L gasps]

354
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,958
[GLENN]
Now's my chance!

355
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,041
[GLENN] Turning on Rumia
must've been hard.

356
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,208
So you really love
your brother that much?

357
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Yes, he means everything to me.

358
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,000
That's why I've decided
to dedicate my life to him.

359
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,708
I guess I didn't want to
believe 'cause I was jealous

360
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,416
he meant so much to you.

[RE=L]
What are you saying?

362
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
I'm saying if you'd
do this for him,

363
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,208
he must be a great guy and
I should give him a chance.

364
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,375
So, introduce us.
What's his name?

He's stalling. Finish him!

Oh, come on,
it's a simple question.

369
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,458
Tell me his name
and I'll back down.

Don't listen,
he's playing mind games!

00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,916

Say it, Re=L. I'm waiting.

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,041

What's wrong with me?

00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,166
Why can't I remember it?

It doesn't matter if you forgot!

[GLENN] Let the plate
of order tip to starboard.

It was a risky bet.

Get off me.

386
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,791
You can't win.

387
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,833
This isn't my strength
you're feeling.

388
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,041
It's gravity.

Gravity manipulation?

390
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,625
Just sit tight,
and I'll take care of this.

How could you?!

396
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,291
I knew when you said Re=L.

397
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,791
Next time you want
to pose as her brother,

398
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,958
you should go with
the girl's actual name!

399
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,041
We called it
"Project Revive Life."

400
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,291
Or for short, Project Re=L.

401
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,291
[RE=L]
That's right.

402
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,375
My brother's name was Sion.

403
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,333
[RAINER] I decided to
name Illushia's copy

404
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
after the project.

408

How many innocent people
have we sacrificed

409
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,583
just to make this one clone?

410
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,625
You can leave the group with us.

411
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,333

00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,375
I don't need you
anymore either, Illushia.

417
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,041
Since I already have your
three elements in hand,

418
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,458
I'll put you to rest
right next to your brother.

419
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:19,291
[RE=L] I remember now
who I--no, what I am.

420
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,791
[RAINER] Two years ago,
Sion betrayed the project

421
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,041
and reported us to the
Imperial Court Mage Corps,

422
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
which led to them
raiding our lab

423
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,375
and setting us back till now.

424
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,000
[GLENN]
Yeah, I know all about it.

425
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,416
I'm the one Sion contacted.

426
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
[SION]
The project's almost finished.

427
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,666
All they need now
is my original spell

428
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,541
to complete the ritual.

429
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,416
I'm the only one
there who can cast it.

430
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
If I leave, they're stuck.

431
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,291
But Glenn. If I help you...

432
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,541
There are two others
I want to save.

433
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,000
We've been through
everything together.

434
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,833
Friends our whole lives.

435
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,000
And their names?

436
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,166
Illushia and Rainer, sir.

437
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,291
[GLENN] He went to
arrange your extraction,

438
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,958
then we lost contact
so we raided the lab.

439
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,208
But Sion was already dead.

440
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,708
And his sister was
too wounded to save.

441
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,916
[GLENN] All I could do
was protect the copy.

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
The manufactured girl
who had inherited

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,666
Illushia's Astral Code,

444
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,333
and all her memories
right up to the moment

445
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,500
of her death.

446
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,291
The copy.

447
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,458
That's me.

448
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,875
I thought I had altered your
memories to suit my needs,

449
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,916
but I guess I didn't
have time for a full scrub

450
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,375
before we were raided.

451
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,583
Oh, well, the first
draft's always junk.

452
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,875
Look, you bastard.

453
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,583
Don't talk about her like that.

454
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,958
But it's just the truth,
she is junk!

455
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,083

Aw, hell.

461
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,083
Now these girls
are real perfection.

462
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,458
I eliminated all
those pesky emotions,

463
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,250
which makes them so
much easier to control.

464
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,583
I call them my little
army of puppets.

465
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,541
Now, girls!

00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,208

00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,458
That was way too close.

470
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
Why protect something worthless?

471
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,250
I'm just a copy.

I wouldn't risk my life
if you were worthless!

476
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,333
But I'm a doll.

477
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,916
What worth can I have?

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,958
Nah.

479
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,583

be moping like that!

There, you see?

00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,291
But I've been cruel.

Re=L!

[crying]

530
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,833
[GIBUL] In theory,
you receive the ball

531
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,625
based on its angle
to the ground.

533
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,083
[GROUP chattering]

534
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,708
It really is a precious
sight, isn't it.

535
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,583
Hell yeah.

536
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,416
Look at all those swimsuits!

537
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,708
And volleyball has a
very high bounce factor!

538
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,458
You know that's not
what I was talking about.

539
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,416
This moment.

540
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,708
Their happiness.

541
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,083
That's what you fought
so hard to protect.

542
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:37,958
Right, Glenn?

543
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,083
Who can say.

544
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,125
[ELEANOR]
Yes. I have it.

545
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:48,041
The entire Project Revive
Life ritual is now ours.
