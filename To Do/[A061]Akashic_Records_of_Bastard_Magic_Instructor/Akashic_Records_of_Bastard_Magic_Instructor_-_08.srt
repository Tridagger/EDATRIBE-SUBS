[BURKS] White alchemy is a
field that combines alchemy

with white magic.

69
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,708
Besides, looking
around this place

70
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375

[SISTINE]
Hm?

Well, it...

73
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,583
It makes me wonder
if it's really okay

74

for people to manipulate
life like this.

00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,166
It seems wrong.

76
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,708
[SISTINE] True, if you were
to delve too deep into this...

77
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,791
...you could start down the
path to becoming an evil mage.

No big deal.

But one thing
I don't understand.

91
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,250
In all our classes,

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,708
we're taught that
resurrecting the dead

93
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
is theoretically impossible.

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,708
Precisely.

95
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,666
At the moment, no magic exists
that can disprove that axiom.

96
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,083
That's actually the very
reason why they founded

97
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,500
Project Revive Life.

98
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,750
[GLENN] They figured they
needed three ingredients.

99
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
A body created
through alchemy

100
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,958
using the dead guy's
genetic code,

101
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,500
which they cleverly
called a "Gene Code,"

102
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,416
an Astral Code,
which is just memories

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,208
transformed into data,

104
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,666
and Alter Ether,
which resets a person's spirit.

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,000
Those elements are
combined to revive someone.

106
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,250
'Least that was the theory.

00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,333
Uh, Professor!

108
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,875
I appreciate the explanation,

109
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,791
but did you have
to butt in like that?

110
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,291
Oh, sorry 'bout that.

111
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,708
I just knew something
and wanted to prove it.

112
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,500
Essentially the idea is to
fuse together these elements

113
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,791
to create a facsimile
of the deceased.

114
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,458
Yeah, but in that case,

115
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,708
is it really even
a resurrection?

116
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,416
Indeed, that might not
be the best term for it.

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,250
More accurately,
it's creating a duplicate

118
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,500
of who they were
shortly before death.

119
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,916
[GLENN]
Relax.

120
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,625
That line of research
was abandoned

121
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,166
a long time ago.

122
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,416
See, the problem was
multiple chumps had to die

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,833
just to revive one person.

124
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,750
The lucky stiff, if you will.

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,083
That kinda trade-off
wasn't exactly sustainable.

126
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,083
Yes, too true.

127
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,166
We humans are not
meant to be gods.

128
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,791

the right to decide

and who should die.

to remain sealed away

134
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:12,166

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,750
Oh, come on,
you don't believe that.

136
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,458
It's just an urban legend.

00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,958
Um, this is just
out of curiosity,

138
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,333

three elements

139
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,958

140
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,541

you can think of

that might be needed
to get Project Revive Life

143
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,458

comes to mind is

original magic.

145
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,458
If there was somebody who
possessed the original magic

146
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,000
necessary to Project
Revive Life, then maybe.

of someone showing up like that?

148
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,166
I mean they have to be
incredibly small, right?

149
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,666

That they are.

successfully completing
that project

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Anyway, hope you won't
lose patience with her

181
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,125
and run for the hills.

182
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,083
Believe me.

183
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,125
I know how tempting that'll be.

184
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,500
What? Don't be ridiculous!

185
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
Professor we would
never just abandon Re=L.

186
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,083
All right, I'm going to go
out there and look for Re=L!

187
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,750
Nah, you girls should
wait for her here

188
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,083
in case she comes back.

189
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,083
But what about...

190
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,250
[RUMIA, SISTINE gasp]

191
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,958
[GLENN] Don't worry,
I'll go look for Re=L.

192
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,041
I am her teacher.
So I kinda have to.

193
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,875
[RE=L crying]

194
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,083
[RAINER] Aw, why are
you crying, Re=L?

195
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,750
[RE=L]
Who's there?

196
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,791
Oh, I'm hurt.

197
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,791
You don't recognize
your big brother?

198
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,875
Is that you?

199
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,500
Wait, but how?

200
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,916
At last.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
I've missed you so much.

202
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,333
[ALBERT]
Tsk. So that's the play?

203
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,833
[ALBERT]
A barrier to keep others out?

204
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,666
You work fast, don't you?

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,083
Or perhaps I was
just overly careless.

206
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,416
[ELEANOR laughs] Aw, are you
out here all alone tonight?

207
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
Poor boy.

208
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,708
[ALBERT] Well, I certainly
wasn't expecting you,

209
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,625
Eleanor Chalet.

210
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,250
You excited to see me?

211
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,375
Perhaps I could impose
on you to entertain me

212
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,041
for the night, Albert?

213
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,083
I promise to give
you one hell of a time,

214
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,666
fueled with a passion
so shameless and unbridled

215
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,458
it will make you scream
so loud you raise the dead.

216
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,750
[ALBERT]
Unfortunately for you,

217
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,750
I have no interest
in cheap women.

218
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,083
So get lost.

219
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,500
[ELEANOR laughs]
What a cold man you are.

220
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm sure you're still
acting out some vile scheme

221
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,625
involving the princess
right now,

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,291
but it ends here.

223
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
I'm removing you from the board.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,875
Immediately.

225
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,166
My, my, someone's impatient.

226
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,416
No need for such haste.

227
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,625
Flame lion!

228
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,500
Come forth,
red king of beasts!

229
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,041
[ELEANOR]
Come out.

230
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,833
Ah, come out, come out!

231
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,833
O, spirits of the night,
answer my call.

232
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,916
Answer.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,666
Answer my call!

234
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,833
Console and moisten thyselves
with his flesh and blood!

235
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,666
Now. Rise up! Feast!

236
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,416
[laughing]

237
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,458
[ZOMBIES moaning, growling]

238
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,166
A necromancer!

239
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,791
[ZOMBIES growling]

240
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,333
Golden lightning beast,
pay heed,

241
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,416
race across the earth,
and dance to the heavens.

242
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,791
[ZOMBIES scream, moan]

243
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,041
Come forth,
and vanquish the dark.

244
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,083
[ZOMBIES screaming]

245
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,291
[ELEANOR giggles]

246
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,541
[ALBERT]
Ah, let me guess.

247
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,208
You thought that you
would have an easy time

248
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:19,666
besting me in close magic combat
simply because I'm a sniper.

249
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,083
[ELEANOR]
Oh, not at all.

250
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,000
It's just, you're so much
stronger and virile

251
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,208
than I imagined!

252
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,916
And so intense!

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,958
Oh, Albert, you're
driving me... crazy!

254
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,958
Your super regeneration--

255
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,708
It's not a conditional
healing spell or the result

256
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,875
of any drugs accelerating
your own healing factor.

257
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,541
No, it's something
far more repugnant.

258
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,125
[ELEANOR laughs]

259
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,958
[ALBERT] This woman is
on a whole different level

260
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,958
than any of the evil mages
I've eliminated before.

261
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,166
If I can manage to capture her,

262
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,083
the Empire will gain
a huge advantage

263
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,250
over her organization.

264
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,583
[ELEANOR] Shall we continue with
this evening's entertainment?

265
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,208
[ALBERT] No, she's too
dangerous to take any chances.

266
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,541
I have to finish her right
here and now, for good!

267
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,083
[RUMIA] So, what do you
think is wrong with Re=L?

268
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,500
[SISTINE]
I don't really know why, but...

269
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,583
When we went down
to the beach...

270
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,041
Friends, huh?

271
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,833
I don't get it,
but I think I could like it.

272
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,750
[SISTINE] I just don't
think Re=L was lying

273
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,208
when she said that.

274
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,166
Me, either.

275
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,291
[SISTINE]
All right!

276
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,125
I'm gonna go
pick up some food!

277
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,125
Those guys will probably
be starving to death

278
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,708
when they get back here.

279
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,958
[RUMIA giggles]
Yeah, good thinking.

280
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,000
[RE=L]
Brother...

281
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,125
It can't be. You're dead.

282
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,541
How are you here?

283
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,625
[RAINER] It's true the
organization killed me that day.

284
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,583
But, at the time,
you must've been so upset,

285
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,916
you didn't notice that
I was still breathing.

286
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,791
[RAINER]
Re=L, please save me.

287
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,458
Two years ago,
you managed to defect

288
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,916
and earn your own
freedom from them.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,541
But meanwhile, I still
remain as their slave.

290
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,833
But... How can I do
anything to save you?

291
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,708
You know Rumia Tingel?

292
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,041
[RE=L gasps]

293
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,500
[RAINER] The organization
needs her for the plan

294
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,625
they have in motion right now.

295
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
Which means that mage, Glenn,

296
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,458
is a pretty big
obstacle for them.

297
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,708
The organization's
given me a chance.

298
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,416
If I can make this plan work...

299
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
...then I'll be free, Re=L.

300
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,583
Like you.

301
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,541
I don't know if...

302
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,291
Re=L...

303
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,166
I thought you were going
to protect your brother

304
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,125
no matter what.

305
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,791
[RE=L]
Yes. But I...

306
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,541
[RAINER] Or are you planning
to abandon me again?

307
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,750
[GLENN]
Re=L!

308
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,583
Re=L, get away from that man!

309
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,125
[RAINER gasps]
Glenn Radars?

310
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,333
Oh, so you've heard of me.

311
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,666
Just what I'd expect
from the Researchers.

312
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,833
[RAINER gasps]
No, I'm not...

313
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,625
Hey, Re=L.

314
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,041
I don't know what kinda
lies you've been filling

315
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,333
her head with,

316
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,166
but I do know that giving
me time to get here

317
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,208
was a big mistake,
you evil mage!

318
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,458
See, it doesn't matter
what fancy tricks

319
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,875
you've got up your sleeve.

320
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,875
Re=L, let's get this guy.

321
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,916
[GLENN gasps]

322
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,333
Huh? Really?

323
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,458
Thank you for everything.

324
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,625
Goodbye, Glenn.

325
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,208
I had to.

326
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,375
I have to live for
my brother's sake.

327
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,416
Pathetic!

328
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,708
Aw, sad!

329
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,958
Time to go.

330
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,000
Fire!

331
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,500
She got me good that time,
I'll admit it.

332
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,958
Oh, well.

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,583
I may have bought too much.

334
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,875
Though Professor Radars
does eat a lot.

335
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,666
Uh, Rumia?

336
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,083
Re=L? What have--

337
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,416
What have you done to her?

338
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
--[SISTINE] Rumia!
--[RE=L] Just relax.

339
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,583
I didn't kill her,
so don't panic.

340
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,708
She's just unconscious.

341
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,208
Wait a second.

342
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,416
[gasps] Hey, where is he?

343
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,333
The professor went
looking for you!

344
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,833
Oh, Glenn?

345
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,958
Yeah, I did kill him.

346
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,791
[SISTINE]
No. No way.

347
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,541
It can't be...

348
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
I don't understand.

349
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,958
Why would you do this?!

350
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
[RE=L]
'Cause I'm with the, um...

351
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,583
The Researchers of, um...

352
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,375
Oh, what was it again?

353
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,458
Anyway, I'm your enemy now.

354
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,375
And I'm taking Rumia with me.

355
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,333
[SISTINE]
Hold it right there!

356
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,583
You get away from her!

357
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,833
Do you hear me?

358
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,083
If you make a move, I'll shoot.

359
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,875
I said don't move!

360
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,291
Oh, will you?

361
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,208
Will you really do it?

362
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,291
[RE=L]
Go ahead.

363
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,750
I won't do anything to you.

364
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,333
[RE=L]
Shoot.

365
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,000
Bang. You're the opposite.

366
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,958
You act tough,
but you're just a child,

367
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
hiding your weakness
behind a mask.

368
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Somebody help me!

369
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,583
[RE=L]
Shoot.

370
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,666
[RUMIA] I understand your point
about magic causing damage.

371
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,000
And make it truly
helpful to people.

372
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,875
[GLENN] If you're serious
about protecting Rumia,

373
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
this magic is your best bet.

374
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,291
Military-anything
isn't exactly cuddly.

375
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,041
But there's no way its
dark side is getting to you.

376
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,458
Your time is up.

377
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,125
[SISTINE]
How could I?

378
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,833
I had no choice.

379
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,083
If I'd fired,

380
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,083
I might have accidentally
hit Rumia, too.

381
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,083
And then there's Re=L.

382
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,625
She could've died.

383
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,125
At my hand.

384
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,041
[SISTINE]
No, that's not it.

385
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,458
I was just so scared,
I couldn't do anything.

386
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,625
[sobbing]

387
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
Professor...

388
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,000
[SISTINE gasps]

389
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,541
[ALBERT]
Sorry to barge in.

390
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,833
[SISTINE]
Mr... Frazer?

391
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,000
[SISTINE screams]

392
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,250
Professor Radars!

393
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,291
[ALBERT] Don't panic.
He's still breathing.

394
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,000
[SISTINE] He needs healing
magic right away!

395
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,250
Won't work.

396
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,875
He's already on the edge
of the reaper's scythe.

397
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
No, he...

398
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,250
Professor! Professor!

399
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,750
I need you to
share your strength.

400
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,250
What could you possibly
expect me to do?

401
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,250
If healing magic
won't work on him,

402
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't help!

403
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:22,916
No!

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
No, no!

405
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Why did this have to happen?

406
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,625
[crying]

407
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,500
Pull yourself together.

408
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,458
All this whining and self-pity
won't do anything to save him.

409
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,000
If you want to kill this man,
then by all means, keep crying.

410
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,875
Leave the rest
to the undertaker.

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,666
Wait, please don't go.

412
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,541
Just tell me.

413
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,416
What do you want me to do?

414
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,041
[SISTINE]
The white magic ritual, Reviver?

415
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,208
But doesn't that require an
enormous amount of mana?

416
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,541
Exactly.

417
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,250
That's why I'll be
using your mana, too.

418
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,333
Understood.

419
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,416
I'll handle the ritual's
complicated setup process.

420
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,916
You work the shortened,
temporary servant pact.

421
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,833
[ALBERT] He stopped
breathing. What a baby.

422
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,666
[SISTINE]
Huh?!

423
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,166
What? Professor?!

424
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[ALBERT]
Calm down.

425
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,833
It's only his
breathing that stopped.

426
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,916
He still has a faint pulse.

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,125
Fibel, administer CPR
until the ritual's ready.

428
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,708
[SISTINE gasps]
CPR?

429
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,000
[ALBERT] If you're an academy
student, you should know how.

430
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,125
Yeah, but truth is,

431
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,875
I've never actually
performed it on--

432
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,208
Shut up and do it!

433
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,291
You don't have
time to be scared!

434
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,791
[RAINER]
Ah, you're awake now!

435
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,916
Sorry 'bout the rough treatment.

436
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,458
But we needed to get you
here, no matter what it took.

437
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,083
For our sake, as siblings.
Right, sis?

438
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,750
Wait, Re=L?

439
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,583
Why on earth are you doing this?

440
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,125
Where's Professor Radars?

441
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,208
Oh, he won't be
coming to save you.

442
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,666
Re=L murdered him in cold blood.

443
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,875
[RUMIA gasps]

444
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,208
He's lying.

445
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,375
Re=L.

446
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
You would never do that!

447
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,208
Would you, Re=L?

448
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,625
Tell me the truth!

449
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,250
[RE=L]
Sorry.
