00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,666
No more, please, Professor.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,333
I'm so sore.

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,625
That's just because
it's your first time.

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,916
The more we do this,
the better you'll get.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I hope you're right.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,125
It feels like
I still have so much

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,291
to learn, though.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,875
[GLENN] Hey, being hard
on you is my job.

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,416
And I say you've already
improved since we started.

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,166
[GLENN] Make sure you
stay warm and supple.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,875
We could both get hurt
if you're too tight.

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,708
[SISTINE]
It smells like the Professor.

14
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,291
I have just one more
question, Professor.

15
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,583
Why are we doing
hand-to-hand combat?!

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm glad I finally
got you hot and bothered

17
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,500
enough to ask me that!

18
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,541
[chuckles]

19
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,041
"Special training."

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,958
I thought I'd learn new spells.

21
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,833
Or that maybe you would teach me
how to boost my magic powers.

22
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,583
But by training in this way,

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,916
we hone your sense of when to
attack or defend in magic duels.

24
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,583
[SISTINE] Or you're just
putting me through all this

25
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,250
because you think
I nag too much.

26
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,791
Of course, that's part of it.

27
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,083
I hate you!

28
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,791
Good! Channel it into your
hand-to-hand combat,

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,708
because once you've
got it going on there,

30
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,041
we're moving on to
military-grade magic.

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,958
Military magic?

32
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,416
Don't be scared.

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,666
I know it's intimidating,

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,666
but if you're serious
about protecting Rumia,

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,666
this magic is your best bet.

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,916
So buck up.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,791
I know military-anything
isn't exactly cuddly.

38
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,333
But I'm confident
you can master this.

39
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,000
There's no way its dark
side is getting to you.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,833
Well, at least I don't think so.

41
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
These things can still
be pretty tricky.

42
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,541
I wish to continue
my training with you!

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,958
Thank you, Professor!

44
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
[RUMIA] Oh, hey, good morning,
Professor Radars.

45

Yeah, yeah, hey.

46

Professor, you look like
death eating a cracker.

47
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,791
He's so worried
about you, Rumia,

48
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,416
he waits here every day
to check in.

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,875
Isn't that right?

50
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,500
No, it's not that.

51
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,125
You don't have
to worry, Professor.

52
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,833
Things are all back
to normal now.

53
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm just sitting here.

54
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,041
It's a coincidence,
nothing more.

What's your deal?!

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,083
I'm greeting you?

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,875
How the hell was
that a greeting?!

63
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,625
But Albert said
this what I should do

64
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,000
when reuniting with
an old comrade in arms.

65
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,708
So he's behind this?

00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
We had our differences,
but not like that!

That's the girl from
the magic competition.

00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,500
Does the uniform mean you're--

Oh, yeah, wait...

You're the new student here?

72
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,208
What's going on here?

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,916
The Imperial bigwigs
decided Rumia would be safest

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
with her own bodyguard.

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,000
The plan was to send in
a mage undercover

76
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,041
as a new transfer student.

77
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,958
But I never thought
they'd pick you!

78
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,041
You came here
just to protect me?

79
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,708
That's so sweet.

80
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,333
I hope we can
become close friends.

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,166
But I'm here to protect him.

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,166

body-guarding, not me!

pointing at on your left!

I've already scouted the
whole route multiple times.

359
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,041
Always prepared.

360
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,375
Nice work, Kash.

361
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,291
What about Professor Radars?

362
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,750
Don't worry, Ky.

363
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,208
I've run all the numbers.

364
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,958
The chances of him
walking by are near zero.

365
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,750
Oh, man. We're doing this!

366
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,083
All right, guys!

367
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,416
Ready to make this
the best field trip ever?

368
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,791
[ALL]
Mm!

369
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,500
[GLENN] Sorry, boys,
but your little plan won't work.

370
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
Uh, what?!

371
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,250
How long have you been there?

372
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,375
Morons!

373
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,541
If I were you guys,
I would--Go there.

374
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,750
And then here.

375
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,125
Then through that.

376
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,541
If I was going to sneak
into the girls' hotel room.

377
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,791
[ALL sigh]

378
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,000
You had us scared.

379
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,666
It's too bad you broke curfew.

380
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,833
Go back in.

381
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,875
There are times when
a man can't back down!

382
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,166
And this is one of them!

383
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,041
We've come too far
to give up now!

384
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,041
We're growing boys! With needs!

385
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,500
[GLENN] I see.
You're not about to back down.

386
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,250
And as your teacher,
I have no choice

387
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,458
but to remove you by force.

388
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,875
And we'll do whatever
it takes to stop you

389
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,500
so we can see boobs!

390
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,541
Let's blast him!

391
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,041
Bring it on, horndog!

392
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,083
[ALL yelling]

393
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,625
[SISTINE] Again, I'd like
to point out the boys

394
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,541
are huge idiots.

395
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,125
I've never seen Glenn
have so much fun.

396
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,458
Oh, yeah?

397
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,250
He's like this all
the time at school.

398
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,458
Well, he used to
be way gloomier.

399
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,875
That's why I thought it so
important I stay close by.

400
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,291
Y'know, to protect him.

401
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,708
Uh, you okay?

402
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,125
C'mon, girls!

403
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,208
You ready to play some cards?

404
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,916
Re=L. We saved a seat for you!

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,666
[RE=L] You really
want me to play cards?

406
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,791
Yeah!

407
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

408
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,625
I don't get it, but I'll play.

409
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,791
[WENDY giggles]
Great, you can shuffle.

410
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,875
I think she's finally
starting to fit in.

411
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,083
Yeah.

412
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,208
You're right.

413
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:54,333
[BOYS groaning]

414
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,500
[GLENN]
Ah! Ow, ow, ow!

415
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,000
Those guys don't know
how to pull their punches.

416
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,708
Well, here's to a good time.

417
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,708
[RUMIA laughs]

418
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,041
Oh, wow.

419
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,250
So pretty!

420
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,916
Re=L?

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
You gotta love that view.

422
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,625
Come on.

423
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,166
[RE=L] I'm not really
sure about much, but

424
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,708
I don't think
I'll ever get tired

425
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,416
of this view tonight.

426
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,708
That's great.

427
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,583
We're so happy we've
gotten to know you, Re=L.

428
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,000
Why's that?

429
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,458
'Cause we like you!

430
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,208
[RUMIA] You're not the new girl
anymore. You're our friend.

431
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,583
We're friends now?

432
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,791
[RUMIA giggling]

433
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,458
[SISTINE shrieks, laughs]
I'm gonna get you!

434
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,041
[RE=L]
Friends, huh?

435
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,500
I don't get it, but I
think I could like it.

436
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,583
[GIRLS laughing]

437
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,333
[GLENN] What did Albert
mean by "be careful"?

438
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
Re=L is a normal-ish girl.

439
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,708
[yawns]

440
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,333
[GLENN]
What are you doing out here?

441
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,291
I wanted to talk to you, Glenn.

442
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,833
Okay, let's go in.

443
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,250
[RE=L]
Hey.

444
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,666
Why did you leave?

445
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,625
You know why, but look.

446
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,958
I do feel guilty about up
and quiting the mage corp.

447
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,875
I didn't mean to
hurt you like that.

448
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,166
You realize that
without you around,

449
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,083
I don't have anything
to live for.

450
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,375
There's no point.

451
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,041
What?! Re=L, that's not
true and you know it!

452
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,791
You were just with
Rumia and white cat.

453
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,458
The whole damn class!

454
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,916
[RE=L]
But I don't get it.

455
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,333
Why don't you just
start over and become

456
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,041
a real student here?

457
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,791
Wash your hands of
the Imperial Mage Corps.

458
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,750
Listen!

459
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,125
I live for you, Glenn!

460
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,250
No, you don't!

461
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,416
If your brother was still here,

462
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,333
he'd want you living
your own life!

463
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,541
[RE=L]
I don't get it.

464
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,583
I don't understand anything
you're saying, Glenn!

465
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,583
Why do you think it's so wrong?!

466
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,916
Whoa, hey, hey!

467
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,916
--Calm down.
--No! Don't tell me that!

468
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,833
What's wrong with
protecting you?!

469
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,125
What's so wrong with
you staying by my side?!

470
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,250
I hate it!

471
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,166
Hey, Re=L...

472
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,125
Sistine. Rumia.

473
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,583
It's like they stole you
away from me, isn't it?

474
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,208
Why the hell would
you ever think that?

475
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,875
Shut up, Glenn, shut up!

476
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,541
This is all their fault!

477
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,833
I hate them!

478
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,666
--I hate them all!
--[GLENN] Re=L, wait a sec!

479
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,291
[GLENN] Things never
work out how I think.

480
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,500
[ELEANOR] I assure you,
our organization

481
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,958
is actively looking
into the matter.

482
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,291
[LAINEL]
Excellent.

483
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,125
We've already made
preparations for the Amplifier.

484
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,375
That's good to hear.

485
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,791
We are about to find
that which we both seek.

486
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:18,958
[chuckles]
