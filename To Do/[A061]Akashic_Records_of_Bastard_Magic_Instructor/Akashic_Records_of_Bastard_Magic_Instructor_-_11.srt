00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,708
[HALLEY] Just as the name
"Mage Corps Battle" implies,

2
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,708
one class will face
the other in a mock battle.

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,875
Your professor will
be your commander,

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,625
and you will obey his orders.

5
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,416
Every spell will be considered
military-grade magic,

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,333
so those of you
we judge to be "dead"

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,125
must leave the battlefield.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,041
The key to winning will
be how the commanders

9
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,333
deploy their forces
and the tactics employed

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,375
once combat begins.

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,291
You have three hours to fight.

12
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,166
If you can capture the
enemy base, your team wins.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,333
You can also win by defeating
the enemy commander.

14
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,291
[clapping]

15
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,500
Wow, Herbs, you took
more time to explain

16
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,666
this fake war than it
would to fight a real one.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,333
Good job. [chuckles]

18
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,208
This is a noble
site of learning

19
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,166
and you're using its students
to duel over a girl.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,208
Have you no shame, sir?

21
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,291
Mr. Leos!

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,708
You better win this.

23
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,416
It's high time someone
knocks the smirk

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,250
off Glenn Radars's face!

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,500
As you wish.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,833
Oh, Sistine.

27
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,208
Don't give me a moment's thought
when you're out there.

28
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,375
I want you to fight
as hard as you can.

29
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,750
[GIRLS gasp]

30
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,958
Because no matter what
happens on that field,

31
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,041
I will overcome it
and win your heart.

32
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,000
Aren't you sweet.

33
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,666
All right, useless maggots!

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,250

35
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,125

[STUDENTS] Why should we help
you get the girl and get rich?!

37
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,875
[SISTINE sighs]

38
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,833
So, be honest, now.

39
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,291
Are you really gonna marry
whomever wins this fight?

40
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,583
What? Marry?

41
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,791
Of course I'm not!

42
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,416
There're so many things
I wanna do in life

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,125
before I settle down!

44
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,500
They're the ones
getting carried away

45
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,666
with this magic duel thing.

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,458
[SISTINE] What if Professor
Radars does want to beat Leos,

47
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,166
so he can, well, y'know.

48
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:54,666
[GLENN (DREAM) yells]

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,041
[LEOS (DREAM) grunts]

[SISTINE yells]

52
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,458
No! Why am I even
thinking about that?

53
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,625
No way could I
marry the professor!

54
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,583
She's acting weird, turning red.

55
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,791
Sistine's irritable
and yelling at everyone,

56
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,333
panting and all sweaty.

57
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,708
She sick?

58
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,458
In a way, I suppose so.

59
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,833
We should probably
take her to a doctor.

60
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,041
Not sick-sick,
and certainly nothing

61
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,708
that a doctor can cure.

62
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,250
All right!

63
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,250
The Mage Corps Battle between
class two and class four

64
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,750
starts right now!

65
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,125
[gong rings]

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,291
Thunder sprites shock!

67
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,666
Pay heed, great wind!

68
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,583
White winter!

69
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,416
[yelling]

70
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,833
Those were direct
hits on Ken and Chris

71
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,083
from class two!

72
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,916
Both guys are
outta the game now!

73
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,666
So far it's been no
surprise that the Academy's

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,750
famed class four
has shown magic power

75
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,500
far beyond class two.

76
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,125
They've even begun executing
three-man cell formations,

77
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,541
a decisive tactic
in mage combat!

78
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,208
Now, let's talk
modern mage combat.

79
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,625
More precisely,
how to succeed at it.

80
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,458
Now pay attention
to what I draw.

81
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,083
Left front squad
is your attack team,

82
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,041
right front circle
is defensive cover,

83
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,208
and the rear?

84
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,708
A supportive mage
position which provides

85
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,375
combat supply needs
to both forward units.

86
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,875
So we call this simple
formation "the three-man cell,"

87
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,541
and it's the most
successful tactic

88
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,541
in modern mage combat.

89
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,458
But if each mage is
specialized and focused

90
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,625
on one role,
then that would give them

91
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,875
a huge advantage against
massed enemy attacks.

92
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,541
Is that what you're saying?

93
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,583
[GLENN]
Nailed it, Gibster.

94
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,875
And each mage's life depends
on his comrade's actions.

95
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,750
You can be the best
mage in the world,

96
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,583
but if you've got a big ego,
and suck at teamwork,

97
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,291
you'll just end up putting
everyone's life in danger.

98
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,958
When you're on a
mage's battlefield,

99
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,583
there's no room for heroes.

100
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,541
That's the real lesson today.

101
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,875
Radars is sending
twelve to the central plain,

102
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,625
eight to the forest, one uphill.

103
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,875
Okay.

104
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,125
I'm sure three-man cells
would be too difficult

105
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,791
for his class.

106
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,958
This appears to be turning
into a much easier campaign

107
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,666
than I thought it'd be.

108
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,833
[ARS]
Professor Leos is making moves!

109
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,750
He's deploying more
troops than class two

110
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,833
to each area!

111
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,041
How will Professor
Radars respond?

112
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,750
[PROFESSOR 11A]
This won't take long.

113
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,166
The combination of
Professor Leos's command skill

114
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,958
and the movements of
class four are impressive.

115
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,750
In comparison,
the command of class two

116
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,166
is disorganized.

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,958
I suppose Professor
Radars is not

118
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,958
well-versed in
mage combat tactics.

119
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,958
[HALLEY] Professor Kleitos

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,250
Each of his class four
students is more skilled

122
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,291
than their class
two counterparts.

123
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,708
It's easy to think
he's got this in the bag.

124
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,166
Until you remember
who he's up against.

No surprise.

You say on the battlefield,
there's no place for heroes.

137
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,875
So I take it you want us
to put our egos aside

138
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,750
and form the three-man cell?

139
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,166

Those are two-man cells?

150
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,000
A smart move.

151
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,541
The two-man cell
is not as powerful

152
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,958
as a three-man cell,

153
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,041
but they're easy to
teach in a short time,

154
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,791

00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,125
The enemy general,
the great Glenn Radars,

180
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,458
stands before you!

181
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,916
If you think you can
best me in single combat,

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,333
let's get it on!

183
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,250
[laughing]

184
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,083
Woohoo!

185
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,083
Oh, wow!

186
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,666
Commander Radars
just moved himself

187
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,166
to the front lines!

188
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,875
Hey!

189
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
C'mon, let's get him!

190
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,375
[STUDENT 11F] If we take down
their commander, we win!

191
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,708
Thunder sprites electric shock!

192
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,166
[GLENN laughing]

193
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,083
[STUDENTS yell]

194
00:08:59,166 --> 00:08:59,958
[GLENN]
Gotcha!

195
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,166
[STUDENTS yell]

196
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,583
What is this stuff?
No! Retreat! Retreat!

197
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,291
[STUDENTS yelling]

198
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,250
[GLENN laughs]

199
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
[GLENN]
I love guerrilla warfare!

200
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,291
It's gurrr-reat!

201
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,916
[laughing]

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,583
Hey, what are you doing
out here all by yourself?

203
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,666
Apparently watching
our illustrious "commander"

204
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,291
gloat over his dirty tricks.

205
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,416
Rukia, come in.

206
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,625
How do you read?

207
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,416
[GLENN]
Nothing that's not 18 and up.

208
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,500
[LEOS]
Professor Radars.

209
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,833
You set booby traps
before the battle started,

210
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,750
didn't you?

211
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,916
No way.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,541
I think your boys just
got caught in some

213
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,708
eco tourism hipster
obstacle course, that's all.

214
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,458
[laughing]

215
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,625
Thunder sprites, shock!

216
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,458
[STUDENT 11G yelling]

217
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,500
Who wants some?

218
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,750
[STUDENT 11G yells]

219
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,083
Leave us alone!

220
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,916
[SISTINE panting]

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,541
That jerk.

222
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,541
He wants to win so badly
he's using booby traps?

223
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,500
[GLENN laughing]

224
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,250
My fake fiancé is
the biggest idiot ever.

225
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,375
Um, Sistine...

226
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,583
All right!

227
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,541
Counter-attack with
everything you've got!

228
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,166
[STUDENTS cheer]

229
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,125
Now! Don't let
them break through!

230
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,833
Thunder sprites electric shock!

231
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,458
Wall of Great Wind!

232
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,250
[gong rings]

233
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,250
All right! Time!

234
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,916
No clear winner
after three hours.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,708
I declare the mock
mage battle a draw!

236
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
You're done!

237
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,333
I'm so beat.

238
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,583
All that for just a draw? C'mon!

239
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,250
[GLENN]
You all did great out there.

240
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,958
Holding your own
against a knob-job

241
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,500
like Leos ain't easy.

242
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,625
[STUDENTS chuckle]

243
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
But Professor,
what happens now?

244
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,291
Hold on.

245
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,416
How are we going
to know who Sistine's

246
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,750
going to marry meow?

247
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,166
Eh. No big.

248
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,500
[LEOS] What the hell was
that pathetic performance?!

249
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,000
If you had followed my orders,

250
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,833
we clearly would have won
and Sistine would be my wife.

251
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,875
That dude's a
selfish creeper, huh?

252
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,583
Hold on.

253
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,208
You're not being fair, here.

254
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,000
A good general never blames
his men for his failure.

255
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,791
I don't care!

256
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,083
Learn to keep your
opinions to yourself!

257
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,333
You know, we've both
had a long day.

258
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,291
Why don't we go--

259
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,750
[LEOS] Glenn Radars,
our duel remains unsettled.

260
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,083
I want a re-match.

261
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,125
And this time, I'm the one
issuing the challenge!

262
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,916
Really? You still haven't
given up on white cat?

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,416
Of course not.

264
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,375
The issue's not settled until
she gives up her studies,

265
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,458
and agrees to become my bride.

266
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,666
Hoo boy.

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,250
All right, fine.

268
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,791
I haven't given up on my dream
of marrying into money, either.

269
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
[SISTINE]
Knock it off! Both of you!

270
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,791
I'm sick of you
fighting over me!

271
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,791
It's so offensive!

272
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,291
Almost as offensive
as your dueling tactics!

273
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,833
They're just cowardly!

274
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,375
What makes you think
I'd marry someone

275
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,958
who doesn't fight honor--

276
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,208
Round two, tomorrow, let's go.

277
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,291
Meet in the Academy's back yard.

278
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,833
Mano-y-mano.

279
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
You sure about this?

280
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,875
If I win, I never have
to work again, ever.

281
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,000
Bet your pompous ass
I'm sure about thi--

282
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,375
So selfish.

283
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,416
I hate you.

284
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
[crying]

285
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
Sistine, wait!

286
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,083
Well! With that, we conclude
today's dramatic mage

287
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,958
combat war games.

288
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,208
Now, get lost!

289
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,083
[SISTINE]
What is wrong with him?

290
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,875
"Never having to work again"!

291
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,791
All he sees when he looks
at me is my family's money!

292
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,458
Sisti, calm down.

293
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,750
What?

294
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,916
We've gotten to know
him pretty well by now.

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,625
He cares about a lot more
than just making money.

296
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,708
Then why bother
challenging Leos to a duel?

297
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,125
I can't believe
you're still focusing

298
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,125
on that ridiculous fantasy.

299
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,541
[RUMIA] Well, maybe he
just got carried away.

300
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,500
Listen. I'm sure there's
a deeper reason for it.

301
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,875
He's too lazy to be
the duel fighting type.

302
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,875
You know, you could always
try talking to him.

303
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,750
C'mon, just ask him!

304
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,083
It can't hurt.

305
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,708
You can't just
hate Professor Radars

306
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,125
without knowing if it's
for the right reason.

307
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,750
Not to mention, maybe once
you do clear the air,

308
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,375
you guys can go back
to getting along

309
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,708
like you used to!

310
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,958
I guess.

311
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,000
Great!

312
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,708
You're right, thank you!

313
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,833
[RUMIA giggles]

314
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,666
[RUMIA] I need to talk
to the professor, too.

315
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,458
About the creepy feeling I got
when I was around Mr. Leos.

316
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,541
What was that all about, anyway?

317
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,500
[BERNARD] Well, boys,
this is a textbook case

318
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,125
if I've ever seen one.

319
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,375
[BERNARD] Another gruesome death
for an Angel's Dust addict.

320
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,458
You won't find a more
pathetic end than this.

321
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,083
I've heard the rumors
for a while now,

322
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,375
but I didn't expect
it to be this bad.

323
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,291
It is.

324
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,750
This makes five cases.

325
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,208
It's pretty clear to me:

326
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,208
This drug's spreading
a lot farther and faster

327
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,083
than we ever thought.

328
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,583
[ALBERT]
Angel's Dust.

329
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,125
What the hell's going on?

330
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,750
[LEOS]
Curse that Glenn Radars!

331
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,250
He is such a thorn in my side!

332
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,708
That's just the
kind of man he is.

333
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,875
But take solace in the
fact that he's nowhere near

334
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,250
your skills as a mage.

335
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,125
Glenn is the type,
who even if fated to lose

336
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,291
99 out of a hundred battles,

337
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,708
would pull out that one victory
in the very first round.

338
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,708
If I didn't know
you any better,

339
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,083
I'd say you admire Mr. Radars.

340
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,666
If I didn't, there'd be no
point to our roundabout methods.

341
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,916
Well, it doesn't matter
what you see in him.

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,333
He's still hardly
a match for me.

343
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,375
And after tomorrow,
Sistine will be all mine.

344
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,500
And once our
nuptials are official,

345
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,291
her family's fall will begin.

346
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,958
The Kleitos line
will gain control

347
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,458
over her detestable branch.

348
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,916
And my claim to sitting at
the head of the entire family

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,208
will at last be secure.

350
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,000
[JATICE laughs]

351
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,333
[GLENN sighs]

352
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,583
What a day.

353
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,208
[GLENN] At least it'll
be all over tomorrow.

354
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,458
I apologize, Leos.

355
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,958
I don't care how
much more you know

356
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,458
about magic than me.

357
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,041
I'm not losing to some
monocled douche

358
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
who does nothing but research.

359
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,166
It's too bad, though.

360
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,958
Whole experience leaves
such a bitter taste

361
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,416
in my mouth.

362
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,916
I'm well aware that I've
done wrong by white cat,

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,666
but it's all for the best.

364
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,291
Right, Sara?

365
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,375
[SISTINE]
It's not for the best!

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,708
[gasps] White cat?!

367
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,375
What's "you've done wrong
by white cat" mean?

368
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,583
Also, who's Sara?

369
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,916
I wanna know the truth.

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,041
Why'd you challenge
Leos to that duel?

371
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,458
Not this again.

372
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,291
I've told you over and over!

373
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,166
So I can marry into money!

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,750
If there's an opportunity
to never work

375
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,250
another day in my life,
I'm gonna take it.

376
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,000
Also, you remind me of Sara.

377
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,708
[GLENN]
A long, long time ago,

378
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,500
there lived a foolish young man.

379
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,125
This guy was obsessed with
becoming a Mage of Justice.

380
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,541
So he put everything
he had into his studies,

381
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,791
and one day, he became a mage
in the Imperial Army.

382
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,666
However...

383
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
He was still young and arrogant,

384
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,625
and he started chafing
at the limits of magic

385
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,125
and his blood reality.

386
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,750
It wasn't long before
he outright began

387
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,041
to hate the magic he once loved.

388
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,083
But through it all, he
never gave up his dream

389
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,000
of becoming a Mage of Justice.

390
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
That was because he
had someone very close

391
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,291
who supported him.

392
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,750
Hold on, is this story about--

393
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,958
Then, on one mission,

394
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,541
that arrogant young
mage failed that girl.

395
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,666
His arrogance became
foolishness and he let her die.

396
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,791
[SISTINE gasps]

397
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,291
[GLENN] Her death made
him more disenchanted

398
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,958
than ever before.

399
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,000
So, he gave up being
a Mage of Justice,

400
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,333
and became an
unemployed shut-in.

401
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,166
And that's the end.

402
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,833
That's sad.

403
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,041
[GLENN sighs]

404
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,166
To be honest,
I don't know why.

405
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,500
In that moment,
it felt like the right move.

406
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,125
Maybe I just wanna help you
solve the sky castle mystery.

407
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,750
And maybe if you make
that dream a reality,

408
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,291
I can finally atone
for losing Sara.

409
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,500
All I know for sure
is when that bastard said

410
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,250
you were wasting
your life studying it,

411
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,333
something inside me snapped.

412
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,000
Before I knew it,
I threw my glove.

413
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,791
No matter what it took,
in that moment,

414
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,625
I just wanted to hurt him.

415
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,333
And that's that.

416
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,750
So in the end,

417
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,250
you just got overly
emotional and lashed out.

418
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,958
[GLENN]
Yes. In a way.

419
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,250
Unbelievable.

420
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,750
You're like a toddler.

421
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,416
[GLENN]
Hey, I'm right here.

422
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,208
[SISTINE sighs]

423
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,625
You know...

424
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,791
I actually feel pretty good.

425
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,125
I mean, what Leos
said does hurt,

426
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,625
but it's the truth.

427
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,416
My grandfather was brilliant.

428
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,333
I'm nowhere near his ability.

429
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,583
The more I study magic,

430
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,416
the more I realize
that and struggle

431
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,291
with losing my love for it.

432
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,833
But now, I have someone.

433
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,500
Someone who supports my dream,

434
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,125
all because they really
want to see me succeed,

435
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,166
and that makes me happy.

436
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,500
So I'm going to work
harder than ever.

437
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,583
Those who accomplish big things

438
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,333
are those who never
give up on their dreams.

439
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,458
Thank you.

440
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,208
You're welcome.

441
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
[laughing]

442
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,375
Radars for the win!

443
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,291
After all, I wouldn't
be much of a professor

444
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,791
if I didn't support
the dreams of my students!

445
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,875
Hey, don't get too
full of yourself.

446
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,500
Really, now,
"marrying into money."

447
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,541
Couldn't you have
been more tactful?

448
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,583
No, I seriously would
like to do that one day.

449
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,833
Doesn't matter who!

450
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,291
Oh, just shut up!

451
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,958
[LEOS]
I have met many men,

452
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,541
but you are the most
cowardly, Glenn Radars.

453
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,541
You weave a moving
fable of dreams and failure

454
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,416
and then claim
it's your life story.

455
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,916
Anyone can tell
you're only looking

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,625
to garner her sympathy.

457
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,666
Leos?

458
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,333
Professor,
since my official work

459
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,791
involves researching
military-grade magic,

460
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,916
I have clearance for accessing
the Imperial Army's

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,958
most confidential files.

462
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,666
I know your whole story.

463
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,500
The truth of what
really happened to Sara.

464
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,916
Tell me.

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,666
Aren't you "Glenn the Fool"?

466
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,083
All right, buddy.

467
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,916
Shut the hell up and get out
before I make you.

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,375
Time catches up.

469
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,375
A man with your past
doesn't have the right

470
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,916
to live a normal life.

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,125
How can you be a professor

472
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,916
when your hands
are still dripping wet

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,750
with the blood of your old life?

474
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,000
[GLENN]
I said shut up.

475
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,791
I'm not warning you again.

476
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,083
If you say one more thing,

477
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,208
then tomorrow's duel
is gonna start early.

478
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,791
I'll settle this beef
right here and now.

479
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,833
Um, Professor?

480
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,875
There's a place and
a job far better suited

481
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,916
to your talents than "teacher."

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,416
Go home to it.

483
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,958
Back to your old spot in
the Imperial Mage Corps

484
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,416
Special Forces.

485
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,791
Number Zero.

486
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,791
"The Fool," Glenn Radars.

487
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,291
[GLENN]
There's three.

488
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,875
Told ya to shut up!

489
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,833
My, my, Radars.

490
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,500
You're so quick to fight.

491
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,500
The Army's
close-combat technique?

492
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,583
What the hell?

493
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,666
--[GLENN yelps]
--[SISTINE] Professor!

494
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,875
[GLENN grunts]

495
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,583
No way, those are tulpas!

496
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,083
Oh, no!

497
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,666
Tulpas are imaginary beings
manifested into our world.

498
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,500
The summoner enters
a trance and wills them

499
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,208
into existence through
the power of suggestion!

500
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,250
That's exactly right.

501
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,958
You've studied well, Sistine.

502
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,166
Impressive.

503
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,250
There is a secret
branch of alchemy.

504
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,458
one that's focused on the
creation of imaginary beings.

505
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,791
That is the tulpas' source!

506
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,625
And they're powerful, indeed.

507
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,791
Especially against you.

508
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,166
What do you think,
Professor Radars?

509
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,166
Instead of summoning
them with a spell,

510
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,791
I used my trance-powered
imagination!

511
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,666
Which means,
since they're not a product

512
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,625
of normal magic, Fool's World
won't work against them!

513
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,583
[GLENN yells]

514
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,625
Professor!

515
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,041
[GLENN grunts]

516
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,083
[LEOS]
What a letdown.

517
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,250
I was expecting you
to be much stronger.

518
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,208
Our duel's still
on for tomorrow.

519
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,875
It'd behoove you to
approach that clash

520
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,333
with more seriousness.

521
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,708
[SISTINE]
Wait!

522
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,916
Glenn's nothing but
a beaten dog now.

523
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,125
[SISTINE]
Stop it, Leos!

524
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,333
I want to talk, honey.

525
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,416
Let... go!

526
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,375
If you don't shut up,

527
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:49,125
I'll make it so one ever
sees your face again!

528
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,958
[SISTINE]
Leos.

529
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,875
Do you accept my proposal?

530
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,041
You don't have
the right to say no.

531
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,875
By the way, let's talk
about your best friend, Rumia.

532
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,833
You've been protecting her,
haven't you?

533
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,666
Her real name and her power.

534
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,000
How do you know that?

535
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,250
[LEOS]
Let's also talk Re=L Rayford.

536
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,125
I'm sure there are dozens
of underground groups

537
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,916
who'd just love to
prick her with needles

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,666
and turn her into a lab rat.

539
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,791
[SISTINE] This isn't
the boy I grew up with.

540
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,250
I shouldn't have to
threaten your friends

541
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,791
for you to say yes.

542
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,375
I mean, you've been in love
with me your whole life, right?

543
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,541
[SISTINE]
Professor, help me!

544
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,458
[SISTINE] The next morning,
Professor Radars

545
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,500
didn't show up for the duel.

546
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,875
In fact, he never returned
to the school again.
