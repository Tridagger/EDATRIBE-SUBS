it's for her own security,

be the third wave,

much, but she did tell me

to "present myself

00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,916
Next, we've got Lynn,
representing class two!

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,625
What transformation
is she going to attempt?

179
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,791
Now behold, phantasmagoria.

180
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,500
Enacted by myself.

181
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,166
This is for you, Professor!

182
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
[CROWD cheering]

183
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,791
[ARS]
An angel!

184
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,250
No doubt about it,
that's La Tilika,

185
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,625
like she jumped out of an icon
and straight into your hearts!

186
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,791
Ten, ten, ten, and ten!

187
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,833
A perfect score!
She's beaten Seta!

188
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,541
Looks like class two has
found their groove again!

189
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,625
[ARS] That's it for
the Granzia event!

190
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,875
Class two storms back
with a conditional spell

191
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,583
and claims the win
with fantastic teamwork!

192
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,375
Not too bad. Right, sir?

193
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,833
[ARS]
With that score, class two

194
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,750
has caught up with class one!

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,541
Incredibly,
this year's competition

196
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,166
is heading into the final
event in a dead heat!

197
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,708
Whoever wins these magic
duels is going to win it all!

198
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,708
[VELOS]
You haven't captured them yet?

199
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,208
No, Commander.

200
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,125
That magic instructor is aiding
the traitor's escape, sir.

201
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,041
[VELOS] You're using one
mage as your excuse?

202
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,583
You will find this
Rumia Tingel without fail.

203
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,458
And you will kill her.

204
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,833
[ARS] This duel's middle
bout has been intense,

205
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,750
with neither side ceding ground.

206
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,875
But wait!

207
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,458
The earth elemental
Gibul has summoned

208
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,250
has captured Kreiss,
and I'm not seeing

209
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,625
a counterspell!

210
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,375
I give up!

211
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,125
[ARS]
Kreiss admits defeat!

212
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,833
After Kash's loss
in the first round,

213
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,958
Gibul recovers with
a hard-fought victory,

214
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,708
and evens the score at one-one!

215
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,000
Nice! You just saved
our butts, Gibul!

216
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,708
[GIBUL]
Was there ever a doubt?

217
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,000
[ARS] And that brings us to
the final round, boys and girls!

218
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,500
Heinkel from class one
versus Sistine from class two,

219
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,541
with the match and the
overall title on the line!

220
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,375
It's about time I get to fight.

221
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,291
Hear the crowd?

222
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,416
I warmed them up.

223
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,416
Try not to waste that, Sistine.

224
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
Real motivational, Gibul.

225
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,291
Thanks for the support.

226
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,083
"If you win, we'll have a party.

227
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,041
I'll let you pig out on all the
food and drink you want."

228
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,833
Glenn told me to say that, too.

229
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,958
So, go on. Kick butt.

230
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,041
Yeah. You can count on me.

231
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,125
[SOLDIER 6B]
There they are!

232
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,833
[ARS]
Sistine is literally blown away

233
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,458
by Heinkel's
overwhelming Fire Wall!

234
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,458
[HALLEY]
Don't stop, Heinkel! Finish her!

235
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,500
Right.

236
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
[WENDY]
Hang in there, Sistine!

237
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,958
Think about the party!

238
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,916
We'll eat ourselves sick
on the professor's tab!

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Don't be idiots. Win this.

240
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,250
Trust us, Sisti.

241
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,750
[SISTINE]
Do they think I don't know?

242
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,916
I'm no idiot!

243
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
Keep them all at bay.

244
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,541
Wall of tempest!

245
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,250
Grant peace to them below!

246
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,541
[HEINKEL]
She trapped me with wind!

247
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,875
What spell did she cast?

248
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,458
It's called Storm Wall.

249
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,791
She's using an altered spell?
Thunder sprites--

250
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,791
Too slow!

251
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,291
Pay heed, great wind!

252
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,166
[HEINKEL yells]

253
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,750
[ARS]
And it's over!

254
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
Sistine's Gale Blow has
thrown Heinkel out of bounds,

255
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,708
making class two the victors!

256
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,125
With those final points,
Professor Radar's team

257
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,375
wins it all!

258
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,416
[GROUP cheering]

259
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,208
[SOLDIER 6A]
It's over.

260
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,000
[ARS] Without further ado,
let's move on

261
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,541
to the award ceremony.

262
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,291
The winning team,
year two class two,

263
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,875
will now receive a medal from
Her Majesty the queen,

264
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,125
Alicia the Seventh!

265
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,750
Give it up for
this year's champion!

266
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,166
Uh...

267
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,833
Albert Frazer? Re=L?

268
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,166
You made it.

269
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,291
[ALICIA]
Huh?

270
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,750
Every year, the instructor
of the class

271
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,208
winning the magic
competition earns

272
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,208
an extremely special honor.

273
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
A big shiny medal
presented directly

274
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,625
by Her Majesty
the queen herself.

275
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,458
It was my only way
to get close to you.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,750
[ALL gasp]

277
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,083
[SISTINE]
Professor! Rumia!

278
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,083
But how?

279
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,791
The Imperial Guard's
chasing you!

280
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,500
[GLENN] We swapped with
some friends along the way.

281
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,541
Just your basic Self Illusion.

282
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,833
I knew it!

283
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,250
That was Rumia!

284
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,333
Guards! Sieze them!

285
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,375
I don't think so.

286
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,583
[GUARDS yell]

287
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,708
That spell!

288
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,375
[GLENN]
Whoa. Isolation barrier.

289
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,375
Celica, you shouldn't have.

290
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,708
How dare you.

291
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,958
You're one to talk.

292
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,750
Commander Mutiny.

293
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,916
Sorry to interrupt
the party, Queen Alicia,

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,666
but your Imperial
Guard's been using

295
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,250
your good name to try
to kill an innocent girl.

296
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,166
Shut your mouth, vile traitor.

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,583
But luckily, you've had me
keeping Rumia safe.

298
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,416
And now the Guard's
outside this barrier.

299
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,625
So we're good!

300
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
Just order your men
to stop, Your Majesty.

301
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,375
And no one gets hurt.

302
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,833
That girl must die.

303
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,083
For what?

304
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,250
When this is over,

305
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I'll take responsibility
for my failure.

306
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,750
And end my own life.

307
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,250
But I've sworn a vow.

308
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,166
To ensure the queen's
survival above all else.

309
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,500
It is my duty,
and Her Majesty's,

310
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,625
to preserve her life
for the sake of the empire,

311
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,958
no matter the sacrifice!

312
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,458
There's no time, my queen.

313
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,458
You must think
about your people

314
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,000
and make a decision.

315
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,291
This is my command.

316
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,416
You will put that girl,
Rumia Tingel, to the sword.

317
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,833
What?!

318
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,958
Forgive my bluntness,

319
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,666
but I cannot allow
that child to exist.

320
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,583
I wish she never had.

321
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,583
I have never loved her,
not one single day.

322
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,875
The only thing I regret
is giving birth to her at all.

323
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,166
If that is not true, nothing is.

324
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,250
I don't get this!
What the hell are you saying?

325
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,833
I know those are lies!

326
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,958
[RUMIA]
So that's it?

327
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,541
Is that all you have
to say to me?

328
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,583
Yes.

329
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,666
[RUMIA gasps]

330
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,000
[VELOS]
Thank you.

331
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,000
For your quick judgment,
my queen.

332
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Celica! What is this?

333
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,666
[GLENN] Damn it!
This wasn't supposed to happen!

334
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,916
I thought getting here
was the answer!

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What am I freaking missing?

336
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,875
[ALICIA] I figured she
wouldn't accept me.

337
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,791
Why would she
view me as her mother?

338
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,625
[GLENN] The queen doesn't
have to justify an execution.

339
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,041
Even if she thought
it was necessary

340
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,583
to protect the crown,
why would she say those lies?

341
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,916
What was the point?

342
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,833
[GLENN] Unless she wanted
me to catch the lie?

343
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,166
[CELICA]
I can't help you.

344
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,750
And I can't say anything more,
do you understand?

345
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,000
Whatever happens next
is up to you and you alone.

346
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,125
Could it be...?

347
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,458
[GLENN]
Your Majesty.

348
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,750
That's some necklace.

349
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,583
I couldn't help but notice it!

350
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,625
Why, thank you.

351
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,333
It's new, yet very
significant to me.

352
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,916
With a rock like that, I'm sure.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,250
Wow!

354
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,458
But with all those karats,
it's gotta be heavy!

355
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,625
Why don't you take it off
and rest your shoulders?

356
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,083
Certainly not.

357
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,208
That's the last thing
I would want to do.

358
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,791
You don't say.

359
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,500
[VELOS]
Not another word, sorcerer.

360
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,541
[GLENN]
Rumia.

361
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,583
You can save the
tears for another time.

362
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,416
Your mom really does love you.

363
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,958
Get back!

364
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,333
[GLENN yells]

365
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,375
Professor!

366
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,583
[CELICA gasps]

367
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,625
Die!

368
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,208
No!

369
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,083
[VELOS]
My queen! What have you done?

370
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,541
[GLENN yells]

371
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,291
[GLENN]
A conditional-cursed necklace.

372
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,833
I love being right.

373
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,375
[GLENN]
Remove it and the wearer dies.

374
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,500
Time limit passes, wearer dies.

375
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,416
If anyone near it
explains the curse,

376
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,666
you guessed it, deadzo!

377
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,458
A classic ploy that's
been so overused

378
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,166
it's almost lame!

379
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,666
The only way to lift the
curse...

380
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,625
[GLENN]
Rumia had to die. Am I right?

381
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,833
I knew you'd solve it. There.

382
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,458
And did you know I was
gonna get a sword stuck

383
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,666
through my hand too?

384
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,833
Not cool.

385
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,333
Wait. But why didn't
the curse activate?

386
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,916
[VELOS]
The Fool Arcana?

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,291
What?

388
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,208
You mean you used that spell
to seal off the magic

389
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,625
that was in the necklace?

390
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,333
I had no idea.

391
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,666
[GLENN chuckles]

392
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,208
Now. Your Grace.

393
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,875
You can stop with the lies.

394
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,583
Huh? Lies?

395
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,083
[GLENN] She took a
big risk talking to us.

396
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,708
If she'd slipped up the curse
would've killed her.

397
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,416
Those lies were like
a riddle, a secret message,

398
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,208
helping me figure out the truth.

399
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,375
[ALICIA]
I'm so sorry, Ermiana.

400
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,458
I've done it again.
I've hurt you.

401
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,750
My queen?

402
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,583
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad you're safe.

403
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,375
[crying]

404
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,708
It's okay, Mom.

405
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,083
[BOTH crying]

406
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,750
[GUARDS gasp]

407
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,833
[SOLDIER 6F]
Her Majesty is safe!

408
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,625
The truth is that our superiors
assigned us two missions.

409
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,708
First, to monitor
the Imperial Guard,

410
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,541
which has lately shown
extremist tendencies.

411
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,708
Second, to the investigate
the backgrounds

412
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,166
of those closest to the queen.

413
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,583
Eleanor Chalet,

414
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,541
heretic mage with the
Researchers of Divine Wisdom.

415
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,083
You tried to orchestrate
the former princess's demise.

416
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
My question's why.

417
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,791
It seems the empire
isn't completely made up

418
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,208
of fools, after all.

419
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
Akashic Records, that's why.

420
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,583
Let's just say this.

421
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,333
That's what the princess is for.

422
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,458
You won't escape!

423
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,583
[GLENN]
Her handmaid, huh? Holy hell.

424
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,166
[ALBERT] Just proves how deep
the Researchers of Divine Wisdom

425
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,083
have burrowed into
the empire's core.

426
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,333
So you think there's
bound to be others, right?

427
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,791
[ALBERT]
We need to get back immediately

428
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,166
and plan countermeasures.

429
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
You be careful, too.

430
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,916
[GLENN chuckles]

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
Thanks for the
help today, Albert.

432
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,875
You're a real gem.

433
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,208
You too, Re=L.

434
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,625
Glenn. Next time
we'll settle things.

435
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,250
Right.

436
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,458
That a threat?!

437
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,333
[RUMIA]
Professor?

438
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,333
[GLENN]
How'd it go?

439
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,541
[CELICA]
Sure you can't stay?

440
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,708
[ALICIA]
Yes. But all is well.

441
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,375
I feel she was able to get
everything off her chest.

442
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,083
[ALICIA] I truly can't
thank you enough, Celica.

443
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,375
With you and
your apprentice here,

444
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,333
I know this is
the best place for her.

445
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,833
Please keep her safe.
And happy.

446
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,875
Sure.

447
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,375
That's what Glenn does best.

448
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,625
[RUMIA]
You were right.

449
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,875
I feel so much better
after talking to her.

450
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,375
That's yet another
thing I owe you for.

451
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,750
All I did was run around
and get stabbed.

452
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,500
Professor, how did
you figure it out?

453
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,291
That she was lying, I mean.

454
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,125
Three years ago...

455
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,708
Back when you were
abducted by those mages,

456
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,583
the queen asked me for help.

457
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
[ALICIA]
Please, I'm begging you, Glenn.

458
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,666
I know I shouldn't be
asking you to risk your life

459
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,458
on a rescue that
may be impossible.

460
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,833
But I... I just have to!

461
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,375
Please, Glenn,
she's everything to me!

462
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,250
The tears she cried,
you just can't fake.

463
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,750
I see. I wish I had known that.

464
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,083
So... You keep making
good on your promise.

465
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,625
I wasn't sure you
remembered it was me.

466
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,625
[GLENN]
There's still some bad guys.

467
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,583
So you can be as frightened
of me as you want,

468
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,458
but if you'll just stop crying,
then I can try to save you.

469
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,916
[RUMIA]
You said you were on my side.

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,583
Before you left, you promised
you always would be.

471
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,916
And you're still helping me,
some three years later.

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,208
A promise is
a promise, after all.

473
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,166
You know... All things
considered, I'm pretty lucky.

474
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,791
Both you and my mother
have saved me.

475
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,166
It all evens out,
'cause your class saved me.

476
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,166
Now I won the prize money
and three months salary

477
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,250
from Halbert, or whatever.

478
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,750
They deserve to
have a little party.

479
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,000
[STUDENTS]
Professor! Where've you been?

480
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,333
[SISTINE]
Hey!

481
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,375
There you guys are.
You're super late, you know!

482
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,791
[laughs]

483
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,666
Sisti, are you okay?

484
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,708
Yeah, she just had
too much brandy cake.

485
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,916
I think we all did, actually.

486
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
Hi, Professor.

487
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,041
Were you out helping Rumia?

488
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,291
You're always
taking care of her.

489
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,125
You're sweet when
you aren't a jerk!

490
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,500
[laughing]

491
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,250
Okay, white cat, that's enough.

492
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,541
I'm not catnip!

493
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,041
They just blew
the reward money

494
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,750
and three months salary
on one stupid dinner?!

495
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,583
[GLENN]
Okay, class, line up!

496
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,666
I've got an Extinction Ray
for every one of you ingrates!
