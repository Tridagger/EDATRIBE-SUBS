1
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,750
[GLENN] "'What are you?'
the demon asked.

2
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,875
'What drives you
to such lengths?

3
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:33,291
I can't fathom why you'd
risk and endure so much.'

4
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,208
Without hesitation,
the mage answered,

5
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,166
'That's simple, Demon Lord.

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,875
There are things
I wish to protect.'"

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,083
"It is this conviction and
understanding of my duties

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,666
that causes infinite power
to spring from my depths.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,833
And lets me rise again.

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,875
Now prepare yourself,
Demon Lord,

11
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,541
for I shall defeat you.

12
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,375
and in doing so,
all shall be protected."

13
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,250
[GLENN] "The Demon Lord
screamed as he perished

14
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,375
beneath the mighty crackle
of the mage's holy lightning.

15
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,750
Their long battle had
finally come to an end."

16
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,041
[GLENN] I wanted to
be a mage of justice.

17
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,083
[hawk calls]

18
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,166
[SISTINE]
This is the city of Fejite,

19
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,375
located in the southern
region of the Alzano Empire.

20
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,208
This community was
born and developed

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,291
alongside the Alzano
Imperial Magic Academy.

22
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,208
It's just another theory.

23
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,583
They'll never know the real--

24
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,625
[RUMIA gasps]

25
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,375
[MALE TOWNSPERSON 1B]
Ow!

26
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,500
[RUMIA]
Are you all right?

27
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,625
[TOWNSPERSON 1B]
Mmm...

28
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,250
[RUMIA]
May I tend to that?

29
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,875
[RUMIA] The angels'
blessings be with you.

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,708
[SISTINE] The reason the
Alzano Empire is known

31
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,541
as a magical power in the world

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,125
is the Alzano Imperial
Magic Academy,

33
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,583
established over 400 years
after the Empire's founding.

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,583
Oh!

35
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,416
Seems you academy students
live up to the tales.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,875
I'm impressed.

37
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,041
Actually, sir,

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,958
using our magic outside
the academy walls

39
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,000
is forbidden.

40
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
So can we keep this a secret?

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,166
[TOWNSPERSON 1B]
My lips are sealed.

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,458
Thank you.

43
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,666
[SISTINE]
Rumia!

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,375
[RUMIA]
Well, good day to you, sir.

45
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,916
Good luck in your studies.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm rooting for you.

47
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,333
[RUMIA]
Thanks.

48
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,833
[SISTINE] The academy
boasts a proud history.

49
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,791
It's hailed as the most
prominent school of its kind--

50
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,666
a training ground where
students can learn

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,041
the most advanced magical arts.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,416
The most famous
mages in the world

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,291
are graduates from this
legendary institution.

54
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,458
You know, Rumia,

55
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,708
I told you you could
go on without me.

56
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
[RUMIA]
How could I?

57
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm just a freeloading nobody
with so much to repay.

58
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,541
I could never leave
"Lady Sistine" alone

59
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,583
on the streets.

60
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,625
[SISTINE gasps]

61
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know if that's
some kind of joke,

62
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,416
but it's not funny.

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,041
You're part of the family now,
so feel proud.

64
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,458
Sorry, Sisti. I'll try.

65
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,416
Yeah, you better!

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,583
[BOTH giggle]

67
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,083
[RUMIA]
It's pretty unusual, though.

68
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,833
You hardly ever forget anything.

69
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,750
Were you too busy
thinking about him?

70
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,166
[SISTINE]
Maybe.

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,375
Why did Professor Huey
suddenly quit like that?

72
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,791
[RUMIA]
Who knows.

73
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,000
But word is we have a new
substitute starting today.

74
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,500
[GLENN panting]

75
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
Yeah, I heard. Aw, man.

76
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,000
I just hope it's someone as
passionate as Professor Huey.

77
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,625
[GLENN yelling]

78
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,541
Hey!

79
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,875
Out of the way!

80
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,458
Move, you brats!

81
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,833
[SISTINE, RUMIA scream]

82
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,208
[SISTINE]
Pay heed, great wind!

83
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,083
[GLENN yelling]

84
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
[RUMIA, SISTINE]
Huh?

85
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
[GLENN yelling]

86
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,916
Think that was a little much?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,583
Yeah, probably.

88
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,041
I just panicked.

89
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,375
What do we do now?

90
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,083
That was unexpected.

91
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,375
You ladies okay?

92
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,375
He's late.

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,875
[GLENN]
Are you hurt?

94
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,750
[SISTINE]
No.

95
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,208
But shouldn't we ask you that?

96
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,333
These crowded streets can
get pretty dangerous, girls.

97
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,916
You should watch
where you're walking.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,208
[SISTINE] You were the one
charging like a madman!

99
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,250
Sisti, don't.

100
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,583
You hit him hard
with that magic.

101
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,125
Just be glad he's okay.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,583
[RUMIA]
Go on. Apologize.

103
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,791
[SISTINE]
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,291
[RUMIA]
I'm sorry, too, sir.

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,791
We should have
been more careful.

106
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,583
[GLENN]
Ha!

107
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,625
[laughing]

108
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,208
Well, I'm glad you agree!

109
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,458
[SISTINE, RUMIA]
Uh...?

110
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,541
Now that we've established
it's not my fault

111
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,791
in any way possible,

112
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,625
and your reckless walking
was 100% to blame,

113
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,333
let's talk consequences.

114
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
Normally they'd be severe.

115
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,000
But I can make an exception if--

116
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,041
[GLENN]
Nice.

117
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,916
You definitely seem familiar.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,875
Have you and I...?

119
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,875
[RUMIA]
Uh...?

120
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,708
Hey!

121
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,041
What is wrong with you, man?

122
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,166
[GLENN yelling]

123
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,750
That's some nerve touching
a lady without permission!

124
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,916
He's scum!

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,458
I'm telling you, he's scum!

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,250
Late on his very first day?

127
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,041
I knew he was a bad choice!

128
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,250
I don't care if it
is just temporary!

129
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,583
We never should have let
a man of unknown origins

130
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,208
instruct at this academy!

131
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,750
ou've made yourself
clear, Halley.

132
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,916
But he came highly recommended
by Professor Celica Arfonia.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,875
[HALLEY growls]

134
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,583
[SISTINE]
What's going on?

135
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,250
This class period is more
than halfway over now!

136
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,041
Maybe something
happened to him.

137
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,583
[WENDY]
A student would be one thing.

138
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,625
But a teacher at this
academy not showing up

139
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,125
to his own lecture?

140
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,208
It's unheard of!

141
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,666
Well, maybe he's
some kind of a bigshot.

142
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,750
I think a big bastard's
more like it.

143
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,791
[SISTINE] I'm gonna lodge
a complaint on behalf

144
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,375
of the entire student body!

145
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,583
--[door opens]
--[STUDENTS gasp]

146
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,791
[GLENN]
Hello, kiddoes. Sorry I'm late.

147
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,333
Well, it's about time, sir!

148
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,166
Do you have any idea what it
means to be a teacher at this--

149
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,000
[GLENN]
I'm not that guy from earlier.

150
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,666
[SISTINE]
How else would you know?

151
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,041
[GLENN]
I'm just that strong a mage.

152
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,541
Give me a break.

153
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,291
[GLENN sighs]
I'm Glenn Radars,

154
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,416
your new substitute
teacher extraordinaire.

155
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,416
I'll be helping you all with
your studies for the next month.

156
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,375
Teaching is a noble profession,

157
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,500
blah blah blah,
you're welcome in advance.

158
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,916
Let's see, my special
skills and hobbies...

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,291
There's no time
for introductions!

160
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,083
Can you please just
start the class?

161
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,583
[GLENN sighs]
Okay, fine.

162
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,916
I'll teach you.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,416
I guess that is my job.

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,625
[RICK]
Surely you can't complain

165
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,583
if a professor recommended him.

166
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,291
I can if he's lousy!

167
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,750
This says his magic capacity
and memory are average,

168
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,375
and he's equally "okay"
in all schools of magic.

169
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,166
It seems his mage classification
is only Trede rank.

170
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,500
What?!

171
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,541
You're letting a run-of-the-mill
Trede teach here?!

172
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,958
At this academy, Quatrede
is the very minimum,

173
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,458
and we even have Quinde
and Sede orders on staff!

174
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,666
Hold on...

175
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,083
Are you sure he even
knows how to instruct

176
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,583
students of this caliber?

177
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,333
Or will he declare
self-study and sip tea?

178
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,208
[GLENN] Okay. Today's class
will be self-study period.

179
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,625
'Cause I'm tired.

180
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,833
--[STUDENTS chattering]
--[GLENN snoring]

181
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,041
[SISTINE]
Unacceptable!

182
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,625
[GLENN yells]

183
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,541
Oh, and did I mention he doesn't
have a teaching license?

184
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,708
[HALLEY gasps]

185
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,791
Still...

186
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,208
He does come recommended
by a professor,

187
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,625
so he can't be that bad.

188
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm not hearing this!

189
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,083
I mean, he must have talent.

190
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,541
He was admitted to our
school at age eleven.

191
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,916
But on the other hand,

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
this says he left the
academy when he was only 15.

193
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,250
And went where?

194
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,416
I have no idea. The next
four years are unknown.

195
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,791
Obviously, that means he
just wasted all that time

196
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,875
doing nothing!

197
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,375
You see?

198
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,041
This boy is clearly a foolish
mage who can't be trusted!

199
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,875
I'm not so sure about that.

200
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,333
Headmaster, please!

201
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,750
Don't count on that witch
for something this crucial!

202
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,125
[CELICA]
A witch, huh?

203
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,125
That's not very polite.

204
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,041
[HALLEY gasps]

205
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,833
Oh, hello, Celica.

206
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,291
When did you get here?!

207
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,333
[CELICA] That'd be helpful
to know, wouldn't it?

208
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,875
But let's focus on
what matters most.

209
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,416
[HALLEY yells]

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,041
[CELICA] You can call me names
all day long if you desire.

211
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,375
I don't really care.

212
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,583
But I will not tolerate
you speaking ill of him.

213
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,791
Take it back.

214
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,166
[HALLEY yelling]

215
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,291
Sorry, professor!

216
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,125
[CELICA]
Well...

217
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,375
I finally managed
to get him into class.

218
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,666
[RICK]
Is that right?

219
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,750
[CELICA] I want you to know
I truly am sorry about this.

220
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,291
[RICK sighs] We've thrust a
young mage with no achievements

221
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,333
to speak of into a teaching
role at one of our

222
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,708
most hallowed academies.

223
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,041
Halley's reaction
is only natural.

224
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,916
[CELICA]
I'll take full responsibility.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
If he fails to perform
in this job,

226
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,666
you can consider
it my failure as well.

227
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,375
[RICK]
You'd really go that far?

228
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,708
Stake your reputation on him?

229
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,875
May I ask what he means to you?

230
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,083
[CELICA chuckles]
You may.

231
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,416
But you'll be disappointed.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,833
There is no special connection.

233
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,041
Not really.

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,166
It's rather simple.

235
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,541
I just want him
to live a full life.

236
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,666
It still hurts.

237
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,208
[STUDENTS] I've never seen
anyone so lifeless before.

238
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,416
[GLENN sighs]

239
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,458
His handwriting's too sloppy.

240
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,166
Sistine whacked him hard
with her iron fist of rage,

241
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,291
but it still doesn't seem like
he's taking this seriously.

242
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,708
[SISTINE growls]

243
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,958
[GLENN] So then you do that,
and then, other stuff.

244
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,708
This guy is incoherent.

245
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,375
I can sort of follow.

246
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,208
[STUDENTS]
His eyes look dead inside.

247
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,583
Excuse me. I have a question.

248
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,791
Sure, why not.

249
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,833
Um, it's about the runic spells

250
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,625
you introduced in the last
section, Professor Radars.

251
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,291
I'm not seeing a
translation for them

252
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,541
into our standard language.

253
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,583
[GLENN sighs]

254
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,166
[GLENN]
Uh... Let's see.

255
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,125
Translation, translation.

256
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,166
[chuckles]
Yeah, I don't either!

257
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,041
That sucks.

258
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,541
Just look it up yourself, okay?

259
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,916
All right, that does it!

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,750
You think that's an
appropriate response

261
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,791
to Lynn's perfectly
good question?

262
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,500
I don't know!

263
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,666
Should I make something up?
Would that be better?

264
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,583
If a teacher can't answer
a student's question,

265
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,208
it's his job to look it up

266
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,000
and have it ready for
the following class.

267
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,000
That's education 101!

268
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,416
Okay.

269
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,625
But if she looks it up herself
she won't have to wait,

270
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,500
now, will she?

271
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait time is not the issue!

272
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,333
Easy, Sisti.

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,250
Oh, now I get it.

274
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,416
Do you guys not know how
to use a runic dictionary?

275
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,625
Is that the deal?

276
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,166
Because it's really
not so--[bell ringing]

277
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,500
That's it for this period.

278
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,625
Later, nerds!

279
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,333
Wait, you haven't
even given us our--

280
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,500
Told you he was a bastard.

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,083
What's with that
so-called teacher?

282
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,208
He's so unmotivated!

283
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,416
Now, now.

284
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,791
[SISTINE] And he's supervising
our next alchemy lab, too,

285
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,666
isn't he?

286
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,958
[RUMIA]
Think so.

287
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,125
[SISTINE] I swear,
he's gonna give me ulcers.

288
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,541
You gonna be okay, Sisti?

289
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,708
I don't know.

290
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,083
I think I need some healing.

291
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,583
Huh? Whoa!

292
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,375
[RUMIA gasps]

293
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,708
[sighs] Nothing like a
little snuggling with you

294
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,166
to make me feel better.

295
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,291
Your skin's so silky
smooth and pretty.

296
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
Oh, knock it off, Sisti.

297
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,750
Come on!

298
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,875
Hey!

299
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,208
Sisti, please!

300
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,916
You're embarrassing me!

301
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wow. You just
keep on developing.

302
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,500
These are impressive.

303
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,250
Am I not getting the same
nutrients into mine, or what?

304
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,208
No fair!

305
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,583
This isn't healing me at all.

306
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,083
It's just making me jealous!

307
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,708
[GLENN]
Waiting is such a pain!

308
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,208
Come on!

309
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,500
Why do you girls have to change
for an alchemy lab anyway?

310
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,625
[RUMIA gasps]

311
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,375
[SISTINE]
Get out!

312
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,625
No! I won't!

313
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,166
At least not yet!

314
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,166
First I must speak about this
super-cliché turn of events!

315
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,541
Why should a man panic
and avert his eyes?

316
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,666
Are we not all just
fellow humans?

317
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,833
Getting my face smashed
in merely for glimpsing

318
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,416
semi-nude women that
are right in front of me

319
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,916
is hardly a just trade!

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,708
Would that not
make me the victim?

321
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,625
[GIRLS growl]

322
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,750
[GLENN]
So I'll make it count.

323
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,916
And burn this image
into my brain!

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,125
[yells]

325
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,291
I can't believe it.

326
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,708
How could he cancel
the whole alchemy lab?

327
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,666
I'm here to actually
learn and get better!

328
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,833
[RUMIA] I understand
how you feel, Sisti,

329
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,916
I really do.

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,208
But let's enjoy lunch, okay?

331
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,458
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,833
It's just...

333
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,291
Your promise to your
grandfather, right?

334
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,875
If I'm ever gonna
solve the mystery

335
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,958
of Melgalius's Sky Castle,

336
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,291
there's so much more about
magic I need to learn.

337
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,375
Every day I don't improve
feels like a lost opportunity.

338
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,541
[GLENN]
Hey, girls.

339
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,458
Ah, that's nice.

340
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,583
Oh, come on!

341
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,625
So good.

342
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,916
Professor Radars,

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,125
you're attacking that food
with some real passion.

344
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,750
So I guess you like to eat, huh?

345
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,625
Sure.

346
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,916
Food's one of my few pleasures,

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,041
especially when I
don't have to cook!

348
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,416
[laughs]

349
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Wow.

350
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,458
Today's stir-fry does
look pretty tasty.

351
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,666
[GLENN]
You're not wrong.

352
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,333
These kilua beans are
in season right now.

353
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,833
Oh, I didn't know.

354
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,833
I'll have to try some
at our next meal.

355
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,250
[GLENN]
Why wait? Try mine.

356
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,041
'Kay.

357
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,333
If you don't mind.

358
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,708
Mmm! So much flavor!

359
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,291
[GLENN]
I know, right?

360
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,583
And what about you, punchy?

361
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,708
You sure that's enough food?

362
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,625
It's hardly a substitute
professor's place

363
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,875
to tell me what I should
and should not be eating.

364
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,708
[GLENN] Gotta eat to grow.
Just sayin'.

365
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,458
It's none of your business!

366
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,708
But the truth is I eat
light so I won't be sleepy

367
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,083
during my afternoon classes.

368
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,208
Though of course,

369
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,583
you're going to be
teaching them today,

370
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,083
so I guess it wouldn't
matter if I went

371
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,666
into a full food coma.

372
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,333
That's a roundabout way to talk.

373
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,541
If there's something
on your mind,

374
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,208
why don't you
come out and say it?

375
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,125
Okay, Mr. Sub.

376
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,333
I'll tell you exactly
what I think.

377
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,458
First of all--

378
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,291
It's okay. I know
what you were thinking.

379
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,833
You wanted to try it, too.

380
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,375
Naughty glutton.

381
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,791
I did not, you jerk!

382
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,000
I was going to say--

383
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,291
But you should share too.

384
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,458
[SISTINE] What are you doing?
That's mine!

385
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,000
Stop ruining my life!

386
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,833
Sisti...

387
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,583
How can you call
yourself a teacher?

388
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,708
Well...

389
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,333
It's only temporary.

390
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,041
[GLENN] You want me to sub
at the magic academy?

391
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,916
[CELICA] Just till we
find a real professor.

392
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,833
Would you do it?

393
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,208
Sorry, no way.

394
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,250
No way?

395
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,458
Why not, Glenn?

396
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,875
[GLENN]
It's a bad idea.

397
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,666
I'm not qualified to
teach magic to a carpet.

398
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,833
Well, it's true.

399
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,541
You don't have a
teacher's license, but...

400
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,458
I'm busy working this
whole cool image thing

401
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,875
and you're killing it
with real world

402
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,291
sub teacher crap?

403
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
Did I fail to mention
you're not allowed to refuse?

404
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,250
Oh? What if I do?

405
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,125
Then I'll have to
strike you with lightning.

406
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,541
Or would you prefer
to be burned in a fire?

407
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,666
Or frozen in ice?

408
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,500
That could be fun.

409
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,625
[chuckles]

410
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,500
[GLENN] Please keep supporting
me! I don't wanna have a job!

411
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,583
Return to the
cycle of providence,

412
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,875
five elements to elements,

413
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,375
and sever the links
between images and truths!

414
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,416
[CELICA]
Next time I won't miss!

415
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,000
[GLENN screams]

416
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,875
[GLENN]
Well, on to afternoon classes.

417
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,958
[KASH]
Again?

418
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,458
Okay, next class.

419
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,958
[GEEVIL]
Even his writing's lazy.

420
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,875
[GLENN]
And the third.

421
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,083
[STUDENTS sigh]

422
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,958
[SISTINE] I really, really
didn't wanna say this...

423
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,333
[GLENN]
Then please don't.

424
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,958
I belong to the noble
Fibel family of mages.

425
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,125
A family with significant
influence on this academy,

426
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,791
and if I tell my father
how you're behaving

427
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,500
in this classroom,
I could easily have you fired!

428
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,458
What? Whoa, really?

429
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,208
I don't wanna resort to
that kind of intervention.

430
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,791
But unless you
clean up your act,

431
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,708
I'm afraid I'll have no choice!

432
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,250
Please tell your father
I'm counting on his complaint.

433
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,083
[SISTINE gasps]

434
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,125
Aw, man, what a huge relief!

435
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,958
I can't quit, but if I'm
fired it's out of my hands!

436
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,791
I never wanted
to work here anyway.

437
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,541
I knew this would be a disaster!

438
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,000
[RUMIA]
Sisti, don't!

439
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,041
[GLENN]
Huh?

440
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,291
[GLENN]
Ouch.

441
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,208
She just challenged
him to a magic duel?!

442
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,916
Well this day just got better.

443
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,000
You accept?

444
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,750
Or are you scared you can't win?

445
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,916
A duel?

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,375
That a joke?

447
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,125
Am I smiling, punk?

448
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,833
[STUDENTS chattering]

449
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,250
You can't do this, Sisti!

450
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,291
Quick! Apologize!
It's not too late!

451
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,875
Just pick up your glove!

452
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,791
What is it you want from me?

453
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,416
[SISTINE] If I win, you have to
correct your terrible attitude

454
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,041
and actually teach.

455
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
[GLENN]
You do understand if I win,

456
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,041
you'll have to accept my demand
no matter what it might be?

457
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,125
I know how duels work.

458
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
[GLENN]
You sure you wanna risk it?

459
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:02,916
Jeez.

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
What's he going to demand?

461
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,833
He makes it sound like
it's something awful.

462
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,291
[SISTINE] This education
is everything to me.

463
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,458
I can't just sit and
watch someone like you

464
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,166
sleep at the front of class

465
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,208
and make a mockery
of out of our academy

466
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,333
and what I've dedicated
my life to learn!

467
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,250
You have no respect for magic!

468
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,208
[sighs]

469
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,541
Unbelievable.

470
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,125
I didn't even think
there was anyone left

471
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,166
who still lived by those
silly old customs

472
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,041
let alone some teenage girl.

473
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,041
But okay.

474
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,000
If that's what you want,
then let's do it.

475
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,708
[RUMIA]
Huh?

476
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,791
He accepted it?

477
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,875
That's crazy!

478
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,041
A duel between a
professor and a student?

479
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,708
I've never heard of that before!

480
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,458
This is so fun it feels wrong.

481
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,375
[GLENN]
Here's the deal.

482
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,000
Though I think a brat like you
could use some punishment,

483
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,125
I don't want to injure you.

484
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,750
So the only spell
we'll use in this battle

485
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,375
will be Shock Bolt, and all
others will be prohibited.

486
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,625
You accept?

487
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,041
[SISTINE] The challenged
mage reserves the right

488
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,625
to decide the rules of the duel.

489
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,583
So I have no argument.

490
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,291
Who do you think
is gonna win this?

491
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,916
I have to go with the professor.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,166
Though he's gonna
be in real trouble

493
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,166
if he underestimates Sistine.

494
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,208
It's weird he picked Shock Bolt.

495
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,291
Well, he said he wants
to go easy on her.

496
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,708
Not sure that's it.

497
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,375
[WENDY]
What do you mean?

498
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,333
It's true that Shock Bolt
is relatively simple magic.

499
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,125
It's one of the first
spells we learn to cast.

500
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,916
A defensive move
summoning electricity

501
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,708
to paralyze your opponent.

502
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,916
The chant is only three lines.

503
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,333
"Thunder sprites, pay heed,

504
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,041
and strike with
your electric shock."

505
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,750
Straightforward, right?

506
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,291
But in actual combat,

507
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,500
the winner's always the mage
with enough mastery of the spell

508
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,166
to condense it into one line
and be the first to cast.

509
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,041
He's confident he can
cast quicker than she can?

510
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,333
Guess so.

511
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,541
[WENDY] I heard Professor
Arfonia backed him.

512
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,958
He must be strong.

513
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,166
Don't look so tense.

514
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,625
I'm sure you're nervous,
but I'm not here to hurt you.

515
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,416
If you wanna practice on me,
you can take the first shot.

516
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,541
[SISTINE]
Come on.

517
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,250
I am Sistine Fibel.

518
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,500
As long as I accept
the mantle of that name,

519
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,291
I can't allow this man
to carry on with impunity!

520
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,750
Even if he is the more
powerful spell-caster,

521
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:38,083
even if I'm forced to eat dirt,
I can't back down!

522
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,500
That's my pride as a mage!

523
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,583
Here I go!

524
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,791
Thunder sprites, shock!

525
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,916
[GLENN screaming]

526
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,083
[STUDENTS gasp]

527
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,541
Right in the face.

528
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,875
What happened?
Did I misunderstand the rules?

529
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,666
[GLENN]
Wow, you're not bad.

530
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,166
Whatever. I'll give you
the first round.

531
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,333
It's fine since we're
playing best of three!

532
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,416
[SISTINE]
Are we?

533
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,291
Okay, here I go!
It's time for round two!

534
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,791
Thunder sprites,
take heed, and--

535
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:30,916
[SISTINE]
Thunder sprites, shock!

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,416
[GLENN screams]

537
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,958
Ah, that was rough.

538
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,500
You're way more
decent than I expected.

539
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,416
Guess I've been goofing
off too much early.

540
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, since
it's best of five.

541
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,125
Five?

542
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,583
But you just said it
was best of three!

543
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,708
Well, fine. Here goes!

544
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,458
Whoa! What is that thing?

545
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,625
Heh! I can't believe
you fell for that! Thunder--

546
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,625
[SISTINE]
Thunder sprites, shock.

547
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,375
[GLENN screams]

548
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,875
Wait a second,
Professor Radars.

549
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,833
Can you not cast Shock Bolt
with a single chanting phrase?

550
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,666
What are you
talking about, punchy?

551
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,791
Shortening a chant is heresy
and a grave insult to magic!

552
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,291
I say that because I'm a man of
principle, not 'cause I can't!

553
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,916
[STUDENTS]
He totally can't.

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,333
I'm not even gonna touch that,

555
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,125
but I've obviously
won this duel!

556
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,750
So as I demanded,
starting tomorrow

557
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,000
you're going to teach us--

558
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,083
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,833
Did I agree to that?

560
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,958
That doesn't ring a bell.
You must be confused.

561
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,291
But more importantly,
your spell-casting

562
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,458
isn't half bad!

563
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,791
And since it's my first day,

564
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll cut you some slack
and say you were so close

565
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,041
it was almost a draw!

566
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,416
[laughing]

567
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,166
So, now what?

568
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,916
But it won't be close next time!

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,875
See ya!

570
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:34,916
[yelps]

571
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,708
[SISTINE]
This guy is hopeless.
