1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,666
So have you finally
made up your mind, then?

2
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,958
No, I have not!

3
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,000
[USHIMATSU]
If you're staying,

4
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,625
your first job
is waiting for you,

5
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,958
so let's hurry up
and get you to work.

6
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,625
[motor running]

7
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,166
Good, right on time.

8
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,541
It's Chupakabura Manju.

9
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,833
With a brand new special design
to welcome our new queen.

10
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,041
I ordered one hundred
boxes to start with,

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,000
but, depending on
how fast they sell,

12
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,125
we might need to have
them whip up a few more.

13
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,041
Okay, sir, one thousand boxes.

14
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,250
That's the whole order.

15
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,083
Can I get you to sign
right here, please?

16
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,500
A thousand?

17
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,708
Why are you so surprised?

18
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,083
That's what you
told me to order!

19
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,583
I said a thousand manju!

20
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,875
There are ten in a box!

21
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,458
That means one hundred boxes!

22
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,458
What's wrong with you?

23
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,500
But you can't
even make a profit

24
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,666
off of such a tiny order!

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,375
Another problem is
it's a food order

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,625
and we can't return it.

27
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,041
So what do we do now?

28
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,291
Queen.

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,041
Oh, no.

30
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,791
[USHIMATSU] Your first trial
is going to be selling

31
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,125
every last one of these.

32
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,375
Wha--?!

33
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,916
Hang on just a second, here!

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,250
I need to tell you something.

35
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,041
I had a really good talk
with your wife last night,

36
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,083
and the truth is--

37
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,583
I came here without
knowing it was

38
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,250
a one-year contract, so I
wasn't prepared to move here--

39
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,916
[USHIMATSU groaning]

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,458
Oh! My aching head!

41
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,708
Here's what we're gonna do.

42
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,208
For now, your contract will last

43
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,708
until the manju
expiration date: one week.

44
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,791
One week's a good
compromise, right?

45
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,625
Yeah.

46
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,875
I guess I could do that.

47
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,291
Then, it's settled!

48
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,625
I promise to forget all about
that year-long contract

49
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,333
you signed if you can
sell all thousand boxes

50
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,958
in one week!

51
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,125
You've got a deal!

52
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,541
I'm gonna hold you to it!

53
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,083
And as soon as
the last one's sold,

54
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
I am on a train out of here!

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,291
[YOSHINO]
That was a dumb move.

56
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,541
I don't think I can sell
a thousand boxes,

57
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,833
at least not in a week.

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,375
Oh, sure you can!

59
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,250
I bet you'll be able to
get rid of the entire batch

60
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,875
of them in no time at all!

61
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,708
And really, if they don't sell,
they don't sell, you know?

62
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,041
Not the end of the world!

63
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,375
Kinda is.

64
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,375
Well, of course we'd
like to sell the manju.

65
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,791
And for your sake,
I hope we can.

66
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,958
Though it does seem unlikely
to get it done in a week.

67
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,666
[YOSHINO]
You know...

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,458
I'd rather not put my
faith in "unlikely" events,

69
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,708
so maybe let's come
up with a strategy--

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,916
May I ask who you are?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
Don't you know? She told me
she was the manager here.

72
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,125
Haven't heard anything
'bout a manager.

73
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,833
Although, do I know
you from somewhere?

74
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,625
Oh! Oden Detective!

75
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,500
You're Maki from
<i>The Oden Detective</i> !

76
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625
A detective?

77
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,541
No, it was a
really cool TV movie!

78
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,416
<i>The Leisurely Case Files</i>
<i>of The Oden Detective</i> !

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You're an actor?!

80
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,916
She wasn't the
central character;

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
she played more
of a supporting role,

82
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,666
so most people don't know her,
but she's famous locally!

83
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,958
She'll always be "Maki from
<i>The Oden Detective</i> " here!

84
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,708
Whoa, then she'd be
way better at this job

85
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,250
than I could ever hope to be!

86
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,958
Please take my place as queen!

87
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,375
Nope, no thank you.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,583
[MAKI]
These are not cute.

89
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,708
They're terrifying.

90
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,583
Seriously, what's a
Chupakabura, anyway?

91
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,250
Hmm... Your basic
mysterious monster.

92
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,583
Well, you cannot sell
ten thousand monster treats

93
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,416
in only a week.

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,416
But we have to try!

95
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,250
Like, what if we
convinced the store

96
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,000
at the train station
and the souvenir shops

97
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,000
to carry them?

98
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,208
Um, do you know
how many tourists

99
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,625
we get here in a year?

100
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,083
[YOSHINO]
Like, a hundred thousand?

101
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,416
Thirty thousand.

102
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,916
Not a lot.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,416
Yeah, just a little
over five hundred a week.

104
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,750
Well, if we could
get each of them

105
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,791
to buy two boxes...

106
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,375
That would not
be normal at all.

107
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,083
Well, good, "normal" is boring!

108
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,416
[YOSHINO]
If tourists don't come through,

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,083
we'll get the residents
to buy them!

110
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,625
How many people live here?

111
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,958
[SHIORI]
Fifty thousand.

112
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,708
[YOSHINO] So if one
in fifty people buys one...

113
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,583
[SHIORI] That's a lot
to hope for, Yoshi.

114
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
Maybe it is, but I've gotta
believe I can sell all of them

115
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,416
and get back to Tokyo!

116
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,416
Here we go.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,875
Our very first store.

118
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,416
[door opens]

119
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh! It's the new queen!

120
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,666
You didn't go back
to Tokyo, I see.

121
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,958
Takamizawa.

122
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,833
He's one of the
local bus drivers.

123
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,166
Hello, sir.

124
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,833
--We met yesterday.
--[TAKAMIZAWA] We sure did.

125
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,166
Which lunch combo?
Ginger pork or curry?

126
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Hi, Erika!

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,208
We didn't come for lunch;

128
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,166
we just need to
ask you for a favor.

129
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,208
[YOSHINO gasps]

130
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,875
One Fortune Teller Combo!

131
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:52,958
[SHIORI]
Huh?

132
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,500
[ANGELICA] Your human
strokes are very unlucky.

133
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,666
However, your heaven
strokes are good.

134
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,666
You will be blessed
in your golden years.

135
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,541
Yeah, I know.
So I've been told.

136
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,041
But how can I sell a thousand
boxes of these things?

137
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,583
That's impossible.

138
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,083
No, I have seen.

139
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,916
Wait, you've seen what?

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,166
Many things.

141
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,083
[YOSHINO]
Could you be more specific?

142
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,583
North by northwest.

143
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,833
Don't even worry about it;

144
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,541
her fortunes are
always like that.

145
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,583
We're heading in the
right direction, yeah?

146
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,000
[SHIORI]
You think it's for real?

147
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,583
Oh, it's a
Japanese sweets shop!

148
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,041
I bet they'll help us!

149
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,250
[SHIORI]
I doubt it.

150
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,708
They don't get along
with the tourism board,

151
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,041
and they're always
fighting with Mr. Kadota.

152
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,416
You old jackass.

153
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,291
Shut up, you stupid hag.

154
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,750
Great.

155
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,416
But you know what?
I bet Rii- <i>chan</i> might know

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,250
something about the Chupakabura.

157
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,750
Who's this "Rii- <i>chan</i> "?

158
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,000
A childhood friend.

159
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,375
She's just a little shy,
sometimes, that's all.

160
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,416
[SHIORI]
You there, Rii- <i>chan</i> ?

161
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,208
Oh! Hi there! Could we--

162
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,333
[SHIORI]
Wait a second, Rii- <i>chan</i> !

163
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,458
Open up!

164
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,833
So, listen.

165
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,458
Shiori tells me you might
know about the Chupakabura.

166
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,750
Can you explain it?

167
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,833
U.M.A.

168
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,833
U.M.A.?

169
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,333
An Unidentified
Mysterious Animal.

170
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,041
"Chupa" is the
Spanish word for "suck"

171
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,208
and "cabra" means "goat,"

172
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,208
so it literally means a creature

173
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,791
that sucks the blood of goats.

174
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,833
The earliest sighting was
in 1995 in Puerto Rico.

175
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,208
There have also been
sightings in Chile, Mexico,

176
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,083
and America,
however, no sightings

177
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,291
have ever been
reported in Japan.

178
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,208
The sighting here in Manoyama
was most likely a weasel.

179
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,708
I knew you'd
be able to help us!

180
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,791
Thank you!

181
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,166
[SHIORI]
She knows a ton about the occult

182
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,375
and things like that!

183
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,666
Pretty handy, huh?

184
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,208
Yeah, for sure.

185
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,916
I think we should really
push the occult theme

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,291
in the town's marketing!

187
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,375
And we need to create
a whole new website!

188
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,583
Uhh...

189
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know about
a new website

190
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,750
when the best I can do
is post photos to a blog.

191
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,083
[YOSHINO]
That's okay, who should I ask?

192
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,625
Well, we really
need to find a local

193
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,250
web designer to do it.

194
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,041
I remember there was
a woman that moved here

195
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,375
from Tokyo last year.

196
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,375
I'm pretty sure she
started up some sort of

197
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,166
web-related business, so...

198
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,458
Ah! Here it is!

199
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,625
Yes!

200
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,625
[YOSHINO]
Excuse me!

201
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
Hello? We're here with
the tourism board!

202
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,708
Maybe she's not home.

203
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,333
[SANAE] It's been six months
since I arrived in Manoyama.

204
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,666
The long winter has at
last given way to spring.

205
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,166
It's finally time to
fully enjoy the benefits

206
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
of a natural lifestyle here.

207
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,541
Today, some locals
gave me some vegetables,

208
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,250
so I used them to try out
this new radish dish.

209
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,458
With the breath of spring,

210
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,208
all the little bugs
have woken up hungry.

211
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,541
So perhaps the thing I should do
with all this bounty is share.

212
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:53,750
Hm?

213
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,541
[SANAE screaming]

214
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,166
[gasping]

215
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,416
--[SANAE screams]
--[SHIORI, YOSHINO gasp]

216
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,250
--[SANAE gasps]
--[YOSHINO] Are you okay?

217
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,500
Hold on, who are you?

218
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,458
[YOSHINO]
Are you hurt?

219
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,291
Tell me!

220
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,375
[YOSHINO]
Your headphones!

221
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,958
So sorry to barge in!

222
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,500
We're with the tourism board
and we really need your help.

223
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,541
[SANAE]
The tourism board?

224
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,166
What was that screaming about?

225
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,333
[SANAE]
Oh. That?

226
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,875
It was nothing, really.

227
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,916
I'm just fine.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
I kicked the corner
of my armoire.

229
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,833
It's lovely living
in the country!

230
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,833
There aren't any armoires
in the city, you know!

231
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,750
Well, that might not be true,
but I never kicked them there!

232
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,208
I swear, only out here in
the country, for some reason.

233
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,250
I mean, am I right?

234
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,083
[SANAE, YOSHINO scream]

235
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,458
[BOTH whimpering]

236
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,541
[SANAE] It's a bug,
it's a bug, it's a bug!

237
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,541
[whimpering]

238
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,333
[SANAE]
I see.

239
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,083
I guess it's not easy
being the queen, is it?

240
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,916
Yeah, it's not what
I thought it would be.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,416
Do you think you
can build a website

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,625
in two days?

243
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,125
I'm afraid we don't
have much of a budget

244
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,208
to speak of.

245
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Aww.

246
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,250
Sure, I'll do it.

247
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,833
After all,
it's for the town, right?

248
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625
Suppose I should help
them out if I'm able.

249
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,958
Thank you so much!

250
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,208
So, what kind of site
did you have in mind?

251
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,666
It's gotta go "boom,"
like, have major impact,

252
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,875
and it has to have an air
of the occult to it somehow

253
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,916
and also be fancy and cute.

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,375
And we need an online store!

255
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,625
There's no way I could
build an entire online store

256
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,750
for you in two days;
I would need at least a month

257
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,041
to set up the system.

258
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,583
A whole month, really?

259
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,375
Man, I was convinced
we could've sold

260
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,250
a thousand boxes online.

261
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,583
Maybe you should
try to think of it

262
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,833
the other way around.

263
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,125
[YOSHINO]
Which other way?

264
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
These days, you can
easily buy delicious food

265
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,708
from all over the country
just while sitting at home.

266
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,833
So if you emphasize the fact
that you can only get these

267
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,291
by coming here in person,
they'll seem more rare

268
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,666
and worth getting.

269
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
Exclusive.

270
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,083
But do you actually believe
that could work? Truly?

271
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,541
Oh, don't worry,
you just leave all that to me.

272
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,958
[screams]

273
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,750
Can we get out of here?

274
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,583
[SANAE]
Hmm...

275
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,958
This place is perfect.

276
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,833
I'll be able to get
tons of work done.

277
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,750
Here you are.

278
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,083
[SANAE]
Oh, thank you.

279
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,541
All right, why don't
we start by talking

280
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,666
some more about
the design you want.

281
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,583
Now, considering
the major time crunch,

282
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,041
we'll keep it as
simple as possible

283
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,416
while still maintaining
that bold feel.

284
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,375
You mentioned looking for a kind
of fancy occult vibe, right?

285
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,750
So how 'bout "Fancyccult"?

286
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,833
Yeah! Fancyccult!

287
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,666
How lovely!

288
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,083
Are you kidding me?

289
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,208
It'd be quite challenging
to come up with content

290
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
for a strictly occult
theme, so...

291
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
we'll push the subculture,
but keep it cute.

292
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,125
But I need something
for the copy. Hmm...

293
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,875
"A little treat from the
depths of the vampire forest."

294
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Yes! That's it!

295
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,791
And there's lots of
wild garlic on the hill

296
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,000
behind our house!

297
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,541
So now we need to
look at text and photos.

298
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,500
Think you ladies could
help me out with that?

299
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,125
What's going on with you?

300
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,500
Nothing's going on.

301
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,333
That girl that just came by
is the new queen, right?

302
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,791
I wonder what that old man
is plotting over there.

303
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,500
Don't you get roped into
anything stupid, you hear?

304
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,708
[SHIORI] It looks abandoned
in these pictures.

305
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,041
Makes it feel occult-y.

306
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,916
You mean Fancyccult.

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We can touch up the photos.
They'll be okay.

308
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,500
Isn't that deceptive?

309
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,625
No more so than
putting on makeup.

310
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,250
What are your thoughts
about the text?

311
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,083
Oh! Yes, here,
I underlined the parts

312
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,625
that I thought might be useful.

313
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,750
Thanks, that's great.

314
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
All right,
I'll get started, then.

315
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, thanks again, so much!

316
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,333
'Kay!

317
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess we can go work on
getting the stand ready.

318
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,041
Let's go!

319
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,375
You coming, Maki?

320
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,708
Why ask me?

321
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,416
[SHIORI]
Hmm... This goes--

322
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,000
[gasps]

323
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's see.

324
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,541
You're really
good at this, Maki!

325
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,500
I've done it on
my part-time jobs.

326
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,375
Oh, like to prepare for a role?

327
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,500
Don't I wish.

328
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,125
No, it's to pay my bills.

329
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,000
When you're an actor,
you have to take side jobs

330
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,416
in order to survive.

331
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,833
[YOSHINO grunts]

332
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,708
Hang in there, my queen.

333
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,625
The entire next year of my life
is riding on this.

334
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,125
If I wanna go home, I have
got to make this thing work!

335
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,375
Yoshino.

336
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,833
You really can't wait
to get out of here, huh?

337
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,000
[MAKI]
So...

338
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,583
What are you gonna
do when you get back?

339
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
What's waiting for
you there in Tokyo?

340
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,500
Uh, what's waiting there?

341
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,083
Everything's waiting there!

342
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,625
Tokyo is everything!

343
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,041
[YOSHINO] Maybe you should
take a little break

344
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,750
and get some sleep.
What do ya think?

345
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,833
I'm fine.

346
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,125
When I lived in Tokyo,

347
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
I would work through
the night on the regular.

348
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
Can you tell me something?

349
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,125
Why'd you leave Tokyo
to come live in this place?

350
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,166
[SANAE]
Hmm...

351
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,416
I kind of got tired
of the rat race.

352
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,916
Plus, nowadays,

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,666
there's no reason to force
yourself to work in a big city.

354
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,666
[YOSHINO]
But... I mean,

355
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,916
isn't Tokyo literally the
economic center of the country?

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,458
Yeah, that's a fact.

357
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,916
So there are more
opportunities there

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,166
than anywhere else!

359
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,458
What kind of
opportunities do you mean?

360
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, there's...
anything and everything.

361
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:02,958
[SANAE]
What happened?

362
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,333
Couldn't find work?

363
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,458
Thirty-two applications
and not even one job offer.

364
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,791
Well, don't let it get to you.

365
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,958
You don't need Tokyo.
With the right mindset,

366
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,916
I believe you can
find work anywhere.

367
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,791
Just my two cents!

368
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,791
[YOSHINO sighs]

369
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,791
Wonder if she's right.

370
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
It's done.

371
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,958
[YOSHINO]
Fancyccult!

372
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,666
[SHIORI]
Oh, it's so adorable!

373
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,458
All that's left is
to post some links to it

374
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,833
on some other sites.

375
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,541
Okay, girls.
Now you're ready to go!

376
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
[YOSHINO]
How'd we not sell a single one?

377
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,583
Well, it is only
the first day.

378
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,375
Your journey has just begun!

379
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
I think it's more than that.

380
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,500
We're not getting nearly
enough traffic on the website.

381
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,500
[SANAE]
Huh?

382
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,291
[SANAE]
What?

383
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
Seventy-six? Aww.

384
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,666
I wonder if Fancyccult
is too avant-garde

385
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,291
and freaky for people.

386
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,833
[YOSHINO] What I've been
wondering is how the heck

387
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,125
Mr. Kadota was planning
to sell all these manju

388
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,750
in the first place.

389
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,333
Apparently, his original plan
was to have that actress,

390
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,625
Yoshino Tsubaki, sell them
to people directly.

391
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,500
Yes, we can use that!

392
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,625
You can count me out!

393
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,458
My acting days
are long behind me.

394
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,583
[YOSHINO]
What? Me?

395
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,916
It makes perfect sense!

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
And you'll do great, Yoshi!

397
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,416
I guess, but I'm wondering...

398
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,708
It's the "beautiful queen"
part that I question.

399
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,208
Don't be silly.

400
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
I was totally planning to
touch up your photo, anyway.

401
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not really
what I meant, though.

402
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,875
Is it more like you're
feeling weird and awkward

403
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,708
about being referred
to as "beautiful"?

404
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, okay, we'll
embrace that, then.

405
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,958
Little question mark
next to the word.

406
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,583
How about "relatively pretty"?

407
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,791
Thanks for that.

408
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
Just put, like, a little
asterisk right there

409
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,541
next to "beautiful."

410
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,958
Sure, great, but what's
the alternate word then?

411
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,375
[YOSHINO] "Buy them directly
from the hand of the beautiful

412
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,208
(based strictly on
individual opinion)

413
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,333
queen of our land."

414
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,416
I mean, at least
that's kind of funny.

415
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Or, we could change
the whole concept.

416
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,041
Just lay it all out there.

417
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,916
"I ordered way too
many of these things.

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,458
Please help us out
and buy some."

419
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,958
--What do you think?
--Great.

420
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,541
Doesn't that make it
sound like it's all my fault?

421
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,916
[YOSHINO]
Yay!

422
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
How did it go?

423
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,125
Sold three boxes.

424
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,833
Met Shiori's whole family.

425
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,250
So it wasn't a total loss.

426
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Yeah, my family
felt bad for us,

427
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
so they came out to buy a few.

428
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,875
That's all we sold?

429
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
Even after the queen
apologized for everything?

430
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
Well, she may
be the queen,

431
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,958
but nobody actually
knows who she is.

432
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,208
And I don't think
anyone is reading this.

433
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,375
Just for the record,

434
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,166
everything you say is negative!

435
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,208
I'm only doing this because
I want to help Manoyama.

436
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,208
Not for your own
self-satisfaction?

437
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,708
[SANAE gasps]

438
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,125
What is it you're
trying to say?

439
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,708
Come on, you guys,
we shouldn't fight each other.

440
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,250
I'm sorry.

441
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,625
Said too much.

442
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,083
Anyway, I tend to agree
that it's hard to connect

443
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,625
with words alone.

444
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,208
Hey, Maki...

445
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,541
You look like you have an idea.
Have you come up with something?

446
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,166
Yeah. I think a video
would have more impact.

447
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,375
A video.

448
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,208
[YOSHINO]
Sorry to drop in so late!

449
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,125
Evening there, my queen.

450
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,666
I heard you sold three
whole boxes today. Ha!

451
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,583
Just you wait.
It's not over yet!

452
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,375
[YOSHINO]
We got the costume!

453
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,958
[SANAE]
And the camera?

454
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,875
[SHIORI] Well, Rii- <i>chan</i> 's
got a really good one.

455
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,166
I texted her,
but she hasn't replied.

456
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,625
Guess she's not interested.

457
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,708
She's here!

458
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,541
I was able to sneak out.

You're a detective?

00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,291
I said forget it!

463
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,375
Maki, thanks for doing this!

464
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,750
I did this kinda
thing part-time

465
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,666
on a superhero show.

466
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,833
You're right, you know.

467
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,083
Tokyo has everything,
and I did it all.

468
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,625
And anyway, making this
video was my idea.

Great attention
to detail, Rii- <i>chan</i> !

to be moist to be correct.

And who're you, exactly?

After all that work,
we still only sold one box.

fair amount of plays.

all watch it again.

There's no need to be neurotic.

is "best enjoyed by,"

don't be so neurotic.

529
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,333
These are actually really good.

530
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,291
All the ingredients come
from right here in Manoyama!

531
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,625
Hey, you're right.
They really are tasty.

532
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,541
I could eat ten more.

533
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
Really? At this hour?

534
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,916
You know, this is the
most fun I've had in a while.

535
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,125
Yeah, me too.

536
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,250
To be honest, you were the
first people I'd talked to

537
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,666
in, like, two weeks.

538
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,125
I was turning into a hermit.

539
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,125
I was even considering
moving back to Tokyo.

540
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,958
Hey! Why don't we all go
cherry blossom viewing?

541
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,416
It'll make for
a great wrap party.

542
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,458
[YOSHINO]
That sounds great!

543
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,916
The blossoms at
Cherry Blossom Pond

544
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,958
are supposed to be
gorgeous, right?

545
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,208
Hey, hold on.

546
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,875
Does that mean you're
not going back to Tokyo?

547
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,250
Because the cherry
blossoms won't even be

548
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,875
in full bloom for
another two weeks yet.

549
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,041
Oh.

550
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,916
Well, guess I'll stay till we
can see them together!

551
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,416
[SANDAL] In order to
save the desolate town,

552
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,041
our new queen has
freed the Sacred Sword.

553
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,500
Next time:
"The Cry of the Mandrake."
