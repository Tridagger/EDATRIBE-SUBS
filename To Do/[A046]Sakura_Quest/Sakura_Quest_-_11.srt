adjust to life in Manoyama,

171
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,541
so, she left.

00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,625
Did you know that, Shiori?

174
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,291
[SHIORI] Mm-hm. Rii- <i>chan</i> has
talked to me about it before.

175
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,416
I guess her mom decided
she didn't want to become

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,458
an oribe, after all.

177
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,250
C'mon! Lunch time!

[CHITOSE]
Huh?

179
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,166
[SHIORI]
So, her dad didn't end up

180
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,416
taking over the confectionary.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,541
He followed his wife instead,
leaving Manoyama,

182
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,791
and he got a normal,
white-collar job.

183
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,916
But then, shortly after
Rii- <i>chan</i> was born,

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,250
they got a divorce, anyway.

185
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,416
Man. That means from
Chitose's perspective,

186
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
her son was tricked,
lured away,

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,125
and left brokenhearted
by an outsider.

188
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,625
What happened to her dad?

189
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,416
[SHIORI] He was appointed
to a position overseas

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,833
right after the divorce,
so it was decided that

191
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,166
living with Granny Chitose made
the most sense for Rii- <i>chan</i> .

Hey. You okay?

You've been acting different

Not since yesterday.
I'm a weird girl.

I've always been a weird girl.

But that isn't-- Okay, yes,
you might be a little weird,

but all of us are,
in different ways,

248
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,833
and that's part of what
makes us who we are!

00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,416
You mentioned the library
and reading about the dragon.

[RIRIKO gasps]

252
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,375
[YOSHINO]
Hm?

253
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,375
[RIRIKO] There's another
interpretation of the tale

254
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,583
of the dragon. A completely
different interpretation

255
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,833
that everyone here in Manoyama
seems to have forgotten.

256
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,875
The dragons were
extremely wise.

257
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,541
The villagers threw
a party in order

258
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,250
to welcome the dragon girl.

259
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,750
They were hopeful and excited
to learn from her great wisdom.

260
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,416
[RIRIKO]
They thought that a fun,

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
lively dance would encourage the
dragon and bring her closer.

262
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,166
But, when the dragon girl saw
them dancing around the fire,

263
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,666
she got scared, and she ran
away right then and there.

264
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,541
By the time they realized
their mistake, it was too late.

265
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,750
The dragon girl ended up dying
alone, deep in a dark cave.

266
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,416
And unfortunately,
at that point,

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,291
the humans forever lost their
chance to learn from her.

268
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,916
"We created a song to
comfort the poor dragon.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
In her solitude, and we sing it
for her with our whole hearts."

270
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,250
Nobody knows the song anymore.

271
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,250
The Manoyama Dance remained,

272
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,958
but the song was
forgotten in no time.

273
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,708
The point is, Manoyama was
originally a place that

274
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,833
accepted and welcomed outsiders.

275
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,000
Rii- <i>chan</i> . That's amazing.

00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,000
This is really
quite a discovery!

00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,625
And it's so perfect
for our tour, so...

278
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,583
...let's go and tell
everyone about it!

279
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,875
Come on, you know nobody's
really interested

280
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,083
in that kind of story.

281
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,958
Then, we'll have to
make them interested!

282
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
Before the firefly tour,
we'll convince them we're

283
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,500
putting on a little
comedy show

284
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,708
and then hit them with the
dragon story! Good idea, right?

285
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,166
Or, maybe that's a
wee bit too much.

286
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Anyway, we'll figure out
something and it'll be perfect!

00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,541
How are you able
to smile like that?

288

Uh...

be the way you are.

but you don't even hesitate to
commit yourself to learning it.

for Tokyo on your own.

about being too normal.
