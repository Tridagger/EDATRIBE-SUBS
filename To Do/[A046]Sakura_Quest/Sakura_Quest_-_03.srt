[music playing]

2
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,291
Feels like I lost a bet.

3
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,083
Why? It's a parade to introduce
you as the new queen!

4
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,291
At this rate, you should
just put me in the stocks!

5
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,291
Oh, don't be silly, Yoshi.

6
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,875
What's the point of
putting you in the stocks

7
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,291
if there's nobody to see it?

8
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,750
[music continues]

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,250
Turn it down!

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,625
You gonna make me?

11
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,750
Don't you know "It Always
Starts with a Mistake"

12
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,750
by Yoshino Tsubaki
when you hear it,

13
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
you classless idiot?

14
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:18,375
[music continues]

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,291
Kinda long day huh?

16
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,083
That's a bit of
an understatement.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,958
Oh, no thanks!
We just came in to eat today.

18
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,333
Hey, it's Maki.

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,708
On a date?

20
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,833
Do you think that's
a boyfriend from Tokyo?

21
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,750
Nope, he's my brother, Kosuke.

22
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,666
Thanks for looking after my sis.

23
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,833
Anyway, I don't think
there's much else to say.

24
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,500
Tell Mom for me, would you?

25
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,125
I won't be coming
home any time soon.

26
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,541
[KOSUKE sighs]

27
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,375
Okay, whatever you say.

28
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,666
So, are you the new queen?

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,375
The one they brought
in from Tokyo?

30
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,583
Um, yeah, I am.

31
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,041
Well, good luck with that.

32
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,750
I hope that you can bring
a little life to this place.

33
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,083
It's great to meet you.

34
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,500
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Same to you.

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,416
[SHIORI] So you're pretty
resolved not to move back home,

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,541
huh, Maki?

37
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,000
[MAKI]
Yeah, not for a while, anyway.

38
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,541
I think I get that.

39
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,291
Hard to believe
it was so lively in here

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,875
a few days ago.

41
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,541
Well, Sanae's got her own work,

42
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,791
so I guess that's
just the way it goes.

43
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,583
Hey, if you're a little
lonely here on your own,

44
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
I could always move in with you.

45
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,166
Seriously?

46
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,250
It's here!

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,625
What? Not more manju.

48
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,833
[YOSHINO] No.
It's all my stuff from Tokyo.

49
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,208
I kept bugging my manager
until he finally sent it.

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,875
So I guess you've
made up your mind, then.

51
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,291
I'll go ahead and
give it a shot,

52
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,416
for now, anyway.

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,125
At least it's not boring.

54
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
And there are worse
things than being paid

55
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,625
to be a queen, wouldn't you say?

56
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,500
I kinda doubt it'll be
quite as easy as you think.

57
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,583
Today's public service
will be an interview--

58
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,750
a local station.

59
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,166
Your first proper interview!

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,291
[chuckles]

61
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,708
You've got a script
and a cheat sheet.

62
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,750
No worries, right?

63
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,291
There's nothing
to be nervous about!

64
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,000
Time to get going, Queen.

65
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,375
[KUME]
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,958
So, the Head of
the Tourism Board

67
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,500
mistook you for the
old star, Yoshino Tsubaki,

68
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,500
and that's what brought
you to Manoyama.

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,666
Right!

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,333
But even starting as a mistake,

71
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,625
I'm going to stay and
give it my very best shot!

72
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,458
I've heard a rumor
that you're also entering

73
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,500
the Regional Mascot Contest
that's happening next week!

74
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,416
Yep! And we hope that people
will turn out to support us!

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,333
[USHIMATSU growls]

76
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,833
Must've been a shock

77
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,000
learning about this whole
Kingdom of Chupakabura thing!

78
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,250
Yes! I honestly had no clue
what it was about at first,

79
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,708
but after looking into it a bit,
I found it really interesting.

80
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,125
It's basically one of the old
mini independent states,

81
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,958
but they've built a story
for it and everything,

82
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,666
and it's fantastic!

83
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,708
Oh.

84
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,291
[YOSHINO]
Umm...

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,791
You see, it all started in
the 457th year of the Chupa--

86
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,583
[KUME] Right, right,
I think we're all familiar

87
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,041
with the backstory.

88
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,166
Now, there've been great
efforts to reinvigorate

89
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,958
small towns all across Japan.

90
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,916
Surely you are aware
that very few of them

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,625
have succeeded.

92
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,666
That's the big issue
you've committed to tackle

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,125
for the next year.

94
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,583
Uh-huh.

95
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,541
[KUME] As queen, what are
your thoughts on any changes

96
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,916
you'd like to make to the town?

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,791
That question's
not in the script!

98
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,541
Come on, hang in there, Queen!

99
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,208
All right, on to
the next quesion, then!

100
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,916
What are some of your favorite
things about Manoyama?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,541
Umm... I would say
the beautiful scenery?

102
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,625
And stuff?

103
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,875
[KUME]
There are several products made

104
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,166
right here in town.

105
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,625
Do you have a
particular favorite?

106
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,958
Umm, I guess maybe the manju?

107
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,458
[KUME] So what made you
decide to continue as queen?

108
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,041
If it was a mistake,
you could have refused, right?

109
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,500
[YOSHINO] Well, yes, but I was
impressed by this company's--

110
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,625
er, this town's potential for
growth and its company culture?

111
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,833
[SHIORI]
No, no worries at all, Yoshi!

112
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,750
Honestly, I think I started
to believe my own press,

113
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,166
being called "Queen"
and everything.

114
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,375
But I don't know
a thing about this town.

115
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,708
Well, you know what?

116
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,666
It's never too late
to start learning!

117
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,625
That's right!
And we can all help teach you.

118
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,833
Look at all the resources
we have here!

119
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,708
Idiots!

120
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,958
[YAMADA, MINO gasp]

121
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
[USHIMATSU]
She won't learn about the town

122
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,916
by reading a bunch of studies!

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,041
She's gotta be in it!

124
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,375
Feel the wind! On her face!

125
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,750
What do you think, Yoshi?

126
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,083
Feeling anything?

127
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,208
What I'm feeling...

128
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,541
[sighs] ...is nothing at all.

129
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,208
I'm so sorry!

130
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,916
It's okay.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,333
Hey, why don't you talk
to that lady over there?

132
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,750
Excuse me! Hi, there!

133
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,791
I'm the new queen.
Do you have a minute?

134
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,250
I'd love to chat with
you about... uh...

135
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,416
Pardon me!

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,625
Can you tell me a
little about the town?

137
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,291
What's the best
thing about Manoyama?

138
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,750
[OLD WOMAN 3A]
What? Who's wrestling?

139
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,458
[YOSHINO]
No, not wrestling!

140
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:14,375
What's the best thing
about Manoyama?

141
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,500
I'll tell you, it's certainly
not the wrestling.

142
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,416
If you had a chance
to change Manoyama,

143
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,791
what kind of town
would you like it to be?

144
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,625
Things are fine as they are.

145
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,208
I don't see a reason
to change anything

146
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,666
when it's working just fine.

147
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,875
What about the
future of the town?

148
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,083
[YOSHINO]
Well, for instance,

149
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,458
what about improvements?

150
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,958
Like, are there any changes
you might want to make

151
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,500
if you could?

152
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,541
[SHOP OWNER 3B] Why? Talking
to you won't change anything.

153
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,291
What good could
an outsider possibly do?

154
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,750
C'mon, no worries!

155
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,041
I think you just
happened to talk to

156
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,500
some of the wrong people.

157
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,791
There are plenty
of folks around here

who care an awful lot
about the town!

Oh hey, it's the queen!

What's going on, officer?

161
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,333
Aw, just got a
few reports saying

162
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,625
some strange-looking girl
has been wandering around

163
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,125
blathering some
nonsense about how

164
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,041
she was going to "go home."

165
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
Well, ouch, that hurts.

166
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,875
To be fair, though,
a lot of people

haven't met you yet.

I mean, I know Ushimatsu
has been working

really hard on this,
but to tell the absolute truth,

170

care less about

bringing change to this town.

172

that is, exactly?

[NOGE] The thing is,
we've been getting along okay.

174

The town's been surviving
for a while now

175

with hardly any tourists at all.

176
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,125
Although, the future's
not bright or anything.

177
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,916
It's not like many kids
are born here.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,541
But I doubt I'll still
be running this store

179
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
when it gets to be a problem.

180
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,291
So, no point fighting it,
you know?

181
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
Seriously?

182
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,708
[NOGE] Yeah, that's basically
how I feel about it.

183
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,583
I'd be surprised if most
didn't feel the same.

184
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,000
You might also
check in with the head

185
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,583
of the Board of
Merchants, though.

186
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,208
Board of Merchants?

187
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,125
Rii- <i>chan</i> 's grandma is
actually the head of that board.

188
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,041
but she doesn't get along
with Mr. Kadota, remember?

189
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,583
Well I'm going over there.

190
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,708
Yoshi, wait!

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,125
What do you want, Queen?
I don't have all day.

192
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
We just came by to say hello.

193
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,666
Come back yesterday.

194
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
[YOSHINO gasps]

195
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,166
We can't come back yesterday!

196
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,916
Please, can't we talk to you?

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,541
[SHIORI] Come on, Yoshi, we'll
try another time, Thank you!

198
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,125
Hey! Working hard today,
huh, Queen?

199
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,583
[YOSHINO] Mr. Takamizawa,
isn't that right?

200
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,583
You're the bus driver
I met before.

201
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
Yep, that's me.

202
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,166
I might not look it anymore, but
I used to be a prince, you know.

203
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,791
What do you mean, a prince?

204
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,708
Oh, my gosh!

205
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,208
What is it?

206
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh, it's nothing.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,041
Suddenly, I feel about a
bazillion years old, that's all.

208
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,208
[ERIKA] It's not gonna
matter what you do, Queen.

209
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,375
This is a crappy old
town way beyond saving.

210
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,750
Give it up.

211
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,458
Hey.

212
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,000
Apologize, Erika.

213
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,125
[ERIKA]
No!

214
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,166
I called it crappy
because it's crappy!

215
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,208
[TAKAMIZAWA sighs]

216
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
Welp, don't let
her discourage you.

217
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,125
You know the old saying, right?

218
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,041
Changemakers are the youth,
fools, and outsiders.

219
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,291
The funny thing is, Ushimatsu
used to be a young fool

220
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,125
long ago, but he definitely
wasn't ever an outsider.

221
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,333
[MAKI] Seems you're pretty
much the ideal candidate.

222
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,125
Just a youthful,
foolish outsider.

223
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,666
[YOSHINO]
Sanae is, too, then!

224
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,166
That doesn't work
because I'm not a fool.

225
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,875
I guess you must've
missed us pretty bad.

226
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,291
Couldn't stay away?

227
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,708
[SANAE] I'm just taking refuge
while the exterminators

228
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,666
clear my house.

229
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,833
Isn't it weird?

230
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,083
How it used to be
the Kingdom of Kabura?

231
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,125
Yeah, it is weird!

232
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
I just heard about that today.

233
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,958
[TAKAMIZAWA] The reason was
that <i>kabura</i> are Manoyama's

234
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,375
only real specialty.

235
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
<i>Kabura</i> ? We call them <i>kabu</i> .

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,416
[SHIORI] Yeah, around here,
people call them <i>kabura</i> .

237
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,833
It was back before I had even
started elementary school.

238
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,041
They used rural
stimulation funds to create

239
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,791
the Kingdom of <i>kabura</i> .

240
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,166
But it didn't last very long.

241
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,416
That was when Ushimatsu had
that big idea of his own.

242
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,666
"The ones that can
change our city are the youth,

243
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,000
outsiders, fools, and of
course, the monsters!"

244
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,375
And so, they decided
to hop on the UMA bandwagon,

245
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,583
changing the kingdom's name from
<i>kabura</i> to Chupakabura.

246
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,000
That's nuts!

247
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,083
The Board of Merchants
was completely against the idea

248
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,333
from the very beginning.

249
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,458
Well, I would be, too,
because I'm not nuts.

250
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,333
I've got it!

251
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,375
Got what?

252
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
It's <i>kabura</i> !

253
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
Everyone in Manoyama really
loves the stuff, right?

254
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,666
So <i>kabura</i> must be the secret
to changing the town!

255
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,083
[WOMAN 3A]
You want to observe the farming?

256
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,833
We harvest the <i>kabura</i> in winter.

257
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,041
So I'm afraid there's
not much to do now.

258
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,583
Well, maybe you
could just tell me why

259
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,000
you're so passionate
about <i>kabura</i> .

260
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh, I wouldn't say
that I'm passionate.

261
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,625
We've just been growing
them around here

262
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,416
for a long time, that's all.

263
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,500
But look, you've got
a Kabura Kid over there!

264
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,708
[WOMAN 3A]
Oh.

265
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,916
Yeah, sure, our son
used to like him a lot.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh! He's probably farming
<i>kabura</i> now, too, then, right?

267
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,958
No, he left town
and got a job.

268
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,833
Doesn't come back
here much anymore.

269

[SHIORI humming]

270
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,041
Oh, good morning.

271
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,250
Good morning.

272
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,875
Hey, where's the queen?

273
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,250
They're holding the Regional
Mascot Contest in town,

274
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,916
so she's headed that
way with Mr. Kadota.

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,666
And I'll be going over
to help them this afternoon!

276
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,541
Man, aren't you the busy bee.

277
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,708
Oh, the broadcast
should be starting now!

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,166

Chupakabura up against those?

--Hi, there!
--[MINO] Shiori, listen!

Huh?

find the thing anywhere!

You're saying it's
not there, either?

Unfortunately not.

We're asking Shiori
about it right now.

Yeah, she doesn't know.

Well, you better figure it out!

00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,000
We go on at three and I
want that Chupakabura head

here by then!

00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,625
Why would you throw it away?!

How's this?

wanna scare kids, it's great.

Don't call me that.

Could I get both of
you to focus, please?

00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,958
We should be thinking
of a way to get Yoshi

and Mr. Kadota out of this mess!

[SHIORI]
Rii- <i>chan</i> !

317
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,166
Kabura Kid.

318
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,750
[RIRIKO]
I saw on TV.

319
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,541
If you use the
Kabura Kid costume

320
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,333
instead of the Chupakabura,
that would solve your problem.

321
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,083
Oh, my gosh, that's right!
There's a costume

322
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,083
from when we were
the Kingdom of Kabura!

323
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,916
That old man destroyed
the Kingdom of Kabura

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,208
by himself, and now
he's going to be saved

325
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,416
by the Kabura Kid.

326
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,250
How perfectly humiliating.

327
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
That's good TV.

328
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,791
[RIRIKO]
But then, the mascot entry

329
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,250
wouldn't be the Chupakabura.

330
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,750
We can't really
afford to be concerned

331
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,833
about that right now.

332
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,333
Do you know where
the costume is?

333
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,833
It's no use.
I can't find it anywhere.

334
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,708
You think maybe
it got thrown away?

335
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,416
Or it could be someone
took it somewhere

336
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,166
to use it and
never returned it.

337
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,375

Oh, I hope not.

338
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,000

We're not giving up yet!

00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,333

Around when did they switch from

340
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,625
the Kingdom of Kabura
to Chupakabura?

341
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,750
If I remember correctly,
I think it was August of 1997.

342
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,041
August '97--looks like
that's spot-on.

343
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,375
This might be
Kabura Kid's last event.

344
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,125
[SHIORI] Wow!

[MAKI] That might be the
Manoyama Community Center.

the Tanaka Fabric store.

350
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,166
So it's possible that it was
used at the Community Center,

351
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,458
and then never returned
to the palace.

It's Kabura Kid,

nobody in Manoyama

then why doesn't she
decide which one to use?

This one sure looks different
from his application photo.

Yes. He's changed a little.

That's pretty smart of her.

She neither rejected nor
chose either one of them.

It's like a mashup of the two.

[USHIMATSU growling]

422
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,625
Years ago, in Manoyama,

423
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,208
the Kabura Kid was chosen
as the town's mascot.

424
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,333
Kabura was an obvious choice,

425
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,625
because Manoyama has a history
of growing quality <i>kabura</i> .

426
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,041
But unfortunately,

427
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,625
Kabura Kid was never very
beloved by the town folk.

428
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,291
Something had to be done,
and UMAs were very popular,

429
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,791
so they made their next
mascot the Chupakabura.

430
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
And when they did,
they really hoped

431
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,666
that people would
take to it this time.

432
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,916
But he wasn't
very popular either.

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,166
Kabura Kid and Chupakabura--

434
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,208
Neither of them ever managed
to become very dear

00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,166
to the good people of Manoyama.

436
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,291
Over time, both of
them were forgotten.

437
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,083
That's why it doesn't
matter which one he is.

438
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,416
That's not what's important.

Sometimes we focus
on the wrong things.

440
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,291
So, the question is,
just what is important 

441
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,958
to the community
of Manoyama?

442
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,583
What is it that drives them?

00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,458
What stands the test of time?

444
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,916
What means most to them?

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,833
What about the town is unique?
What do they hold dear?

here myself,
