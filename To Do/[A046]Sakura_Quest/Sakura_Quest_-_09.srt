1
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,791
[CHITOSE]
Well, Shi.

2
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,916
Do you really think
you can do that?

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,541
Yes I can. I will lift
this burden off the Queen.

4
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,000
And I will commit to take
the lead on this project.

5
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,625
[SHIORI]
I'm still shaking like a leaf!

6
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,125
And to think how
reluctant you've been

7
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,500
to take a leadership
role before now.

8
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,916
Trust me, no one's more
surprised than I am.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,041
But all I could think about was

10
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,375
how to save Yoshi
from that situation.

11
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,166
I feel terrible, Shiori.

12
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,750
No worries, Queen, I insist.

13
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,958
I wonder if Rii- <i>chan</i> is okay.

14
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,250
[CHITOSE]
So, did you really not know?

15
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,291
You had no clue it was on the
same date as our festival?

16
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,541
No, I didn't.

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,666
Unbelievable. Your head
is in the clouds, girl.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,833
No, I just don't care.

19
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,375
[MAKI]
I'm gonna have the <i>somen</i> .

20
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,083
Yeah, me, too!

21
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,500
Again?

22
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,291
You guys are quite the
<i>somen</i> enthusiasts, huh?

23
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,750
[TAKAMIZAWA]
So, what's wrong with that?

24
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,791
I've been eating <i>somen</i>
since childhood.

25
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,875
That's just how it
is here in Manoyama.

26
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,000
But why? What is
it about <i>somen</i> ?

27
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,041
Is it because we
harvest so much wheat?

28
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,041
It's because 50 percent of
our bodies are made of <i>somen</i> .

29
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,833
[SANAE]
Oh, stop. Be real, please.

30
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,333
[SHIORI]
Hey, Sandal, what did you order

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,416
for dinner tonight?

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,666
I'm having borscht.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,875
[YOSHINO]
You're eating borscht?

34
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,416
Wait, does that mean
you come from Russia?

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,750
Nope, it doesn't.

36
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,916
[YOSHINO]
Where are you from, then?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,958
Where's your hometown?

38
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,458
Oh, you know what they say,

39
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,916
"When the home's far away,
you stink about it."

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,458
Don't you mean
"think" about it?

41
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,416
[SANAE] Look at that, they even
put somen in their borscht.

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
It's just a little
cultural exchange.

43
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,125
People love their hometowns.

44
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,666
That's it!

45
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,458
[knocking]

46
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,833
Hey, Shiori, think you
might want this bag?

47
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Huh? You sure?

48
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,833
I thought this was
one of your favorites!

49
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,875
Yep, so take good care of it.

50
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,583
Still working hard, I see?

51
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,833
[SHIORI]
Mm-hm.

52
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,250
[SAYURI] Just don't wear
yourself out, all right?

53
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,583
[YAMADA] The Manoyama <i>Somen</i>
Mega Expo. I get it.

54
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,375
You're partnering it up
with the Board of Merchants'

55
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,791
summer festival, right?

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,833
Yeah! <i>Somen</i> is a
Manoyama specialty,

57
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,208
locally produced and
locally consumed.

58
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,416
So that part, at least,

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,166
should make the Board
of Merchants happy.

60
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,375
This isn't just a simple
presentation, either.

61
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,666
It's a contest!

62
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,083
We'll have different
organizations

63
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
run competing booths,

64
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,583
and the winner will be
decided by the guests' votes.

65
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,250
[SANAE] Anyone who lives
in Manoyama can participate.

66
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,500
Showcasing people's unique
ways of serving <i>somen</i>

67
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,583
is a cool way to showcase
the town, itself!

68
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,666
[MAKI] The winning dish will
be made an official recipe

69
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,958
of the kingdom, and we're
in talks to have it served

70
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,958
at the city hall cafeteria.

71
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,375
Huh. That's not half bad.

72
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,875
Really? You think so?

73
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,250
It allows the Board of
Merchants to save face, too.

74
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,875
And I like that it's
open participation.

75
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,833
Yeah, but, I still
don't think it's gonna

76
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,583
be enough to change
the old hag's mind.

77
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,500
[MINO] Why don't we add
something to make it beneficial

78
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,375
for them in some way?

79
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,791
Yeah, that's good.

80
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,250
Something like holding a
farmer's market alongside it?

81
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,416
Yes, we can invite local vendors
and other producers, too!

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,875
It's a total win-win!

83
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,958
Okay, we'll go ahead
and update our proposal!

84
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,333
[CHITOSE] Interesting plan.
You've worked hard, here.

85
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,458
I have no objections
to what you propose.

86
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,333
[BOTH gasp]

87
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,083
Thank you so much, ma'am!

88
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,583
I hope you know
that I didn't say

89
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,458
any of those things because
I have a problem with you.

90
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,166
I just need you to help support
the Board of Merchants.

91
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,333
[YOSHINO] Of course!
We'll be more careful.

92
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,000
Shiori, thank you.

93
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh! We have one more
favor to ask of you.

94
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,750
What is it?

95
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,041
[SHIORI] Would you give
Rii- <i>chan</i> your blessing

96
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,625
to be a member of our
team on this project?

97
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,875
All five of us
worked on it together.

98
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,708
If you took one of us
out of the equation,

99
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,125
it wouldn't be our
project anymore.

100
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,041
All right, then.

101
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:32,791
[gasps]

102
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,291
Oh, yay!

103
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,708
[CHITOSE]
Be warned.

104
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,958
The Board of Merchants is
going to win this contest.

105
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,000
[CHEF 9A]
A <i>somen</i> competition?

106
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,625
That actually sounds
like a lot of fun!

107
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,541
We'll give it a shot!

108
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,916
[YOSHINO]
Thank you so much!

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,916
We got the Mommies
Together Club!

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,166
So far, so good.

111
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,500
That's right!

112
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,750
And it's all thanks to
Shiori's super-smart plan.

113
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,083
[USHIMATSU]
Hm?

114
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,041
I don't know, it just
seems to me that Shiori's

115
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,916
got a real knack for mediating.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,416
Well, that's just because locals

117
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,750
have a unique way
of interacting.

118
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,458
That doesn't mean outsiders
should get discouraged, though.

119
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,791
Uh--

120
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,916
What I'm saying is,
you don't need to get upset

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,208
just because you
screwed up a little bit.

122
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,208
Ah. So, you could tell, huh?

123
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,875
The Queen has no time to
stand around, navel-gazing!

124
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,958
She must keep moving forward!
So forward we go!

125
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,083
Right!

126
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,541
[USHIMATSU]
Forge on, straight ahead!

127
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,875
Straight ahead, and then
take a right at the T!

128
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,916
[YOSHINO]
Got it!

129
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,708
[USHIMATSU]
Her cup runneth over.

130
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,041
You know somethin'?

131
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,583
This is a pretty solid
project, coming from you.

132
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,416
I would've been more
aggressive, though.

133
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,666
[YOSHINO]
So, um.

134
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,125
How exactly do you two
fellas know each other?

135
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,791
Well, we used to
build stuff together

136
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,916
when we were much younger.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,291
No, I was your
glorified lab rat!

138
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,041
There was this crazy Icarus
Project where he put these

139
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,041
weird wings on me and
pushed me off a cliff.

140
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,791
I bestowed the gift
of flight upon him!

141
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,416
Almost killed me,
is what you did!

142
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,583
[YOSHINO]
That's messed up.

143
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,583
All right. Gimme a
booth at this thingy.

144
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,666
I'll call it "Doku's Booth."

145
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,750
That's catchy.

146
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,708
[laughs]

147
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,000
[SHIORI]
Thanks!

148
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,666
We appreciate you
letting us put a poster up.

149
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,208
[KUMANO]
No problem at all!

150
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,333
An expo for <i>somen</i>
is a really solid idea!

151
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,125
Man, something smells so good!

152
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,916
Oh, I was just making myself
a little somethin' back there.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
You want some?

154
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,958
Holy wow!

155
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,458
I've never in my life had
French toast this good!

156
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,791
Oh, thank you.

157
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,791
To tell you the truth,
this stuff is responsible

158
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,958
for changing my life,
for better or for worse.

159
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,208
[GIRLS]
Huh?

160
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,875
[KUMANO]
It was back in high school.

161
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,875
I took a cooking class and
we were making egg dishes.

162
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,458
Hey, Kumano, what'd
you decide to make?

163
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,208
Oh, Shinomiya!

164
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,833
Um, it's only some French toast.

165
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,125
Ah! I love French toast!
Can I try a bite?

166
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,125
[KUMANO]
U-Uh, sure.

167
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,541
It's scrumptious! I'm
really impressed, Kumano!

168
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,125
[KUMANO]
That was when I decided

169
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,541
I'd go to France and study
to perfect my French toast.

170
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,875
Whoa!

171
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,416
That was your only reason
for training in France?

172
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,083
And all this time
I thought that Shiori

173
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,416
was the one you were into.

174
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,541
[SHIORI]
Yeah right! Whatever!

175
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,875
Sayuri's always been
the one, hasn't she?

176
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,000
I admit, all I wanted was
to see her smile again.

177
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,583
However, once I got to France,

178
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,750
I realized something
rather troubling.

179
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,208
Was it the fact
that French toast

180
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,916
didn't even originate in France?

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,041
[SANAE, SHIORI, MAKI]
Wha...?

182
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,291
One theory is that
the name of the dish

183
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,833
comes from an American
named Joseph French.

184
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,333
So, French was just
the guy's name?

185
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,833
Some American dude?

186
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,000
[KUMANO]
Yeah. So, that's what happened.

187
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,666
But I couldn't turn
around and go home

188
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,541
just because of
a misunderstanding.

189
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,708
So, before I knew it, I became
a fully trained French chef.

190
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,750
Well, your food is
genius-level good.

191
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,000
[SHIORI] If you really
liked my sister that much,

192
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,083
why on earth didn't you tell her
before you left for France?

193
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,625
Oh, I had planned to!

194
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,125
But she never showed up like
she promised me she would.

195
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,875
She said the exact same
thing to me about you.

196
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,125
[gasps]

197
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,750
[YOSHINO]
Oh, come on.

198
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,833
All you did here was switch
the tea out for broth.

199
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,500
No, I developed a new sensor

200
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,125
that automatically pours more
broth when it gets diluted.

201
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,791
[YOSHINO] Yeah, that's not
what I meant, though.

202
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,291
Isn't there some way to,
like, try to involve the--

203
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,958
[YOSHINO gasps]
Oh, Doku! I think I've got it!

204
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,541
We're about to make
<i>somen</i> so exciting!

205
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,541
What?

206
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,166
[CHIKAKO]
Take care of yourself, okay?

207
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,958
Please try not to work too hard.

208
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,916
[SHIORI] Good luck,
Sayuri! I'll miss you!

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,458
[TAKAYUKI sobbing]
My little girl!

210
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,333
Aw, Dad, come on,
it's just one town over.

211
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,541
Okay, bye, everyone!

212
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,875
[yelps]

213
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,375
[panting]

214
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,500
Kumano! Are you okay?

215
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,208
[KUMANO]
Yeah. Shinomiya.

216
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,083
There's something I really
need to talk to you about

217
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,125
before you go away.

218
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,458
What is it?

219
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,791
What's this?

220
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,166
I was under the impression
the chef liked Shiori.

221
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,708
Do you remember what
I said at graduation?

222
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,250
That I'd be waiting
for you at three o'clock

223
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,458
at the station the next Sunday?

224
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,875
[SAYURI]
Mm-hm.

225
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,416
I waited for you there
well into the night.

226
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,958
But, you never showed up.

227
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,375
So, that's why I left
for France before I'd--

228
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,916
But I was waiting, too! I was!

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,333
[KUMANO gasps]

230
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,666
[SAYURI] I mean, I waited
most of the night, but...

231
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,958
It was the Sunday right
after graduation, yeah?

232
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,875
Yeah. I don't get it.

233
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,958
[MOVER 9A] Hey! We're ready
to take off if that's okay!

234
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,208
Thank you! Yes, that'll be fine!

235
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,875
Sorry.

236
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,125
I'll come back by for
dinner again, soon.

237
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,791
[SHIORI]
What happened? What'd she say?

238
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,583
[MAKI] Well, maybe it was
the wrong station.

239
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,291
I don't really see how.

240
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,958
Not when there's only
one station in Manoyama.

241
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,250
Then I guess they
must have been waiting

242
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,333
in different places.

243
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,333
Oh, yeah! Like Shibuya Station!

244
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,000
[MAKI] Right, like waiting
at the Moyai statue

245
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,083
instead of Hachiko!

246
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,250
But the difference is,

247
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,166
this station only
has one meet-up spot.

248
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,833
[YOSHINO]
We're back!

249
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:13,625
[SHIORI]
How'd it go?

250
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,750
Tons of people signed up!

251
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,166
All the booths are full!

252
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,333
That's incredible!

253
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,708
No way, Yoshi! Bet that
was a lotta work!

254
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,833
[YOSHINO]
It actually wasn't!

255
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,666
Everyone was really interested.

256
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,166
Oh! I almost forgot,

257
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,541
I brought you guys a treat
from the Local Cuisine Society!

258
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,583
[SHIORI]
Ooh! My favorite!

259
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,458
I love these!

260
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,875
What are they?

261
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,833
Rice balls covered in
<i>kombu</i> seaweed flakes.

262
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,333
Why cover them?

263
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,416
No idea.

264
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,333
These have been
around here forever.

265
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
Makes sense.

266
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,208
I've noticed that
since I've moved here.

267
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,958
People in Manoyama eat
a crazy amount of <i>kombu</i> .

268
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,666
Oh, really?

269
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,166
You use it in broths,

270
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,708
to flavor your sushi
and rice, even <i>kombu</i> tea!

271
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,208
One time, at a pub here,

272
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,333
I even witnessed a guy
drinking <i>kombu</i> liquor.

273
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
[MINO] Well, Toyama actually
has the highest <i>kombu</i>

274
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708
consumption rate per
capita in the country.

275
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,291
It's kinda strange, huh?

276
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,625
It's not like you can
harvest it in Toyama Bay

277
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
and Manoyama isn't
close to the sea.

278
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,916
[USHIMATSU]
Back in the Edo Period,

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,083
it was common for trade
ships from Hokkaido

280
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,541
to make frequent stops
at each port in the north.

281
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,833
And it so happened that
they brought a lot of <i>kombu</i>

282
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,833
with them when they did.

283
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,708
Oh, well I guess
that answers that.

284
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,833
[SANAE] Learning more about
this place every day.

285
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,416
So true.

286
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,958
We eat these things all the
time without thinking about it,

287
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,625
but they're directly
connected to our history.

288
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,500
And they're good!

289
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,583
Hey, wait a sec.

290
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,375
[MAKI]
What? I see the wheels turning.

291
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,958
We'll come up with
an amazing dish--

292
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,333
something only the Tourism
Board could pull off!

293
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,375
We'll crush the
Board of Merchants!

294
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,708
No, I'm starting to
feel the pressure!

295
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll tell you a secret.

296
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,000
I've come up with
a surprise, myself.

297
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,541
[SANAE]
Hm? What is it?

298
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,125
[YOSHINO] Well, it's
directly related to <i>somen</i> ,

299
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,916
and it's completely interactive.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,375
[YOSHINO laughs]

301
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,125
You've got a scary
look on your face.

302
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,750
You good with it, Mr. Kadota?

303
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,375
Of course, I'm totally
good with it.

304
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,583
Bring it on!

305
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,000
[DOKUSHIMA]
You came.

306
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,208
[YOSHINO]
Yes.

307
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,208
All right, let's do it. Doku.

308
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,416
[SHIORI]
<i>Somen</i> and <i>kombu</i> .

309
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,458
I'm so used to them that I
can't see what to do with them.

310
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,166
[SHIORI sighs]
They're just going to say

311
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,166
my idea is boring again!

312
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,083
I wish Sayuri was
here to help me.

313
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,416
Why don't you take
a little break?

314
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,041
[SHIORI] Yoshino and the
others are all working

315
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
really hard, so I can't
slack off right now.

316
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,708
Aw! But what if no one from
town even shows up for this?

317
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,666
I mean, what're
we gonna do, then?

318
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,958
You worry about things like this
a little too much, Shiori.

319
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,166
Maybe so.

320
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
But I personally got
these people involved,

321
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,208
and we're spending
a lot of money on it.

322
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,208
So, I think about it
being completely empty,

323
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,833
and it scares me.

324
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,750
Because I'll be the one
responsible if it fails.

325
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,625
I'd feel terrible.
I'd wanna disappear.

326
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,833
Yoshino's doing great and
I really do respect her.

327
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,750
I don't know the details here.

328
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,791
But it sounds to me like
you should ask your friends

329
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,041
for a little more help, hm?

330
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,416
Thank you, Mom.

331
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,750
But the problem is,
we've only got one week left.

332
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,625
[gasps] No way! Do I have
the wrong date down?

333
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,291
Oh, no!

334
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,458
[CHIKAKO]
Shiori? What is it?

335
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,708
[SHIORI]
The date!

336
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,958
The date is...

337
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,083
Oh, my gosh, what has
that silly girl done?

338
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,291
It's last year's calendar!

339
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,666
Oh. Are you kidding me?

340
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,125
I think I was
seriously on the verge

341
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,583
of having a heart attack!

342
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,500
[CHIKAKO] You two have
always been such airheads.

343
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm so nervous.

344
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,208
Hey, don't worry!

345
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,958
I'm sure folks are
gonna show up.

346
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,791
Look!

347
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,583
So many people!
Look at that, Shiori!

348
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,958
Yeah!

349
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,916
Okay then, what do you
want to do first?

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,833
I'm hungry, Mommy!
When do we eat?

351
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,833
[SANAE] Hello, everyone!
We want to welcome you

352
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,666
to the first Manoyama
<i>Somen</i> Mega Expo!

353
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,458
Everything you see in the
booths is free of charge!

354
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,291
There are plenty of
options, so make sure

355
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,166
you save room to
try 'em all, folks!

356
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,875
The booth that receives
the most votes

357
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,666
will be the champion.

358
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,583
We'll promote that
lucky winner's recipe

359
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:22,041
as one of Manoyama's
specialties!

360
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,041
There's no way we're losing
to the Tourism Board.

361
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,458
[SHIORI]
Our recipe is unique!

362
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,250
Rather than serving
the noodles in a broth,

363
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,833
we've chosen to flavor our
dish with a thicker sauce.

364
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,916
You place the well-strained
<i>somen</i> , in a bowl,

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,250
and then you add some
<i>kombu</i> flakes, okra,

366
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,708
<i>natto</i> , and some
grated mountain yam.

367
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,458
Lastly, you're gonna
throw in just a splash

368
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,250
of sauce with sesame oil.

369
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,833
Mix it up, and it's
all ready for you

370
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,416
and your family to enjoy!

371
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,291
Wow! This is good!

372
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,708
[MAKI]
Kosuke, what do you think?

373
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,833
It's making me feel
nostalgic, somehow.

374
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,666
Curious, why <i>kombu</i> ?

375
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,708
[SHIORI] Well, <i>kombu</i> and
<i>somen</i> have been popular

376
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,166
in Manoyama for such
a long time, so,

377
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,250
we thought it made sense

378
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,375
for them to be
considered a local dish.

379
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,500
Guys!

380
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,916
How 'bout a bowl
of Happy <i>Somen</i> ?

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
It's pretty tasty! Wanna try?

382
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,791
Count me in!

383
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,958
It sounds totally boring.

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,416
Well, look at this, though.

385
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,750
<i>Kombu</i> is low in calories
and it contains nutrients

386
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,125
that are said to increase
the size of your bust.

387
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,375
Huh?

388
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,750
[ERIKA]
I'm sold.

389
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,333
[RIRIKO]
Here you go. Enjoy.

390
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,625
There's still time for you, too.

391
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,083
Huh?

392
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,333
[KUMANO]
Shiori! Sorry I'm so late.

393
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,625
I was busy with prep.

394
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,083
[SHIORI]
Hey, Kumano!

395
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,500
Here you go.

396
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,041
Tastes like your
hard work paid off.

397
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,250
And I like the name, too.

398
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,750
Thanks so much, Chef!

399
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
I'm hopeful that this
will help us find

400
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,125
some new local
favorites, you know?

401
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,833
Yeah! Oh, I almost forgot.

402
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,958
Try not to miss each
other this time, okay?

403
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,583
I guess they've started
to figure things out.

404
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
[SANAE] Ladies and gentlemen,
we're currently

405
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,875
tallying your votes for
the <i>Somen</i> Mega Expo.

406
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,541
We'll have the results soon.

407
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,208
But in the meantime,
let's have a word

408
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,500
from Yoshino Koharu,

409
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,333
Queen of the kingdom
of Chupakabura.

410
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,500
Huh?!

411
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,500
Good afternoon! I hope
you're all having fun!

412
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,291
Yoshi!

413
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,916
What's with the swimsuit?

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,416
We've got a lot of great
new <i>somen</i> dishes here today,

415
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,458
but I'd like to show you a cool
new way to experience them!

416
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,041
What new way?

417
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,416
I think we can all agree,
everyone loves <i>somen</i> .

418
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,291
And now, thanks to this guy,

419
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,666
you can get closer to
your favorite noodle!

420
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,000
May I present the brand new,
Over-Flowing <i>Somen</i> 5-DX!

421
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,541
"Overflowing <i>Somen</i> "?

422
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
All right, let's eat!

423
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,000
[MACHINE VOICE 9A]
Prepare to overflow!

424
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,541
[YOSHINO]
There it is!

425
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,583
Ah... Ah.

426
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,833
[YOSHINO yells]

427
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,041
Ya see? It stimulates
the five senses!

428
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,458
A 5-DX exper--

429
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,333
In ya go. In ya go. In ya go.

430
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,208
I might need to go ahead
and automate this part, too.

431
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,083
Do you think this was
the "little surprise"

432
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,708
that Yoshi was
bragging about earlier?

433
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,458
You mean this
high-tech masterpiece?

434
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,250
It looks fun.

435
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,958
It's a meal... you enjoy...

436
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,500
...with your whole body.

437
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,916
Best game ever!

438
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,791
[GIRL 9A]
I wanna play, too, Mommy!

439
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,708
[YAMADA]
Here, Kozuki!

440
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,041
Take it! Hurry!

441
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,458
Well, everyone,
we hope you enjoyed

442
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,583
that little show.

443
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,916
Now it's time to
announce the results!

444
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,625
The winner of the first
Manoyama <i>Somen</i> Mega Expo is...

445
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,666
The Manoyama Mommies
Together Club

446
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,000
with their Spicy
<i>Somen</i> Spring Rolls!

447
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,500
Congratulations!

448
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,333
Hey, you guys! We did it!

449
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,083
So, I guess we lost.

450
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,458
Aw, it's okay.

451
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,958
I have every intention
of finishing this later.

452
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,833
Well, it was obvious that
we were ahead, anyway.

453
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,791
Shut up, hag!

454
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,125
Come on, now!

455
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,125
Everyone had a good time,
isn't that what counts?

456
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,208
Excuse me, miss,

457
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,958
you're with the
Tourism Board, right?

458
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,791
Yes, I am.

459
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,875
Well, I wanted you to know,
I just loved the Happy <i>Somen</i> .

460
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,875
You think I could serve
it in my restaurant?

461
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,916
[SHIORI]
Yes, of course!

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,833
[ROBA]
I really enjoyed it, too!

463
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,791
The flavor was somehow calming.

464
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,625
I'm planning on
making it at home.

465
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,750
[SHIORI]
Please do!

466
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,166
You did so great, Shii- <i>chan</i> .

467
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,375
Well, it's 4PM and I'm
at the throne room.

468
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,166
[SAYURI]
Kumano?

469
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,250
[KUMANO] Shinomiya!
What're you doing here?

470
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,875
Shiori said I had
to be here today.

471
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,416
So weird.

472
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,583
She gave me a note telling me
to be here at four o'clock.

473
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,166
And she gave me this.

474
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,500
[SAYURI]
I think that's from my room.

475
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,041
[KUMANO] Why a calendar?
And it's last year's.

476
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
[SAYURI gasps]

477
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,083
That means the calendar
I was looking at

478
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,500
when we were supposed to meet...

479
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,000
It was probably
the wrong one, too!

480
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,375
[gasps]

481
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,916
[SAYURI] I bet I was waiting
for you at the station

482
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,375
on the wrong day!

483
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,458
[gasps]

484
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,250
[laughs]

485
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,208
Well, at least the
mystery's been solved, then!

486
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,458
Oh, man.

487
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,541
I'm so sorry, I guess
I really am an airhead!

488
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,166
Look, why don't we try again?

489
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,041
Will you come back by my
restaurant sometime tomorrow?

490
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,125
I'll even make your
very favorite dish.

491
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,875
You mean that
yummy French toast?

492
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,125
Yep, that recipe
hasn't changed at all!

493
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,958
[BOTH laugh]

494
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,708
[SHIORI]
Oh, there you are, Yoshi!

495
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,083
We've been looking for you.

496
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,083
[MAKI] Hey, don't let it
get you down, girl.

497
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,750
That little show of yours
was remarkably entertaining.

498
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,416
C'mon, don't say that.

499
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,958
I was really trying.

500
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,750
[SANAE]
Aw, you are such mess.

501
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,458
[SHIORI]
Sometimes I envy you, Yoshi.

502
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,750
You've got such a totally
weird imagination!

503
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,916
Not a compliment!

504
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
[SANAE] Our dear Yoshino
who never thinks

505
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,291
a single thing through.

506
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,958
And Shiori, who
overthinks everything.

507
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,500
[SANAE laughs] Maybe we should
just add you together

508
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,750
and divide by two.

509
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,250
Okay, from now on,

510
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,125
I swear I'll think things
through completely before I act!

511
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,833
No, wait!

512
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,708
That's not who you are, Yoshi!

513
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,958
I think you should double down,
and go for everything!

514
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,958
And no worries,
'cause I've got your back!

515
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,708
Ah! That's it! An inauguration!

516
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,125
Inauguration?

517
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,958
[RIRIKO] You're the only
one without a title.

518
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,291
Oh! Am I, really?

519
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,083
Lord Shiori Shinomiya,

520
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,791
I hereby declare
that henceforth,

521
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,083
you are known as the
Minister of Mediation!

522
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,625
--Of mediation?
--[YOSHINO] Yeah!

523
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,041
[SANAE]
What's that?

524
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,041
A minster that mediates things
and makes them all good!

525
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:41,916
Too long.

526
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,916
I humbly submit my resignation.

527
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
[YOSHINO]
What?

528
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,541
[RIRIKO]
That was a three-second term.

529
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,166
But why? Don't you like it?

530
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,291
Well, no, it's actually
pretty terrible.

531
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,333
[SANAE]
Girls, whaddya think?

532
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,625
Should we start a revolt? Yeah!

533
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,500
--[SHIORI] Yeah!
--[MAKI] Hear, hear!

534
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,041
[YOSHINO]
Come on, you guys!

535
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,666
[ANGELICA]
Have a seat.

536
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,625
[TAKAMIZAWA]
You know what I want.

537
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,666
[SANDAL] I tried taking
Doku's place at the controls

538
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,291
of the Over-Flowing <i>Somen</i> 5-DX.

539
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,875
That thing wore me out.

540
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,208
Next time: "The
Dragon's Soft Spot."
