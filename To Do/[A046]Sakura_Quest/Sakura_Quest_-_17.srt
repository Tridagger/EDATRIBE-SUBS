1
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,583
[IWASHITA]
Three Sacred Treasures, huh?

2
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,958
[YOSHINO]
Right!

3
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,250
The Staff, the Hanging Drum,
and the Golden Dragon.

4
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,958
We need to revive the festival.

5
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,916
We have to have
the treasures to do that.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,541
Any idea where they could be?

7
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,083
It's fifty years
since the last festival.

8
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,708
The priest passed away
a long time ago,

9
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,125
and even the shrine
itself is gone.

10
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,083
Our work is cut
out for us, huh?

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,291
Tell me! Did your
grandma know anything?

12
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,000
Unfortunately not.

13
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,333
Oh, no!

14
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,958
My grandma and grandpa
said that they don't

15
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,875
remember anything about
the festival treasures either.

16
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,125
I guess we'll make our own.

17
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,291
It's not DIY.

18
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,750
[NOGE] I would bet the
professor might know.

19
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,791
What professor?

20
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,625
We get a lot
of orders from him.

21
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,166
I heard he used to teach
at some college.

22
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,416
Let's see.

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,666
Ah, here we go.

24
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,041
He's the one who
wrote this book.

25
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,708
"Cultural Anthropology."

26
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,041
Oh!

27
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,291
This was once my textbook
for a college course.

28
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,416
What a small world.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,250
Wow, and he lives in Manoyama?

30
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,583
He lives by himself
in Warabiya Village

31
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,666
out in the mountains.

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,208
But, he's quite an
eccentric old man.

33
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,541
I'm intrigued.

34
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,875
Should we go?

35
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,291
Warabiya is pretty deep in
the mountains, you know.

36
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,250
[YOSHINO]
It's my first time out this far.

37
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,708
It must be hard living
in a place like this.

38
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,958
Yeah, makes you wonder
where they go shopping.

39
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,083
[YOSHINO]
Excuse me! Mr. Suzuhara?

40
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,958
Are you at home, sir?

41
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,750
Maybe he's out.

42
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,833
[GROUP gasps]

43
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,375
That was scary.

44
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,541
[SUZUHARA]
Well, well, look at that.

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,958
Five sneaky tanukis at my door.

46
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,416
Can I help you?

47
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,250
Just to be clear,
did he call us tanukis?

48
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,041
[MAKI]
Yes. Yes, he did.

49
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,666
[SHIORI] I have a feeling
he might know a lot

50
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,291
about the past, though.

51
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,375
Cultural anthropology.

52
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,500
It involves taking up residence
in the region being researched,

53
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,250
and observing its
culture and society

54
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,041
over a long period of time.

55
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
[SUZUHARA]
Exactly.

56
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,125
Rather than tracing
back to the past,

57
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,416
this field focuses solely
on knowing the present.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,208
Anybody care for a drink?

59
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,000
[MAKI]
We're all fine, thanks, though.

60
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
That was a joke.

61
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,958
This stuff would be
wasted on tanukis.

62
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,125
I'm hosting the queen
and her ministers, am I?

63
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,625
Oh, you've heard of us, then?

64
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,625
[SUZUHARA] I saw you on
"Moving Mountains."

65
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,333
Playing at your little
rural revival games.

66
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,750
What do you mean by "games"?

67
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,833
We take our work very seriously!

68
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,375
Hey, it's okay, Shiori.

69
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,291
[SUZUHARA] And you're here
to ask about the festival

70
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,416
that ended fifty years ago, huh?

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,916
Yes, sir!

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,958
The five of us are committed
to trying to bring it back!

73
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,458
That's interesting.

74
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,125
Unfortunately, I only moved to
Manoyama twenty years ago.

75
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,625
What are you aiming
to accomplish

76
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,541
by reviving it, anyhow?

77
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,583
[YOSHINO]
Uhh...

78
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,166
Remember, it didn't
end on its own.

79
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
The fact it ended means
no one cared about it.

80
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,291
Don't you agree?

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,041
No, I actually don't.

82
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
I think the people
really need it.

83
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,875
They need a place to return to.

84
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,041
A place to gather.

85
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,500
C'mon, Let's go.

86
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,125
It seems to me like this
professor doesn't know anything.

87
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,833
[SUZUHARA]
I never said I didn't know.

88
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,500
I've heard rumors in the
village, over the years.

89
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,416
Apparently, one of
the treasures is held

90
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,000
in the storehouse of a
certain traditional home.

91
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,791
[MAKI] If he knew,
he should've just told us

92
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,166
from the start!

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,333
I really can't stand
people like that.

94
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,875
He reminds me of someone.

95
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,291
What're we gonna do?

96
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,541
There are so many
storehouses around here.

97
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,458
We're just gonna
have to check at each one.

98
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,583
[SANAE]
Hm?

99
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,583
[YOSHINO]
Sanae!

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,416
[SUZUHARA] I think I'll play a
little game with those tanukis.

101
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,458
[GROUP chattering]

102
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,708
Hey! Isn't that Takamizawa?

103
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Yeah.

104
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,333
I've tried talking to my company
about it several times!

105
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,916
[SHIGE] You do understand
what you're doing,

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,666
taking away our
freedom like this?

107
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,208
[GORO] And what about those
of us that live alone, hm?

108
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,708
I had thought you understood

109
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,250
and were on our side
about this, Takamizawa.

110
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,625
I'm disappointed.

111
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,458
[TAKAMIZAWA] Come on,
please don't say that, Kiyo!

112
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,666
I wonder what's up.

113
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,166
From what I've heard, this area

114
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,791
is about to be removed from
the current bus route.

115
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,666
People are upset.

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,750
[YOSHINO]
Oh, wow.

117
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,583
[MASA]
Please forgive the mess.

118
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,833
I haven't given the storehouse
a proper cleaning for years!

119
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,875
Oh, and if you see
any naughty mags,

120
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,083
just pretend you didn't!

121
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,166
[laughs]

122
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,916
Masa, what is that? A tablet?

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,916
Oh, this thing?

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,833
Someone from the
city offices left it here

125
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,041
a little while back.

126
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,000
I have no clue
how to use it,

127
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,708
but it's pretty helpful for
night time bathroom trips.

128
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,125
Oops! The batteries!

129
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,125
[SANAE yelps]
Someone just touched my butt!

130
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,041
[RIRIKO]
It wasn't me.

131
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,125
[MASA]
Me neither!

132
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,541
[MAKI]
Hide, hello sir.

133
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,041
[SHIORI] Thanks so much
for letting us look through

134
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,250
your storehouse!

135
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,208
Sure thing. Did you
find what you needed?

136
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,875
[SHIORI]
I'm afraid not.

137
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,958
That's too bad.

138
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm sorry that I
couldn't be more help.

139
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,208
Not at all! We appreciate it!

140
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,041
Are you fixing
one of your tools?

141
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,500
You still enjoy work, don't you?

142
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,791
Oh, no, I've been retired
for quite some time now.

143
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,458
I'm just keeping up
the routine at this point.

144
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,666
It can be a hard habit
to break, you know.

145
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,541
I made my living
this way for decades.

146
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,833
Of course, makes sense!

147
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,833
[timer beeping]

148
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,833
[HIDE]
Oh, good!

149
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,458
It's time for lunch!

150
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,958
So, you use the...?

151
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,291
It's very useful.

152
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,416
It works as a timer,
and as a weight!

153
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,041
Yep, they're useful, all right!

154
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,791
[door opens]

155
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,291
[YOSHINO]
I'm a hungry girl!

156
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,041
Oh, hey, Takamizawa!

157
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,083
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Hey!

158
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,916
[ERIKA] Lunch A: Tonkatsu.
Lunch B: Hot Somen.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,666
--[YOSHINO] I'll go with "A."
--[MAKI] Same here.

160
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,875
I'll take "B," please.

161
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,625
[SANAE]
"B" for me, too.

162
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,875
--Curry.
--'Kay.

163
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,833
[sighs]

164
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,250
[YOSHINO]
Takamizawa!

165
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,041
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Huh?

166
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,416
We saw you the other day.

167
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,750
That looked rough.

168
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,083
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

169
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,208
There's nothing I can
do about it, anyway.

170
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,625
I understand.

171
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,041
But what happens if those stops
are taken off the route?

172
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,500
I think in cases like this
they usually replace it

173
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,583
with a subsidized
community bus.

174
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,750
So things won't actually
change much, then?

175
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,416
[TAKAMIZAWA] Well, the local
government isn't exactly rich.

176
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,625
Running just one bus for a year
costs over ten million yen.

177
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,750
That much?

178
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,666
And we only get
about ten riders a day

179
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,166
from Warabiya Village.

180
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,125
Not that they don't matter,
because they do, but

181
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,416
the buses aren't
the only problem, here.

182
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,333
I mean, there's no hope
of the town growing

183
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,750
at this point.

184
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,125
They just have to make
sure to live within their means

185
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,625
from here on out.

186
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,208
That sounds so harsh.

187
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,708
You guys only talk
about boring stuff.

188
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,625
That's why I want to get
out of this stupid little town.

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,583
[USHIMATSU coughing]

190
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,416
Old ass!

191
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,208
[coughing]

192
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,500
[sighs] Damn, I thought
I might die, there.

193
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,250
So. What do you
want with me, anyway?

194
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,208
[CHITOSE]
You just keep hanging on, huh?

195
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,458
[USHIMATSU]
You show up out of nowhere

196
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,916
and greet me like that?

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,125
[CHITOSE yells]

198
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,083
I won't be back!
Hurry up and die, already!

199
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,458
[USHIMATSU]
What the hell?

200
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,625
[GORO] This bus thing's
a total catastrophe.

201
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,583
If I start using taxis now,

202
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,416
I'm going to be broke
in no time.

203
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,333
We'll worry about that later.

204
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,208
Those of us who can
drive will be flexible

205
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,458
and help each other out.

206
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,375
[GORO] Masa, you can
barely see at night!

207
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,291
You shouldn't be driving at all!

208
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,875
I still seem to have a
sixth sense for butts, though!

209
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,291
[GROUP laughs]

210
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,916
They were standing
around by the door,

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,041
so I brought them in.

212
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,625
Is that okay, Professor?

213
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,208
Of course.
Everyone, the queen is here.

214
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,333
Thanks very much.

215
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,583
It's nice to meet you all.

216
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,583
Ah! I saw you on TV once!

217
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,000
That other girl's from
<i>The Oden Detective</i> !

218
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,125
Kids these days
are remarkable.

219
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,500
The one with the glasses
is my type o' lady.

220
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,833
Talk about a caboose.

221
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,041
It was you, old bastard.

222
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,833
So, what brings
you all here today?

223
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,625
Well, I don't look the part,
but I am the queen,

224
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,958
so I thought I should
learn more about

225
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,708
how different people live here.

226
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,875
[SUZUHARA]
Hmm. Interesting.

227
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,125
As I assume
you're well aware,

228
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,875
the bus will stop
coming around here

229
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,458
before much longer.

230
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,875
We want to stop
that from happening.

231
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,291
What do you think?

232
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
We want to hear young
people's thoughts.

233
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,750
You first, Ms. Koharu.

234
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,541
Uh... Oh, umm...

235
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,208
If they drive slow and
focus on efficiency--

236
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,750
That's an "F."
A truly pointless effort.

237
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,416
Next, Ms. Shinomiya.

238
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,833
Increase fares so that
they don't operate at a loss,

239
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,625
I guess?

240
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,208
[SUZUHARA]
Fail.

241
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,041
Any and all fare changes require
approval from the government.

242
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,791
[SUZUHARA]
Next, Ms. Midorikawa.

243
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,250
Make the buses smaller.

244
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,541
[SUZUHARA]
That's a C minus.

245
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,791
We still can't reduce
people's salaries.

246
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,583
So what do we do, Ms. Oribe?

247
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,333
Wait until self-driving cars
have finally become popular.

248
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,583
That's an "F."

249
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,041
We obviously won't be
alive when that happens.

250
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,375
Last one. Ms. Kozuki.

251
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,875
This affects the whole country.

252
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,958
The decreasing population
problem isn't limited

253
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,291
to our town.

254
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,625
With that in mind,
towns with dwindling populations

255
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,458
should try to move their
citizens to more central areas.

256
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,000
Compact communities can be
reconstructed in urban zones.

257
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,625
If you do that, I believe
the transportation problem

258
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,666
should be resolved.

259
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,000
Big fail.

260
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,916
These people worked hard
up until their retirement,

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,250
and paid their taxes.

262
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,958
This is their rightful home.

263
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,916
They should be able to live
here as long as they want.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,291
[MASA]
That's right, we should.

265
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,125
[KIYO] I don't want
to move at this age.

266
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,500
Ms. Kozuki.

267
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,791
When you break up an older
community such as ours,

268
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,458
what you're really
doing is breaking up

269
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,041
that region's culture.

270
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,041
[SANAE]
Oh...

271
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,375
Your urban life
left you ignorant

272
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,458
of the situation in the country.

273
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,208
I say that even though
I am from Tokyo, myself.

274
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,625
[SANAE]
Really?

275
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,666
I moved here from the city, too.

276
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,875
I had no direct
connection to Manoyama.

277
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,833
All right,
just one more question.

278
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,083
What was it that made
you choose to come here?

279
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,500
[SANAE]
Huh?

280
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,583
[SUZUHARA] On that TV program,
it seemed a little like

281
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,125
you didn't much
care where you went.

282
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,541
That's not really--

283
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,500
[SUZUHARA]
Don't worry. It's fine.

284
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,666
Believe me, I didn't have
any special feelings

285
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,500
for this place, either.

286
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,666
However, over the years,
I've put down roots here.

287
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,750
[SUZUHARA] By the way, how's
your treasure hunt coming along?

288
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,291
Going okay.

289
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,958
We've been trying to hit up
every place with a storehouse,

290
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,500
but there sure are a lot of 'em.

291
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
Unless we find a way
to get help from others,

292
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,250
there'll be no end.

293
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,958
That's the kind of thing
your generation is good at.

294
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,875
Ms. Kozuki.

295
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,041
Yes?

296
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,000
[SUZUHARA]
What are you the minister of?

297
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,208
Time you made use
of your weapons.

298
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,791
That was a complete
waste of a trip.

299
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,666
Except, what the professor
said was totally true.

300
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm the queen here now,
but I know next to nothing

301
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,833
about this town.

302
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,750
Make use of my weapons, huh?

303
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,416
Hey, what's the deal
with those tablets

304
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
that the city workers
left with some of them?

305
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,750
What was that?

306
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,958
Oh, the municipal
government recently

307
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,125
handed those out
to seniors living alone.

308
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,125
The idea was that they
could get health checkups

309
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,666
while they were at home.

310
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm not sure they're actually
being used that way, though.

311
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,416
But that means the
groundwork is already there.

312
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,166
Ooh! Do you have an idea?

313
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,750
Don't you think
a town where the seniors

314
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,791
are internet savvy
could be a cool thing?

315
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,791
Then we'd be able to use
the internet to ask them

316
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,833
about the lost festival
treasures, too!

317
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,500
--[SHIORI] Sounds great!
--[YOSHINO] Yeah!

318
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,583
We can call it:

319
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,541
"The Plan to Teach
Manoyaman Seniors

320
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,208
Social Media and Gather the
Missing Festival Treasures"!

321
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,375
Concise.

322
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,041
We'll call it the
Mano-S plan for short!

323
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,625
[KIYO] Oh, no!
I touched the wrong thing again.

324
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,166
[SANAE] This is where you
switch to hiragana.

325
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
And this is where
you convert it to kanji!

326
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,083
Then you just tap
right here, see?

327
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,166
Oh!

328
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,750
That's actually
pretty easy, isn't it?

329
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,541
So, this one is for pictures?

330
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah, that's right!

331
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,958
And this is for video.

332
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,208
[RIRIKO] If you press here,
you can go back.

333
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,041
[KIYO]
Oh, you're right!

334
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,250
Thanks, young lady!

335
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,125
I want to know
more about butts.

336
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,541
[TABLET]
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

337
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,166
Masa, come on,
what are you doing?

338
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,833
You got butts in there?

339
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,041
[TABLET] I don't think I'm ready
for that kind of relationship.

340
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,291
[MAKI]
Oh, my god.

341
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,208
[SHIORI]
It reads like this, see?

342
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,041
[tablet chimes]

343
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,875
Okay! Now you're registered!

344
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,416
You can send each other
messages whenever you want!

345
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
Wow.

346
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,458
Learning from a pretty young
lady sure did make this easier!

347
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,708
[laughs]

348
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,250
Everyone!

349
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,625
If you've got any friends that
couldn't make it here today,

350
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,541
please ask them about
the festival treasures

351
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,500
if you would!

352
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,541
[GROUP]
Okay!

353
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,500
[OLDER MAN 17A]
All right!

354
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,208
Did you get a shot of that one?

355
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,083
[OLDER MAN 17B]
Yep, it's perfect!

356
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,500
You're in a little bit
a trouble, then, aren't cha?

357
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,041
[OLDER MAN 17D]
I don't know who this guy is,

358
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,333
but he's surprisingly good!

359
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,750
Now Bishop to King,

360
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,250
and that's checkmate.

361
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,958
Adios, Lucia!
I hope you find the matsudodon!

362
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,041
Gracias, amiga!
See you again!

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,250
That's so cool!

364
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,833
You became really good
friends with the Cryptids,

365
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,166
huh, Riichan?

366
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,958
Manoyama's network
keeps getting bigger and bigger!

367
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,708
You know, seniors generally
tend to stick together, too.

368
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,458
But by reinforcing their
communication via the web,

369
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,500
the seniors will
feel less isolated!

370
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,083
The Mano-S Plan
has some unexpected benefits!

371
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,125
And before long, the buses
will all be driving themselves.

372
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,916
[SANAE] The professor said it'll
take another couple decades,

373
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,958
but it's possible now,
technologically speaking.

374
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,916
If it's a legal issue,
they could make Manoyama

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,291
an exception, right?

376
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,833
[SHIORI] That would solve
the problem for people

377
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,083
who shouldn't be driving!

378
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,333
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Thanks.

379
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,166
Oh. Lost your appetite?

380
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,833
[TAKAMIZAWA]
I just feel kinda full.

381
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,875
Once the self-driving
cars make it here,

382
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,375
you'll be out of a job, huh?

383
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,166
Will not! What do you know
about it, anyway, little girl?

384
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,541
Buses are not that simple!

385
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,333
They aren't the same
as a car at all!

386
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,750
Some things just require
a human touch.

387
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,916
What are you talking about?

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,458
Your whole life's on rails!

389
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,208
You go round and around the
same route every single day!

390
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,791
No, buses don't go
on rails, you fool!

391
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,916
They move around freely,
like me, so there!

392
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,791
[ERIKA]
Why are you so pissed, loser?

393
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
The loser here is you!

394
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,208
Go, run on home,
Tacrappyzawa!

395
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,333
Shut up, flat-chest!

396
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,083
That's it, you're
banned from now on!

397
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,416
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Fine!

398
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,791
I have a feeling we
might've touched a sore spot

399
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,416
for Takamizawa.

400
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,916
Yeah, I think we did.

401
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,458
Hello, hello. I'm Onono Komachi.

402
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
--[MASA] I got it!
--[KIYO] Got it!

403
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,875
Turning your voice into writing.

404
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,666
It seems like magic!

405
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,041
And to think our generation
used rotary phones!

406
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,166
Now if you want to,

407
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,583
you can have your
community meet-ups

408
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,041
without ever leaving home!

409
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,208
[SHIGE] Thank you all so
much for your help with this!

410
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,750
[GORO]
Oh, yes, many thanks!

411
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,125
No, it's our pleasure!

412
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,458
It sure would be nice to
see the other person's face

413
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,500
while we talk.

414
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,750
Don't lie.

415
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,291
What you actually want
to see is their butts.

416
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,125
Damn straight!

417
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,875
[laughing]

418
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,333
See their face...

419
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,125
[USHIMATSU]
That was it! [chuckles]

420
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,416
[SHIORI]
Mr. Kadota!

421
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,583
[YOSHINO] You were released
from the hospital?

422
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,916
That's right, I'm back!

423
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,208
[laughing]

424
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,833
Oh, Minister of IT.

425
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,166
I heard you're treasure hunting
on the Internet.

426
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,666
Yes, we are,

427
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,500
but we also want more active
participation from seniors,

428
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,208
so we're thinking of making an
informational web series.

429
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,375
Sounds like fun.

430
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,250
You can use my
place if you want.

431
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,416
I've got a camera.

432
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,041
Really, Gen? Thank you!

433
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,625
That would be so perfect!

434
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,208
Hello, everyone!
Thanks for joining!

435
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,958
This is the new
Manoyama Channel,

436
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,125
the source for all
your local info!

437
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,375
For our viewers at home,
if you connect,

438
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,708
you'll show up
on a little screen,

439
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,875
so don't be afraid to
join in the conversation!

440
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,541
That's right, don't be shy!

441
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,458
[MASA]
Hey, can you see me?

442
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,625
Oh, we've already got one!

443
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,708
Hello, Masa. We can see you.

444
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,958
Looking sexy, as always, Sanae!

445
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,166
Masa! Come on, now!

446
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,791
You dirty old pervert.

447
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
That's me!

448
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,583
Oh, that's right! Hey, Gen?

449
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,791
How'd the Mahjong end up?

450
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,333
You won't believe it.

451
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,500
Ushimatsu ended up taking it
all his very first time back!

452
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,250
[MASA]
What? That crazy bum!

453
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,750
What the heck are they doing?

454
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,166
It doesn't matter; it's okay.

455
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,041
Yeah, it's not like we're trying
to get the whole world

456
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,291
to watch or anything.

457
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,791
It's just a community
for the people

458
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,333
of Manoyama to come together.

459
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,500
[SANAE] This afternoon,
we'll be broadcasting live

460
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,000
from Michiyo's house.

461
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,541
[GEN] Feel free to use your time
however you want, Michiyo!

462
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,583
[SANAE]
Michiyo?

463
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,333
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

464
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,625
[SANAE] Uh-oh, looks like she
hasn't noticed yet.

465
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,208
[MAKI, SHIORI, YOSHINO]
What is happening?

466
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,916
[NOGE] Those seniors
are surprisingly active.

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,083
You mean the
Manoyama Channel thing?

468
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,541
Yeah, check this guy out.

469
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
I make cabinets just for fun.

470
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,583
And I'm better at it
than these young kids.

471
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,333
He makes cabinets for fun.

472
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,750
Man, I feel lazy.

473
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,625
And look, there's a
bulletin board here, too.

474
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,500
There's this one old guy
who blew my mind

475
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,000
with how much he
knows about sixties jazz!

476
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,041
I can't believe I found someone
to talk about that with

477
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,958
in Manoyama!

478
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,875
So you've been
going to visit him lately?

479
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,916
Yeah, it's cool!

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
He lives way out
in the mountains,

481
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,000
so we can play records
as loud as we want

482
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,250
and no one complains.

483
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,500
And he's got this
super cool old amp!

484
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,041
This town's not bad!

485
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,166
Who woulda thought?

486
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,541
Huh.

487
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,958
That's crazy.

488
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,041
These old guys have gotten
pretty good with the web.

489
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,958
How's the group chat going?

490
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,666
[MAKI]
So far, so good.

491
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,208
Great! I bet we'll
learn something about

492
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,000
the festival treasures soon.

493
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,041
Is there anything new
in the questions section?

494
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,958
Well, we seem to be
getting the same question

495
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,833
over and over, actually.

496
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
I wonder why.

497
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,333
Those are some dirty old guys!

498
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,916
So, what about you?

499
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,500
[RIRIKO] People aren't getting
along very well on the boards.

500
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,541
Huh?

501
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,333
[SANAE] Maybe we should have
made them use their real names.

502
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,166
And it seems like more of them
are becoming shut-ins now.

503
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,250
[SANAE]
Huh?

504
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,125
Some of them are
commenting all day long.

505
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,500
Whoa, seriously?

506
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,791
I guess it's better than
having nothing to do, right?

507
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,875
Let's just keep an eye on them.

508
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,333
Where's Yoshino?

509
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,916
The professor called her,
so she went over to see him.

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,125
The professor?

511
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,375
--Whoa.
--What is it?

512
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,875
A fight is breaking out.

513
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,875
[SANAE] "I'm coming over
to kick your ass, Goro."

514
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,416
[SANAE] Hm?!
Wait, this is an actual threat!

515
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,708
Who the hell wrote that?

516
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,333
We'd better get over
to Goro's place right now!

517
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,875
[SHIGE]
You fat young punk!

518
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,125
I should have known it
was you who threatened me!

519
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,333
You're imagining things!

520
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,166
Where's your proof,
you skinny old corpse?

521
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,458
Would you stop it, you two?

522
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,916
You're both well over
eighty years old!

523
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,041
[SANAE]
What's going on?

524
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,166
[SHIGE] This guy is constantly
making fun of me!

525
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,000
Making sneaky remarks online!

526
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,916
[GORO]
I'd say it to your face!

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,250
When would I have taken
that picture, anyway?

528
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,500
[RIRIKO] "Look at Shige's
tiny little cucumbers!

529
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,583
They're cracking me up!"

530
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,958
[SHIORI]
Huh?

531
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,875
Okay, okay, we got it!
Now let's calm down, please!

532
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,208
We're going to start
making everyone

533
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,916
use their real names
from now on.

534
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,958
[YOSHINO]
Are you serious?

535
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,375
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

536
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,583
I'll head right back.

537
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,750
Thanks to you
and your friends,

538
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,041
my friends and I have
actually learned quite a bit.

539
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,458
Thank you for that.

540
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,666
Well, looks like we've
created some problems, too.

541
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,000
At the dawn of
the internet, it was different.

542
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,416
People had to
register to use it,

543
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,791
so they were more courteous.

544
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,541
Then, screen names
were introduced,

545
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,958
encouraging lawlessness.

546
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,083
Next came flat-rate
plans creating shut-ins.

547
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,291
[chuckles]

548
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,291
History has a way of
repeating itself, huh?

549
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,250
I don't know that it's
anything to laugh about.

550
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,375
And remember, you were the
one who encouraged Sanae

551
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,958
to do this in the first place!

552
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,166
[SUZUHARA] Well, I
suppose the time is right.

553
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,500
Ms. Koharu.

554
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,708
I'm terribly sorry,

555
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,625
but I'm going to have
to take you hostage.

556
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,750
What, now?

557
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,875
[SHIORI]
Yoshi sure is late tonight.

558
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,708
She said she'd be
right back, didn't she?

559
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,250
She did. I wonder
if something happened.

560
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,375
--[RIRIKO gasps]
--What is it this time?

561
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,208
The professor's house.

562
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,083
[SUZUHARA] We, the people
of Warabiya village,

563
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,250
wish to express our
opposition to the removal

564
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,625
of our bus route,

565
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,583
as well our deep
disillusionment and rage.

566
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,958
People are the
foundation of the state.

567
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,750
If you deem it necessary
to forsake us,

568
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,583
then we will be forced
to do the same to you.

569
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,000
In light of that,
we hereby withdraw

570
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,250
from the Kingdom of Chupakabura!

571
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,375
What?!

572
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,583
They're withdrawing
from the Kingdom?

573
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,333
But not from Manoyama?

574
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,166
For real,
what is he talking about?

575
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,500
Hey, look over there!

576
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,791
It's Yoshi!

577
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,458
[MAKI] Girl, what is
going on with you?

578
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,333
[SENIORS]
Hey hey, ho! Hey, ho!

579
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,416
Ho.

580
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,541
[SANDAL] My cousin wouldn't
listen to his dad, my uncle,

581
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,583
for five whole years
after my uncle forgot

582
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,666
to erase his browsing history.

583
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,000
Next time:
"Minerva's Saké Saucer."
