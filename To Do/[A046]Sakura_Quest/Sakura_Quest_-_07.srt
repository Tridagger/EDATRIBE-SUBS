it really hit me hard.

a pile of wood.

to use a house.

will do for the town!

find a replacement house,

a problem with that.

00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,625
[gasps]

177
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,291
You'd better thank him.

178
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,333
Yeah, whatever. I didn't
ask for his help.

179
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,125
I'm taking a walk.
I don't wanna run into him.

180
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,375
I had no idea the
Oden Minister's dad

181
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,875
was the vice principal here!
Wonder what he's like.

182
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,750
He's here now.

183
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,250
Where is he?

184
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,625
Over there.

185
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,333
[SANAE]
Woah. He looks super intense.

186
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,666
[BOY 7A] You're so stupid!
I'm the very scariest!

187
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,958
[BOY 7B]
Nuh-uh!

188
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,833
You're just a crappy
zombie that gets killed!

189
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,291
No way! That's you!

190
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,791
--You're the crappiest!
--[SANAE] Hey, guys,

191
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
we're about to get started,
so let's quiet down, okay--

192
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:00,916
Oh!

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Shut up, four-eyes big-butt!

194
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:07,958
[CHILDREN] Big butt!
Big butt! Big butt! Big butt!

195
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,916
--[SANAE] Wh-What?
--Big butt! Big butt!

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,750
Big butt! Big butt!

197
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,875
Okay, guys! Are we ready
to have fun today?

198
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,625
[CHILDREN]
Yeah!

199
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,541
They're mini monsters!

200
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,041
This takes me back.

201
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,708
Hey.

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,250
I'm bad with kids.

203
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,125
Oh, really?

204
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,125
[RIRIKO]
This book is still here, though.

205
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
Guess you went to
this school, too, huh?

206
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,333
[RIRIKO]
Yes.

207
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,250
I started when you
were in sixth grade.

208
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, wow.

209
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,000
[RIRIKO]
Uh, so. Um...

210
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
Thanks for helping me
the other day.

211
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,041
[MAKI]
That? Sure.

212
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,666
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

213
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,875
But, I--

214
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,708
Acting is living in
an imaginary situation.

215
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,666
Don't think about
the performance.

216
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,208
Just be present in
that moment in time.

217
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,083
It really can be as
simple as that. Cool?

218
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
Yeah.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
So? How was it?

220
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583
Did you end up
enjoying it at all?

221
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,333
[RIRIKO]
Mm...

222
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,708
Hey! They're still
doing the same show!

223
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,625
That's crazy!

224
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,250
[RIRIKO]
You mean <i>Snow White</i> ?

225
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
[MAKI]
Yep, we did it, too.

226
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,208
I lost at rock-paper-scissors

227
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,000
and didn't get to
play Snow White.

228
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,958
There were so many
students back in the day.

229
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh! There I am!

230
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,958
Look at that, I played
a tree. A tree!

231
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,500
[MAKI chuckles]

232
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,291
I remember one year,
there was a girl

233
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,125
with a huge smile that was the
most graceful tree I ever saw.

234
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,250
Bet it was you.

235
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,666
In truth, it probably was.

236
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,750
So you've liked acting
since you were a little kid?

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,916
Yeah, I guess.

238
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,083
[MAKI]
Hey, here's a tip.

239
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,625
You've gotta do
more than "like" it

240
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,916
or you won't get far,
kid. Trust me.

241
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,375
[MOE]
Please, wake up, Takeshi!

242
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,708
You have to wake up!

243
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
I love you, and I know
you love me, too!

244
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,708
You have to remember
what we said! Stop!

245
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,041
[groans]

246
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,083
Cut! That'll work!

247
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,583
Still not really
following the plot, here.

248
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
Basically, the house
is a special place

249
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
that links our reality
to an alternate one.

250
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,375
So they're going to burn
the whole house down

251
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,708
to block off the entrance?
Yeah, I don't get it at all.

252
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,458
I was really feeling that scene!

253
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,833
You nailed it, Moe!

254
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,375
Oh, thanks so much!

255
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,916
It was important
to me to show her

256
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,458
struggling with
her love, you know?

257
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm sorry about before.

258
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,208
I think I kinda lost it.
What I said was really mean.

259
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,833
No worries. I should
apologize, too.

260
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:07,250
You're just trying to do your
job. I made it harder for you.

261
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,583
[YOSHINO]
It's okay.

262
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,208
You sure you're fine
about the house?

263
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,291
It doesn't really matter,
when it comes down to it.

264
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,583
It was never my
decision to make.

265
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,416
But it did occur to me
that she might've actually

266
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,458
liked this--having the house
preserved in this movie,

267
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,125
rather than it just
being forgotten.

268
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,791
I mean, I hope so.

269
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,041
[FUJIWARA]
Okay, let's take five, everyone!

270
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,291
Once the sun goes down,

271
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,875
we'll start shooting
the final scene!

272
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,750
Everybody be ready!

273
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,916
Romeo! Oh, Romeo!

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,833
Wherefore art thou?

275
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,541
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

276
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,875
[ANGELICA]
If it's the sun card,

277
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,041
you'll continue
to pursue acting.

278
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,791
But if you choose
the Reaper card,

279
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,333
you'll give it up, completely.

280
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,291
Make sure you choose carefully.

281
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,375
[door bell rings]

282
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,250
[KOSUKE]
Ah, there you are.

283
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,750
Oh, hey, Kosuke.

284
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,458
That's right, I owe
you a melon popsicle.

285
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,125
--Do you want it?
--[KOSUKE] Nah, it's fine.

286
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,416
For you. It's from Dad.

287
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Uh-- What is it?

288
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,375
He said you'll know it
when you see it.

289
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,208
[ANGELICA]
Want to watch it?

290
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,625
Please, I'm lost.

291
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,416
[MAKI]
Is this <i>Snow White</i> ?

292
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,000
Come this way!

293
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,375
[KOSUKE]
Sure is.

294
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,583
Dad was in charge of filming
school events back then.

295
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,208
[KOSUKE]
You're really graceful!

296
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,958
Yeah, I guess I was.

297
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,166
Apparently, the principal
was pretty pissed off.

298
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,583
He chewed Dad out.

299
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,791
Because he didn't film any
of the other kids at all.

300
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,000
Huh?

301
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,791
I see.

302
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,208
Who woulda thought?

303
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,166
Seems to me you've found
your very first fan.

304
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,791
[FILM CREW 7E] You guys have
fed us really well this week!

305
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,875
Thanks so much!

306
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,791
What? <i>Fukuragi</i> is yellowtail?

307
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,875
Baby ones.

308
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,250
[SHIORI]
We've got plenty of food here!

309
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be afraid to get seconds!

310
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,250
[FUJIWARA]
What? Are you serious?

311
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,250
[SONODA]
Come on, they're in love!

312
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,458
Takeshi is stuck inside
a burning house.

313
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,875
You don't think it's
weird that she'd just

314
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,833
sit outside and scream instead
of going in after him?

315
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,916
She should fling
herself inside! Dive in!

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,833
Oh, yeah, I totally get it.

317
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,416
But at this point,
it's hard to change it.

318
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,083
[SONODA] It doesn't matter
how difficult it is!

319
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,458
The plot is a living thing,
it's a living thing!

320
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
You've got to be kidding.

321
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,500
Agreed. I want to
shoot it that way.

322
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,625
Well, now! Atta girl!
That's the spirit!

323
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,958
Moe, you really shouldn't make
these decisions on your own!

324
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,750
But don't you think it's
only natural for her

325
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,583
to want to be with the one
she loves until the very end?

326
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,916
I can't let you to do
something this dangerous.

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,083
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,500
The company's made
a big investment in you

329
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,958
and there's nobody else
to take your place.

330
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,958
But I really want to do it.

331
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,416
[MAKI]
I can take Moe's place.

332
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,875

Maki?

333
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,083
What's she doing?

Maki, no.

I know I'm a bit taller,

but if we shoot from
behind, you can't tell.

337
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,958
Uh, wait, who are you?

338
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,333
--Stand-in?
--[MOE] It's dangerous, though.

339
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,208
Really.

340
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,125
Please let me do this, okay?

341
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,583
It's not every day an
opportunity comes along.

342
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,833
Yeah, all right.

343
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,791
That's what I'm talkin'
about! Let's get to it!

344
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,958
Maki, are you sure this is okay?

345
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,958

were to happen?

I love it.

This is the thing
I love to do most.

00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,250
I can't ignore it anymore.

349
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,000
Everyone! I'm excited
to work with you.

350
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,500
[FUJIWARA] Okay, if you're
done with dinner,

351
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,291
we could use help digging!

352
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,416
[FILM CREW 7F] Try to project
the sound in that direction.

353
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,250
I'll give the signal...

354
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,458
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

355
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,625
[FILM CREW 7H]
Once you've moved that...

356
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,833
[CHIEF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 7A]
Okay, the director says

357
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,791
he wants us to move
two meters to the right.

358
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,833
Okay, so, you're going
to run over this way,

359
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,208
and then jump into
that hole, right there.

360
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
There is a fire
truck standing by,

361
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,541
so if things get really
dangerous, we'll stop shooting.

362
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,125
Cool. I'm ready when you are.

363
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,000
Number one is go!

364
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,375
[FILM CREW 7L]
Two is go!

365
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,041
[FILM CREW 7M]
Three is go!

366
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,875
[FILM CREW 7N] The average
wind speed is zero point five.

367
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,916
[FILM CREW 7P]
Everyone standby!

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,291
[FILM CREW 7Q]
Lights off!

369
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
Just one shot!

370
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,375
So let's get this one right!

371
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,083
[FILM CREW]
Yes, sir!

372
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,583
We're rolling!

373
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,333
Stand by.

374
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,916
Action!

375
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,375
Takeshi, no!

376
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,708
And, cut! Okay!

377
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,833
Maki, you were
absolutely perfect!

378
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,958
You play me better
than I play myself!

379
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,666
Thanks, it really had been
a while. It felt good!

380
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,500
[ISOGAI] Moe! They've got
a bouquet for you!

381
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,250
'Kay!

382
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,083
I hope we get to work together
again sometime soon!

383
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,041
I'll see you around!

384

[YOSHINO]
Maki! You okay?

385
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,375
You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

386
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,875
Nope.

387
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,458
[sighs] I'm just so relieved
you're back safe and sound!

388
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,916
You really are a genuinely
kind soul, aren't you?

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,208
Uh... I don't know--

390
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,666
Thanks, Yoshi. So much.

391
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,333
Huh? I didn't do
anything, though.

392
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Wow, it all happened so quickly!

393
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,916
[TOWNSPERSON 7C]
That was quite a show!

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,583
Okay, everyone,
that's scene 112!

395
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,958
So, on behalf of Sonoda's
entire crew, that's a wrap!

396
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,958
Thanks so much for
all your hard work!

00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,375
[FILM CREW chattering]

398
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,291
[FUJIWARA]
Ms. Shinomiya!

399
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,791
[pants] You've been such
an incredible help.

400
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,875
If we hadn't had everyone's
wonderful support,

401
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,416
this shoot would
have been a disaster.

402
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,916
Thank you!

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,041
Not at all.

404
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,625
It's rare that
people on location

405
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,166
go this far to help us.

406
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,708
I'm starting on
another shoot soon,

407
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,041
and I'll be sure to tell
everyone about this place.

408
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,041
Oh, really? I appreciate that.

409
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,458
You know, I've been
kinda wondering

410
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,666
if the Queen might have
had some kind of attachment

411
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
to that house.

412
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,208
Sorry?

413
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,791
[FUJIWARA]
Oh. You didn't hear?

414
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,166
About this?

415
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,458
It's the woman that
used to live here.

416
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,916
The Queen asked us
to be sure to give her

417
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
a special mention and thanks
in the end credits.

418
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,833
What?

419
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,375
[FUJIWARA] She said we
should value the memory

420
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,041
of the person that lived here...

421
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,916
That a house is more than
just a pile of wood.

422
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,041
Come visit again,
okay! Take care!

423
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,208
[YOSHINO] Great job!
We actually pulled it off!

424
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,541
To us!

425
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,541
[MAKI, SANAE, RIRIKO, SHIORI]
To us!

426
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,875
I mean, we had to
deal with a lot of stuff,

427
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,458
but thanks to everyone's
sheer brilliance,

428
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,791
we did it, 'n this beer's good!

429
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,666
It's weird, everyone
left so quickly.

430
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,083
They hardly said anything.

431
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,375
I thought we'd at least
have a little wrap party.

432
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,583
I guess it really
was low budget, huh?

433
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,416
But what matters is that
now we're building up

434
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,458
a really good reputation,
and that might help us

435
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,958
bring the town back to life!

was really cool.

Wow. Thanks, lady.

some great people

441

supporting me and stuff.

442
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,500
It's nice to be home, isn't it?

443
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,958
Yeah. It was good to run
into the younger me.

444
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,666
You're always welcome here!

445
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,791
That's just the kind
of town Manoyama is.

446
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,000
[SANAE]
What kind, exactly?

447
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,125
I wish more people would
run away to see us.

448
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:15,958
Hear, hear.

449
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,583
I'm going to run away, too.

450
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,875
No! You're gonna
stay right here!

451
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,291
With me.

452
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,500
[chuckles] Uh-oh, say something
to your Minister, Queen.

453
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,750
Are you asleep?

454
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,458
[laughs] At least put
your beer down first.

455
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,333
Jeez, she has a vice
grip on this thing!

456
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,458
She won't let go!

00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,375
[RIRIKO]
Rigor mortis.

458
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,625
[SANAE]
Hey, don't kill her off.

459
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,333
[MAKI] Like, "Time of
death: 12 hours ago."

00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,666
What's up?

463
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,875
You won't believe it--

464
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,791
it's a movie production
company from Tokyo!

465
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,083
Seriously? So, Mr. Fujiwara
kept his promise!

466
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,000

speak to the Queen.

Yes. Hello!

of Chupakabura,

471
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,500
[MOVIE PRODUCER 7A] So,
I heard from this guy I know.

472
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,375
Is it true that in Manoyama
you can shoot car chases

473
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,166
and blow up temples if you want?

474
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,583
Huh?

475
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,958
[MOVIE PRODUCER 7A]
If it's true, we'd love to shoot

476
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,750
a big-time, knock-your-socks-off
movie in your town!

477
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,375
I really think he might
have oversold us.

478
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,750
[SANDAL] The movie
wrapped, but apparently,

479
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,291
my scene was cut.

480
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,125
Boo.

00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,250
