the dance audition,

Well, I think
I did the best I could.

I wish I had your confidence!

step forward.

Oh, friend.

I hope it goes great.

[RIRIKO]
Hello...?

00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,708
Okay, this sure
isn't a great feeling.

36
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,250
It's hard to believe
nobody showed at all.

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,083
Maybe we didn't
give enough notice?

38
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,458
[MAKI]
Ms. Koharu!

39
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,333
Feed my belly, I'm hungry!

--Hey, Maki.
--[MAKI] Yo.

00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,375
That was really fast!

42
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,375
Yep, a lot faster
than I expected.

43
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,791
I didn't get the part,
so I just came right back.

44
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,791
I'm finished with acting,
so from now on,

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll focus on my role
as Chief Handywoman!

46
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,291
And I look forward
to working with all of you

47
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,375
once again!

48
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,875
Well, in that case...

49
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,916
I guess it's time to eat!

50
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,583
Mmm! This is great!

51
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,208
Well done, Chef Shinomiya!

00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,416
Thanks, guys!

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,416
Doesn't mean much if
nobody comes, though.

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,291
It's the curse of
the Blood-Soaked Santa.

55

Oh, please, can we not?

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,458
You know, seems like nobody
cares about this school.

57
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,750
I wonder why.

58
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,041
Maybe it has to do
with the fact

59
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,500
that it never really closed.

60
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,833
Huh?

61
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,000
I just mean, I was in
the last graduating class

62
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,000
of this school,
but there was never any

63
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,166
closing ceremony.

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,375
Closing ceremony?

65
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,916
Like an event
to let everyone know

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,458
they're closing the school.

67
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,791
So the graduates can
get together and stuff.

68
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,583
Right. Opinions were
divided over whether

69
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,166
we should close it or not,

70
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,416
so we ended up having our
graduation ceremony,

71
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,833
and that was it.

72
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,500
Oh, so, that's what you meant.
"Never really closed."

73
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,666
Yeah.

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,458
Without closure,
you can't move on.

75
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,708
[USHIMATSU]
A closing ceremony?

[YOSHINO]
Yes!

77
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,666
It's been exactly ten years
since it was closed.

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,875
So we can really make
a big deal about it!

79
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,750
We wanna try to contact
as many graduates

80
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,916
as we can who have
since moved away.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,041
[USHIMATSU] Well, first, how did
the whole hot lunch thing go?

82
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,375
Oh, yeah, that.

83
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,583
It didn't go so well.

84
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,125
[USHIMATSU]
You see? What'd I tell you?

85
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,291
You needed fried bread
on the menu!

86
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,750
You know, I graduated
from that school, too.

87
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,791
If you really did hold a
ceremony, I'd want to go.

88
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,041
But hey, are you
ready for the festival?

89
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,166
Very good point!

90
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,416
The Tourism Board
shouldn't be holding

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,791
a school's closing
ceremony to begin with!

92
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,208
Yeah, that's true,

93
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,541
but instead of just waiting
for it to be demolished,

94
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,416
this would be
a good opportunity.

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
We can look at how we might
repurpose the building

96
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,625
in a positive way.

97
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,083
[SANAE]
Which could, in turn,

98
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,541
potentially contribute to
increased activity in town.

for the festival, too,

feelings won't be enough!

reusing the building.

shaved ice in winter?

00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
Yeah. Not a bad idea.

178
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,416
The Board will
probably surprise you.

179
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
They're not near
as stiff as you think.

180
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,291
I doubt they'd say no
to a proposal like this.

181
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,625
You think so?

182
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,166
[IWAO] When will you
take it to them?

183
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,333
If you'd like, I can go
with you when you do.

184
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,916
Would you really?

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,500
After all, rural politics are
really all about connections,

186
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,500
you know.

187
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,458
[GROUP]
Thank you, Mr. Midorikawa!

188
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,375
Yes, we appreciate your help.

189
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,083
By the way,
what's this thing?

190
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,291
What's the "Second Middle
Memorial Stage"?

191
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,166
Oh, that's just a--

192
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,333
[IWAO] Are you planning to
have something go on there?

193
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,541
You should probably
be more specific about it.

194
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,958
Sure! Yeah, we'll,
uh--That's it!

195
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,458
You know what people remember?

196
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,583
The Blood-Soaked Santa!

197
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,500
--[GROUP] What?
--We can put on a play!

198
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,208
I mean, after all, it's gonna
be right around Christmas!

199
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
Yeah, but what about the
part where he's blood soaked?

200
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,750
[YOSHINO]
We'll free his ghost!

201
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,833
Hold on a second, what do
you mean, "free his ghost"?

202
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,041
The director of the play will
be our Chief Handywoman, Maki!

203
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,666
So, we'll be in
very good hands!

204
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,958
Yoshino! You never even--Ugh!

205
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,875
Oh, good!

206
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,166
Well, if that's the case...

207
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,791
[SANAE]
It sure has piled up, huh?

208
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,291
It's not actually that much.

209
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,333
It'll probably melt pretty soon.

210
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,083
[RIRIKO] Right, winter doesn't
really start until the new year.

211
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
All units, attack!

212
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,458
[GROUP laughing]

213
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,583
[MAKI] Really, Queen?
What're you doing?

214
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,416
[yelps]

215
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,708
Oh, the queen's been hit!

216
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,083
Medic! Queen down!

217
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,916
This is no time
for us to be playing!

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,166
Do you realize how many
days are left till Christmas?

219
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,458
Whoa, Maki.

220
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,500
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

221
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,291
There's no way
I'm half-assing it.

222
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,875
Cool!

223
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,750
You guys are actually
pretty lucky to have found me!

224
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,416
Don't like to brag,
but I played the lead

225
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
a lot in elementary school.

226
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
I was in the ping pong club,
does that help?

227
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,833
And you're unemployed,
so you're not busy.

228
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,375
You're not busy, either.

229
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,125
I'm kinda surprised
to hear you did drama

230
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,666
in high school, Yamada!

231
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,458
Mr. Kadota stole
my role in the movie,

232
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,708
so I want another chance!

233
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,000
Sweet justice!

234
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,541
I'd really like
to thank my senpai

235
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,041
from my old acting troupe.

236
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,833
There's no way we'd
ever turn down a request

237
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,708
from our lovely friend, Maki!

238
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah, let's kick some butt!

239
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,625
The show must go on, guys!

240
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,500
Let's keep up the good work!

241
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,291
[SHIORI]
We haven't actually started yet.

242
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,875
[MAKI] Well, we don't have a
lotta time to put this together,

243
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,791
but we're gonna give it
our best shot.

244
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,083
I'm counting on you!

245
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,916
--[MAKI] Thank you.
--You gonna stay up?

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,833
[MAKI]
Yeah, a bit longer.

247
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,125
When you write
the script yourself

248
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,083
and you're also
an actor in the show,

249
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,000
you change things
till the last minute.

250
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,583
Interesting.

251
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,583
I'm kind of feeling like...

252
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,541
Like the Maki that
we've seen around here--

253
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,250
maybe she's just a tiny part
of who you really are.

254
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,291
Well, remember,

255
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,958
I had just come
back here in defeat.

256
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,708
You met me at my
very lowest point.

257
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,958
But I've finally
made up my mind.

258
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,791
No matter what I do
for work in the future,

259
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,375
I'll always try to bring
something I like to it.

260
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,208
I won't get upset
just because it may be

261
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,500
something I don't love.

262
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,000
Instead of complaining,

263
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,750
I'll try to infuse the situation
with creativity, you know?

264
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,291
Yeah, I get it.

265
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,333
I'm a little jealous, you see.

266
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,083
You have something
that you're passionate about

267
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,208
that keeps you going.

268
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,500
I wonder if I'll ever
find something like that.

269
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,416
Who knows?
Maybe you already have.

270
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,083
Ugh, what should I do?

271
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,166
What is it?

272
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,375
The last scene.

273
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,375
I want something to
really make an impact,

274
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,625
like, aside from the dialogue.

275
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,125
Really make an impact.

276
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,666
[GRADUATE 20A]
Ah, here it is!

277
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,916
I found us! Look!

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,500
[GRADUATE 20B]
Wow, that brings back memories!

279
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,625
You had a shaved head back then!

280
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,833
Oh, my.

281
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,916
Your graduating class
looks a bit lonely.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,875
There were so many
more students here

283
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,416
back when I graduated.

284
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,875
Hurry, get in the shot, teacher!

285
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,166
[GRADUATES laugh]

286
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,916
Come on, now.
Sit down, you two crazies.

287
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,875
[SHIORI]
So many people came!

288
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,916
[YOSHINO]
Yeah.

289
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,291
It's time. All right,
you're up, Yoshino.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,458
Greetings, Manoyama Second
Middle School graduates!

291
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,500
And welcome,
other friends of the school!

292
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,666
Thank you all.

293
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,416
The Closing Ceremony is for you!

294
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,125
For all of you!

295
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,083
We'd like to start the night
with a special greeting

296
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,708
from the school's last
principal, Mr. Yoshihiko Funazu.

297
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,416
Let's give him a
round of applause!

298
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,083
[AUDIENCE claps]

299
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,833
Ah! I'm totally nervous!

300
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,916
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'm here for you.

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,291
Shut up!

302
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,750
[MR. FUNAZU] I'd like to
sincerely thank the members

303
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,583
of the Board of Tourism
for putting on

304
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,375
this wonderful event
for us this evening.

305
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,416
Okay, students!
Like I always say,

306
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,666
make the day fun!

307
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,708
[AUDIENCE claps]

308
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,750
[taiko drums play]

309
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,000
[GROUP]
Ha!

310
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,583
[AUDIENCE claps]

311
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,666
It's your turn.
Good luck out there.

312
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,708
Thanks!

313
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,875
Okay, the next
number is called:

314
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,375
"The Blood-Soaked Santa"?

315
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,333
Oh, wow, I remember that story!

316
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,750
Oh, man, Christmastime
is almost upon us,

317
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,250
once again.

318
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,500
Hello there, Mr. Reindeer?

319
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,000
Why the heck do I have to
hand out presents tonight?

320
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,791
That's obviously Papa's job!

321
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

322
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,333
I know it's hard to believe it,

323
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,333
but I couldn't make
a turn on an icy road,

324
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,333
and so we ended up crashing.

325
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,041
There's simply too much
snow in Manoyama.

326
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,583
But you can fly, can't you?

327
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,875
What were you doing
on the road, anyway?

328
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
And where on earth is Papa?

329
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:32,958
Well, you see...

330
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,125
Huh?

331
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,833
Santa, you're here!
What happened?

332
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,333
I thought for sure
you were dead!

333
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,708
I'm not dead!

334
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,791
I might have been soaked
in blood, but I'm not dead!

335
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,458
Those little punks
at Second Middle School

336
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,750
were spreading lies!

337
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,208
You lied! So did you!

338
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,000
That's why I'm
asking you, daughter.

339
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,041
Will you do this?

340
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,583
Will you take
my place this year?

341
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,750
I don't want to!

342
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,500
Kids these days are
all totally selfish.

343
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,125
[TAIRA] I want a brand
new combine harvester!

344
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
That won't fit in the chimney!

345
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,125
And I want my very own
house with a garden!

346
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Go ask an oil baron!

347
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
[AUDIENCE laughs]

348
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,916
There are still so many to go!

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,166
Please! There used to be
way more kids than this.

350
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,208
It was a whole lot harder then!

351
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,833
Yay, declining birthrates!

352
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,875
--[AUDIENCE laughs]
--I can't take any more.

353
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,250
But I know I've got to try.

354
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,000
Everyone is out there
waiting to get their presents.

355
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,708
There's one for you!

356
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,125
And there you go!

357
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,333
[ACTOR 20A] I hope Santa
will get here soon!

358
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,958
I know, I can hardly wait!

359
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,291
[MAKI, SHIBUKAWA]
Ho, ho, ho!

360
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,625
Ho, ho, ho!

361
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,458
Yay! Thanks, you rock, Santa!

362
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,333
Hooray! Thanks, Santa!

363
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,458
This is exactly
the one I wanted!

364
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,625
[SHIBUKAWA] The sun is
gonna be up really soon.

365
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,125
Give it up, we'll get the
others to them next year.

366
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,416
No, I can't.

367
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,916
Not when there are still
kids out there waiting.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,166
I remember what
Papa used to say.

369
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,750
"No matter how difficult it
gets, it's never hard at all."

370
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,833
Now, after this,

371
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,166
I finally understand
what he meant.

372
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,000
[SHIBUKAWA]
What's that?

373
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,375
[MAKI]
It's pretty simple.

374
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,083
I'm the one who's getting
the real gift tonight.

375
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,458
You got a gift?

376
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,416
That's right!
Everyone's smiling faces!

377
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
[AUDIENCE]
Ahh!

378
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,958
We made that with our
class back in the day!

379
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:44,000
[AUDIENCE clapping]

380
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,625
[SHIBUKAWA]
Director.

381
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
[clapping continues]

382
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,666
Okay, guys. Let's do it.

383
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
Thanks so much, everyone!

384
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,833
[clapping continues]

385
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,291
[YOSHINO] That concludes
our Closing Ceremony.

386
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,916
Thanks for joining us tonight.

387
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,750
The year after next,

388
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,291
this place is scheduled
to be an empty lot.

389
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,375
So...

390
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,250
For that reason,
we, the Tourism Board,

391
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,250
would like to make a proposal.

392
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,541
This wonderful building
once housed a school

393
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,791
that helped children
grow and thrive.

394
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,041
That purpose may be over now,

395
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,583
but why don't we
give it a new one:

396
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,583
helping Manoyama
grow and thrive!

397
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,500
What if we revived the life
in these dear old halls

398
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,958
as a base for Manoyama culture?

399
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,208
I believe that we can do it!

400
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,458
A base for Manoyama culture.

401
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,375
That's a much better idea
than just demolishing it.

402
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,625
Everyone!

403
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,750
I'd now like to present
our official proposal.

404
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,875
[YOSHINO] The Manoyama Second
Middle School Opening Ceremony!

405
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,625
The heck?
When they'd do this?

406
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,250
Oh, they asked me
to rig that up for 'em.

407
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,166
My friends, starting today,

408
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,541
we'd like to make Second Middle
School a public facility,

409
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,625
open to everyone!

410
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,583
[AUDIENCE claps]

411
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,791
Not a bad idea.

412
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,666
[GROUP]
Cheers!

413
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,416
I haven't felt this way
for a long time!

414
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,833
I know! Reading the surveys,
lots of folks say

415
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,500
they'd like to use the school!

416
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,291
Past choir members want to form
a new mother's chorus!

417
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,666
So sweet!

418
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,875
[YOSHINO] By the way, Maki,
you did an amazing job!

419
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,250
Thanks, so did you!
Your speech was so passionate!

420
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,833
[chuckles]
Really? Thank you!

421
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,625
I guess your passionate
performance inspired me!

422
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,333
You're actually an impressively
driven person, Maki.

423
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,458
It's good to meet you!

424
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,666
Oh, stop it,
you're a total weirdo.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,166
So, hey, I've been thinking.

426
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,625
I might like to start an acting
troupe there at the school.

427
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,083
Acting troupe?

428
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,333
If there's nothing to do,
it's up to us to create it!

429
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,333
That's right!

430
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,000
So what play
are you gonna do?

431
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,500
Well, I've been
thinking I'd like to try

432
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,500
adapting the Dragon Song
into a play.

433
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,791
[SHIORI]
No way, really?

434
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,541
Yeah! You guys said it
was hard to understand

435
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,208
with just the song alone.

436
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,583
So, I think we should
tell the whole story!

437
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,166
That's a great idea.

438
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,625
It'd be cool if we could combine
it with the Mizuchi Festival.

439
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,500
[SHIORI] I love the idea
of a play at the festival!

440
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,833
Let's do it!

441
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,250
And the theme is co-existing
with other cultures.

442
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,208
I can think of no better
setting than the festival

443
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,250
for keeping that story alive,
can you?

444
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,500
Then, at the very end,

445
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,750
Riichan can burst out
and sing the whole song!

446
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,041
I'm filled with
anticipation and trepidation.

447
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,958
Hey, it's okay! So am I!

448
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,041
But we'll work together
and make it happen.

449
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,250
What'll be the name
of the acting troupe?

450
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,041
Come on,
isn't it pretty obvious?

451
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,750
The Royal Chupakabura
Acting Troupe!

452
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,875
Hell, no! Not that!
Anything but that!

453
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,708
All right, sir, that's it.

454
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,125
We'll go ahead and
get started on the repairs,

455
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,375
like you requested.

456
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,541
Here's the thing, no one
remembers requesting it.

457
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,291
[MOVER 20B] The order
was placed by this person.

458
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,333
Who's Mita Kyuro?

459
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,750
Maybe "Santa Claus"?

460
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,416
[SANAE]
Are you kidding me?

461
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,208
Well, the request
wasn't made by us.

462
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,625
That may very well be true,

463
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,000
but we've already
been paid in full, so...

464
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,041
What?

465
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,250
[MINO] We have a benevolent
Secret Santa.

466
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, and what a mystery.
I'm dying to know who it is.

467
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,916
No, it couldn't be.

468
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,333
[SANDAL] "The Oden Detective
part 2" is brilliant.

469
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,708
The part with the
trick that involves

470
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,791
the difference between
karashi and mustard

471
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,083
is pure genius.

472
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,458
Next time: "The Pixie
in the Town of Ice."
