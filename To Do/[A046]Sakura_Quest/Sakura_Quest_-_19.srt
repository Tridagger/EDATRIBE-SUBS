1
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,250
[SANAE] I don't understand
why we had to come

2
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,291
do this at night.

3
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,166
[YOSHINO]
It's urgent!

4
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,625
We're lucky someone
posted that lead

5
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,500
about the festival treasure.

6
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,083
It'll be cool if the
Hanging Drum really is here.

7
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,541
Well, if it is,

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,291
then you guys should know
where they'd keep it, right?

9
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,458
I mean, didn't you three
go to school here?

10
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,708
I actually went to
the other middle school.

11
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,291
Yeah, so did I.

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,125
I went to this one, but I don't
remember anything about a drum.

13
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,000
It's been ten years
since this place shut down.

14
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,750
Not surprising that it's
a little creepy, huh?

15
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,333
[RIRIKO]
This is where he'd pop out.

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,583
The Blood-Soaked Santa.

17
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,541
Blood-Soaked Santa?

18
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,166
It's a classic urban
legend from this school.

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,375
How do you know about that?

20
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,916
Nope! Don't wanna
hear it! La la...

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,125
A Santa was driving
on an icy road

22
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,416
when he slid through a curve,
crashed, and died.

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,208
He's been wandering ever since.

24
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,416
[YOSHINO yelps]

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,166
C'mon, stop trying
to scare us, Riichan!

26
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,958
Okay, why wasn't he flying?

27
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,875
And why would he
come to this school?

28
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,208
[GROUP yelling]

29
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,750
[MAKI]
He's right on time.

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,000
[RIRIKO]
What is... that?

31
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,291
[GROUP gasps]

32
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,958
[YOSHINO]
It's him! Blood-Soaked Santa!

33
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,083
What's he carrying?

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
Don't tell me it's
a reindeer's corpse!

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,375
We'll all be killed.

36
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,666
[SHIORI] May your soul
rest in peace, sir!

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,875
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

38
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,375
[GROUP screams]

39
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,708
A gorilla!

40
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,333
Look, it's a peeping gorilla!

41
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,375
[MAKI]
Would you guys calm down?

42
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,666
This is just my father.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,708
[GROUP]
Huh?

44
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,041
Oh, I guess the
lights do work.

45
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,666
The school might've
been shut down,

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,666
but it wasn't abandoned.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,000
It's still got running
water and electricity.

48
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,666
I assumed you must have checked
all of that stuff earlier!

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
[YOSHINO sighs]

50
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,208
I'm really sorry.

51
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,416
I shouldn't have called you
a gorilla, Mr. Midorikawa.

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,333
Don't worry about it;
he's an ape.

53
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,583
No, Maki,

54
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,791
because that would make
you a little ape girl

55
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
and I just can't have that!

56
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,125
Shiori, you really gotta work on
your mood-lightening jokes.

57
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,166
Thank you so much for your help
with the film shoot,

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,541
Mr. Midorikawa.

59
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,833
The mini-zombies.

60
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,125
Not at all!

61
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,791
The kids loved the
opportunity to do something

62
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,541
others don't get to do.

63
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,791
So, if I may ask,

64
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,041
what brings the Board
of Tourism here tonight?

65
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,916
Well, we're kind of
looking for something.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,875
[IWAO] The Board of Education
has been getting complaints

67
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,833
from around the
neighborhood lately.

68
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,083
Kids hear these rumors
about a Blood-Soaked Santa,

69
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,458
so they get curious and
start poking around.

70
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,458
What? You really think
that's why we're here?

71
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,833
[IWAO]
Isn't it?

72
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,166
What the hell are you
doing wandering around here

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,416
at night, anyway?

74
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,583
Mr. Elementary School
Vice Principal!

75
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,250
This happens to be
my alma mater!

76
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,000
You think I'm happy
my beloved halls

77
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,250
have been turned into some
kind of haunted house?

78
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,833
I'm here tonight patrolling
for any shenanigans!

79
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,083
Um, sir?

80
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,541
We didn't come to snoop
around out of curiosity.

81
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,375
We actually got permission
to enter the school

82
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,041
from the Board of Education.

83
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,625
We're looking for
a festival treasure,

84
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,958
the Hanging Drum.

85
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,500
The one from the Mizuchi
Festival fifty years ago.

86
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,000
The Mizuchi Festival?

87
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,875
[YOSHINO] Yes, we're
planning to revive it!

88
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,500
Cool, right?

89
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
Okay, I get it.

90
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,958
Would've been better to
come in the daytime, though.

91
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,708
That looks less suspicious.

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375
Yeah, sorry about that.

93
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's see, I think it was here.

94
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,583
[IWAO]
'Kay.

[YOSHINO gasps]

96
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,166
It's the hanging drum!

97
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,000
So it really was here!

98
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,166
I'm glad, I'm glad.

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,666
[GROUP]
Thank you for your help!

100
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,500
Yeah, thanks
for all the nothin'.

101
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,291
What was that?!

102
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,666
[GROUP gasps]

103
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,416
Oh. I wasn't talking
about you girls, you're fine.

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Hate to say it, but I
don't see how this thing

105
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,375
could be much use
to you in this state.

106
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,708
Yeah, you're prob'ly right.

107
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,125
[YOSHINO]
Okay, first things first:

108
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,500
how are we gonna move it?

109
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,958
We'll convince Mino
and the others

110
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,541
to help us out tomorrow.

111
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,416
Great!

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,916
Hey, Yoshi,

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,375
I've got some things to do
tomorrow, so I won't make it.

114
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,833
But I took care
of the other thing.

115
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,958
[YOSHINO]
Cool, thanks!

116
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,416
So, Maki, you sure are
a chip off the old block,

117
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
aren't you?

118
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,541
Let's be real. You and your
father have a lot in common.

119
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,000
Like what?

120
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,458
[SANAE] Why don't you take
a chance and move back home?

121
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,666
Your house is closer.

122
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
Staying in the dorm
doesn't make much sense.

123
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,375
But I would totally
miss her if she stopped

124
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,583
living at the dorm.

125
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,416
I'm trying to give her
some healthy advice!

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,083
I have no intention of moving.

127
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,250
So stubborn.

128
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,375
I just don't see
eye to eye with that guy.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
[MINO]
A little more that way!

130
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,375
Okay. Okay.

131
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,791
[YAMADA]
Here we go!

132
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,208
[YAMADA, MINO grunt]

133
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,958
All right, I'm gonna
head back now.

134
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,625
[YOSHINO]
Okay! Thank you!

135
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,416
We'll definitely have
to get this thing repaired,

136
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,208
you know.

137
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,625
Oh, yeah, for sure.

138
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,833
I wonder how much
it's going to cost.

139
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,166
If it needs a new head,
it won't be cheap.

140
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,625
Couple hundred thousand
yen, maybe.

141
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,083
What? That'll screw up
our entire budget!

142
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,250
Well, we'll just have
to manage it somehow.

143
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,166
Hey, Sanae's going
to bring the car around

144
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,583
this way to pick us up.

145
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,958
Oh. Okay.

146
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,791
Whoa, what is this thing?

147
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,375
[YOSHINO] A commemorative
work for the school's

148
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,708
fortieth anniversary.

149
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,416
Apparently, all the
students and teachers

150
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,541
and even some of the townspeople
worked on it together.

151
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
It's beautiful.

152
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,791
It really is such a shame
that they're getting rid

153
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,000
of this place.

154
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,416
Getting rid of it?

155
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,791
It's already been settled.

156
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,083
It's scheduled to be demolished
the year after next.

157
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,500
[YOSHINO]
Really.

158
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,333
Yep, it's a bummer, but
maintaining it costs money, so.

159
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,708
[car horn beeps]

160
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,458
Here she is. C'mon, Yoshi!

161
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,833
[YOSHINO]
Oh. Coming.

162
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,500
[MAKI]
Is this too plain?

163
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,791
[SALES ASSOTIATE 19A]
Good afternoon!

164
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,083
Are you looking
for a gift today?

165
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,708
[MAKI]
Yeah. I guess.

166
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,125
Ta-da!

167
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,375
Oh, that looks really nice!

168
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,791
I went ahead and put the
drum in the garage for now.

169
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,500
Huh? What's this?

170
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,958
The Mizuchi Festival
Production Board.

171
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,875
I asked Maki to make it for us.

172
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,916
Nice work, Chief Handywoman!

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,416
Being an actor prepares
you for anything, huh?

174
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,000
The festival has been
scheduled for next April.

175
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,375
It's already December,
so we decided to start

176
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,708

be a good person to ask.

00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,500
[IWAO]
You haven't been excused yet!

350
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,833
Make up your mind!

351
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,541
Why did you drop out of
college before you'd even

352
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
talked to us about it one time?

353
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,958
Uh... He seems
pretty upset to me.

354
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,458
Well...

355
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,208
[IWAO] And what happened to
your acting career, anyway?

356
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,500
This is great daikon!

357
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,833
Well, it can't be worse
than rotten tomatoes.

358
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,500
--Yeah...
--Don't you get mad at him!

359
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,333
Would you prefer a
cicada or two with that?

360
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,583
No, I wouldn't, thanks!

361
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,416
What were you doing
checking late-night TV

362
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,791
for me, anyway?

363
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,083
I just happened
to be watching it,

364
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,250
and you showed up
out outta the blue!

365
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,583
It wasn't even
broadcast in Manoyama!

366
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,333
So, you just dropped out of
college to eat cicadas, did you?

367
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,458
As a matter of fact,
I never ate cicadas!

368
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,458
Stop this! Both of you!

369
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,583
I'm the star of the
show tonight, right?

370
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,208
--[IWAO] Yes, dear.
--[MAKI] Yes, ma'am.

371
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
[MAKI] Sorry. It always
ends up like this.

372
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,541
I don't mind, though.

373
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,500
It keeps things lively, right?

374
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,125
I really wish you'd
move back in.

375
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,916
I know it doesn't seem like it,

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,625
but Dad cares about you.

377
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,375
He's watched every single
show you've had a part in.

378
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,083
[MAKI]
Oh, god.

379
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,458
That just makes it harder
to come back, honestly.

380
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,708
Hey Maki, wait a sec!

381
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,041
I forgot to tell you,

382
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
you received a letter
in the mail the other day.

383
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,375
[MAKI]
Yeah?

384
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,458
From Tokyo.

385
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,041
What? No way.

386
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,333
Director Ryotaro Kurose.

387
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,875
The Kurose?

388
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,250
Yeah.

389
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,458
I didn't think there was
any way I'd actually get in.

390
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,625
So if he likes your audition,

391
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,208
you'll for real be in
one of his movies?

392
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,541
When's the date?

393
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,291
Whoa, that's in two days!

394
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,833
Yeah. I'm not going.

395
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,958
I only submitted because
my friend asked me to.

396
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,666
I've got a steady
job here, anyway.

397
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,291
What are you saying Maki?
This is your chance!

398
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,125
You've always wanted
this opportunity!

399
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,083
I left that and came
back to Manoyama.

400
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,333
That's my answer.

401
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,625
[YOSHINO] Shut-down schools
end up getting repurposed

402
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,041
a lot, don't they?

403
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,166
They've helped rural revival
efforts, too, sometimes.

404
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
Huh.

405
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,708
Why do you think they aren't
using the one in Manoyama?

406
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,750
--[door opens]
--Hey, you're back!

407
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,250
It's late. Have you had dinner?

408
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,666
Sorry, yeah,
I ended up eating out.

409
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,916
What're you guys doing?

410
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We've been researching
about the middle school.

411
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,541
We were just thinking
that it's a waste

412
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,791
not to use such
a wonderful building!

413
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,916
Whoa, some schools
are even letting

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,750
private companies
use them for free!

415
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,583
How about using it
as a hotel for the festival?

416
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,333
Then, visitors wouldn't
have to camp out

417
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,625
like they did for
the Founding Festival.

418
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,083
Using it for lodging
would create

419
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,958
an awful lot of hurdles, though.

420
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,416
It's got to be renovated, and
there'll be a ton of paperwork.

421
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,083
Then we'll turn it into
Chupakabura Academy!

422
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,666
Wait, an academy?

423
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,166
It was shut down because there
weren't enough students here!

424
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,041
I still think it's a good idea.

425
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
The Royal Chupakabura Academy!

426
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,458
I like your style, Queen.

427
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,583
G'night.

428
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,333
[YOSHINO]
You dropped something.

429
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,458
Marvin... Productions?

430
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
--What's this?
--[MAKI] It's nothing.

431
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,833
Work I never got paid for.

432
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
I think I have an idea.

433
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,708
[SHIORI] A hot lunch party?
I love that!

434
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,250
And there are cases
where it helped rural

435
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,166
revival efforts, too!

436
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,958
Well, first we've gotta
get people thinking

437
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,666
about the school itself.

438
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,666
Agreed. I feel like we should
discuss it with people

439
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,833
that went there.

440
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,416
Know of anyone?

441
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,125
I did. Gimme a look!

442
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,666
Aww. Man, If I didn't have
to work, I'd love to go.

443
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,083
I'd be happy to talk to the
Community Club for you.

444
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,500
Great! Thanks!

445
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,458
Why the heck would
anyone want to go eat

446
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,458
gross hot lunch in
a haunted school?

447
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,958
Come on, Erika!

448
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,625
You don't know if
it's gross or not!

449
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
Yeah, I do!

450
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,208
You'd get more people if it was
a haunted house, you know.

451
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,041
That's good stuff.

452
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,291
It's not gross!

453
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,916
You just hate it because
you're still in school,

454
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
so you have no choice
but to eat it.

455
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,208
When you get older,

456
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,375
you'll find you kinda
miss it, like we do.

457
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,416
Hot dog buns.

458
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,291
Or that kinda spiceless curry!

459
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,875
[sighs]
I'm so glad you're here.

460
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,583
Uh, welcome. Hi.

461
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,541
What is it?

462
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,000
It's just...

463
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,083
I have something I want to
tell you guys, about Maki.

464
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,333
[MAKI] It's not every day
you to invite me over, huh?

465
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,125
What's up? You good?

466
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,083
[RIRIKO] I wanted to
upload the Dragon Song

467
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,166
on the Manoyama Channel
so lots of people

468
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,958
could see it whenever
they wanted to.

469
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,875
--Oh, nice!
--But lately...

470
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,291
I'm starting to feel
like my singing is off.

471
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,333
You're the only one
I can go to for advice,

472
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,916
since you're an actor and all.

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,541
I see.

474
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,791
Okay.

475
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,250
So should I start with
more or less vibrato?

476
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,125
[MAKI]
No, that's not what it's about.

477
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,791
It's the same thing with acting.

478
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,125
It's not really about whether
you're good or bad,

479
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
but whether you're
able to connect.

480
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,041
It's about being honest.

481
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,125
Audiences just wanna
feel something.

482
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,583
Lead them there by
expressing your feelings.

483

over and help them out!

00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,166

wouldn't budge an inch!

[IWAO] I had a meeting with
the Board of Education.

00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,375
A paper play? Haven't seen
one of those in a while.

505
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,291
Who makes a face like that

506
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,458
when they're watching
a paper play?

507
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
I was born this way.

508
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,541
No, you weren't.

509
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,375
You smiled a lot
when you were little.

510
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,583
You know, you should
really stick with acting.

511

[MAKI] But... I can't
make a living that way.

512
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,333
I took a lot of odd
jobs just to survive.

After a while,

514
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,041
I wasn't sure why I ever went
to Tokyo in the first place.

[IWAO] Who said it had
to make you a living?

Is it really that
hard for you, Maki?

00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,041
You did.

521
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,000
Hey, guys. I'm home!

522
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,541
Kosuke told us about the letter.

523
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,500
The audition is tomorrow, right?

524
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,125
Aren't you going?

525
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,708
My goal right now is to
make the festival a success,

526
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,041
as Chief Handywoman for
the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

527
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,625
I don't think it's the
right time for an audition.

528
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,583
It is the right time!

529
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,333
The opportunity is
right in front of you!

530
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,166
If you don't try,
you're always gonna regret it!

531
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,916
I'm doing the best
I can as Queen,

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,916
and I think the work
is very worthwhile.

533
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm glad I'm here.

534
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,750
But after that, next year,
I don't know what to do.

535
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,541
I don't have a long term dream.

536
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,666
I haven't found anything yet.

537
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,208
You've known what
you've wanted for yourself

538
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,250
ever since you were little!

539
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,291
That alone is amazing!

540
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,791
[SANAE]
Let's get to the station.

541
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,333
You should just be able to
make it by the end of the day.

542
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,708
Maki, go!

543
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,708
[train horn blares]

544
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,833
[SANDAL] Santa Claus used
to come visit our house

545
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,875
when I was little,
but when we started using

546
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,875
those little roach motels,
he stopped showing up.

547
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,458
Next time: "The Phoenix
in the Holy Night."
