2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:14,875
Huh?!

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:15,666
--Huh?
--Hmm?

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,708
[KOMORI]
Ahh?

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:17,666
[gasps]

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,250
[NOZOMI gasps]

7
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,791
[HIMENO]
Huh?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,458
[shocked noises]

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,875
[NOZOMI] We're supposed
to be rehearsing, here!

10
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,333
You didn't actually
have to do it.

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,083
Ah! But, well I...

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,375
It's just...

13
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,541
It was written
in the script, so...

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,416
What? It was?

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,708
[ALL]
Hmmm...

16
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,333
[KYOKO]
Uh-uh.

17
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,416
Where?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,750
[HIMENO]
Um... Here, look.

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,291
[NOZOMI]
This was added by hand.

20
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,833
Not me. I had no idea.

21
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,916
Okay, someone must have
written it into her script.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,083
But when?

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,500
They were just handed
out earlier today.

24
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,041
[HIMENO]
I don't know if it helps,

25
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,916
but I got my script from Komori.

26
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,333
[chuckles nervously]

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,416
[KOMORI cries out]

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,416
[groans]

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,916
[gasps]

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,083
Talk. Now.

31
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,291
[KOMORI]
Uh... Well, the thing is...

32
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:43,666
[HYAPPO]
Komori. Komori. Komori.

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,208
That's it.

34
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,458
Okay, the part of the prince
will be played by Makoto Komori.

35
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,958
[KOMORI]
All right! Yes!

36
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,958
[MANAMI]
That's enough. Sit down.

37
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:55,708
[KOMORI]
Yeah!

38
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,333
[MANAMI]
I mean it. Sit.

39
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,208
[KOMORI]
Here. I brought your script.

40
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,250
Oh. That's nice, thanks.

41
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,166
We're gonna knock 'em dead.

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,916
[HIMENO]
Yeah. Sure.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,916
Seriously? Creep.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,208
Don't forget our deal.

45
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,875
I want my foie gras roll.

46
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,500
[KOMORI]
Shut up, idiot!

47
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,833
Heh. Heh.

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,916
[MANAMI sighs]
So, it has come to my attention

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,708
that Komori used bribery
to secure his role.

50
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,750
He will no longer
play the prince.

51
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:35,416
I have decided--the part will
be played by Nozomi Gokuraku.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't wanna be
the stupid prince.

53
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,708
[screams]

54
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,958
[sighs]

55
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,166
The part was supposed
to be mine, not yours.

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,875
Such a pervert.
How desperate are you, man?

57
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,375
And as for you, Hime,

58
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,791
did you actually plan
to kiss Komori?

59
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,000
[gasps]

60
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:57,041
Well, I just, you know.

61
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,291
I thought it would be
okay if it was you.

62
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,333
Uh?!

63
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,708
Gettin' hot and heavy.

64
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,000
Love is in the air.

65
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,958
Please go away.

66
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,708
All right, people
it was just a kiss.

67
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,291
Back to rehearsing.

68
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,958
[KYOKO]
Oh? You wanted more?

69
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,833
Well, I, uh... Wha...?

70
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,750
[clears throat]

71
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,083
That's enough.

72
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,458
A kiss between friends
doesn't count as anything.

73
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's get to work.

74
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,666
Yeah, okay.

75
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,375
By the way, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,666
No, don't.

77
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,833
There's nothing
to apologize for.

78
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,458
[NOZOMI]
Man, I'm exhausted.

79
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,541
Why did we have to pick a play?

80
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,666
A chorus or something
would've been easier.

81
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,208
I doubt that would have
been impressive enough

82
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,916
for our class president.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,541
Come on. It is kinda fun.

84
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,750
To you, maybe.

85
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,375
Well you did get to
kiss Hime, didn't you?

86
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,291
Oh. I wasn't expecting that.

87
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,583
You're a good actor, Hime.

88
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,208
Have you done plays before?

89
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,750
Yeah, I have.

90
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,166
I played a princess
in middle school, too.

91
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,625
And in elementary school.

92
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,208
And in kindergarten.

93
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,333
Impressive what
about in the nursery?

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,958
Yeah, there, too.

95
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,500
I was my daddy's princess.

96
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,958
It's probably because
of my name.

97
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,750
[KYOKO] Nope, I'm gonna
go with looks and behavior.

98
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,791
I'd be fine just
playing Passerby A.

99
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,791
[KYOKO] Wow, so humble it
almost sounds like bragging.

100
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,583
Hey!

101
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,541
Things are really coming along.

102
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
We've got a costume
for you to try on, Hime.

103
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,500
[HIMENO giggles]
Wow!

104
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,000
It's amazing!

105
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,666
[AKECHI]
Better be. That was hard work.

106
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,041
The play's set in medieval
Scandinavia, right?

107
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,250
So, it's historically impossible

108
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,416
for there to have been
a centaur princess.

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,291
It could have happened
in Russia though,

110
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,708
so I used that for reference,

111
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,083
along with Central Asia
and the Near and Middle East.

112
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,166
You'll also see some
Baroque influence in the lace.

113
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,708
I guess you'd call it
Bourbon style?

114
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,000
Anyway, I guess the historical
inaccuracy bugs me a little,

115
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,083
so I just wanted
to add some...

116
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,833
[INUKAI]
That's gonna go on for a while.

117
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,416
Anything to do with costumes
brings out her inner nerd.

118
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,708
[AKECHI] ...everyone might
as well be on stage naked!

119
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,458
I'm not sure, though.

120
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,791
What?

121
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,916
[AKECHI] I thought I made
it on the larger side,

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,791
but it's pretty tight on you.

123
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,500
Ah!

124
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,916
[AKECHI]
Hmm...

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,416
[HIMENO]
Oh...

126
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,166
Hey, that looks great!

127
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,416
Way to go me!

128
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,291
[door sliding open]

129
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
[FUJIMOTO]
Mitama!

130
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,208
Is it okay if we
bring the set pieces in?

131
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,416
[MANAMI]
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

132
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,458
[FUJIMOTO]
All right, you guys.

133
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,333
Let's go!

134
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,375
[BOY D]
Coming!

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,583
[creaking]

136
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,583
[HIMENO gasps]

137
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,791
Hey, Fujimoto. One thing.

138
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,208
Huh?

139
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,083
I think we need to use
more braces on the platforms.

140
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
We tested them out, though.

141
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,166
They'll hold anything.

142
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,291
I mean, no one can be
heavier than Nekomi, right?

143
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,916
Uh...

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,916
[sighs]
Just do it.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,708
You never know
what could happen.

146
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,208
It's better to be safe.

147
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,333
You're the boss.

148
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,791
[MANAMI] All right, we've
got costumes and the set.

149
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,708
Let's do a run through of
the whole thing, with feeling.

150
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, and skip the kiss this time.

151
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,583
[giggles]

152
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,875
Okay, everybody. Places!

153
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,500
[GIRL E] The play they're doing
has a real kissing scene.

154
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,041
[GIRL D]
Seriously?

155
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,375
Go on. You're gonna kiss, right?

156
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:43,791
No, they aren't.

157
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,541
Aww...

158
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,791
Perfect.

159
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,333
There's no stopping the
high school rumor mill.

160
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:07,625
[audience applause]

161
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,416
Right. We're up next.

162
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,291
Okay, let's carry in our set.

163
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,375
It's our turn!

164
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,958
I'm kinda nervous.

165
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,333
It'll be okay.

166
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,541
Hey, careful with that.

167
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,875
Don't worry. It's fine.

168
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,833
[ANNOUNCER] Next, we
have Class One-One's play,

169
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,458
<i>A Dream Under the Midnight Sun.</i>

170
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,666
Hey, good job.

171
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,291
You were a perfect queen.

172
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,583
Comes naturally, huh?

173
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,458
[MANAMI]
Shut up!

174
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,041
Don't you have something to do?

175
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,041
Nice work out there.

176
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,041
[HIMENO]
Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,750
Okay, let's nail
the final scene!

178
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,166
My love is true.

179
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Even if Heaven and Earth
should fall, it will remain.

180
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,333
Hey. This is the part
with the kiss, right?

181
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,541
You think they'll
actually do it?

182
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,500
I guess there was no way
they'd do it for real, huh?

183
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,791
Yeah, that would be crazy.

184
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,041
[screams]

185
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,833
Help! Quick!

186
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,666
[NOZOMI]
Thank you.

187
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:40,291
[audience applause]

188
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,333
[NOZOMI]
The crowd loved the ending.

189
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,958
They said it was perfect.

190
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,250
Yeah, well.

191
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,041
I don't think the principal
was as impressed.

192
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
That's not surprising.

193
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,583
You two could've been hurt bad.

194
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,083
[NOZOMI]
Hmm...

195
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,583
Leave that to the president.

196
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,541
She'll smooth things over.

197
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,125
[GIRL D] Hey! I just wanna say,
you guys were great!

198
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,166
[NOZOMI chuckles]
Thank you!

199
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,541
[NOZOMI]
Hey, what's wrong?

200
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,666
Don't be shy.

201
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,041
We're past that now.

202
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,250
We are?

203
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,416
I'm glad you two are
having so much fun.

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,416
[NOZOMI] Sorry, I can give
you a kiss too if you want.

205
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,291
I'll pass!

206
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,458
[giggles]

207
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,375
[TEACHER] As I'm sure you recall
from your early biology courses,

208
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,541
modern day mammals,
birds, reptiles,

209
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,083
and amphibians have six legs.

210
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,375
It is widely believed
that this originated with fish,

211
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,666
whose pectoral, front ventral,
and rear ventral fins

212
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,791
grew over many generations until
they eventually became limbs.

213
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,333
[TEACHER] The genes
that determined the shape

214
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,333
of the pectoral fins
duplicated to form ventral fins,

215
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,500
which duplicated again
to form rear ventral fins.

216
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,500
Of course, in prehistoric times,

217
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,625
there were also
four-legged amphibians,

218
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,125
but they died out and
left no surviving descendants.

219
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,500
Most likely, extra limbs
evolved because six legs

220
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
were more advantageous than four

221
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,458
when it came to
supporting body weight.

222
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,041
Humans are the ultimate
product of evolution.

223
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,583
We can be broadly divided
into four different groups.

224
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,583
[TEACHER]
The first of these groups

225
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,541
includes the catfolk, the
goatfolk, and the fauns.

226
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,875
In the next group are the
angelfolk and the draconids.

227
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,500
The third group is the centaurs.

228
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,500
Weretigers were also included
in this group at one time,

229
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,958
but unfortunately
they are now extinct.

230
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,083
Finally, we have the merfolk,
though none of the students

231
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,083
in this room are
part of that group.

232
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,666
In the past, the differences
between the four groups

233
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,375
led to discrimination
and distrust,

234
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,416
often culminating in war.

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,166
Of course, had the four-legged
amphibians survived,

236
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,333
become the dominant race,
and evolved into humans,

237
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,375
things would be very different.

238
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,250
[TEACHER] There would
likely still be differences

239
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,583
in hair, skin, and eye color,
but nothing significant enough

240
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,541
to lead to serious
discrimination.

241
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,208
However, the idea of
a world in which humans

242
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,750
have just four limbs is absurd.

243
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,083
Something out of
a fantasy novel.

244
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,250
In reality, we must
remain vigilant at all times

245
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,041
if we wish to avoid the fear
and chaos of global conflict.

246
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,541
Some nations are still
plagued with violence,

247
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,666
while others strive for
the harmony that comes

248
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,000
from accepting each
group's differences.

249
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,958
We can only achieve
unity by viewing others

250
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,666
as neither greater
nor lesser than ourselves.

251
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,916
Therefore, equality is the key,

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,333
the virtue we must strive
for above all others.

253
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,208
All right. Now for
the national anthem.

254
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,166
[MANAMI]
Yes, ma'am. Stand.

255
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:40,583
[KYOKO pants]

256
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,208
Wait. Please wait.

257
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,250
[NOZOMI]
Huh? Huh...

258
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,125
[NOZOMI]
Go faster.

259
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, go faster.

260
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,625
C'mon, go faster.

261
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
Can't you go any faster?

262
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,291
If you're about to collapse
after two kilometers

263
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,291
you should really
start exercising more.

264
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,375
I'm not a natural athlete, okay?

265
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,958
[pants]

266
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,541
You know, I don't get why we all
have to run the same distance.

267
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,416
Doesn't seem fair.

268
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,916
Mom and I run every day.

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
We do about twenty kilometers.

270
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,416
It's not so bad.

271
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,041
Why do you run so much?

272
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,500
A weight-loss thing?

273
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,125
Well, uh...

274
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,625
[NOZOMI]
You don't look that big to me.

275
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,125
Uh?!

276
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,041
[chuckles]

277
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,250
When centaurs gain weight,

278
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,125
we have a hard time
turning our bodies,

279
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,583
so we can't do stuff like
wiping our own behinds.

280
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,875
Oh, wow.

281
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,875
I didn't think you
could reach that far.

282
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:34,958
[HIMENO gasps]

283
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,375
Of course, I can!

284
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,000
'Kay, sorry.

285
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:44,416
I need... a break...

286
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,750
[NOZOMI]
If you don't get in shape,

287
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,833
you won't be able to
wipe your own butt.

288
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,375
I hate you!

289
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,208
No matter how much you eat,
you never gain weight, do you?

290
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,125
[KYOKO]
No, not really.

291
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,208
You're lucky.

292
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,708
[chuckles]

293
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,916
Hey. Hold on.

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,125
What was that chuckle for?

295
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,416
Well, your body's
nothing but straight lines.

296
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,291
Doesn't seem like something
to be jealous of to me.

297
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,416
I'll punch you, you jerk!

298
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,916
[NOZOMI laughs]

299
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,916
[KYOKO]
You!

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,666
[NOZOMI]
You'll have to catch me first.

301
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,416
[KYOKO]
Okay! I will!

302
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
[NOZOMI]
Good luck!

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
Hey, you're actually
running pretty fast.

304
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:28,000
[KYOKO pants]
I can't... Have to stop...

305
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,750
[HIMENO]
Are you okay?

306
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,750
Jeez, you look like
you're about to die.

307
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,208
[KYOKO]
And whose fault is that?

308
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,208
[HIMENO] Do you want me
to carry you on my back?

309
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,791
[KYOKO]
No way.

310
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,291
That's a terrible idea.

311
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,708
I'd be accused of discrimination

312
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,083
and sent to a
correctional clinic.

313
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,833
[NOZOMI]
That's a little dramatic.

314
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,750
It really isn't, actually.

315
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,583
In our country, centaurs
used to be warriors,

316
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,541
but in some places, they
were slaves used as mounts.

317
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,458
That's where most anti-
discrimination laws originated.

318
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,250
They take this stuff seriously.

319
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,875
Jeez, even talking like
this is probably illegal.

320
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,666
[NOZOMI] Anyway, once
you've caught your breath,

321
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,375
we'll take our time finishing.

322
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,833
No. I'm fine.

323
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,250
Go on ahead without me.

324
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,041
Don't worry,
it's not like we're trying

325
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,958
to get first place or anything.

326
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,625
I bet you that's what
Tama's going for, though.

327
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,166
Yeah, because being
class president isn't enough.

328
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,500
[NOZOMI] For the record, though,
if there was a cash prize,

329
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,500
I would ditch you
in a heartbeat.

330
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,458
[moans]

331
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,708
'Kay, let's go.

332
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,208
Huh? Already?

333
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,208
[NOZOMI] We still need to make
it back to school on time.

334
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,750
[NOZOMI]
Come on! Let's get moving.

335
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,250
[NOZOMI]
We'll take it easy, okay?

336
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,375
Huh?

337
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,291
Hey, Hime?

338
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,708
[HIMENO]
Hmm?

339
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,791
If you try,

340
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,083
I bet you can go
really fast, huh?

341
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,791
[HIMENO]
Mm...

342
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,791
I can do a hundred meters
in nine seconds or so.

343
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,916
Is that fast?

344
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,166
[NOZOMI]
Yeah, crazy fast.

345
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,958
[HIMENO]
I can show you if you want.

346
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,291
There are no cars coming.

347
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll just run to the stoplight.

348
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,791
[NOZOMI]
Okay, be careful, though.

349

00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
I'm sorry!

356
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,333
[NOZOMI]
Hime!

357
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,000
Hey, are you okay?

358
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:03,791
Uh-huh.

359
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,250
[laughs]

360
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,250
It isn't funny.

361
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,458
You are crazy fast, huh?

362
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,750
You should run track.

363
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,916
I doubt there's anybody
who could beat you.

364
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,083
[HIMENO] Umm...
Yeah, that's not exactly true.

365
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,958
I actually gave it a try once.

366
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,500
[STARTER]
Ready!

367
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,541
[HIMENO]
Hey, wait!

368
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,583
Oh, right.

369
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,041
I forgot the heats
were divided by race.

370
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,291
Yep.

371
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,666
Okay, but what about a
sport like basketball?

372
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,291
[NOZOMI]
Uh...

373
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,750
[NOZOMI]
Here! Pass!

374
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:44,625
Hime has the horsepower,
but she's not very graceful.

375
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,333
[KYOKO]
Too bad what a waste.

376
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,000
But still, it's gotta
be pretty nice

377
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,166
being faster
than most people.

378
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
You could be faster if you
worked out once in a while.

379
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,625
Hey, you've been leaning
on me long enough.

380
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,166
Huh?

381
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,750
Hey, wait for me.

382
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,875
Pick up the pace, you three.

383
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,541
We haven't got all day, here.

384
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,541
The lunch break is almost over.

385
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,791
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,750
[NOZOMI]
Wait, is that?

387
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,166
[KYOKO]
What are you doing on there?

388
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,333
Oh, hi.

389
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,708
Well, I didn't get much sleep
last night, so I'm worn out.

390
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,208
I hope you can make it, Kyoko.

391
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,833
We don't have any
more room on the bike.

392
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,041
Huh? Aww...

393
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,291
[COACH] All right, that's
enough chit-chat, ladies.

394
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,333
[AKECHI]
See ya!

395
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,291
[INUKAI]
Good luck.

396
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,125
[KYOKO moans]

397
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,541
Whining isn't gonna help.

398
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,291
Now, let's go.

399
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,875
[HIMENO]
Huh?

400
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,000
Hold on.

401
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,041
Hey, Nozomi!

402
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,166
You're going the wrong way!

403
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,291
The patrol's already
passed us, right?

404
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,250
So, let's take a shortcut.

405
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,666
[KYOKO] I guess you have
good ideas once in a while.

406
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,291
[NOZOMI]
Shut up, slow poke.

407
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,833
[HIMENO]
Is this really okay?

408
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,541
[KYOKO pants]

409
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,375
Shortcut or not.

410
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,458
I'm beat!

411
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,875
[NOZOMI]
Serves you right.

412
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,125
Maybe that'll teach you
not to slack off all the time.

413
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,041
[HIMENO] You can do it.
We're almost there.

414
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,458
[KYOKO moans]

415
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,250
[MANAMI]
Took you long enough. Hurry up!

416
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,958
Afternoon classes are starting.

417
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,583
[KYOKO moans]

418
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,000
Yay!

419
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,791
Whoa.

420
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,291
You look sick. Why?

421
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,333
What's your rank? Huh?

422
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,958
[KYOKO]
Oh...

423
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,833
Well, that sucks.

424
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,250
What did you say
about slacking off?

425
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,541
It's okay.

426
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,416
We can all study together.

427
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,208
You know you spoil
her too much, right?
