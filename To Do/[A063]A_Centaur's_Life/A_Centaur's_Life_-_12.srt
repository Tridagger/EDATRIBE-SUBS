1
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,000
It's kinda chilly down here.

2
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, we are
underground in bikinis.

3
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,541
Are you doing okay, Suu?

4
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,250
Yes. I'm used to cold weather.

5
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,666
This doesn't bother me.

6
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,791
Right. Well, good. I'm glad.

7
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,625
Huh?

8
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,000
[HIMENO gasps]

9
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,166
[NOZOMI] This is a good way
to warm things up a bit.

10
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,625
Hey, shouldn't we be
staying focused?

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,958
I mean, what if something
jumps out at us?

12
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,666
[NOZOMI] Oh, something will,
right around the next corner.

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,500
Stop teasing! That's not nice.

14
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,750
Um, guys.

15
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:41,791
[NOZOMI]
See? Told ya.

16
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,583
[HIMENO]
Ah! It's coming this way!

17
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,708
[NOZOMI]
You know, it might help

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,083
if you would stop
with the screaming.

19
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,875
We got this, Suu.
Stay behind us.

20
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,083
Right.

21
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,500
[NOZOMI]
Hime, use your bow.

22
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,250
[HIMENO] Uh... but
won't we get in trouble

23
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,833
with the Animal Welfare people?

24
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,083
[NOZOMI]
It'll be fine.

25
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,333
Look at its face.
See? It's human.

26
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,750
They won't get mad
if you shoot a person.

27
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,750
[HIMENO] Um. Really? That
doesn't seem right somehow.

28
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,875
[NOZOMI]
Here it comes!

29
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,916
[TROLL roars]

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,125
[NOZOMI]
How did you miss?!

31
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,458
[HIMENO]
Ah! It ducked! I'm sorry!

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,041
My turn!

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,375
[NOZOMI]
Kyoko! Magic!

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,875
[KYOKO]
I'm on it. Just gimme a sec.

35
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,166
There. Done.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,333
[KYOKO] Dora magura, goma
magura, sesame magura.

37
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,666
[NOZOMI]
Hey, what's the holdup?

38
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,208
Hooray, hooray!

39
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,125
Hooray, hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

40
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,375
Uh, what're you doin'
back there, Suu?

41
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,041
Preforming a victory dance.

42
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,875
I thought it might be helpful.

43
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
More like distracting.

44
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,291
Upsy-daisy.

45
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,916
'Kay, got it.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,625
Go on, fire. Do your thing.

47
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,083
Might wanna stand back.

48
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
You really think
this is gonna work?

49
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,958
Step back, and we'll find out.

50
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,791
[TROLL roaring]

51
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,291
[ALL gaspiing]

52
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,250
That's was awesome!

53
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,166
Yeah, I know.

54
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,125
Seriously, only two
gold? What a rip-off.

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,583
No, you've just been influenced

56
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,000
by the greedy capitalism
of the real world.

57
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,875
It seemed primitive,
but if it had money,

58
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,250
doesn't that mean it
was an intelligent being?

59
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,291
It didn't strike me as
being especially intelligent.

60
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,125
[KYOKO]
It's probably an instinct thing.

61
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,125
Like how crows
collect shiny stuff.

62
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,791
Did you see those claws?
It was obviously a monster.

63
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,208
[HIMENO]
Huh?

64
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,250
Which means that this labyrinth
is like a haunted house,

65
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,458
and the scary things
are comin' out to play.

66
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,291
I wish you hadn't said that.
I don't like haunted houses.

67
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,708
Right, because of
one bad experience.

68
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,041
You got spooked
and broke something

69
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,041
with your big butt, right?

70
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,666
How did you find out about that?

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,833
Oh, you know.

72
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,250
Well, let's go. Heh.

73
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,125
[NOZOMI]
Uh.

74
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,166
Looks like we've got company.

75
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,083
Hime, you can shoot
these guys, right?

76
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,125
Yep.

77
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,750
Kyoko, make with the magic.

78
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,833
I've got it covered.

79
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,708
[yells]

80
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,458
[NOZOMI]
Kyoko, where's that magic?

81
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,958
I'm working on it. Let's see...

82
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,958
Let me handle this.

83
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,041
[NOZOMI]
We don't need another dance.

84
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Kay-su-yo-chi-no.
Eemay-ee-ko-chino.

85
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,333
Dako-pome-pino-peecone-pano.
Eee- dan-dee-kuh

86
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,166
Well, that worked.
But what the heck was it?

87
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,541
That was a sutra,
in the gods' language.

88
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,583
[NOZOMI]
Hm.

89
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,583
Aren't you supposed
to be a dancer?

90
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm a priestess.

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,666
[KYOKO]
For what god?

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,375
I'm not sure.

93
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,625
[NOZOMI]
Only one lousy silver?

94
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,291
[HIMENO] Actually, there
are two more. Here, see?

95
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,041
[KYOKO]
Two, huh?

96
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,625
[HIMENO]
Not a bad haul.

97
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,083
[NOZOMI] We should be
pretty far down by now,

98
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,208
and we haven't run into
anyone but monsters yet.

99
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,833
[HIMENO] I wouldn't want to run
into anyone dressed like this.

100
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,416
It's kinda like
we're at the pool,

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,458
only with monsters
and weapons and stuff.

102
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,875
[HIMENO]
I wish I had your outfit, Kyoko.

103
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,458
[KYOKO]
Because of the cape?

104
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,125
Maybe you should've thought that
through when we chose our jobs.

105
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,833
[HIMENO] The mage's
incantations seemed like

106
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
they'd be too tricky
for me to manage.

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,291
I figured I could
handle a bow, though.

108
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,916
[NOZOMI]
Nah, it isn't that hard,

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,166
and I don't see how you could
be that much worse than Kyoko.

110
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,791
[KYOKO]
Hey, I beat that troll earlier.

111
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,833
[HIMENO yelps]

112
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,458
[NOZOMI]
What's wrong?

113
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,625
[HIMENO]
I stepped in something.

114
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,000
[BOTH gasp]

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,500
[KYOKO, HIMENO, SUU yelling]

116
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,083
Whatever this freaky stuff
is, it's not letting go!

117
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
Monsters are bad enough,
but now we've got this icky

118
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,250
green slime to deal with, too?

119
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,250
[SUU] Perhaps if we could
identify this substance,

120
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,208
we could find a way
to break free of it.

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,458
Oh my goodness...

122
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,041
Kyoko, use your magic
already! Make it stop!

123
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,375
[screams]

124
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,416
[HIMENO]
Kyoko, please!

125
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,041
There must be something.

126
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't worry. I think
you're fine, actually.

127
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,291
We're fine, huh?

128
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,750
It doesn't look like
it's going to eat you.

129
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,916
Are you sure?

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,250
Who cares?! Just get
it off of us, Kyoko!

131
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,208
That stuff's harmless, really.

132
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,625
It'll just do sexy things to you

133
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,666
and put you in racy
positions for a while.

134
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,125
[yelps]

135
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,708
Oh, god! My armor!

136
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,833
I think it's melting!

137
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,458
[SUU]
When you say "sexy things,"

138
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,583
what exactly does that entail?

139
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,125
I'd like to help,
but the problem is,

140
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,250
if I use something like fire
or ice, it'll hit you too.

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know what to do.

142
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,708
Why don't you try salt water?

143
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,125
If this is a giant amoeba,

144
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,458
the osmotic pressure
should take care of it.

145
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,916
That sounds pretty scientific,

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but I can at least
give it a try.

147
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,375
It'll be just a sec.

148
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,041
[HIMENO]
Hurry! Hurry!

149
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,875
[NOZOMI] Ah! Who said you
could touch in there?

150
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,333
[HIMENO]
Leave me alone!

151
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,500
[SUU] I don't know how much
longer I can endure this!

152
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,541
Okay, that oughtta do it.

153
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,625
Well, here goes nothing.

154
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:08,083
Piassa, selassa, regomar.
Splash and soak!

155
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,583
[ALL scream]

156
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,500
[sighs]

157
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,166
Huh?

158
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,125
That's a pretty sexy sight.

159
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,916
So embarrassing!

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,083
Indeed.

161
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,083
Kyoko, I'm not
gonna forget this!

162
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,041
[NOZOMI] All right, time
to fight the final boss.

163
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,416
[KYOKO] Really went
all-out, didn't they?

164
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,375
[NOZOMI]
Eh, who cares? Let's go!

165
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,583
[NOZOMI]
Hey, anyone there?

166
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,958
[MANAMI] I'm surprised
that you made it this far.

167
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,958
Welcome, ladies.

168
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,375
I am the queen
of this labyrinth.

169
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,083
That's way too fitting.

170
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,666
Yeah, the "queen"
in which sense?

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,875
Wait, what do you mean?

172
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,125
That kind of queen?

173
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,333
[HIMENO, SUU]
What kinds are there?

174
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,083
[MANAMI]
Quiet!

175
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,375
Listen!

176
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,500
The paltry magic and
combat skills you possess

177
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,208
won't be enough to defeat me.

178
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,625
You must perform a task in
order to conquer the labyrinth,

179
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,916
and that task is to uncover
the queen's secret.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,583
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Mm...

181
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,083
And if you give
the wrong answer,

182
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,958
you will be trapped here
for the rest of your lives!

183
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,416
[HIMENO gasps]

184
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,416
Okay, I think I've
got the answer.

185
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,541
Your secret is that
you pad your chest.

186
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,666
[gasps]

187
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,666
[yelps]

188
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,458
[MANAMI]
H-How did you know?

189
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,375
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Oh, please. It's obvious.

190
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,666
[NOZOMI]
Hey! Hold up!

191
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,250
[ALL yelping]

192
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,375
That's not good!

193
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,125
Let's get out!

194
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,583
[HIMENO screaming]

195
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,333
[SUU]
Please wait for me!

196
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,833
[KYOKO, NOZOMI]
Uhh...

197
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:23,958
So you wrote this thing

198
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,583
as some kind of
weird joke, right?

199
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,750
[AKECHI gasps]

200
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,291
[AKECHI]
That's what you think?

201
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,750
I like adventure stories.
They're amusing.

202
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,875
Totally!

203
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,458
There are more than
a couple problems

204
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,041
with this story, though.

205
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,708
For one thing, what good is
bikini armor gonna do anyone?

206
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,666
[AKECHI]
Hm.

207
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,333
Good point.

208
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,000
[KYOKO]
Hey, what're you looking at?

209
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,666
Hey, um... what's
everyone doing?

210
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,583
Ah, looks like the
favorite's finally here.

211
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,666
[KYOKO]
Okay, here we go.

212
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,125
And... begin!

213
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,458
Sorry, but I work out these
muscles every single day.

214
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,666
I won't lose to someone
who's not even in a club.

215
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,041
Done, and the winner
is the class prez.

216
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,708
Ow, that really hurt.

217
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,666
How the heck did you
get so strong, anyway?

218
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,000
[chuckles]

219
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,916
[MANAMI] My muscles get
plenty of workouts.

220
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,416
Yeah, fair enough.

221
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,375
'Kay, time for the next match,

222
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,708
and remember, girls,
no cheating.

223
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,416
[KATSURA gasps]

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,666
[KATSURA whines]

225
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,416
[NOZOMI] Arm wrestling is
about reading your opponent.

226
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,625
Just watch her very closely.

227
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,833
Right. I will do my best.

228
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,375
[SUU]
Stay calm and watch her closely.

229
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,500
[AIKOU] Man. Jeez.
She's really staring.

230
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,708
[NADE]
Let's have a fair fight.

231
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,458
Okay, ready. Let's wrestle!

232
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,750
Now!

00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,291
[SUU gasps]

234
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,458
And the winner of this
match is Aikou!

235
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,750
[AIKOU cries]

236
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,041
I didn't do too well.

237
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,708
[NOZOMI]
Honestly.

238
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,166
[KATSURA]
Hey, you're up next, Hime.

239
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,791
Okay.

240
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:18,750
[HIMENO] Why is everybody
taking this so seriously?

241
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,416
Okay, grab hands.

242
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,458
I bet it'll be Princess.

243
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,000
[OMAKI]
Fuku's tough, too, though.

244
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,500
She's one of the top five in
the prefecture in shot put.

245
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,958
[FUKU]
Man, her hands are big.

246
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,708
Let's have a fair fight.

247
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,083
Okay, ready. Let's wrestle!

248
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,500
C'mon.

249
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,666
[OMAKI] Check out Hime.
She's as strong as a gorilla.

250

Hm?

251
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,041
There!

252
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,291
Owie!

00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,083

Aw, I guess I lost.

[HIMENO]
Huh?

256
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,541
[NADE]
Do-over. That one didn't count.

257
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,875
She's right! Be serious, here.

258
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,666
[HIMENO]
I'm being serious, really.

259
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,458
Let's up the stakes
a little bit.

260
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,708
If you lose again,
you'll have to pay the price,

261
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,875
by presenting your
breasts for verification.

262
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,500
[HIMENO]
Uh, "verification"?

263
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,291
That's right, a very up close
and personal assessment

264
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,541
to determine whether
or not they're real.

265
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,666
No way!

266
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,541
I can tell you right
now: They're real.

267

[NADE]
Uh, let's start again.

268
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,291
Let's have a fair fight.

269
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,541
Okay, ready, and let's wrestle!

271
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,791
Princess is the winner
of the rematch!

272
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,416
Sorry. Are you okay?

273
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,541
[FUKU] Aww... I lost.
After all that training.

274
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,750
A bet is a bet.
Do with me as you will.

275
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,041
[HIMENO] Uh! Why are you
taking your clothes off?

276
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,083

You weren't part of the bet.

277
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,333
Oh, okay.

00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,291
Jeez!

279
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,500
How did we get
paired up together?

280
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,833
You look like you're
about as weak as a kitten.

281
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,166
Well, you look weaker.

282
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,333

Winner!

[AKIRA grunting]

284
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,041
I gotta say, Akira.

285
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,458
You've got decent reflexes,

286
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,333
but when it comes to strength,
you're pretty pathetic.

287
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,708
Maybe if you helped your
mom out every now and then.

288
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,458
[AKIRA] Shut up.
You don't know anything!

289
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,041
[NOZOMI]
And down you go.

290
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,333
[KATSURA]
The kendo club member lost!

291
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
[FUKU]
And the tea club member won!

292
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,625
Whew, this is exhausting.

293
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,041
So, uh, why are we doing this?

294
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,250
[KYOKO]
Hm?

295
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
[KATSURA] Hey, come on,
Princess. You're up.

296
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,583
[HIMENO whines]

297
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,375
Go get 'em, Hime.

298
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,916
I'm sorry!

299
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,833
And it's over!

300
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,875
All right, everyone, the winner
of this match is Nozomi.

301
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,666
Aw, man, I lost.
I was doing so well.

302
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,916
She beat you, too,
so I guess it's okay.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,041
This is dumb. Who really
cares about arm wrestling?

304
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,375
[AKECHI] Okay, we're
down to our four best!

305
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,375
Go Michi!

306
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,708
[KYOKO]
No favoritism.

307
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,125
Well, we've known one
another or many years now,

308
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,250
but it looks like it's finally
time to settle the score.

309
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,500
Jeez, it's an arm
wrestling tournament.

310
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,083
We're not goin'
into battle, here.

311
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,500
Got anything, Princess?

312
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,375
still don't understand
why we're doing this.

313
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,541
[INUKAI]
Uh?

314
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,375
[SATOU]
I'm surprised no one's left

315
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,583
from any of the athletic teams.

316
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,208
[OMAKI]
Well, Hime and Nozomi

317
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,208
are both involved
with local dojos.

318
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,208
Wait for my signal.
No false starting.

319
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,250
Ready.

320
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,458
Go!

321
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,916
Seems I'm not the only one.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,291
You're taking this
seriously, too.

323
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,333
Yeah, well I appreciate
a good competition

324
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,416
as much as you do.

325
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,083
[KATSURA]
The winner is Mitama!

326
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,500
Man, my hand's gonna be
sore for like a week.

327
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,208
We build strength differently.

328
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,958
I guess this means
child-rearing beats karate.

329
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,125
[KYOKO]
You know what they say,

330
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,958
"no one's stronger
than a mother."

331
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,416
Not that she is a mother.

332
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,625
[NADE] All right, Inukai,
Princess, come on.

333
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,708
You're up next.

334
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,250
Okay, I'm coming.

335
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,708
[NOZOMI]
You got this!

336
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,833
To warn you,

337
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,875
I don't think this is going
to be a close contest.

338
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,916
I guess we'll find out, huh?

339
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,416
I know about Princess
and her archery,

340
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,708
but what about Inukai?

341
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
How'd she get so strong?

342
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,041
Well, she's pretty tall,

343
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,458
and she was into sports
in middle school, too.

344
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,750
Really, her strength
comes from love.

345
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,708
From love? So what
are you saying?

346
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,541
You guys get cozy
<i>ekiben</i> -style every day,

347
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,166
and that's why
Inukai's so strong?

348
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,541
<i>Ekiben</i> ? The train
station bento boxes?

349
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,916
Who doesn't love <i>ekiben</i> ?

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,333
You are so dirty.

351
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,166
Please, you're the one
with the dirty mind, here.

352
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,208
Uh, just ignore her.

353
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,666
[NADE]
Here we go.

354
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,666
Okay, ready. Let's wrestle!

355
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,666
[INUKAI gasps]

356
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,500
Princess is the winner.

357
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,541
You are crazy strong, huh?

358
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,000
Sorry about that. You okay?

359
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,083
Oh, well, looks like
your love lost.

360
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,041
I wonder if I should be
doing something differently.

361
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,166
Take it too far and
you'll just look silly.

362
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,000
[NADE]
Time for the final round!

363
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,500
Do you need a break?

364
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,500
No thanks, I'll be fine.

365
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,125
I still don't know why
we're doing this, though.

366
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:35,208
This may be a game, but
it's one I will not lose.

367
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,875
Tama, you sound really
scary sometimes.

368
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,625
[NADE]
Let's have a fair fight.

369
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,208
Okay, ready. Let's wrestle!

370
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,375
Sorry!

371
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
[gasps]

372
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,708
[STUDENTS gasping, applauding]

373
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,041
[NOZOMI] I guess no one
can beat Hime, huh?

374
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,375
[KYOKO]
Looks like it.

375
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,958
Hey, Tama, are you okay?

376
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,333
[MANAMI sighs]

377
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,791
I feel like I let down my
little sisters by losing to you.

378
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,333
[HIMENO]
Uhh...

379
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,458
Well, you know, I
spend a lot of time

380
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,958
carrying Shino around.

381
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,750
I think she probably
weighs three times

382
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,125
as much as the Chisters.

383
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,625
Three times, huh?

384
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,958
That gives me an idea
of how much you weigh.

385
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,291
No, don't tell anyone!

386
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,291
I mean it. I'm serious! Okay?!

387
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,833
You won't tell anyone, right?

388
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,708
[HIMENO]
Also, why are we arm wrestling?
