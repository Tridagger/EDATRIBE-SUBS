1
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,666
[EDITOR]
It's been so long.

2
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,208
Since the reunion, right?

3
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,916
Uh, yeah.

4
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,458
Things still all lovey-dovey
with that hairy man of yours?

5
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,916
Please. You know how it goes.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,833
Our daughter is
the apple of his eye.

7
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,041
She's all he can see these days.

8
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,041
Her name is Himeno, isn't it?

9
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,250
Yes, though I'm
surprised you remember.

10
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,750
Guess you're not as
forgetful as you used to be.

11
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,625
So, tell me about her.

12
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,041
Does she take after her father?

13
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,875
Or did she get your looks?

14
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,541
Should I be concerned about
your interest in my daughter?

15
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,625
Huh? Uh, no!

16
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,125
I'm asking in a purely
professional capacity.

17
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,416
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

18
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,500
[NOZOMI]
Hime?

19
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,458
Maybe, but she looks different.

20
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,250
[NOZOMI]
No, there's something sexy

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,458
about this girl that
Hime doesn't have.

22
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,041
[AKECHI]
Boo!

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:55,750
Ah!

24
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,875
What are you doing?

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,666
Jeez, someone's jumpy.

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,458
[NOZOMI]
Well, someone snuck up on me.

27
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
So, doing some reading?

28
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,125
[giggles]

29
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,208
[NOZOMI]
What are you laughing about?

30
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,750
Oh, you know.

31
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,791
Just thinking that you're
starting to grow up.

32
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,000
Little shota girl.

33
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,041
It's adorable.

34
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,833
[NOZOMI]
Don't call me a shota girl!

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,500
What are you even talking about?

36
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,375
[AKECHI] Your newfound interest
in fashion, of course.

37
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,791
Huh?! Uh...

38
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,833
Wait, that's not it!

39
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,000
Here, see?

40
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,625
Take a look at the cover.

41
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,750
Huh?

42
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,750
[NOZOMI]
Well?

43
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,750
Doesn't she look like Hime?

44
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,875
[AKECHI] Hmm...
That's actually her, isn't it?

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,833
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
[AKECHI]
On the cover of a magazine?

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,875
Way to go, Hime!

48
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,791
Is that a big deal or something?

49
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,166
[AKECHI] Uh, you're
totally kidding me, right?

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,583
That's the kind of thing
people dream about.

51
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,333
It's sort of a shame,
though, don't you think?

52
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,416
Why's that?

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,791
You realize she's going to be

54
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,875
on a totally different
level than us now?

55
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,791
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

56
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,125
[AKECHI]
I mean, she's a model!

57
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,750
That's gonna keep
her pretty busy.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,208
I bet she'll have to go to
work right after school.

59
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,875
She probably won't have time
to hang out with you anymore.

60
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,041
You'll be all alone.

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,541
No, you're wrong!

62
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,666
[AKECHI]
I know!

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,375
Why don't you try
being a model, too?

64
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,791
That's crazy.

65
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,583
[AKECHI] I think there's
a demand for your type.

66
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,875
There's no way I could do it.

67
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,583
I don't know anything
about fashion.

68
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,208
[AKECHI]
That's easy to fix.

69
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,791
Come over to my place.

70
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,041
I can teach you everything
you need to know.

71
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,666
Everything.

72
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,875
I think I'm gonna pass.

73
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,208
Why? Come on!

74
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,541
I need a shower after
that look you gave me.

75
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,833
[AKECHI groans]

76
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,083
Okay, if that's how
you want to play it.

77
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,875
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

78
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,000
[AKECHI]
Did you know that our school

79
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,125
doesn't allow students to work?

80
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
I heard there was a second year

81
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,375
who got caught,
and they were expelled.

82
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,666
Oh, dear. What if
someone finds out?

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,083
I might slip up

84
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,583
and accidentally tell a teacher
about Himeno's modeling

85
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,875
You're really evil.

86
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,291
You know that, don't you?

87
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,875
[AKECHI]
Heheeee...

88
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,541
[AKECHI]
Oh, wow.

89
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,000
You wear a bra?

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,208
You already knew that.

91
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,125
You've seen me
change in P.E. before.

92
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,666
I'm just going to
comb back your hair,

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,125
and then I've got
a wig for you to try on.

94
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,041
Perfect!

95
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,750
You're a precious little angel!

96
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,041
She is.

97
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,458
You're doing this
because you like to cosplay

98
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,083
not because you want to
teach me anything about fashion!

99
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,708
Yeah, so what?

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,625
Now, let's see how
this looks on you.

101
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,916
[NOZOMI]
Ugh...

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,791
Have you guys looked
through this magazine?

103
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,750
I mean, the pictures of
Himeno are pretty, and all,

104
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,291
but I don't get why
they have this spread

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,125
of an Antarctican snake girl.

106
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,166
I didn't really think
this was the kind of thing

107
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,875
snake people would read.

108
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,875
At least some
must if it's in there.

109
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,000
And "snake people"
is a derogatory term.

110
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,125
You should call them
Antarcticans.

111
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,208
Anyway, I'm not surprised
that spread is in there.

112
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,958
Magazines like
that are always careful

113
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,208
to treat all the races equally.

114
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
[NOZOMI]
I think I've had enough.

115
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,958
If you're just going to use me
as a dress-up doll, I'm leaving.

116
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:28,708
Aw...Hmm...

117
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,916
Heh!

118
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,708
[AKECHI] It's gotta be hard to
get letters of recommendation

119
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,791
after being expelled.

120
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,125
[INUKAI]
Play nice.

121
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,708
[NOZOMI growls]

122
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,083
[NOZOMI sighs]

123
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,583
Is something bothering
you, Nozomi?

124
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,541
You seem down.

125
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,958
Do I?

126
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,250
You look like someone
kicked your puppy.

127
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,625
Tell me something, Hime.

128
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,375
What?

129
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,416
Is there anything you've
been hiding from us?

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
[gasps]

131
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,708
This is delicious!

132
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,541
I'm glad we came.

133
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,666
[NOZOMI] If you eat
too many, you'll get fat.

134
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah, you're right.

135
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,333
Okay. See ya!

136
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,875
Hiding? What would I be hiding?

137
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,166
Oh!

138
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,458
[KYOKO]
This, maybe?

139
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,500
Oh, you meant that.

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,708
[giggles]

141
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,166
[NOZOMI]
Why didn't you tell us?

142
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,041
You know this is
a bad idea, right?

143
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,208
No, why's it a bad idea?

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,541
[KYOKO]
"Students are forbidden to work

145
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,000
while attending this school."

146
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,750
Does it really count if I didn't
get paid for doing it, though?

147
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,458
[NOZOMI]
Is that what matters?

148
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,041
I think it's about distracting
from our studies.

149
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,125
I was doing a favor.

150
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,083
The magazine's editor-in-chief
is a friend of my mom's.

151
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,166
Apparently, they have trouble
getting centaur models,

152
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,375
so she kind of
begged me to do it.

153
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,500
Yeah, there aren't all
that many centaurs around.

154
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,291
So, you're not a "model," then?

155
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,416
I wouldn't make it
a career or anything.

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,291
[KYOKO]
Why not?

157
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,791
Because it's against the rules?

158
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,291
[HIMENO]
Hmm...

159
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,291
That, too.

160
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,083
But also, because
I'd be embarrassed.

161
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,625
Plus, I'd have to watch
my weight all the time.

162
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,375
And, to be honest, the editor-
in-chief kind of scares me.

163
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,375
Aw, but you could
totally pull it off, though.

164
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,958
If the school rules
were different, anyway.

165
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,000
[HIMENO] I don't think it
would be a good fit for me.

166
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,291
Huh...

167
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,666
[KYOKO]
I dunno.

168
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,000
You seem like
model material to me.

169
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,958
You're super cute,
and you've got the height.

170
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,291
I bet you could be successful
if you worked at it.

171
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,250
Even if that were true, a
model's not what I want to be.

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,750
Well, what is?

173
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,458
[HIMENO]
Hmm... A doctor, I think.

174
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,791
You a doctor?

175
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,125
Sounds just a little scary.

176
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,416
That isn't very nice!

177
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,291
Remember there are dangers
to being a doctor, too.

178
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,416
[HIMENO, NOZOMI]
Huh?

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,750
Doctors get sued

180
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,333
for malpractice and stuff
all the time, you know.

181
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,750
I guess I hadn't really
thought of that before.

182
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,875
Okay, maybe I'd be better off
becoming a veterinarian instead.

183
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,875
[barks]

184
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,208
[HIMENO]
That's dangerous too, though.

185
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,541
I mean, what if one
of my patients bites me?

186
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,791
Besides, the only pets
I've had are fish.

187
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
[NOZOMI]
You could be a fishmonger, then.

188
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,791
Sell tropical fish and stuff.

189
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,416
[KYOKO] Fishmongers
sell fish for eating.

190
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,958
[HIMENO]
Tropical fish are tricky.

191
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,958
You have to watch the
nitrate levels of the water,

192
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,250
pH, temperature, everything.

193
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,083
[NOZOMI] Goldfish from festival
stalls never have their bowls

194
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,833
cleaned or anything,
and they live forever.

195
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
[HIMENO]
That's fine for them.

196
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,291
Algae produces oxygen
through photosynthesis,

197
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,375
breaks down their poop, and
even serves as food for them.

198
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,708
The problems happen

199
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,541
when humans clean their
bowls for easier viewing.

200
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,041
So, what, are you some
kind of fish expert now?

201
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,541
Stop!

202
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
[HIMENO]
If I did become a doctor,

203
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
I wouldn't necessarily
have to see patients.

204
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,875
There are plenty of doctors
who just do research.

205
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,750
My dad says that medical
research is a good field

206
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,125
to go into because the
budgets tend to be higher than

207
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,125
in other areas of study.

208
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
[KYOKO]
Wow, fascinating.

209
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
[NOZOMI] You've really
thought this through, huh?

210
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,458
I'm impressed, Hime.

211
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,083
Maybe we should start thinking
about our futures, too.

212
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,708
Well, I should, at least.

213
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,583
You'll probably be
taking over the dojo.

214
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,666
Nope, don't think so.

215
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,958
Never gonna happen!

216
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,166
Why do I feel like there's
something I'm forgetting?

217
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[KYOKO]
I mean, can you believe that?

218
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,958
[HIMENO chuckles]

219
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh, what do you need?

220
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,125
I know something I think you
would find very interesting.

221
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:53,958
Want to hear it?

222
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,083
[NOZOMI]
Hmm?

223
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,125
[INUKAI] Akechi is working
part time at a maid café.

224
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,291
[gasps]

225
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,291
Ah! No way!

226
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,541
[HIMENO]
Is something the matter?

227
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
[NOZOMI]
Uh... Nothing.

228
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,000
Thanks for that, Inukai.

229
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,541
You're pretty okay.

230
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,708
Don't mention it.

231
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,750
A little bird told me

232
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,875
that you're working
part-time at a maid café!

233
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,416
Yeah, sorta. You found out, huh?

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,208
[NOZOMI]
That's all you have to say?

235
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,458
Well, you had better
hope no one tells on you.

236
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
I trust that you're
not going to tell anyone.

237
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,166
After all, you're my friend.

238
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,125
So, are you saying
Hime's not your friend?

239
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,125
No, silly.

240
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,583
Of course, she is!

241
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,083
[NOZOMI growls]

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,708
[HIMENO]
Wait, what?

243
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,416
[KYOKO]
Brr.

244
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
It's freezing!

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,375
[sighs]

246
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,083
I'm a human popsicle.

247
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,000
[NOZOMI] You really are
a baby about the cold.

248
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,416
Well, I'm fragile.

249
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,666
[KYOKO] Not all of us discipline
ourselves with cold water baths.

250
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,375
Hey, shut up.

251
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,791
I don't do that.

252
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,291
[KYOKO sighs]

253
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,583
Talking about cold stuff is
just making me even colder.

254
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,041
[MANAMI]
Stop that. Get off of me.

255
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,208
[AKECHI laughs]
No way!

256
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,000
It's warm in here!

257
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:32,958
Honestly!

258
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,666
Hey, wait.

259
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,791
There!

260
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,458
Feel better now?

261
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,958
She's your girlfriend,
isn't she?

262
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,083
Do something!

263
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,125
I really would,
but she's a lost cause.

264
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,708
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
Oh! Hey, you three.

266
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,791
Yo, how's it going?

267
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,708
[NOZOMI]
Hey.

268
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,833
[HIMENO]
Nice to see you guys!

269
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,083
[KYOKO]
Good morning, I guess.

270
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,791
Ha! Come and
get in on this action.

271
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,208
It's so cozy!

272
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,125
They aren't yours to offer!

273
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,041
Aw...

274
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,125
Isn't this what
they're for, though?

275
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,583
[MANAMI]
No, they're for me.

276
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,583
Besides, the idea that
angelfolks' wings developed

277
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,958
as protection against the cold
is only one of many theories.

278
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,666
Nothing's been proven.

279
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,250
I know.

280
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,875
Some people even think they're
just decorative, like my horns.

281
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,666
They're warm,
though, so why not?

282
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,833
[KYOKO]
Lucky...

283
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,291
[NOZOMI]
Get a room.

284
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,333
[KYOKO sighs]
Nice and warm.

285
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey, stop.

286
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,833
You're bothering Hime.

287
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,750
No, it's okay.

288
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,375
I don't mind.

289
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,083
Aren't you worried, though?

290
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,125
The other day you were
talking about being sent

291
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,208
to a correctional clinic.

292
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
[KYOKO] Yeah, that's
when we were talking

293
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
about getting up
on her completely.

294
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,166
I don't think I'll be arrested
for leaning on her shoulder.

295
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,291
'Kay. I'll join ya.

296
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,833
[gasps]

297
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,333
Oh, I take it back, this is
starting to get embarrassing.

298
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,750
Oooh. Nice.

299
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,458
Thanks for the show.

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,666
Lucky.

301
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,458
Well, I'm not
letting you in mine.

302
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,333
Who would want to
snuggle up to you, anyway?

303
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,041
You handle the heat just as
badly as you handle the cold.

304
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
Is there any
temperature you do like?

305
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,791
[KYOKO]
I have a delicate constitution.

306
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,125
This weather doesn't
bother you, Hime?

307
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,625
[HIMENO]
Hmm...

308
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't mind the cold nearly
as much as you, I guess,

309
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,916
but I can't
stand the heat.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,625
No wonder, given
how large your body is.

311
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,000
[KYOKO] Animals in polar
regions tend to be big.

312
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,833
[HIMENO]
Mm-hmm.

313
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,875
[KYOKO] It's an
evolutionary thing, I think.

314
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,208
The reduced ratio of
body mass to surface area

315
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,250
helps them maintain
a constant temperature.

316
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,625
Yeah, that makes sense.

317
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,625
[NOZOMI]
I think you lost me somewhere.

318
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,750
You're comparing
Hime to a polar bear?

319
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,083
[HIMENO]
A polar bear?

320
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:56,208
Those are kind of cute,
but also kind of not.

321
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,375
I have an idea, Kyoko.

322
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,833
[KYOKO]
Hmm?

323
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,583
Maybe it would help you to
forget how cold you are now

324
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,666
if you thought about sometime

325
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
when you felt warm
and happy instead.

326
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,875
Wait. What about
that time last spring?

327
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,583
That might work.

328
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,083
[KYOKO]
Hmm...

329
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,500
Am I melting?

330
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
I think I'm melting.

331
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,416
[SOLDIER B]
Hi there.

332
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,666
Stick together.
It's easy to get lost here.

333
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,000
It almost feels like

334
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,791
we're walking into
a jungle, doesn't it?

335
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,083
Except the jungle doesn't
smell so much like salt water.

336
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
Well, hello and welcome

337
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,833
to the fourteenth
High School for Waterfolk.

338
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,958
Aw, score!

339
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,333
We've hit the jackpot here!

340
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,958
Quit staring, you perv.

341
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,250
[KOMORI]
I can't!

342
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,083
They're all so hot,
and their racks are huge.

343
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,500
What are you talking about?

344
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,916
Boobs!

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,708
Mountainfolk have the
strangest bodies, don't they?

346
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,500
They're so different from ours.

347
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,375
That one in front
has such a flat chest

348
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,875
it's hard to
believe she's a girl.

349
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,916
Follow me, please.

350
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,541
[NOZOMI]
The way the merfolk are moving,

351
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,916
they kinda look more like
upright snakes than fish.

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,625
Maybe it's like treading water.

353
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,875
I mean, if they swam normally,

354
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,125
their textbooks would
get wet, wouldn't they?

355
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,583
They lowered
the water level today

356
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,791
to make it easier for you
mountainfolk to get around,

357
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,166
but if you want, I can show you

358
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,000
how we really swim later,
during our free period.

359
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,416
Hello!

360
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,541
Hi.

361
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,458
Nice to meet you.

362
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,250
Yeah, same to you.

363
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Hi--

364
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,250
[BOY A] So, you enjoying
yourself so far?

365
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,833
Uh...

366
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,166
[BOY B] Hey, how about we get
out of here during free period?

367
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
Back off, bro,
I got to her first.

368
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,500
What do you say I show
you around town later?

369
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,250
Nah, you should go with me.

370
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,708
I'm a good time.

371
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,125
Don't listen to them.

372
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,666
Kyoko seems to be a real
hit with the boys here.

373
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,250
She's a lot different than
the girls they're used to.

374
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,875
I can't help but notice
that you all seem

375
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,958
to have beautiful figures
and large eyes.

376
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,416
Uh, thank you.

377
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,083
[MANAMI] A lot different than
you see in paintings.

378
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,666
Huh?

379
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,333
Your tail is touching me.

380
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,458
'Cause you're taking
up the whole desk.

381
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,708
So, cute!

382
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,708
Look at him!

383
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,458
She's huge!

384
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,791
[MANAMI]
This should be interesting.

385
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
Hey you've got a pretty
unique look yourself.

386
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,875
I look "unique"? Like, how?

387
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,916
I promised myself
I wasn't going to ask,

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,166
but are you actually a boy?

389
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,541
A boy?

390
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,500
[GIRL E] Well, you look
just like the main character

391
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,750
in this book!

392
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
[NOZOMI]
No. I'm a girl.

393
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,666
[GIRL E]
Really? Let's see.

394
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,833
Hey! What are you doing?

395
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,416
Aw. I'm sorry about that.

396
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,458
What's going on over there?

397
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,083
All right, everyone,
it's time to begin class.

398
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,541
Settle down.

399
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,500
Quiet.

400
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,916
[MANAMI]
I feel like I've lost.

401
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,250
Very good.

402
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,000
Now then, all of you from
Shin Kanata High School

403
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,583
are probably...

404
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,000
And that was supposed
to be a good memory?

405
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,833
[NOZOMI]
Those guys were all over you...

406
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,291
...which doesn't happen often.

407
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,875
[KYOKO]
What was that last part?

408
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,083
And anyway, I almost ended
up with heatstroke that day.

409
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,291
It's probably a lot warmer
there than it is here now.

410
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,375
[KYOKO] Actually,
I heard it's cold in winter.

411
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,791
[NOZOMI] But they're
basically naked year-round.

412
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,375
How does that work?

413
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,583
[KYOKO] Their bodies
are built differently

414
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,958
than people of the other races.

415
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,291
They have to be,

416
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,083
considering they live
in water all their lives.

417
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,708
[KYOKO] Man, we're talking
about cold stuff again.

418
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,750
[laughs]

419
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,416
Sorry. Whoops.

420
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,208
No, don't worry about it.

421
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,041
You're going to
knock somebody over

422
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,791
if you're not more careful.

423
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,541
I know.

424
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,083
[NOZOMI] There's still
something overwhelming

425
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,250
about the merfolk to me.

426
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,500
Maybe.

427
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,041
But did you see how
he was carrying her,

428
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,500
like she was a princess?

429
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,750
[KYOKO] Your boyfriend
would need a crane.

430
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,750
[HIMENO]
Don't be mean!

431
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,333
I'm not that heavy.

432
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,250
I'd give anything to
have legs instead of fins.

433
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,166
[KOMA]
Don't say that.

434
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
Huh?

435
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,916
Don't you see?

436
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
You're not worth
any less as a person

437
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,833
just because you
can't walk on land.

438
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,458
It's all about
evolution, y'know?

439
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,625
What's wrong?

440
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,250
Is it a STEM major thing,
or a boy thing?

441
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,166
[KOMA]
Huh?

442
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,958
[PURPLE HAIR GIRL]
Hey, look.

443
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,333
It's Koma and Shizuura.

444
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,666
[snickers] You've got a pretty
raw deal, don't you Koma?

445
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,000
[KOMA]
No. I really don't, actually.

446
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,458
That's right.

447
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,125
He does this
because he wants to.

448
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,791
Oh, yeah? Somebody
sounds a little defensive.

449
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,125
Well, we don't
want to interrupt.

450
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,541
We'll just leave you two alone.

451
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,833
Why does he always go to so
much trouble for her, anyway?

452
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,375
Just because they've been
friends since they were little,

453
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,125
and she's kinda pretty
and has big boobs?

454
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:49,541
Probably. Sounds like
more than enough reasons.

455
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,291
An old friend,
pretty, big boobs.

456
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,750
[DOCTOR] Introducing
the Cyber Troll Company's

457
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,833
latest walking
assistance machine!

458
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,375
Climbs up and
down stairs with ease!

459
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,875
And, should you
lose your balance,

460
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,958
it'll always be
there to catch you.

461
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,708
Its sophisticated,
cutting-edge design

462
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,666
even makes surfing possible!

463
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,208
Doctor, some people believe that

464
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,416
allotting most of the equal
supplementary budget

465
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,416
to merfolk is
reverse discrimination.

466
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,958
Am I correct in assuming
you disagree with that?

467
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,000
I believe we must do
whatever is necessary

468
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,083
to achieve perfect equality.

469
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
We have made great
progress in that area,

470
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,083
but there is always more...

471
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,000
Here, I've got our drinks.

472
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,500
What's that you're watching?

473
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,333
A walking assistance
machine for merfolk.

474
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,416
I want one.

475
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,541
[KOMA]
That's expensive!

476
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,791
I could probably get
financial aid for it.

477
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,250
[KOMA]
Yeah. I guess.

478
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,125
Well...

479
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,666
[sighs]
You're right.

480
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,750
It's way too expensive.
