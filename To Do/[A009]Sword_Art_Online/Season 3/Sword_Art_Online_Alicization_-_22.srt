187

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,880
after spending
all that time with someone,

361
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,050
one doesn’t need
a fluctlight to care.

362
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,290
Even if the nature
of an intelligence

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,460
is just a collection
of input and output data,

364
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,530
it is still possible for it
to have a true soul within

365
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,300
and, in some cases, love.

366
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,530
a concept
you’ll never understand,

367
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,670
as long as you live!

368
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,740
Administrator,
you wretched woman!
