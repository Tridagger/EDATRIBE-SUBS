Klein: A machine that
can interface with the soul

176
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,170
is the biggest deal ever.

177
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,172
you know
who doesn’t patent that?

178
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,441
Sneaky bastards, that’s who.

179
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,910
Oh, cool! We’re almost there.

180
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,387
That’s it, huh?

181
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,922
I don’t get it. What’s the point

182
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,825
of stashing kiri-dude
out here by the docks?

183
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,460
- ( Cell phone buzzing )
- ( Asuna stammers )

184
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,566
Hey, Liz.

185
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,902
Lisbeth: We’re out in front
of rath’s office now.

186
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,637
Their security’s super tight,

187
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,472
and they wouldn’t
tell us a thing.

188
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,808
Oh, and there’s
cameras all around,

189
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,544
so we asked yui
to check out the footage.

190
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,647
As far as she could tell,
they didn’t bring kirito here.

191
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,617
asuna: Okay.
I’ll call you later.

192
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,819
Hey, yui.

193
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,588
Yui: Here, mommy.

194
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,524
I just checked all the security
cameras in the harbor.

195
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,028
This property has
a helipad over there.

196
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,099
yesterday, at 21:20,
a helicopter took off from it.

197
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,934
Asuna: Do you know
if he was on it?

198
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,771
Yui: Well, I can’t confirm,
but I believe he was.

199
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,540
( Suguha gasps ) Oh, my god.

200
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,110
They could have taken him
anywhere then. Now what?

201
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,778
asuna:
Wait. Let’s not panic.

202
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:11,912
Yui.

203
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,681
Just confirming,

204
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,083
this is the last place
his signal showed up?

205
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,450
Yui: Yes, it is.

206
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:18,986
Asuna: He needs treatment,

207
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,788
so they’ll have to take him
to some kind of facility.

208
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,490
But if they landed,

209
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,226
kirito’s signal should have
popped up again by now,

210
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,463
unless wherever he is
is out of range.

211
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,699
Yui: Yes, that must be the case.

212
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,867
It’s possible they took him
out of the country.

213
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,502
Klein: Say what?!

214
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,204
Yui: It’s one possibility.

215
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,140
It’s also the most likely.

216
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,941
Klein: What do we do?

217
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,177
He could be anywhere
in the world by now.

218
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,780
Suguha: He’s right. How the heck
are we gonna find him?

219
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,683
Asuna: Kirito.

220
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,020
Yui: Cheer up, mommy. Have hope.

221
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,254
Asuna: I’m trying.

222
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,156
yui: When you
were trapped in alfheim,

223
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,492
daddy searched
all over for you.

224
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,462
he never gave up,
and eventually, he found you!

225
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,562
Asuna: I know.

226
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,797
Yui: Then cheer up!

227
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,966
Now it’s your turn
to search for him!

228
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,668
I know you’ll find a clue

229
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,636
that will lead you
straight to daddy.

230
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:13,006
and if anyone stands
in your way, they’ll be sorry.

231
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:16,810
Because nothing, no one,
can sever the bond between you.

232
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,812
♪

233
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,892
Asuna: It didn’t matter
what dangers he faced.

234
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,628
Kirito never backed down.

235
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,064
I’ll find him,

236
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,633
if it’s the last thing I do.

237
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,835
Thanks for the pep talk, yui.

238
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,204
You’re right. I won’t give up.

239
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,541
( Yui giggles )
That’s the spirit!

240
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,210
Asuna: Let’s think
for a sec here.

241
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,178
What do we know about rath?

242
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,849
Assuming they’re the ones
who have kirito now.

243
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:58,585
Suguha, did kirito ever
tell you anything about them,

244
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,154
anything at all?

245
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,055
suguha: I haven’t
seen him that much lately

246
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,523
’cause of his work.

247
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,593
we talked a bit
now and then, but not much.

248
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,729
You know what?
Come to think of it,

249
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,497
he did say something once,

250
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,833
something about
how that machine he was testing

251
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,802
was based on the medicuboid.

252
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,205
Asuna: They share the same tech?
I had no idea.

253
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,041
The medicuboid.

254
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,877
I just remembered
something he told me.

255
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,779
you know
who designed the medicuboid?

256
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,682
The commander, akihiko kayaba.

257
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,751
He laid the groundwork,

258
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,786
but his partner developed it
for hospitals.

259
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,122
Kirito: Yeah, in fact,
she was taking care

260
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,758
of heathcliff’s body
while he was diving.

261
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,659
She was his head researcher.

262
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,862
She helped him develop
full-dive technology.

263
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,832
Asuna: What was her name?

264
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,201
Rinko kojiro, I think.

265
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,171
Yui: I’ll run a search.

266
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,541
I found someone who’s most
likely the person you mentioned.

267
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,743
Currently, she’s a researcher

268
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,079
at the California
technological institute.

269
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,748
This is her.

270
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:04,985
The university’s database
details her career so far.

271
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,488
She’s a former member
of the shigemura lab

272
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,423
at Toto institute
of technology’s

273
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,058
department of electrical
and electronic engineering.

274
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,929
Suguha: Wait. Isn’t shigemura
the guy who made the augma?

275
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:19,700
Asuna: Yeah, and kayaba
was one of his students.

276
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:26,673
She might know something
about the s.T.L. And rath.

277
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,222
( Rinko sighs )

278
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,132
Wait. A floating castle?

279
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,837
kayaba: Yeah. A castle
in the sky with numerous floors,

280
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,073
100 floors, maybe,

281
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,976
and each one has a town,
a forest, and a plain.

282
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:07,447
To get to the next floor,
you climb a long staircase,

283
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,584
and when you reach the top,
you’ll find a palace.

284
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,487
Rinko: So what’s in the palace?

285
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,089
Kayaba: I don’t know.

286
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,792
When I was young,

287
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,795
I used to go to that castle
every night in my dreams.

288
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,832
every night,
i’d climb up each staircase

289
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:29,503
and get closer to the top,
bit by bit.

290
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,938
But then, at some point,

291
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,708
( Sighs )
I wasn’t able to go there again.

292
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,714
( Sighs )

293
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,951
It was just a silly dream.

294
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,654
I pretty much forgot
all about it.

295
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,531
Rinko: Liar.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,035
( Computer chimes )

297
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,503
Not again.

298
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,505
Hmm?

299
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,010
Asuna yuuki?

Pilot: Almost there.

301
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,857
You’ll see the ocean turtle
in a sec.

303
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,037
Rinko: Why "turtle"?

304
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,608
oh, see it.
Yeah, I guess it looks like one.

305
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,878
Looks more like a pig
from here, though.

306
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,582
Or a pig-turtle.

307
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,518
wasn’t there
a creature like that

I’m sorry, ma’am.

Security’s awfully tight here.

( Sighs )

348
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,808
fair enough,
but before you decide anything,

349
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,844
you should know
you’re one of three people

350
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,813
whose skills are crucial
to this project,

351
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,049
and now you’re all here.

352
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,517
Rinko: Hmm. Congratulations.

353
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,486
Well, well, look who it is.

354
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,890
Don’t tell me he roped you in
on this too, higa.

355
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,459
Higa: What do you think?
Of course he did!

356
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,695
Honestly, i’m stoked to be here.

357
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,063
I’m carrying on the legacy
of shigemura lab.

358
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,700
Rinko: I swear, you haven’t
changed a bit, have you?

359
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,703
Well, who’s the third person
you mentioned?

360
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,040
Kikuoka: Unfortunately,
I can’t introduce you now,

361
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,643
but don’t worry.
In a few days, i’ll show--

362
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,377
asuna: Mr. Kikuoka...

363
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,646
- You’ll take us to him now.
- ( Kikuoka gasps )

364
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:13,654
a-asuna, i--
wh-what are you doing here?

365
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,456
Rinko: She sent me
an interesting email.

366
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,162
Asuna: An organization
called rath

367
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,065
is developing a machine
called the soul translator.

368
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,967
It’s based on the medicuboid,

369
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:30,638
the medical full-dive rig
you designed the technology for.

370
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,041
kazuto kirigaya
was testing this new machine,

371
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:39,112
but he disappeared, and I
need your help to find him.

372
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,515
Rinko: Kazuto kirigaya?

373
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:44,452
kirito: I was
in the old "s.A.O." Server,

374
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,121
and I met kayaba’s
digital ghost there.

375
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,622
( Rinko gasps )

376
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,024
Kirito: We spoke.

377
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,759
He gave me a program
called the seed.

378
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:56,930
Do you know it? If you do,
i’d like to get your thoughts.

379
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,765
( Rinko sighs )

380
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,870
If you hate him
for what he did,

381
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,472
then just delete it,
and forget all about it.

382
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,709
It’s okay, really. End it.

383
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,477
But if there’s
still a part of you

384
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,046
that sees v.R.’s potential...

385
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:17,618
Asuna: After kirito disappeared,
I went through his contacts,

386
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,819
and that’s where
I found your email.

387
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,556
If you know anything about rath,
anything at all,

388
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,091
it could help me find him.

389
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,193
You’re my last hope, Dr. Kojiro.

390
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:30,064
Help me, please.

391
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,566
Rinko: Sorry.
Did we surprise you?

392
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,168
Are you having
second thoughts now

393
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,237
about inviting me to be
on your project, Mr. Kikuoka?

394
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,739
Kikuoka: Apparently,
our security

395
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,573
wasn’t thorough enough.

396
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,644
I know we have your assistant’s
photo from the university.

397
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,712
They should have run
a proper check.

398
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,481
Asuna: They did. On our way in,

399
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,817
they scanned my face
quite a few times, in fact.

400
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:53,186
But I had her assistant’s photo
in the school’s database

401
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,122
switched with mine a while ago.

( Kikuoka gasps )

403
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,625
Asuna: I happen to know someone

404
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,127
who’s great
at busting through firewalls.

405
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:01,662
Rinko: Right now,
the real mayumi

406
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,497
is probably on a beach
somewhere working on her tan.

407
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,837
Asuna: Take me to kirito.
