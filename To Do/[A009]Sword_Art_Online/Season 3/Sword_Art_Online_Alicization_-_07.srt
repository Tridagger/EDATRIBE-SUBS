115
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,288
your true power wasn’t
just expressed in numbers.

116
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,358
Only three stats
show up in your window,

117
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,295

your object control authority,

118
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,397
and your
system control authority.

119
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:34,435
If your object control
authority’s a low number,

120
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,005
you can barely even hold
a higher-class weapon.

121
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,574
But if your stat’s way bigger
than the weapon’s,

122
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,209
it feels crazy light.

123
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,679
Your system control
authority stat

124
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,983
tells you what kind
of sacred arts you can use.

125
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,019
if you’re low-level,
you can only use simple spells.

126
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,687
But if you level up,

127
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,957
you get access
to more sophisticated ones.

128
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,495
That’s how it works
in games, too,

129
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:05,166
but there’s an extra feature
here that affects your stats.

130
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,068
It’s something "s.A.O."
And "a.L.O." Didn’t have.

131
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,271
Sometimes, the strength
of a mental image you create

132
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,073
can influence your stats.

133
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,477
If a person has the confidence
or will to win,

134
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,213
their power can be amplified
many times over.

135
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,350
That’s what makes liena
so powerful.

136
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,553

’cause ever since she was a kid,
