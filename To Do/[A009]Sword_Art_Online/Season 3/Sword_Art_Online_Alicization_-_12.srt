exist in this world.

Technically, that’s true,

272

but there was once a time
when something similar did.

That was about 450 years ago.

Back when centoria was
no more than a tiny village,

there were four gods.

Kirito: Let me guess.

277
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,394
They were the four staff members
from rath who built this place.

Cardinal: You are correct.

279
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,065
Two males and two females
came to this land.

280
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,568
Each couple raised eight
children each on two farms.

281
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,337
They taught them
to read and write

282
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,007
and how to raise crops
and livestock, too,

283
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,843
and the moral arguments
of good and evil,

284
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,579
which formed the basis
of the taboo index.

285
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,516
Based on how effectively
the first four

286
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,851
were able to pass down
these teachings,

287
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,787
it’s clear that, as humans,

288
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,089
they were
incredibly intelligent.

289
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,690
However...

290
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,593
There was one among them
who was not only brilliant,

but devious as well.

292

inherited selfish desires,

such as the hunger
to rule and conquer.
