breakin’ the rules,

131

the school’s
and the taboo index’s.

132

On the other hand, anything that
doesn’t fall under the rules

is up for debate.

135

for a loophole.

they’d go that far

137

on doing anything.

That’s the secret mantra
of the aincrad style.

146
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,686
It’s pretty much the same
as saying, "stay calm."

147
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,088
You can also use it
to say goodbye to someone.

148
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,390
It’s like another way
of saying, "see you later."

149
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,726
Eugeo: Oh. Okay!

150
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,926

152
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,397
What an unusual thing to say.

153
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,832

i’m gonna go hit the sack.

156
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,372

by the way, about tomorrow,

157
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
I have to run some errands,
so you’re on your--

158
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,076
eugeo: Oh, no, you don’t!

159
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,079
We promised tiese and ronie
we’d take them out for a picnic,

160
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,382
and by "we," I mean us,
so if you think

161
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,883
you can get out of it,
you’re mistaken.

at 9:00 sharp,

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,756
so make sure you’re ready
to leave by then. You got it?

165
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,057
Kirito: Okay, okay.

166
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,793
Do me a favor, though,
and wake me up at 8:00.

167
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,795
I need to catch up
on some sleep.

168
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,664
Eugeo: No! 8:00’s way too late!

169
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,032
Make it 7:30!

170
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,601
And stay cool.

171
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,903
Kirito: I know I told you

172
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,704
that phrase
is like saying, "bye,"

173
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,374
but it’s not something you say
to someone goin’ to bed.

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,441
Eugeo: Why not?

175
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,377
Kirito: ’cause you don’t.

176
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,513
You use it when you’re really
saying goodbye to someone.

177
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,748
Eugeo: Oh.

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,783
What a complicated phrase.

179
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:16,763
If what kirito said is true,
are humbert and raios capable

180
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,933
of sidestepping the laws
of the axiom church?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,069
( Sighs ) What am I saying?

182
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,706
You can’t even doubt
the taboo index,

183
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,107
much less disobey it.

184
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,877
If there were a way around it,

185
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,845
I could have done something

186
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:36,483
instead of stand there
and watch Alice get taken away.

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,853
Why couldn’t I disobey
when I had the chance?

188
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,657
♪

189
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,928
Alice.

190
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,668
( Birds chirping )

191
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,902
( Frog chirping )

192
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,637
Tiese: Eugeo, are you listening?

193
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,072
Eugeo?

194
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,774
Eugeo: Huh? Sorry.

195
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,711
I missed that last part.
you were saying?

196
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,445
( Tiese sighs )
You didn’t hear a single word.

197
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,047
Eugeo: I’m sorry. I just--

198
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,917
i was just admiring
how beautiful the forest was.

199
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,586
it has animals
i’ve never seen before.

200
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,621
Tiese: Really?

201
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,989
Eugeo: Yeah, like that one.

202
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,426
Tiese: Oh, that? That’s just
a plain old golden flying fox.

203
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,462
don’t tell me
you’ve never seen one.

204
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,530
They’re in every tree
in the capital.

205
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,033
eugeo: Oh, right.
I guess you’d be used to them,

206
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,834
since you were born
and raised here.

207
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,902
Tiese: That’s true.

208
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,504
Eugeo: Do your folks
live nearby?

209
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,339
tiese: No.
They live in district eight.

210
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,109
It’s a bit of a ways away
from where we are in five.

211
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,643
Eugeo: Oh. You don’t say.

212
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,545
Uh...

213
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,548
Hang on. If i’m not mistaken,

214
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,017
don’t you come
from a family of nobles?

215
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,786
I thought all of the mansions

216
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,888
were in districts
three and four.

217
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,990
tiese: Only nobles
who are fourth rank or higher

218
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,525
get to live in that district.

219
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,061
my father is
a sixth-rank nobleman.

220
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,730
Therefore, he has
no judicial authority.

221
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,132
Eugeo: I didn’t know that.

222
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,033
i thought that was
something every noble has.

223
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,702
Tiese: Certainly not!

224
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,871
Only nobles fourth rank or
higher are granted that power,

225
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,007
whereas nobles who are
ranked fifth and lower

226
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,144
must adhere to the judgment
of those of higher ranking!

227
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,112
Eugeo: Oh. Interesting.

228
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,016
Tiese: Uh, anyway...

229
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,785
That’s why someone like myself,

230
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,786
an heir to a sixth-rank house,

231
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,622
is an aristocrat in name only.

232
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,558
In that sense, our lifestyle

233
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,794
is really no different
from most people’s.

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,029
Eugeo: Oh. Really?

235
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,531
Kirito: Okay,
so if your opponent

236
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,399
wants to get the drop on you
from above

237
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,934
with a high-norkian
style attack,

238
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,669
there’s two types of strikes

239
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,172
you gotta be ready
to defend yourself against.

240
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,574
They are a strike from above

241
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,510
or diagonally to the right.

242
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,911
If they do anything else,

243
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,879
that means they’re gonna
switch up their footing,

244
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,148
so you’ll still
have time to block it.

245
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,550
( Eugeo chuckles )

246
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,553
Man, i’m stuffed!

247
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,659
Tiese: Um, if it would be
all right with you two,

248
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,529
we’d like to get
your thoughts on something.

249
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,866
it’s about frenica,
our roommate at the dormitory.

250
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,568
( Both sigh )

251
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,570
Ronie: The elite disciple
whom she unfortunately is forced

252
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,640
to serve under
is a rather crude individual.

253
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,475
Over the past few days,

254
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,146
he’s been giving her orders that
go way beyond inappropriate.

255
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,382
Eugeo: His ranking is no excuse.

256
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,751
If he’s making her do things
that violate the school’s rules,

257
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,986
he should be reported.

258
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,922
Tiese: That’s just it.

259
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,557
technically,
they’re not violations,

260
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,561
but the demands he makes of
a female student are so obscene.

261
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,897
Eugeo: You don’t
have to say any more.

262
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:40,000
The problem is, the only way
to change frenica’s mentor

263
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,969
is to get the approval
of her current one.

264
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,971
Can you tell us his name?

265
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,041
( Tiese sighs ) Yes.

266
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,912
It’s second seat elite disciple,
humbert zizek.

267
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,514
Kirito: I’m not surprised.

268
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,048
( Both gasp )

269
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,585
Eugeo: A few days ago, I had
a sparring match with humbert

270
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,388
in the training hall.
We ended it in a draw.

271
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:05,092
In fact, he seemed
pretty upset by that.

272
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,530
my guess is he’s taking
his frustrations out on frenica.

273
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,465
Ronie: He’s doing this
out of revenge?

274
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,534
How could he be so cruel?

275
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,436
Tiese: I just
can’t understand it.

276
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,907
We live in a larger house
than most other civilians

277
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,477
and enjoy
some additional privileges,

278
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,713
but my father
would always remind me

279
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,415
that we should never
take those things for granted.

280
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,552
He’d say we were obliged
to ensure everyone,

281
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,886
no matter their station,

282
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,522
could live
a happy and peaceful life.

283
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,158
And if war broke out,
it’s our duty

284
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,795
to take up our swords first
and protect the weak.

285
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,131
and yet,
because of the heartless orders

286
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,167
that were issued by a noble,

287
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,670
frenica couldn’t help but cry
herself to sleep last night.

288
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,940
it’s not right. How can
something like this be allowed?

289
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,176
( Sighs )

290
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,745
Thank you.

291
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,048
Kirito: There’s a phrase
in the sacred tongue

292
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,415
that comes to mind,

293
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,050
which--let’s see.

294
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,588
it’s pronounced
noblesse oblige, I think.

295
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,826
Basically it means
whoever’s got the power

296
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,995
should use it
for the sake of the vulnerable,

297
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,531
just like your father said.

298
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,567
It’s a code of honor,

299
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,603
and that kind of honor
is more important

300
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,505
than any law or custom.

301
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,641
There are things
you just shouldn’t do,

302
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,777
even if there’s
no law against ’em.

303
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:34,014
At the same time, there might
be stuff you should do,

304
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,717
even if the laws
say you shouldn’t.

305
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,087
Ronie: I think I understand

306
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,821
what it is you’re saying.

307
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,924
If i’m hearing you correctly...

308
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,794
the taboo index
doesn’t cover everything.

309
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,929
In cases like this one,

310
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,565
we have to use
our own personal sense

311
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:52,933
of what’s right
and what’s wrong.

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,469
Instead of blindly obeying laws,

313
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:59,740
we need to ask why they exist
and if they’re even honorable.

314
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,940
That self-reflection

315
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,944
is more important
than just blind faith.

316
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,347
kirito: Yup!
That’s exactly right.

317
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,814
It’s super important to learn

318
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,649
how to act and think
for yourself.

319
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,651
That’s worth more
than the best sword

320
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,553
or the flashiest move.

321
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,823
Even though humbert didn’t
technically break the rules,

322
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,359
what he did is still 100% wrong.

323
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,763
Someone’s gotta hold him
accountable for that.

324
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,900
In this case, it looks
like it’s up to us to.

325
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:30,037
eugeo: Right.
We’ll go and sort this out.

326
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,041
Raios: Well, well.

327
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:38,545
To what do we owe the pleasure
of this visit, disciple eugeo?

328
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,415
and on the evening
of our day of rest, no less.

329
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,818
Eugeo: I’ve come to report
a troubling rumor.

330
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,788
unfortunately,
it concerns disciple zizek.

331
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,391
I thought i’d bring this
to your attention

332
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,960
before it damaged
his stellar reputation.

333
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,728
Humbert: Are you mocking me?!

334
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,597
Raios: Oh, my.

335
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,131
I must say i’m surprised.

336
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,667
i wouldn’t have
expected this from you.

337
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,669
How thoughtful of you
to be concerned

338
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,972
for the sake
of my friend’s good name.

339
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,841
However, i’m afraid
I have no idea

340
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,677
what this rumor
you speak of could be.

341
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,583
Along with the nature
of these claims,

342
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,086
I must ask where you
acquired this information.

343
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,854
Eugeo: From lord zizek’s page,

344
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,357
along with the girls
who room with her.

345
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,958
As far as the claims
are concerned,

346
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:28,762
they say lord zizek

these "perverse orders"?

you’re getting at, sir eugeo.

350
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,072
Which of the school’s
regulations

351
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,141

( Sighs )

354
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,015
Sir, even if something isn’t
specifically forbidden here,

355
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,817
do you not agree there are
things an elite disciple

356
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,420
should never do
as a primary trainee’s mentor?

357
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,623
raios: Oh, ho!
I can tell this upsets you.

358
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,059
Now then, what exactly
are you insinuating

359
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,462
humbert forced frenica to do?

360
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,063
Eugeo: I couldn’t say.

361

what say you, humbert?

362
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,434
Do you have any idea

363
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,803

could be referring to?

364
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,407
Humbert: Not even the foggiest!

365
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,910
Try as I might, I can’t make
heads nor tails of it.

366
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,779
It is true that I asked her

367
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,915
to perform
some menial tasks for me.

368
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,550
But ever since my duel
with sir eugeo,

369
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,054
which regrettably ended
in a draw, i’m a changed man

370
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,023
and have immersed myself
fully in my training!

371
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,427
Why, i’ve been using muscles
I did not know I had,

372
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,130
and, as a result,
my body ached so badly.

373
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,398
In such a humbled state
as I was in,

374
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,434
I had no choice but to ask her

375
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,536
to massage me every night
while I bathed.

376
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:43,938
( Eugeo gasps )

377
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,806
Humbert: I was concerned
she would soil her uniform,

378
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,942
so I graciously
had her strip down

379
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,776
and massage me
in her undergarments.

380
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,813
honestly, I can’t
for the life of me understand

381
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,149

could think that perverse.

382

Eugeo: Because of your behavior,
frenica has been beside herself.

383
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,593
If you continue harassing her,
I will be forced

384
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,596

of our instructors.

385
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:10,864

the reason they’re going
to all this trouble

398

is to set a trap for you.

if you’d taken their bait and
started going off on humbert,

402
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:54,474
they could have accused you
of being disrespectful to them,

403

to punish you. You see?

406

messing with frenica, he’ll pay.

407

is really your fault.
