00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,472
Alice: I am Alice,

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:11,209
Integrity Knight
Alice Synthesis Thirty!

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,745
I am the proxy
of the three goddesses

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,147
who protect this realm!

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,549
I am the priestess of light,

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,351
and whoever dares defy me...

9
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,087
( Through skull )
Shall know the fury of my power!

10
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,757
( Gabriel gasps ) A-Alice.

11
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,226
( Chuckles )

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,129
Alicia.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,566
This time...

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,035
This time,
her soul will be mine.

15
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,304
And once I have the lightcube

16
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,040
that holds her fluctlight
in my hands,

17
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,244
I'm going to savor
every last bite.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,513
Subjects, your attention!

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,384
We are heading south,
Pugilists in the lead,

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,453
then Dark Knights,
then the Supply Corps.

21
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,389
That knight
is the priestess of light,

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,192
and she is
to be captured unharmed!

24

26
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,041
( gear rattling )

27
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,057
Bercouli: The plan's working
a little too well.

28
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,660
Vecta's got his whole army
coming after you now.

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,263
He's obsessed with you.
No doubt about that.

30
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,332
Alice: We should
be thankful he is.

31
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,203
It is much better
than being ignored entirely.

32
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,405
Bercouli: All right,
let's talk about strategy.

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,608
I was thinking me and the troops
keep leading them south

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,678
and slowly chip away
at their ranks.

35
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,345
Seems like the best approach.

36
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,613
Alice: Agreed.

37
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,349
We have already wiped out
half of their numbers.

38
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,553
That leaves their main force,
the Dark Knights and Pugilists.

39
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,821
Chasing us will wear them down.

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,224
And if we can defeat
Emperor Vecta,

41
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,560
I have hope the remaining
people of this land

42
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,827
will be open to a truce.

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,229
Bercouli: Hmm.

44
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,165
That's a good hope to have.
Problem is,

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,302
who's gonna be in charge here
when Vecta's gone?

46
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,305
If only that punk shasta
was still alive.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,506
Alice: Then, it is true.

48
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,841
The general
of the Dark Knights is dead?

49
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,443
Bercouli: Yeah.

50
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,580
I didn't see him
or his number two out there.

51
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,982
He would have been
our best shot to reason with.

52
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,650
- ( Wings flap )
- Hmm?

53
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,585
Huh?

54
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,124
Renly: I have finished
my reconnaissance, sir.

55
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,527
The shrubland south of here
should work for our ambush.

56
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,996
Bercouli: Thanks for
checking it out, kid.

57
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,532
Tell the units,
and get 'em ready to move out.

58
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,868
That dragon of yours
must be exhausted by now.

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,471
Make sure it gets food and water
before we go.

60
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,673
Renly: Sir!

61

63
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,612
Alice: What is it?

64
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,415
Bercouli: Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'.

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,085
Part of me's glad there won't
be any more synthesis rituals.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,621
I mean, havin' your memory
and life stolen,

67
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,357
that's a horrible price to pay
to be a knight.

68
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:49,094
But then, part of me's also
kinda sad we won't be seeing

69
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,764
any more young'uns like Renly
joining the order.

70
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,232
Alice: Perhaps we won't.

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,103
However, stolen memories
and lives do not make a knight.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,706
I know of no such rule, uncle.
Do you?

73
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,644
When we are all gone, our souls,

74
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,246
our will, our purpose,

75
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:12,184
they remain to inspire
those we leave behind.

76
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
That is what I believe.

77
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,328
- ( Explosion )
- ( Gasps )

78
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,596

Pugilists yelling )

80
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,067
Alice: Here they come.

81
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,671
( Iskahn yelling )

82
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,473
Bercouli: Damn Pugilists.

83
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,809
They'll be a handful for us.

84
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,677
If you hit 'em
with your bare fist,

85
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,545
they'll happily take it.

86
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,481
But if you come at 'em
with a sword,

87
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,148
they refuse to get cut.

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,484
Alice: What? "Refuse"?

89
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,219
Bercouli: Yup,
that's what I said.

90
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,753
See, the more training
they go through,

91
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,090
the more they think a sword's
nothing to be scared of,

92
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,026
so watch out when you fight 'em,

93
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,495
'cause they can
will their skin to get hard,

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,230
and they can deflect any blade.

95
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,632
We'll have to keep 'em busy

96
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,035
'til the others are
in position for the ambush.

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,570
( Alice grunts )

98
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,506

go and face them.

one of them
super strong integrity knights.

104
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,964
Eh? ( Grunts )

105
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,540
Who are you supposed to be,
and why are you in the way?

Sheyta: Hmm.

108
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,414
I am a knight.

109
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,217
I am here to keep you
from advancing further.

110
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,152
( Iskahn laughs )
By the looks of you,

111
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,288
you couldn't stop a kid
from getting by!

112
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,090
Wait. Let me guess.

113
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,358
All you can do
is cast arts, right?

114
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Sheyta: Mm.

115
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,362
I am not skilled
in formal arts.

116
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,497
( Iskahn grunts )

117
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,032
Ah, whatever.

118
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,568
Go kick her ass, Yotte.

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,835
Yotte: You got it!

Sheyta: Just you, then?

122
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,378
Yotte: I'm way more than you
can handle, you beanpole!

123
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,381
Now shut up,
and draw your sword.

( Yotte growls )

127
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,564
I'll break you in half!

Administrator: I've heard that
you prefer keeping to yourself.

134

Why is that, I wonder.

135
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,028
Do people scare you?

136
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,097
Or perhaps...

137
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,566
Your urge to slice them
scares you.

Administrator: I knew it.

141
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,439
I can see in your eyes
that it does.

142
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,843
If you had your way, you'd
slice up everything in sight.

143
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,981
You feel like you're cursed
with a drive for murder.

144
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,651
Cheer up. There's no reason
to feel ashamed about it.

145
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:37,055
In fact, I can help you
use it to your advantage.

Administrator: On your last
reconnaissance mission

148
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,462
into the dark territory,

149
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,597
you brought
this flower back to me.

150
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,332
It absorbed massive amounts

151
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,602
of the spatial resources
generated on the battlefield.

152
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,672
I will turn it
into your divine object,

153
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,141
a sword with
the highest priority level

154
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,210
that can cut through anything.

155
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,045
( Sheyta gasps )

156
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,225
With this sword, you shall wield

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,761
a manifestation of the curse
carved into your soul.

158
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,298
Take it, and serve me
with your murderous impulse.

159
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,635
The curse you were born with
now has a purpose.

160
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,039
Slice and hack and slash away,

161
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,574
and at the end
of your blood-smeared path,

162
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,644
you will find the key
to breaking your curse.

163
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,480
At least, you might.

Alice: What a savage
fighting style.

170

And yet, as violent
as her attacks are,

171
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,606
I do not detect any hostility
or any emotion, for that matter.

172
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,943
Bercouli: I've known her
for more than a hundred years,

173
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,547
and I still have no idea
what goes on in her head,

174
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,948
not even a clue.

175

Don't worry about her.

176
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,151
She can handle 'em.

177
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,288
But we should go before
the main force catches up.

178
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,223
Come on. We have to make sure

179
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,292
everyone's ready
and waiting for 'em.

180
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,593
Alice: Right.

182
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,574
Soldier: All the units
are in position.

183
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,041
( Renly grunts )

184
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,578
According to Commander Bercouli,

185
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,581
the Pugilists
are vulnerable to sacred arts.

186
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,451
The plains might not have
enough spatial resources,

187
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,588
but here, there's
at least some vegetation,

188
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,055
so the priests should have

189
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,525
enough sacred power
to launch an attack.

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,394
Hopefully it'll cause confusion,

191
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,330
and we can use our dragons
to burn them.

192
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,133
( Gasps )

193
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,335
Are the Supply Corps
somewhere safe?

194
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,603
Soldier: Yes.

195
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,338
They're standing by
to the south.

196
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,672
They're far enough back

197
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,474
that they won't get caught
in the battle.

198
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,377
Renly: Very good. Thank you.

199
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,419

Come on, man.

205
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,703
I'm getting bored
sitting around, giving orders.

206
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,573
How's about we go outside
and have ourselves some fun?

207
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,375
Gabriel: No, thanks.

208
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,378
But you can go first
if you want to.

209
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,613
I'll pick a spot.

210
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,784
There. In those woods.

211
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,652
Vassago: That better be
where the action is,

212
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,520
or I'm gonna be disappointed!

213
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,256
Gabriel: I guarantee
you'll have fun,

214
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,292

You're gonna pay for this!

222
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,861
To these fists of mine,

223
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,930

Well, well, well.

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,764
You might look like a girl,
but you're as hard as a rock.

233

Sheyta: I am not a girl.

234
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,302
I am older than you.

Iskahn: Huh?

236
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,372
Yeah, I know you are.

237
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,240
You're an Integrity Knight.

238
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,110
You're all supposed to be
immortal freaks or whatever.

239
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,113
So what, do you want me
to call you granny instead?

240

( Sheyta grunts )

241
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,117
I'll allow it.

242
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,986
However, you are also freakish.

243
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,123
Your skin is so hard,
I could barely cut into it.

244
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,859
( Iskahn scoffs )
Deal with it, granny.

245
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,329
Besides, folks like us need
an edge against you knights,

246
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,732
what with
your demon powers and all.

247
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,868

You maimed 'em.

You were holding back,
weren't you?

252
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,481
What do you think we are,
training dummies?

253
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,818
You takin' pity on us? Huh?!

254
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,755
I'm gonna beat you
to death personally.

was punch?!

Iskahn: Now that
your armor's gone,

269
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,691
you're lookin'
way more like a fighter,

270
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:23,361
although you don't got
nearly enough muscles.

271
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,331
You should eat
and train more, woman.

Sheyta: As should you.

273
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,504
Just now,
you became a bit softer.

Iskahn: Eh?

275
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,107
Aw, who you callin' soft?!

276
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,909
I was just getting warmed up!

277

Now that I am, you're
gonna see me at full power,

278
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,382
so don't hold back!
Give me all you got!

279

off your face already!

how I allow
this battle to continue.

296
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,924
It must be this one's attack.

297
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,060
He seems weak
everywhere except his fists,

298
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:05,130
but he displays a will
worthy of an Integrity Knight.

299
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,400
I could end this
by cutting off his head.

300
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:09,935
I should, but...

301
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,272
I wonder if I can slice
through that fist?

Even though she looks

305
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,015
like some weak upper-class lady
from the human empire,

306
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,151
deep down, she's the same as me.

307
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:31,022
Uh-oh. She's gonna overpower me.

308
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,758
Oh, well.

Ronie: It wasn't too hard.

337
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,856
My mentor taught me to trust
my senses, not my eyes.

Where have I heard that?

Dozens of them?

351
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,160
If they destroy our supplies,
we will be immobilized.

352
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,296
And those two girls and kirito
are back there.

353
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,366
I should send backup,
but if I do,

354

the enemy will know
about our ambush.

355
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,971
Or could they already know?

356
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,107
Maybe I should send all
of these troops back to help.

357

Bercouli: I guess they figured

358
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,844
we'd head this way
after we broke through,

359
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,913

down here to meet us.

Get the troops
up and out of here.

363
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,989
Kiddo, go and help
the Supply Corps.

364
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,059

you'll hold them off,

367
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,397
but how?

368
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,400
They are 5,000. You are but one.

369
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,135
Bercouli: Kid, don't worry.

370
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,138
I got this. Now get goin'.

00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,141
Alice: All right, then.
Please be safe.

372
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,813

that old feeling.

379
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,295
God damn,
I missed the rush of it,

380
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,765
a life hanging
by the edge of my sword.

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,435
This right here's why I can't
get enough of player killing.

You gotta be kidding me.

394
00:20:56,957 --> 00:21:00,426
Same hair, same face. It's her!
