1
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,348
Asuna: I got this!

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,387
( Kirito yells )

3
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,393
Player: Well,
that's the end of that.

4
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,094
All teams, retreat.

5
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,631
Grid one-nine's too hot.

6
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,968
Player #2: Aw, we could
have killed 'em all
if we stuck with it.

7
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,304
You sure you wanna
end the day like this, boss?

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,240
Player #1: That team's
all over the place.

9
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,242
Fighting them
won't help with our training.

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,513
We have a big mission coming up,
and we need to stay sharp.

11
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,481
Let's go.

12
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,463
( Man sighs ) Hmm?

13
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,403
Woman: Mr. Miller, the people
from the N.S.A. Are here.

14
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,271
Miller: Send them in, please.

15
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,409
Agent: Mr. Miller,
we'd like to retain the services

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,213
of glowgen defense systems
for a top-secret mission.

17
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,015
Miller: What is the nature
of the mission?

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,351
Agent: To acquire a piece
of tech called soul translation.

19
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,353
Miller: I'm not familiar
with what that is.

20
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,223
Agent: A Japanese company
called rath developed it.

21
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,092
It's a machine
capable of analyzing a soul.

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,229
Miller: A human soul?
That's hard to believe.

23
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,098
Agent: Yes, well,
it's been verified.

24
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,234
With this soul translation tech,

25
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,037
not only can rath
scan and read a soul,

26
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,971
they can clone it.

27
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,574
The project is code-named Alice,

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,110
and its goal is to develop
an artificial soul

29
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,247
to pilot military drones.
That kind of tech

30
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,316
would disrupt the balance
of power in east Asia.

31
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,053
Agent 2: Needless to say,
the U.S. is concerned

32
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,855
and wants to keep that
from happening.

33
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,323
Miller: Understandable.

34
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,859
Please go on.

35
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,861
What are the specifics
of the mission?

36
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,996
Agent 2: There's a mega-float
moored near the izu islands.

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,998
It's called the ocean turtle.

38
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,268
We need you
to infiltrate the facility,

39
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,470
secure
the soul translation tech,

40
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,338
and bring it back.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,075
Miller: So you want to raid
a Japanese vessel,

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,877
one of our allies.

43
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,946
Agent 2: We have
a contact inside the J.S.D.F.

44
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,548
They'll be sure
to leave the window

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,015
open for you on the day.

46
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,485
Use whatever methods you want.

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,354
Just keep in mind
this is off the books.

48
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,358
You won't get any support
from the U.S. if you get caught.

49
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,128
Miller: All right, then.

50
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,898
I'll assemble a team

51
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,067
and lead this mission myself.

52
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,571
( Chuckles ) Alice.

53
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,372
Your soul will be sweet,

54
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,542
maybe the sweetest yet.

55
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,576
¶

56
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,445
( singing in Japanese )

57
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,713
¶

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,021
- ( Thump )
- Miller: Hmm?

59
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,490
Merc: Say that again, critter.
I dare you.

60
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,961
Critter: Sure, Vassago,
but it won't change a thing.

61
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,297
The lock on this system's
tougher than dried shit.

62
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,100
I could try and crack it
with the laptop we brought,

63
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,902
but you'd die of old age
before I got in.

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,105
They boned us, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

65
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,440
Vassago: That ain't
all you said,

66
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,176
you four-eyed scumbag.

67
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,244
You said, "we wouldn't
be stuck like this

68
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,446
if we weren't so slow
getting in here."

69
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,248
Critter: So what if I did?

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,517
I was just pointing out
the facts, is al--

71
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,320
Vassago: Next time, instead of
waiting for the all-clear,

72
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,856
you're coming up front
with us, you pussy.

73
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,923
( Fingers snap )

74
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,992
Miller: Enough.

75
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,994
You boys better cool down.

76
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,129
This isn't the time to start
pointing fingers at each other.

77
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,532
We have to figure out
how to deal with the situation.

78
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,933
Vassago: Aw, come on, bro!

79
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,004
Let me put this worm
in his place.

80
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,472
Miller: I said stand down.

81
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,208
Everyone did
what they were supposed to.

82
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,878
Aside from Gary getting winged
by a round, the team's intact.

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,413
And now that we're
in the control room,

84
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,816
we're exactly where
we need to be to get this done.

85
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,484
Vassago: Get what done?

86
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,486
If we can't get
access to the system,

87
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,154
then we can't get
what we came here to get.

88
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,290
The schematics said
everything's automated,

89
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,827
and the lightcube cluster
thing's behind a wall of steel.

90
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,830
Miller: Right.
So, all we have to do now

91
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,365
is figure out a way
to breach that wall.

92
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,967
Vassago: Yeah, well,
the S.D.F. Agents onboard

93
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,903
ain't gonna hide
in their holes forever.

94
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,706
And, when that ship outside
figures out what's what,

95
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,441
we'll be up to our ass
in soldiers.

96
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,176
Miller: The client told me

97
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,379
they have a special
relationship with the J.S.D.F.

98
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,049
They assured me
we'd have a 24-hour window

99
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,183
before the ship rolled in.

100
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,785
Critter: Ooh! Espionage!

101
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,856
That's way better than
a boring old smash-and-grab.

102
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,058
( Miller chuckles ) All right.

103
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,792
Let's go over the situation.

104
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,063
We stormed the facility
40 minutes ago.

105
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,733
Right now,
it's 14:47, local time.

106
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,001
We're standing
in the main control room

107
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,203
of the ocean turtle.

108
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,938
We've been locked
out of the system,

109
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,339
and we were unable to capture

110
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,876
any rath staff
to help us unlock it--

111
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,545
a minor setback,
not the end of the world.

112
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,614
Our new objective is to
infiltrate the sub control room

113
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,149
and try from there.

114
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,218
Well, Brigg?
Do you think it's possible

115
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,887
to cut through
the bulkhead door?

116
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,889
Brigg: Not with
the kind of gear we brought.

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,158
It's made out of some kind
of rock-hard composite material.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,094
If we gotta be
out of here in 24,

119
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,896
the portable saw ain't enough.

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,298
We need something
bigger and sharper.

121
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,034
Miller: All right.
Hans, can we use C-4 to blow it?

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,570
Hans: Sure,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

123
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,906
The chamber
with the lightcube cluster

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,975
is supposed to be
on the other side
of the wall there.

125
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,311
If we blow the door,
we'd risk damaging the chamber

126
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,845
and everything in it.

127
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,247
Miller: Hmm.

128
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,317
All right, somehow we
have to find one lightcube

129
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,052
in a vault of thousands
and retrieve it.

130
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,387
We have the cube's I.D.

131
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,790
As long as we have
a working console,

132
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:34,192
we can eject it
along with its interface.

133
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,928
Vassago: Piece of cake.

134
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,264
Thank god we brought seﾑor dork
along for the ride.

135
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,533
All that bs
about hacking the Pentagon.

136
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,068
If you were really that good,

137
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,070
you would have
had this system open by now.

138
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,405
Critter: Listen
to the super soldier.

139
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,541
Up to now,
the only combat you've seen's

140
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,410
been the virtual kind, hoss.

141
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,779
( Vassago growls ) Goddamn nerd!

142
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,415
( Both gasp )

143
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,418
Miller: Do you want
to go back empty-handed

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,755
and, instead of a big,
fat bonus, get laughed at?

145
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,758
Vassago: Hell, no.

146
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,026
Miller: And how about you?
Are you gonna let

147
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,495
some amateur programmers
lock you out?

148
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,030
Critter: No.

149
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,032
Miller: Then, think, damn it!

150
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,769
Come up with a way to get in
and prove you got

151
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,238
more than oatmeal
in your skulls. Understood?!

152
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,940
Mercs: Yes, sir!

153
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,811
¶

154
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:31,316
Miller: The pressurized bulkhead
leading to the lightcube cluster

155
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,185
can't be breached.

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,789
We have to find some other way
to access it from here.

157
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,256
What you got?

158
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,925
Critter: Admin privileges
can't unlock the system.

159
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,928
All I can do is bring up
a visual of the world

160
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,198
so we can see what
all the fluctlights are doing,

161
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,467
basically, watch 'em
living their lives

162
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,336
in their little
fairy-tale kingdom.

163
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,140
Miller: Goblins?

164
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,409
Critter: You know
your fantasy tropes, captain.

165
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,412
Vassago: They seem kinda big
for regular goblins.

166
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,048
Yeah. Those things
are hobgoblins.

167
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,684
Miller: Critter.

168
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,219
Critter: Hmm. Yeah?

169
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,154
Miller: Are those creatures
part of the system,

170
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,155
like NPCs?

171
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,289
Critter: Mm-mmm.

172
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,291
Not according
to what I'm seeing.

173
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,029
Check it out. They all got
their own lightcube designation,

174
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,297
which means
they're in the cluster.

175
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,099
Those things all have souls.

176
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,101
Vassago: You're kidding!

177
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,905
Those hobgoblins
have human souls, same as us?

178
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,907
Yo, check out
what the other lightcubes got!

179
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,844
Like, maybe they're all filled
with goblin and orc souls, too!

180
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,845
Maybe Alice is one!

181
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,179
Critter: Would you chill?

182
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,580
Look at the screen.

183
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,782
The underworld is split
into the human empire,

184
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,718
where, you know, humans live.

185
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:40,985
And, surrounding that,

186
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,254
on the other side
of the mountains,

187
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,190
is the dark territory,
where the monsters are.

188
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,791
With a name like Alice,

189
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,862
I'm pretty sure
she's both a she and human.

190
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,064
The problem is,
the human part is so big

191
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,800
and filled with people,
we'll never find her like this.

192
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,136
Vassago: Not sitting out here,
that's for sure.

193
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,804
But, in there, we could.

194
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,006
If they got a civilization,
they can talk,

195
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,075
so just drop me in,

196
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,143
and I can ask around
'til I find her.

197
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,144
Critter: Good idea!

198
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,145
For a dumb-ass.

199
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,213
Vassago: You little bastard!

200
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,215
Critter: Stop and think.

201
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,483
There's tens
of thousands of people

202
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,951
living in the human empire.

203
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,487
It's huge,
and you're just one person.

204
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,691
- You can't ask every...One.
- Vassago: Huh?

205
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,358
Critter: Unless...

206
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,427
You're someone with some clout.

207
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,896
Miller: Good point.

208
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,964
The researchers
must have special accounts

209
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,700
they could use to log in there.

210
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,101
It's a safe bet those accounts

211
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,436
would be a higher level
than the average citizen.

212
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,504
Isn't that right, critter?

213
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,840
Critter: Yeah, boss. Exactly!

214
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,442
Out of all the ranks
and classes,

215
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,312
the rath peeps
had to set aside a few to use.

216
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,046
That way, they could monitor

217
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,449
and tweak the world
from inside.

218
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,185
Vassago: Uh-huh.
Now we're talking.

219
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,054
Hey, how 'bout
if I log in as a general

220
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,990
or president
or something like that?

221
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,127
I'd give the order to find Alice
and let the grunts do the work.

222
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,130
Critter: Oh, my god.
Now that I hear you say it,

223
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,266
I'm not so sure
I'm a fan of the idea anymore.

224
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,402
Eh, balls.

225
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,138
They got
all these high-level accounts

226
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,140
locked down
as tight as the system.

227
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,342
If we dive in
to the human empire,

228
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,478
it's gonna be as
a plain old, low-level person.

229
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,880
Vassago: Damn it.
So much for that idea.

230
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,350
Miller: No. Try again,

231
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,019
but, this time, search
for any high-level accounts

232
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,887
outside the human empire.

233
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,289
Critter: Outside it?

234
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,225
Okay, but the chances
of Alice being in monster land

235
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,160
is close to nil.

236
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,629
Miller: Yes, I'm aware of that.

237
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,498
But, if all that separates
the two regions are mountains,

238
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,566
they can be crossed.

239
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,768
Vassago: Yeah!

240
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,235
That's why you're in charge!

241
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,171
Always thinking outside the box.

242
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,172
I can see it now.

243
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,174
I'll dive in as a boss monster

244
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,776
and lead a raid on the humans.

245
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,644
( Chuckles )
I'd be down with that.

246
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,380
( Critter whistles ) Look!

247
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,249
I think I found
a couple contenders.

248
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,919
No password required, gents.

249
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,388
Specs look good.

250
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,323
This one's classified
as a dark knight.

251
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,258
So edgy.

252
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,127
And his
object control level's at 70.

253
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,797
He's a bad-ass to the bone!

254
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,065
Vassago: Sweet.
Right up my alley.

255
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,133
Yo, I got dibs
on the dark knight.

256
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,470
I found another account
that we can access.

257
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,271
Eh? Well, that's weird.

258
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,408
There's no rank, and it
doesn't have a level, either,

259
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,411
no durability,
system control authority.

260
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,346
The only setting is its name,

261
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,483
emperor vecta.

262
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:28,086
Vassago: Hell, yeah. That guy's
the king of the monster world.

263
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,421
Changed my mind. I'll be him.

264
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,555
- Miller: No.
- Vassago: Eh?

265
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,890
Miller: I'll use that account.

266
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,161
Vassago: All right, bro.
You're the emperor,

267
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,830
and I'm cool
being a dark knight.

268
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,564
Let's get this show
on the road.

269
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,100
I wanna chop some fools
with my sword!

270
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,568
Come on, four eyes.

271
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,303
What do we gotta do to log in?

272
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,438
( Critter sighs )

273
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,040
Miller: Speak up, critter.

274
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,042
Something's obviously
bothering you.

275
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,512
Critter: Maybe i'm
just being overcautious,

276
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,180
but I keep seeing the same term

277
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,582
pop up again and again
in these logs.

278
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,385
It might not affect our op,
but still...

279
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,987
Miller: Go on.
What is this term?

280
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,758
Critter: "The final load test."

281
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,096
Higa: How do I put this?

282
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,966
As far as kirito's
real-world condition,

283
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,235
it's like I said before.

284
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,970
Things aren't
looking too good for him.

285
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,839
The only thing
that gives me hope

286
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,508
is he's still logged in
to the underworld.

287
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,246
That's good. See, even though
his self-image is damaged,

288
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,582
his fluctlight's still active
and receiving stimuli,

289
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,384
so there's a chance
his neural network can heal.

290
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,053
I was thinking.

291
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,387
His guilt
over losing his friends

292
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,323
is what damaged his soul, right?

293
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,192
What if--
and it's a big what if.

294
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,994
What if someone forgave him?

295
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:43,962
That might help.

296
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,531
Kikuoka: Huh?

297
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,467
Asuna: Send me. I'll go.

298
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,469
Rinko: A-Asuna.

299
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,178
Asuna: I'll go.
Log me in to the underworld.

300
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,682
I want to tell him
that he did all he could...

301
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:05,884
That it's okay,

302
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,219
that, after all the pain

303
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,355
and sadness I know he suffered,

304
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,425
in the end,
he did the best he could.

305
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,427
Kikuoka: All right.

306
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,363
We have another S.T.L.
We can use.

307
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,899
But the underworld's
at a critical stage.

308
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,102
It's not exactly stable
right now.

309
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,772
It's scheduled to enter
the final load test soon,

310
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,907
the last phase
of the experiment.

311
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,310
Rinko: Final load test?

312
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,178
What happens then?

313
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,246
Higa: The eastern gate
separates the human empire

314
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,782
from the dark territory.

315
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,850
Once its durability level
hits zero,

316
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,186
the monsters
will invade the human side.

317
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:45,124
If the humans were able to
build up their defenses in time,

318
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,059
they could drive the monsters
back to their side,

319
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,129
but now it's up in the air.

320
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,665
Kirito pretty much destroyed
the Axiom Church,

321
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,334
the ruling body there,

322
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,669
so who knows
what'll happen now?

323
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,140
Kikuoka: At this point,
having someone dive in there

324
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,209
might be the best course
of action for all our concerns.

325
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,812
Once the invasion begins,

326
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:09,815
there's no telling how chaotic
the underworld will get,

327
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,217
and there's a good chance
Alice could be killed.

328
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:16,287
But, if we send someone in
using a high-level account,

329
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,090
they could find Alice and
have the power to keep her safe

330
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,560
long enough to get her
to the world end's altar.

331
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,095
Then, using the terminal there,

332
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,032
they can eject her lightcube
to this control room.

333
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,835
Rinko: Ah! So that's
why you told kirito

334
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,170
to take her there, to eject her.

335
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,971
( Kikuoka sighs )

336
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:37,308
He'd have gotten her there
by now if he were able to.

337
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,311
You heard what he said.
She was right there with him.

338
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,382
Rinko: Time there's accelerated,
so, by now, months have passed.

339
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,783
Do you think there's a chance

340
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,186
they're still together,
even now?

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,454
Higa: I'd say
it's a good bet they are.

342
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,924
And personally, I think,
if anyone's gonna dive in,

343
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,060
it should be Asuna.

344
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:57,863
She's our best hope
at breaking through to kirito.

345
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,999
Plus she's got
the combat skills

346
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,134
to protect Alice
and get her to the terminal.

347
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,804
Kikuoka: You don't need
to convince me about that.

348
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:06,872
All right, let's find her

349
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,407
a high-level account
to dive in with.

350
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,476
Higa: Sure thing.
I got tons of options.

351
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,413
A knight, a general, a noble--

352
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,815
whatever you pick's
gonna have high stats, Asuna.

353
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,018
Rinko: Wait.
I just thought of something.

354
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,285
Higa: What is it?

355
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,287
Rinko: What about
the people in main con?

356
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:23,822
If they're here for Alice,

357
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,424
maybe they've got
the same idea we do.

358
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,093
Higa: Yeah. Maybe.

359
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,762
There's two S.T.L's over there
they can use.

360
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:33,765
Thing is, the passwords I set
for the high-level accounts

361
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,834
are tough, and they
won't have time to crack 'em.

362
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:40,171
If they dive in, they can
only go as a level-one person--

363
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,007
- ( sighs )
- Rinko: What's wrong?

364
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,175
Higa: Oh--

365
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,911
nah, it's nothing.

366
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,215
¶

367
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,200
Aki: Are you ready for this?

368
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,970
Asuna: Yeah.
Ready as I'll ever be.

369
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,311
( Sinon breathing softly )

370
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,414
( Gasping )

371
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,415
( Gunshot )

372
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,516
( Clears rifle chamber )

374

375
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,262
( Gasps )

376
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,833
( Wind blowing )

377
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,838
( Sighs )

378
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:47,839
( Gasps )

379

¶

380
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,380
( yelps )

381
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,248
( Groans )

382
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:03,355
( Miller chuckles )

383
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,125
( Sinon gasps )

384
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,862
Miller: Your soul...

385
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,931
Will be so sweet.

386
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,169
( Sinon gagging )

387
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,004
¶

388
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,845
( Gasps )

389
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:33,084
Jeez, not him again.

390
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,285
( Cell phone buzzes )

391
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,355
Asuna.

392
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,824
Yui: Hi, Sinon.
I have to tell you

393
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,225
and the others
something important.

394
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:43,362
Could you please
log in to "A.L.O." Right away?

395
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:44,463
( Sinon sighs )

396
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,234
Yui: It's risky,
but there's a chance

397
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,436
Daddy's fluctlight
can be repaired,

398
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,373
so Mommy dove in
to the underworld to save him.

399
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,307
Leafa: I hope she can.

400
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,243
Silica: What if she can't?

401
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,245
Lisbeth: Ah, would you guys
stop worrying?

402
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,980
Kirito's always
pulled through before.

403
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,050
Sinon: This sucks.

404
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:06,985
I can't stand
that they're stuck out there.

405
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,188
- ( Silica sighs )
- Sinon: And those hijackers,

406
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,322
what if they figure out
how to get to them?

407
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,992
Klein: There's gotta be
something we can do,

408
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,394
'cept sit around and wait.

409
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,128
( Yui sighs )

410
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,329
They're safe for now.

411
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,065
But be ready.

412
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:23,836
If worse comes to worse,
I'll be calling on you for help.

413

¶

414
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,084
Critter:
Fasten your seat belts, gents.

415
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:50,996
( Miller sighs )

416
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,472
( Wind blowing )

417
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,179
Lipia: Thank you
for seeing me, milord.

418
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,381
I, Lipia Zancale, bring news.

419
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,252
Lord: Very good. Take a seat.

420
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,386
Lipia: Thank you, milord.

421
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,257
Shasta: Don't be so formal.

422
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,858
It's just us here.

423
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,260
Lipia: Yes, I know,

424
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,295
but officially
I'm still on duty.

425
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,932
( Shasta sighs )
Have it your way.

426
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,535
Your familiar warned
of an impending emergency.

427
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,070
Is it that serious?

428
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,406
Lipia: Yes, quite serious.

429
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,143
The Pontifex
of the Axiom Church is dead.

430
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,011
( Shasta gasps )

431
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,948
That immortal being?

432
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,685
Lipia: Yes. I, too,
found it hard to believe,

433
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,954
so I spent the past week
confirming it.

434
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,456
Shasta: I see.

435
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,094
Perfect.

436
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,096
Lipia: I-I'm sorry.

437
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,097
Perfect for--

438
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,898
shasta: For peace,

439
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,032
peace for all.

440
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,168
Lipia: Is that still possible?

441
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,771
Do you honestly
believe that, milord?

442
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,973
Shasta: Whether it's
possible or not,

443
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,375
it must be achieved,
no matter what.

444
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,912
Lipia: But, milord,
you would first have to convince

445
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,914
the other nine in the council,

446
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,384
and, well, would
the order of Integrity Knights

447
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,187
even entertain
peace negotiations with us?

448
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,123
Shasta: Yes.

449
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,258
I believe the Integrity Knights
would be interested.

450
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,528
If the Pontifex is dead,

451
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:33,465
then I'd wager old man Bercouli
is in command now.

452
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,201
I can't stand him,
but he is reasonable.

453
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:38,069
I hate to say this,

454
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,939
but the only thing that could
get in the way of peace talks

455
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,741
would be our council of ten,

456
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:46,411
not all, just four of them.

457
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,346
They will have to die.

458
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,948
Lipia: Milord! That's too risky!

459
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,617
You could handle
the goblin chiefs

460
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,419
and the Orc Chief. However--

461
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,355
Shasta: The head
of the dark mages guild

462
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,490
would be difficult. I know.

463
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,961
She hopes to find the secret
to administrator's immortality

464
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,096
and one day become empress.

465
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:08,099
Peace would get in the way
of her ambitions.

466
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,235
Lipia: Precisely!

467
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:13,104
That is why you cannot
take the chance, milord.

468
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,974
As I said, the Goblin and
Orc Chiefs are no match for you,

469
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,844
but she is diabolical!
I can't imagine

470
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,246
what kind of evil spells
she has up her sleeve!

471
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,916
( Singing in Japanese )

472
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,120
( Shasta chuckles )

473
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,321
Listen, Lipia,

474
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,392
how long have you and I
been together?

475
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,526
Lipia: Uh...

476
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,395
Well, um...

477
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,930
Since I turned 21, I think,

478
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,065
so four years now?

479
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,934
Shasta: That long? Really?

480
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,069
Forgive me.

481
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:46,005
I made you wait far too long.

482
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,006
It's not fair.

483
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,340
I was thinking...

484
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,876
Maybe now we could...

485
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:53,045
You know...

486
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,283
Make it official
and become husband and wife.

487
00:21:58,419 --> 00:21:59,985
( Lipia gasps )

488
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,890
- Milord.
- Shasta: I know.

489
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,358
I wish I were younger, too.

490
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,294
¶

491
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:18,303
- Man: Emergency!
- Lipia: I--

492
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,039
Man: It's an emergency!

493
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,507
Come to the throne room!

494
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,844
The chain that seals the door
is trembling!

495
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:30,849
