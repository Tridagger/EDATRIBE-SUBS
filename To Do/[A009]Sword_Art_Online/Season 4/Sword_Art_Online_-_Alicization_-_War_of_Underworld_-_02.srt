Kirito...

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,730
You cannot fight, but I can.

8
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,098
Do not worry.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,035
I shall rescue them
and come right back.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,438
I promise.

14
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,482
Alice: Goblins.

15
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,484
( Goblins growling, laughing )

16
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,091
Goblin: Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

( Men gasp )

18
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,900
Alice: Why don't they
flee south, where it is clear?

19
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,836
Alice: Amayori, wait here.

20
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,579
Gasfut: Should the enemy
breach our defenses,

21
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,848
you must hold them back!

22
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,649
Barbossa: You hear that?!
Stand your ground,

23
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,052
and keep those things
out of our village!

24
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,321
( Villagers gasp, yell )

25
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,390
- Gasfut: Eh?
- Man: What is it?

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,991

Selka: Alice?

29

( Alice grunts )

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,543
Look...

31
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,678
They will surround you
if you stay here.

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,681
Have everyone evacuate
by the south road

33
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,949
while you still have time.

34
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,218
Barbossa: A-are you insane?!

35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,955
My mansion--i mean,
this village is our home!

36
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,623
Alice: It can be rebuilt,

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,694
but, if you stay,
you will surely be slaughtered.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,564
Which is more important,
your possessions or your lives?

39
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,499
( Barbossa sputters, sighs )

40
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,501
Gasfut: We must stay,
because it is what zink,

41
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,169
our man-at-arms, ordered.

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,905
We are
the last line of defense.

43
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,575
In this situation,
everyone must do what he says,

44
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,443
even I, the village elder.

45
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,578
( Alice gasps )

46
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,980
Gasfut: Imperial law
is clear on that.

47
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,917
Selka: We should do
as my sister says.

48
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,451
( Gasfut gasps )

49
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,186
Selka: Please, father.

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,455
( Alice sighs )

51
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,591
Selka.

52
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,658
( Selka grunts )

53
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:14,659
Listen to her.

54
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,662
You know she speaks the truth.

55
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,598
Our lives are more important!

56
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,601
I know we have to follow
the laws of the land,

57
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,436
but, even so...

58
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,139
If we stay, we die!

59
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,874
Barbossa: We can't
abandon our homes!

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,678
You're just a child,
and you should mind your tongue!

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,748
We will stay
and protect the village!

62
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,749

¶

64
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,887
I-I see now.

65
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,889
This is your doing, isn't it?!

66
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,025
These things
from the dark territory

67
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,561
wouldn't be here
if not for you, Alice!

68
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,696
Years ago, when you were a child

69
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,499
and trespassed onto their land,
you were tainted!

70
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,768
You're a witch!

71
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,103
She is in league
with the monsters!

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,373
Alice: I am a knight,

73
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,776
and I revoke
the man-at-arms's order.

74
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,845
You will all
evacuate the village

75
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,047
by the south road at once!

76
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,784
Those of you bearing weapons
shall take the lead.

77
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,453
Barbossa: You--
you cannot be a knight,

78
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,988
not in this village.

79
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,856
There's no calling
for them here!

80
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,058
You can handle a sword
reasonably well,

81
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,727
but claiming to be a knight
is outrageous!

82
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,830
What if a knight from centoria
heard this?!

83
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,867
Alice: My name is Alice.

84
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,370
¶

85
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,943
I am one of the three knights
who oversee centoria,

86
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,547
an integrity knight
of the church,

87
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,750
Alice Synthesis Thirty!

88
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,753
- ( Villagers murmuring )
- ( Barbossa gasps )

89
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,490
Y-You're an integrity knight?!

90
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,962
Selka: Why didn't you tell me?

91
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,536
Alice: In truth,
I was afraid to.

92
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,573
The knighthood
is both my duty...

93
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,642
And my punishment.

94
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,845
Selka: I knew
you weren't a sinner.

95
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,979
Deep down, I knew!

96
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,915
I always believed in you!

97
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,316
( Thump )

98
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,020
Gasfut: I will do
as the lady knight commands.

99
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,655
We shall evacuate.

100
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,757
( Alice gasps )

101
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,927
Gasfut: All those
bearing weapons

102
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,730
will lead the villagers
to the south gate at once!

103
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,065
As soon as everyone is out,

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,734
evacuate to the forest
south of the clearing!

105
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,469
( Villagers chattering )

106
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,738
Man: I need help with
the wounded and the elderly!

107
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,541
Man 2: Right behind you!
Hey, you over there, follow us!

108
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,811
Alice: Keep them safe, father--

109
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,515
Selka and mother, everyone.

110
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,218
Gasfut: Yes, milady.

111
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,687
Be safe as well.

112
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,556
Selka: Be careful.

113
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,924
Don't get yourself hurt.

114
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,894
Alice: Amayori!

115
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,496
( Amayori roars )

116
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,398

( Zink gasps )

118
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,705
There's way too many.

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Fall back! Retreat!

120
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,710
- ( Gasps )
- Alice: Burn them!

121
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,811
Goblin: Eh?

122
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,447
( Goblins scream )

123
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,382

125
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,790
Barbossa: It'll burn everything!

126
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,592
Selka: Alice has a dragon?

127
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,530
Zink: Whoa.

128
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,333

Zink: What are you doing here?

131
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,008
Alice: There is
no time to explain.

132
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,543
Follow the others to safety.

133
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,045
Hurry up!

134
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,948
Goblin: I'll kill ye

135
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,017
and eat yer guts, ium woman!

( Orc growls )

139
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,976
Alice: From this moment on,

140
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,045
I fight for that
which is important to me,

141
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,381
the lives of my sister
and parents.

142
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,983
I fight...

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,920
For the sake of what Kirito and
eugeo sacrificed everything for,

144
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,822
the people.

145
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,662
( Chorus vocalizing )

( Goblins and Orcs yelling )

147
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Alice: Thank you, Kirito.

148
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,741
I am all right now.

149
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,144
Though I may still falter,

150
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,146
my purpose is crystal clear.

151
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,751
I shall persevere
for the sake of our cause.

152
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,554
Halt! My name is Alice.

153
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,956
As long as I live,
the human realm

154
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,893
will not fall to you, so begone!

155
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,629
Return to your homeland now,

156
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,298
or you will die where you stand!

157
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,668
Enhance armament!

You stupid ium girl!

167
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,420
The end mountains
separate our lands.

168
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,889
Dig through it if you will,

169
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,624
but, as long
as we knights exist,

170
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,594
you are not
to set foot here again.

171
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:24,730
Make your choice!

172
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,567
Step forward,
and drown in your blood,

173
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,436
or retreat
to your land of darkness!

174
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,505

185
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,734
Alice: No, I understand.

186
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:05,938
One day, when I
have fulfilled my duties,

187
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,872
I will return,

188
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,075
not as a knight,
but as Alice Zuberg.

189
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,645
Perhaps then
I shall be able to say...

190
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,016
"I have come home, father."

191
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,753
¶

192
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,460
( thinking ) I will return
to this village someday.

193
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,869
And, even if I fall in battle,
I know my heart will.

194
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,873
¶

195
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,601
( Man chuckles )

196
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,489
( Energy surges )

197
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,892
Man 2: Where the hell
is everyone?

198
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,761
Man 3: Hiding. Duh!

199
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,830
Man 1: Locate them.

200
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,834
Man 3: There you go.

201
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,769
The sub control room.

202
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,680
Higa: I patched in
to the backup power.

203
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,183
The subcon's up and running
and ready for action now!

204
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,354
( Kikuoka grunts )

205
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,959
Asuna: You better pray
Kirito wakes up again,

206
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,295
because, if he doesn't,
I swear I'll make you pay!

207
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,230
( Sandal taps )

208
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,299
( Kikuoka gasps )

209
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,100
( Sighs )

210
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,169
I know. I know.

211
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,304
I'm going to do everything I can

212
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,106
to bring him back. I promise.

213
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,376
- ( Gasping )
- ( Sandals clatter )

214
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,180
Rinko: Take it easy.

215
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,448
You will get him back,

216
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,384
but this isn't the way to do it.

217
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,918
Try to stay calm.

218
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,655
Asuna: You're right.
I'm okay now.

219
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,923
Just overreacted there
for a minute.

220
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,792
( Door hisses )

221
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,793
Kikuoka: Huh?

222
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:43,395
Nakanishi: Reporting in.

223
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,998
The primary
and secondary bulkheads

224
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,399
are sealed and secure.

225
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,468
Also, all noncombat personnel

226
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,137
have been evacuated
to the bow block.

227
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,271
Kikuoka: Good work.

228
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,808
About how long
will the bulkheads hold?

229
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,343
Nakanishi: Depends.
If they have saws, eight hours.

230
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,212
A few minutes
if they have explosives,

231
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,946
but they won't go with that,

232
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,082
not on the primary bulkhead.

233
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,886
Kikuoka: It's too close
to the lightcube cluster.

234
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,222
All right,
let's see where we stand.

235
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,959
Casualties first.
Please tell me everyone's okay.

236
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,161
Nakanishi: They are, sir.

237
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,562
Three civvies
with the research team

238
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,297
sustained minor injuries.

239
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,566
As for our S.D.F. Unit,

240
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,102
it suffered two minor
and two heavy injuries.

241
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,904
It's nothing life-threatening.

242
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:26,839
They're being treated now.

243
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,841
Kikuoka: What about the ship?

244
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,308
Nakanishi: Not so good, sir.

245
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,845
The bulkheads from
the bilge dock to main control

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,181
are offline
and can't be accessed remotely.

247
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,116
But the real issue is power.

248
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,053
The main line was cut,
so we're on auxiliary now.

249
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,055
The good news
is we have stable power

250
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,456
all through the ship.

251
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,991
The bad news is
we can't rotate the screw props

252
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,927
without rebooting
the whole system.

253
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:52,531
Kikuoka: Like a sea turtle
without fins

254
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,867
and with a shark
nipping at its belly.

255
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,469
Nakanishi: Yes.
They got the bilge dock

256
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,072
and all 12 sectors
in the lower shaft.

257
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,074
( Sighs ) The bastards.

258
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,876
They got us good.

259
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,143
Nakanishi: They did.

260
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,280
All right,
they have main control,

261
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,416
S.T.L. One,
and the nuclear reactor.

262
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,887
They don't want to destroy us.
If they did,

263
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,155
they would've blown us
out of the water by now.

264
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,624
The next question is...

265
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,894
Who the hell are these people?

266
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,496
Higa, what do you think?

267
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,165
Higa: Oh. Um...

268
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,467
Let's have a looksie.

269
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:31,770
( Both gasp )

270
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,305
Higa: Going by their suits

271
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,573
and the hardware
they're packing,

272
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,575
I'd say they were mercs.

273
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,843
And, based on
their average size,

274
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,512
I'm pretty sure
they're not Asian.

275
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,847
Kikuoka: Well,
look on the bright side.

276
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:43,982
At least
we're not being attacked

277
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,184
by our own special forces,

278
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,519
which is a relief.

279
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,523
We can also be sure
of one other thing.

280
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,525
Whoever these people are,

281
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,394
they know about
project alicization.

282
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,130
Higa: Yup, you got that right.

283
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,332
They broke in
through the bilge deck

284
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,935
and headed straight
for the main control room.

285
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,937
They know about the S.T.L.,

286
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,773
and they know
we have a true bottom-up A.I.

287
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,009
They're here for Alice.

288
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:12,877
( Both gasp )

289
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,814
Higa: Fortunately,
I locked main con down in time.

290
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,150
( Chuckles ) I fixed it

291
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,485
so they can't interfere
with the simulation

292
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,221
or eject Alice's fluctlight
from the lightcube cluster.

293
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,023
Kikuoka: That's fantastic,

294
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,825
but, then, neither can we.

295
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,426
Higa: No, we can't.

296
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,029
No one can eject
Alice's lightcube externally,

297
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,565
either them in main
or us in here.

298
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,167
But that's a good thing!

299
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,836
I mean, it's pretty much
a win for our side.

300
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:40,505
They can't access the cluster
by computer,

301
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,040
and they won't
break through the wall,

302
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,175
'cause they know
they'll damage it.

303
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,377
It's only a matter of time

304
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,312
'til the "Asahi"
comes with backup.

305
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,914
Then it's game over
for those dumb-asses.

306
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,849
Game over!

307
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,317
Kikuoka: But we still don't know

308
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,253
if we're playing the game
or getting played.

309
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,122
- Higa: Huh?
- Kikuoka: We're here.

310
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,257
Where's the "Asahi"?

311
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,626
Nakanishi: Waiting, sir.

312
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,194
¶

313
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,797
the fleet command
in Yokosuka ordered her

314
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,200
to keep her distance and
stand by until further notice.

315
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,869
They seem to think
we've been taken hostage

316
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,070
and are sitting tight

317
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,139
until the attackers
make their demands.

318
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,341
Kikuoka: Here's what I think.

319
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,276
Our guests
have to have a back channel

320
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,278
to someone high up in the S.D.F.

321
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,016
And, if I'm right,
the "Asahi" won't move in

322
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,819
until Alice's lightcube
has been retrieved.

323
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,553
Higa: Well, now we know.

324
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,223
We're not dealing
with terrorists here.

325
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,424
This isn't good.

326
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,827
If these guys are
what I think they are,

327
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,161
they'll have
an expert with 'em!

328
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,497
Kikuoka: Who might realize
they can eject the cube

329
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,565
from inside the underworld.

330
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,035
Since they have
control of S.T.L. One,

331
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,436
they can drop someone in

332
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,906
and use the virtual console
to execute the command.

333
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,043
Rinko: And if they do that,
then what?

334
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,512
Kikuoka: The target cube
will be extracted

335
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:57,115
from the lightcube cluster
in the center of the main shaft.

336
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,251
Then, it'll be sent
through an air tube

337
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,854
to a hatch
in the selected control room.

338
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,523
The hatch
for this room's over there.

339
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,193
The other's in main con,
with them.

340
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,863
( Typing )

341
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,131
Well, now that we
know what they want,

342
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,334
we have to retrieve Alice's
fluctlight before they do.

343
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,437
Right now, that's up to Kirito.

344
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,206
Once again...

345
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,743
All our hopes
are riding on his shoulders.

346
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,611
Higa, how is he?

347
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,780
What's his status currently?

348
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,616
Higa: Well,
the short version is...

349
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,952
He's stable now,

350
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,955
but he's on the edge
of not good.

351
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,824
( Asuna gasping )

352
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,896
Higa:
That death gun dude's toxin

353
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,964
damaged Kirito's neural network.

354
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,367
And that's not something
conventional treatment can help.

355
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,902
We thought the S.T.L.

356
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,904
Could stimulate
the growth of a new network,

357
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,574
so we blocked his memory and
dropped him into the underworld.

358
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,644
But, this time,
his memory didn't get blocked,

359
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,914
probably 'cause of
the neural damage.

360
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,116
He woke up in there
as his real-world self,

361
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,184
and we didn't find out
until he called us.

362
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,921
Rinko: What? Hang on a second.

363
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,188
What about time?

364
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,990
It's accelerated
in the underworld.

365
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,793
How much time has passed
in there since he dove in?

366
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,129
Higa: About 2 1/2 years.

367
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,864
For that whole time,
he's been interacting

368
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,335
with the artificial fluctlights
like they were real people.

369
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,471
He also knew that,
once the simulation ended,

370
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,474
his new friends
and their world would be erased.

371
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,943
That's why
he went to the console

372
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:32,477
in the central cathedral,

373
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,014
since that was the only way
to get ahold of us.

374
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,016
Or rather keeks here.

375
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,752
I bet he was gonna
try to convince you

376
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,220
to spare them and their world.

377
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,223
He had to fight like hell
to get to that console,

378
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,426
but he made it,
thanks to some friends.

379
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,296
I couldn't check the event log
during all the commotion here,

380
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,497
but his friends helped him

381
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,033
in the fight
with the axiom church.

382
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,169
Some didn't make it.

383
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,172
When he got through to us,
he was in mental distress,

384
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,975
blaming himself
for the death of his friends.

385
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,113
And, by doing that, he ended up
attacking his own fluctlight.

386
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,849
It was right about then
when those jackasses

387
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,518
cut the power line.
That caused a short circuit,

388
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,389
and the surge from that caused
a spike in the S.T.L.'s output.

389
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,123
As a result,

390
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,328
Kirito's self-destructive
impulse was actualized.

391
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,265
Then his ego was deactivated.

392
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,533
Rinko: I don't get it.

393
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,935
His ego was deactivated?

394
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:33,071
I didn't know that was possible.

395
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,207
Higa: Have a look at the screen.

396
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,541
That's a fluctlight,

397
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,543
Kirito's fluctlight
to be precise.

398
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,146
And that black hole
right there...

399
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,415
Is where a person's self-image
should be.

400
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,350
Rinko: The self-image,

401
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,021
the idea, concept,
or mental image of oneself.

402
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,289
Higa: Yup.
All of your decision making

403
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:55,093
passes through a simple yes-no
pathway in your fluctlight.

404
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,429
It asks whether you should
or shouldn't do something

405
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,232
based on
whatever situation you're in.

406
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,100
For example, Dr. Kojiro,

407
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,036
when you're
at your fave beef-bowl place,

408
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,838
you ever order a second helping?

409
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,572
Rinko: Mm, no.

410
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,374
Higa: Even if in your mind,
you're like,

411
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,510
"Damn, this is good.
I could eat another bowl"?

412
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,378
Rinko: Never.

413
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,580
Higa: And that's
your self-image pathway at work.

414
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,182
Decisions
can't lead to actions

415
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,051
unless they go
through those circuits.

416
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:23,188
In Kirito's case, his fluctlight
is damaged in that one spot.

417
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,457
He can't process
what happens around him,

418
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,392
and he can't initiate an action.

419
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,263
All he can do, I think, is stuff
he remembers from repetition--

420
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,465
eating, sleeping,
stuff like that.

421
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,403
Right now, I don't think
he knows who he is

422
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,138
or what he should do,

423
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,941
and he can't speak,
so he can't ask for help.

424
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:44,409
But that's just my theory.

425
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,344
( Asuna sighs )

426
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:55,888
¶

427
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,790
( singing in Japanese )

428
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,033
( Typing )

429
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,069
( Man chuckles )

430
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:45,904
( Whistles )

431
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,115
( Man 2 chuckles )
