Please, come in.

Undetermined, you say?

534
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,333
I guess these days people
can do all sorts of things

535
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,250
they weren't able to before.

536
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,000

This is different, though.

I believe they possess power
that's particularly unusual.

of any real significance

to someone such as yourself,

that you have with Toma...

Well, Toma does the

when you get to know him.

[KAMIJO] Tomorrow?

636
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,208
Yep. I'm discussing
my contract

00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,041
with the Orbit
Portal people.

00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,166
Oh, really?
It's just,

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,291
I've got a remedial
class to go to.

00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,208
I don't think there's
any possible way

00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,583
I could make it
there in time.

642
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,708
[KAMIJO] I can't
entrust Index with this.

643
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:19,000
That would only
make me worry more.

644
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,291
Is there anybody else?
A good friend, maybe?

645
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,000

go with you just this once?

[MIKOTO]
Hello! Sorry we're late!

648
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,708
[MIKOTO] Yeah? You mean Orbit
Portal is the same company

649
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:48,791
that was responsible for the
Orion incident three years ago?

650
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,875
[UIHARU] Yes. They staked
the fate of the company

651
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:52,708
on the space plane
project and would have

652
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,458
gone bankrupt after the crash.

653
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,666
But then they were bought out

654
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,000
and experienced a
miraculous recovery.

655
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,125
That's when work
on Endymion took off,

656
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,958

Oh, and you
know what else?

659
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,625
The president of the company
is actually a young girl!

660
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:10,625
She's only about ten years old
now, if I remember correctly.

661
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,125
Huh? You mean when
the buyout happened,

662
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,666
she was only
seven years old?

663
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,166
She is nothing more
than a figurehead

664
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,666
for the company,
though, isn't she?

665
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,208
I mean, a munchkin beauty
queen in charge of everything?

666
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,666
Who would take
her seriously?

667
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,333
I hear she's
pretty weird, too.

668
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,666
You think so, Shirai?
As weird as a beat-up,

674
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,916
So, I've got another
urban legend for you guys.

675
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,125
Supposedly, this child-president
of theirs is really just

676
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,541
a promotional hologram
or a robot or something.

677
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,875
Least, that's
the rumor, anyway.

678
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,541
Ha! Definitely
an urban legend.

679
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,291
C'mon, there could
be some truth to it.

680
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,708
You never know. I mean,
have you ever seen her?

681
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,666
[SATEN] She really looks like a
little porcelain doll sometimes.

682
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,125
Why did you stop? Is
there something the matter?

683
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,750
No, this doll just
looks so much like...

00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,291
I like your songs.
They're pretty.

00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,166
[LADYLEE] Which is surprising,
I can't think of a singer

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,208
I've liked since Jenny Lind.

00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,291
I wish you good luck.

00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,708
