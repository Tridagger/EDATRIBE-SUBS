1
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,375
Haruhi-chan.

2
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,666
Please come out and play.

3
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,833
Sorry, we have
the wrong apartment.

4
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,666
Hey. Hey, wait a second!

5
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,083
Don't act so traumatized
'cause you're seeing me

6
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,916
without my makeup on.
Even trannys get stubble--

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
--first thing in the
morning, which is more than

8
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,583
I can say for any of you.

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,666
You're so funny!

10
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,416
My dear Ranka,
I hope this day finds you

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,750
in excellent health.

12
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,916
Ranka, please.
That's my head.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, silly me!
I forgot my manners!

14
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,500
Please forgive my appearance.

15
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,458
It's so wonderful
to see all of you!

16
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,083
Is Haru-chan here?

17
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,708
I'm afraid not. She's out
with the girls today.

18
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,666
They picked her up this
morning, and you know women--

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,916
heaven only knows
when they'll be back.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So she's not home?

21
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,708
Well, I guess Haruhi
is entitled to spend time

22
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,666
with her old friends
from middle school

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,083
once in a while.

24
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,416
I can't believe
she has friends.

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,416
This is why I was
against a surprise visit.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,125
You know, come to think
of it I'm not sure that

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,208
I recognized any
of her new friends.

28
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,583
But, then again you
never can tell, can you?

29
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,416
Haruhi always
has made friends easily.

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,041
Just imagine it,
my little girl out and about

31
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,250
with students
from Lobelia Academy.

32
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,041
Did you say--?

33
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:02,666
Lo-

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,125
-Be-

35
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:03,750
-Li-Ah!

36
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,375
Ah!

37
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,500
Lobelia.

38
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,291
St. Lobelia Academy.

39
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,416
High school,
second year Benio Amakusa.

40
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,333
Lobelia.

41
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,041
Second year student
Chizuru Maihara.

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Lobelia.

43
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,250
And, first year
Hinako Tsuwabuki.

44
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,041
Lobelia.

45
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,291
Together, we are
St. Lobelia Academy's

46
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,750
illustrious White Lily
League, also know as--

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,333
The Zuka Club!

48
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,416
Oh Lady Benibara!
Good morning to you!

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,750
Why good morning, my dears.

50
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,416
You look ravishing.

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,666
I--

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,541
I took it upon myself
to prepare a lunch

53
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,375
for you today,
Lady Benibara.

54
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,958
It's your favorite,
little octopus-shaped

55
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,458
cocktail weenies!

56
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:09,375
Thank you. Oh the irony.

57
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,916
Why my dear, you're just
as red and adorable

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,583
as the octopus.
Could it be you wish for me

59
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,083
to feast on you?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,625
Lady Benibara,
I volunteer to be eaten!

61
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,125
Simmer down, people!

62
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,083
Keep your places in line!

63
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,833
Oh! Pick me! Pick me!

64
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,583
Hey, I said no passing
notes without permission!

65
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,875
Please remain calm, everyone!

66
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
Those in front, crouch down.

67
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,166
The rule is to allow--

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
Your fan-club executives
certainly run a tight ship.

69
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
They must be exhausted.

70
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,541
I don't envy them one bit.

71
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,875
Chizuru.

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,291
Where's our guest?

73
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,500
In the changing room, of course.

74
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,875
How's that size?

75
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,375
You're gorgeous, Maiden.

76
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,916
I mean, Haruhi.

77
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,666
"The Lobelia Girls'
Academy Strikes Back."

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,541
You look absolutely beautiful!

79
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,958
Seeing you in that dress,
I'm convinced your place

80
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,125
is here with us!

81
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,083
Oh my dear.

82
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,000
You and that uniform were
destined for each other.

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,125
It's most befitting an
innocent girl like you. Yes.

84
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,958
One still unfamiliar with young
love's first tender kiss.

85
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,250
Oh no!

86
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,458
What if the Zuka Club
entices Haruhi to do

87
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,708
something outrageously
scandalous?

88
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,125
Entices her?

89
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,458
Something scandalous?

90
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,208
Just suppose she's
forced to kiss somebody?

91
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
Kiss?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
As I recall--

93
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,583
--there was that
dance party where--

94
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
Ha! Aren't they a laugh!

95
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,250
What exactly goes on at that
Host Club of yours, Suou?

96
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,708
Why nothing that a loving
father wouldn't approve of!

97
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,458
We must rescue
Haruhi without delay!

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,791
Maiden--

99
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,791
Hey, would you wait a minute!

100
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,625
Stop it! Get off!
Now hold on, what is this?

101
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,666
Could someone explain it
to me? 'Cause one moment

102
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,833
I'm on my way to the
supermarket and the next

103
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,375
I'm brought here.

104
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,791
I'll be back in a bit.

105
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,791
Be careful.

106
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,250
Target--

107
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,166
--captured.

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,583
Wait! What the--?

109
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,791
Wow. Lobelia.

110
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,958
Good. Bring her in.

111
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,291
Roger.

112
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,875
Hold on, where are we going?

113
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,041
The three of you have
about as much subtlety

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,500
as the Host Club does.

115
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:08,750
How dare you, Maiden! We are
nothing like those idiots!

116
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,833
Oh, forgive my outburst.
It's only natural for you

117
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,458
to be upset. After all--

118
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
--in our haste, we whisked
you away this morning

119
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,208
in your nightshirt.

120
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,791
Those weren't pajamas,
you know. That happens to be

121
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,791
the way I usually dress.

122
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,625
Does rudeness just
come with the territory

123
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,291
when you're rich?

124
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,708
All theatrics aside, Maiden.
We have a small favor

125
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,916
to ask of you.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,958
As you may know,
one of our responsibilities

127
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,375
at the Zuka Club is to arrange
the regular performance

128
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,583
of musical numbers
and original plays.

129
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
Today is called Pink Carnation
Day, when we celebrate

130
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,416
the birth of the White
Lily League's founder

131
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,291
by putting on the most
glorious production

132
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,625
of the entire year.

133
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,291
We've been rehearsing
non-stop in preparation

134
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,041
for today's performance.

135
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,125
Tragically, the lead actress
in our play was in

136
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,875
a terrible accident and is
currently in the hospital.

137
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,166
But even so, without her,
you know what they say,

138
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,916
"the show must go on."
Which means.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,583
This is your big opportunity
to be a part of the theatre!

140
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
I can't.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,541
Not a chance.

142
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,791
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,125
You would only have to
memorize a handful of lines.

144
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,916
For most of the play
the character you'd be

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,250
portraying is silent.

146
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,916
The role is actually
more symbolic than anything.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,041
She just stands
there looking beautiful.

148
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,916
You can manage that,
now can't you? We promise

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,916
it'll be the
easiest thing ever.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,458
I'll let myself out.

151
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,416
Forgive me. I will forever
fall short of your legacy.

152
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,333
You must be
so ashamed! Oh Mother!

153
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,208
 Benio--

154
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,833
Don't talk like that!

155
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,958
So then your mother--?

156
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,458
Benio's late mother was
a distinguished graduate

157
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,791
of St. Lobelia
Academy, prominent in

158
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,375
the White Lily League.

159
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,958
To this day, it's said
no woman looks lovelier

160
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,666
in men's clothing.

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,416
That's right.
To honor her, we celebrate

162
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,083
Pink Carnation Day with the
same flair for pageantry

163
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,083
that made the woman's
name synonomous with

164
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,416
the Zuka Club.

165
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,208
Her whole life, Benio has
dreamed of nothing more

166
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,958
than to follow in
her mother's footsteps.

167
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,583
If today's performance
is cancelled, that dream

168
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,833
will be dashed against
the craggy shores of fate.

169
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,458
That sounds just awful.

170
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,583
If my daughter is held captive
in there, I'm not going to

171
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,333
sit back and do nothing.
But we have to play it cool.

172
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,916
The Zuka Club is ruthless.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,583
Once you've become tangled
in their web of lies,

174
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,166
you could go bankrupt trying
to get yourself out again.

175
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,333
How do you know so much, sir?

176
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,541
Haruhi doesn't really seem
like the type who that would

177
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,416
get involved with their kind.

178
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,291
You're right but neither
did Kotoko. She'd always

179
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,625
seemed like she was
such a strong woman.

180
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,125
Kotoko?

181
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,375
Haruhi's late mother- someone
she's always looked up to

182
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,208
very much and unconsciously
attempts to imitate.

183
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,166
There may be some
connection between her and

184
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,583
the infamous Zuka Club.

185
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:14,083
I was so blind then. We were
newlyweds and I was in love.

186
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,791
So what're we having for
dinner, my Reason For Living?

187
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,125
Miso soup with mezashi
and rice, sweetheart!

188
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,791
That's excellent! You both
need your calcium!

189
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,083
What's mezashi?

190
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,083
They're dried, salted sardines.

191
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,416
Don't interrupt my flashback!

192
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,875
One day, while cleaning,
I discovered my wife's

193
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,291
dirty little secret.

194
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,750
What?

195
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,250
Her collection
of Zuka Club memorabilia!

196
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,958
What are we going to do?

197
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,125
What if Haruhi wants to join
the Zuka Club so she can be

198
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,333
more like her mother?

199
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,791
Is Haru-chan really
going to go bankrupt?

200
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,291
She's practically broke already!

201
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,541
Oh, don't worry. Our girl's
worth a small fortune in cute.

202
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,416
I know I'm flat as a board.

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,916
But if you'll please
just take pity on me.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,583
That's even worse!

205
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,875
Kyoya, order us some
Lobelia uniforms right now!

206
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,166
We're going undercover!

207
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,333
Overruled!

208
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,541
Men who only dress in women's
clothing recreationally

209
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,750
are an insult
to us professionals.

210
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,541
You don't want to insult me,
do you? Do you?

211
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,958
Now listen up! To infiltrate
Lobelia, you'll have to do

212
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,125
exactly as I tell you.

213
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,708
Exactly.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,208
Um, can I get up now?

215
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,291
Oh Marianne, how many
lonely nights have I prayed

216
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,041
that we would
be together again?

217
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
And how many times,
have the powers that be

218
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,541
demanded that we remain apart?

219
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,791
That our love is forbidden?

220
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,625
Oh my Lord Frederick.

221
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,083
I'm slain by this fatal
gunshot wound. Alas,

222
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,666
I'm to draw breath no more.

223
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,333
My Lord Frederick.

224
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,625
Marianne. With your arms
holding me close,

225
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,083
all this pain becomes naught.

226
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,708
I am overwhelmed with peace.

227
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:29,208
Lovely angel. Your gaze is
my paradise and you are

228
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,583
the very image of
my beloved mother.

229
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,833
Dying will be--

230
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,000
This guy sure does talk
a lot for someone who's

231
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,458
supposed to be dying.
I wonder how long

232
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,833
he can hold out.
You'd think there'd be time

233
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,625
to get him to a doctor
or something.

234
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,083
My Lord Frederick.

235
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,083
Can you see her?
What's she doing?

236
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,916
It looks as though she's
playing the heroine of some

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,458
sentimental tragedy. But-- 

238
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,583
My Lord Frederick.

239
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,083
She sounds like a robot.

240
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,375
A boring daikon radish.

241
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,625
Even as her father,
I can't stand this!

242
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,541
Someone please make her stop.

243
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
My Lord Frederick.

244
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,666
How many times is she going
to repeat that line?

245
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,750
I think she's about
to start singing!

246
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,416
No! Her grades in music have
always been absolutely awful!

247
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,791
Here in this moment,

248
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,083
I am losing nothing,

249
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:31,000
Even if you leave me,
I won't be alone.

250
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,875
Because love has taught me,

251
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,250
That this life
is still worth living,

252
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,666
Empty skies
above can't stop me,

253
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:49,166
Oh I'm sorry, my foot
got tangled up in the cord.

254
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,875
Be careful.

255
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,791
Ah, she's lip-synching.

256
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,291
Lip-synching?

257
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,625
Hey newbies!

258
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,000
If you want to be part
of the Benibara Fan Club,

259
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,083
you have to follow the rules!
Now up on your feet!

260
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,750
To be a full-fledged member
your conduct must be

261
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,541
beyond reproach at all times.

262
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,041
Now, altogether.
With enthusiasm.

263
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,708
Let me her those
fan club mantras!

264
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,666
Lady Beneebara,
please hang in there for

265
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
your adoring fans today!

266
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,875
Lady Benibara,
you look magnificent!

267
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,166
Lady Benibara
please hang in there for

268
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,708
your adoring fans today!

269
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,458
Okay, now that we're in,
what's the rest of your plan?

270
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,666
Blend in. If you want to
get close to the Zuka Club,

271
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,000
you've got to prove
you're a diehard fan.

272
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,791
And watch yourself,
these girls get pretty

273
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,250
competitive. Even more
than you could imagine!

274
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,375
Lady Benibara please hang
in there for your adoring--

275
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,625
Right. Let's give it a rest.

276
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,666
Glad to have you, newbies!

277
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,291
What do you like most
about Lady Benibara?

278
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,416
Oh, only everything!
The way she walks and sings

279
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,375
and the way she
looks in coattails.

280
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,375
Why even the shape of her head!

281
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,916
 I think so, too!

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,666
He's a professional. He's got
blending in with the ladies

283
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,208
down to an art.

284
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,833
I'm just so excited to see
the play! It's supposed to be

285
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,166
a tragedy.

286
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,666
"It's called The Senorita's
Love" Lord Frederick

287
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,000
fakes his own suicide
as revenge against

288
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,250
his father for coming
between he and his lover,

289
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,291
Marianne. But the gun
he uses, supposedly filled

290
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,333
with blanks, is actually
filled with live rounds.

291
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,208
Oh, that's so terrible.

292
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,416
I have my suspicions about the
girl playing Marianne, though.

293
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,875
Whoever she is. If she
ruins Lady Benibara's play,

294
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,083
our very own Maiden Warriors
will be waiting

295
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,958
patiently in the wings to
"critique" her performance.

296
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,500
If Haruhi has to put on
a performance in front

297
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,708
of these psychos,
she'll be done for!

298
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,833
They'll beat the
daylights out of her!

299
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,375
Haruhi!

300
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,875
Don't you worry.

301
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,500
We're going to get her
out of that place.

302
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166
And yet-- 

303
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,500
--even as we speak--

304
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,166
--the curtain's rising
is nearly upon us.

305
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,750
So you've wormed
your way in after all.

306
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,666
You vulgar,
incompetant host club.

307
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,041
My dears, it's almost time.

308
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,000
Now I'm counting on you.
Remember I want us to think

309
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,958
of today as our audition
for "The Crimson Goddess".

310
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
Hold on. Where'd
Kyoya run off to?

311
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,791
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him in a while.

312
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,708
Hey look! He's up there!

313
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,833
It is such an honor
having one of the Otori boys

314
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,541
dropping by to
pay us a visit.

315
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,916
That jackass.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He moves quickly.

317
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,125
Very nice setup.

318
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,500
And that's the
orchestra pit, I take it?

319
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,375
That's right.
And just above that we have our

320
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,500
fully equipped
digital backdrop. Here,

321
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,958
let me show you.

322
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,083
We can project any
high-resolution image

323
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,416
and use it as part of the
scenery without unnecessary

324
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,916
set changes. Isn't
technology just amazing?

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,625
Yes.

326
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,625
At this point, we'll just have
to rescue Haruhi mid-show.

327
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,458
Here's her entrance.

328
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:51,291
I, I can see the sky,
The sun and mountains high,

329
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,125
Heavy!

330
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,708
Your makeup's too heavy, Haruhi!

331
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,500
I can't bear to
see her like this.

332
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,666
Enough! I'm getting
her out of here right--

333
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,416
Wait a minute.

334
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,458
Just look at her up there.

335
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,708
She's so much more radiant
than she was in rehearsal.

336
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,958
Well, her cheeks are rosier.

337
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,125
That'd be the makeup.

338
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,875
And her skin looks
like it's glowing!

339
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,125
That'd be the lights.

340
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,208
You're right. We can't
interfere in the middle

341
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,583
of her performance.
She's having the time

342
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,500
of her life.
Let her have her moment.

343
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,666
We can sneak her
out of here afterwards.

344
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,541
Oh my Lord Frederick!

345
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,416
I am slain by this
fatal gunshot wound. Alas,

346
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,166
I'm to draw breath no more.

347
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,833
My Lord Frederick!

348
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,083
Marianne. With your
arms holding me close,

349
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,083
all this pain becomes naught.

350
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,416
My soul is--

351
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,833
The kiss scene is coming up!

352
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,375
But the scene falls just short
of their embrace, right?

353
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,750
Of course. Lady Benibara
would never actually

354
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,458
kiss her.

355
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
Kiss scene?

356
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,166
In "The Senorita's Love"
Lord Frederick fakes suicide

357
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,791
to take revenge against
his father for coming

358
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,208
between he and
his lover, Marianne.

359
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,666
Kiss scene? Revenge?

360
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,708
Ah, and yet--

361
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,625
The love I bear for you, and
the desire I have for revenge--

362
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:36,833
-- are not things which can
so simply be forgotten.

363
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,958
Senpai? And Dad?

364
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,500
Right before his eyes,
I'll steal your first kiss.

365
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,958
All for the sake of revenge.

366
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,250
No Lady Benibara!

367
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,875
You can't really kiss her!

368
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,375
Never in a million years,
will Daddy allow his Haruhi,

369
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,958
to be used in such
a despicable way!

370
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,041
Banana?

371
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,291
Victory is mine.

372
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,500
You poor incompetent
buffoon. Now behold

373
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,000
while we embrace!

374
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,666
Haruhi!

375
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,000
My love.

376
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,541
You're crazy lady.

377
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,500
Yes. Please forward that
photo to me immediately.

378
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,750
Stop it! Get off me!

379
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,041
Oh no!

380
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,833
That picture is--

381
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,375
--from the dance party!

382
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,958
So, as you see--

383
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,916
--see Haruhi's already
had her first kiss.

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,208
Haruhi!

385
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,041
So is that what goes on in
that degenerate Host Club!

386
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,875
Hearing that from
her transvestite father--

387
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,416
--seems kind of ironic.

388
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,291
You're going to explain
this photograph to me

389
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,750
right this instant young lady!

390
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,916
Maiden. You mean to tell me!

391
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,458
Haruhi!

392
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,958
Jump down!

393
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,458
I'll catch you!

394
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,541
No!

395
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,958
Haruhi!

396
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,458
I'm sorry, Senpai.

397
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:41,041
Haruhi! How could you do this
to your adoring father?

398
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,875
Not so fast Marianne.

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,625
Must protect my Haruhi.

400
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,416
Don't let her go!
This is not over yet!

401
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,458
I don't care how
many kisses she's had!

402
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,583
The next one will be mine!

403
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,583
And all I wanted to do
today was go shopping.

404
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,041
So, why did Hikaru and
Kaoru joing the Host Club?

405
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,666
Because I, the Host Club
King, personally scouted

406
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,541
them out.

407
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,708
Don't get an ego or anything.

408
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,041
Next time, "The Door
the Twins Opened."

409
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,125
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you.

410
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,708
We'll see you then.
