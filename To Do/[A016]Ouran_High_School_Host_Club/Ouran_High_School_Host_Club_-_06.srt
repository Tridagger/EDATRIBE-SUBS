1
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,833
Oh, there you are Shiro. The
rest of the club is assembled

2
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,791
and ready to go. You should
get to the music room.

3
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry sir, but I'm quitting
the Classical Music Club.

4
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,291
Huh? What made you decide
to quit all of a sudden?

5
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,083
I think you have a natural
talent for the piano- it'd be

6
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,125
a shame to waste it. So forget
about quitting and come back

7
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,625
to the club.

8
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,083
If you play piano,
you're sure to be popular

9
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,750
with all the ladies.

10
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,041
But that's gonna take too long!

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,375
I don't have that much time!

12
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:14,333
The top floor
of the south building,

13
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,291
at the end
of the north hallway.

14
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,000
In a music room
that's never used.

15
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,916
This is it. This is the place.

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,166
Welcome to the Ouran Host Club.

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,333
Oh, it's just a kid.

18
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,625
Not only that, it's just a boy.

19
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,291
What's wrong, little boy?

20
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,541
Did you come to my palace
in search of something?

21
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,375
Um, are you the king
of this place?

22
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,625
Well, are you?

23
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,750
Come closer, lost one.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,500
What was it that you
just called me, little boy?

25
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,916
The "King"?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,166
The "King"! Yes, I'm the king
of the Ouran host club!

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,916
Long live the host king!

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,666
I'm an elementary
5th year, Shiro Takaoji!

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,958
I want the Host Club King to
take me on as an apprentice!

30
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,791
The Grade-School Host
is the Naughty Type!

31
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,958
Oh my, Tamaki,
you have an apprentice?

32
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,458
Yes. He's still
in elementary school,

33
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,541
but I like
the fire in his eyes.

34
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,541
But are you sure it's okay
for such a young boy

35
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,916
to become a host?

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,708
Why wouldn't it be? Love
has nothing to do with age.

37
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,458
Take us, For instance,
whenever I look at you,

38
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,583
my heart starts pounding.

39
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,125
Suddenly, I feel no different
than a lovesick little boy.

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,750
Oh, Tamaki.

41
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,166
Don't you think it's weird
that he's making the kid

42
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,000
observe him
up close like that?

43
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,541
There is a theory
that people are considered

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,291
more beautiful the closer they
are viewed. Tamaki seems to

45
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:18,125
live by that theory.
Well, let's leave them alone.

46
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,875
You naughty girl,
you've drawn me

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,125
to the forbidden fruit, dearest.
You're a mermaid who's

48
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,750
brought light into my lonely
sea. My mermaid princess.

49
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,833
I remind you of a mermaid?

50
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,250
You look more like the carp
that swim in my pond at home.

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,333
I'd never give false
compliments like that!

52
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,375
Carp?

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,166
Oh, don't listen to him.
He's just a kid-

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,791
you know how kids are-
they can't help but be honest.

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,916
Honest?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,458
But that's just his opinion!
I wouldn't say that

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,458
you look like a carp. And even
if you did look like a carp,

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,666
you'd be the most beautiful
carp of them all!

59
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,875
So I am a carp!

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,291
Uh, no, that's
not what I meant.

61
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,916
Tamaki, you're an idiot!

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,375
No wait! Mermaid Princess!

63
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,250
Man, what a crybaby.

64
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,333
So how's it going, boss?!

65
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,500
That's an adorable little
apprentice you've got there.

66
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,166
Hikaru, do you wish you had
a little brother like Shiro?

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,916
Don't be silly. I could search
the globe and I'd never find

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,166
a better brother
than you, Kaoru.

69
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,291
Hikaru.

70
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,166
Look! They're doing it!

71
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,416
It's forbidden brotherly love!

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,916
They're homos!
And they're brothers!

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,333
That makes this totally
"insectuous"!

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
I think what you meant to say
was incestuous.

75
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,125
Hey Shiro-chan!

76
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,750
You wanna have
a piece of cake with me?

77
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,291
We've got three kinds:
chocolate, strawberry and lime.

78
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,583
Hey, back off! What grade
are you in, anyway?!

79
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,416
Why are you wearing
a high school uniform?

80
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,250
Something wrong, Mitsukuni?

81
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,333
That's not fair! A little kid
like you isn't supposed

82
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,833
to have a cool,
older friend like him!

83
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,291
Are you alright?

84
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,125
I know. It's kinda hard
to get used to all

85
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,666
the weirdos around here. It took
me a while to get adjusted

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
to all the craziness,
so don't freak out.

87
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,458
I'm sure you'll get used to it.

88
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,041
This one kinda acts
like a girl.

89
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,750
Something wrong?

90
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,333
Are you a cross-dresser?

91
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,875
Oh, no.

92
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,458
Okay, that's enough.
I think Shiro should take care

93
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,750
of the tea for us,
don't you?

94
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,166
Wow, Haruhi, you're
looking extra manly today!

95
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,666
Now do what the boss says
and let Shiro take care

96
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,708
of that tea set,
it's part of his training.

97
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,875
You're too macho
for tea sets.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,375
This kid is smarter
than I thought.

99
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,791
He may be a kid
but he's got quite an eye.

100
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,833
Now be careful with it.
It's pretty heavy.

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,000
It's not my fault
I dropped it.

102
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,791
It's your fault 'cause
you're the one who made me

103
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,916
take it in the first place.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,166
Say what?

105
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,916
Haruhi, that's
another 100,000 yen.

106
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,166
Hey! You should
make the cross-dresser do

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,333
all your stupid chores!

108
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,958
I'm not here to carry
tea sets- I'm here to learn

109
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,666
how to make women happy!

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,166
You won't get anywhere
with that attitude.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,750
And I am not going to let you
disrespect Haruhi. So!

112
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,625
Put this brat in isolation!

113
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,875
You got it, boss!

114
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,583
What's going on here?!

115
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,041
Why'd you put me in
a cage all of a sudden?!

116
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,250
Yeah, where'd it come from?

117
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,833
This is supposed to be
a music room, right?

118
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,625
This is no way to treat
your loyal apprentice!

119
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,708
Now let me out of this cage!

120
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,375
Not until you've learned
your lesson. I made you

121
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,166
my apprentice because I thought
you were serious about

122
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,333
becoming a host but
I guess I was wrong.

123
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,250
I am serious.
Totally serious.

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,750
I want you to teach me
how to make a woman happy!

125
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm gonna run out of time.
Please, won't you teach me?

126
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,166
You're a host because
you like girls.

127
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,291
You like bringing a smile
to a girl's face- that's why

128
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
you do it, right?

129
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,666
Please, won't you teach me
how to be like you?

130
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,666
You're a genius at it!
You're the king!

131
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,208
Well, you may be a brat,
but I admire your desire

132
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,750
to become a host,
so I'll teach you.

133
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,875
You know, Shiro,
you and I are so much alike.

134
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,458
You poor kid.

135
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,416
Then you'll help me
become the kind of host

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,833
that can make any woman happy?!

137
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,541
Of course, making women
happy is the sole purpose

138
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:29,083
of being a host. If this is
what you really want Shiro,

139
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,416
then you have to figure out
how to use the material

140
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,541
you already have.

141
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,583
What does that mean?

142
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,375
You see, here at
the Ouran Host Club.

143
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,916
Our policy is to use our
individual personality traits

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,833
to meet the needs
of our guests. For example,

145
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,333
there's Tamaki, who is
the princely type.

146
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,625
There's the strong,
silent type.

147
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,833
The boy Lolita type.

148
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,416
The little devil type.

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,833
And the cool type.

150
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,666
It's all about variety.
And now our group is complete

151
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,166
with the addition
of Haruhi, the natural.

152
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,541
The natural?

153
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,875
It would seem that right now
we have a perfect blend

154
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,583
of characteristics,
so it's going to be

155
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,833
difficult to find
a new type for Shiro.

156
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,291
If you go by his age, he
should be the boy Lolita type.

157
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,083
But Honey-senpai's
already got that covered.

158
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,166
Is he gonna replace me?

159
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,958
Oh come on! Is that
all you've got?

160
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,416
What's up with this place? It's
supposed to be a music room.

161
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,083
Sorry to interrupt gentlemen,
but what's with the lackluster

162
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,291
character analysis? I must
say, I'm quite disappointed.

163
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,875
I thought I taught you better.

164
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,375
Alright then, Miss Manager.
How would you work Shiro

165
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,500
into our collection of
characters? He can't be

166
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,875
the boy Lolita because Honey's
already got that covered.

167
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,000
You just don't
get it, do you?

168
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,583
Now listen up! There are
plenty of girls out there

169
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,583
who have a thing for younger
boys or boys with baby faces.

170
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,875
These girls would be
considered shota fans.

171
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,000
Now, shota can be
a fairly broad category

172
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,875
so it's important to know
that the genre can be

173
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,875
broken down into many different
smaller sub-categories.

174
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,333
For example, shota fans with
an interest in Lolita boys

175
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,708
would favor a boy like
Haninozuka-senpai.

176
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,583
But this little boy is
different. If I had to pick

177
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,125
a character for him.

178
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,625
Yes! He'd be the naughty-boy
type, without a doubt!

179
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,250
The naughty type?

180
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,583
Now to play up
the naughty type,

181
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,375
you have to wear shorts, okay!

182
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,625
You've gotta have
bumps and bruises!

183
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,666
Give him a couple of scars!

184
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,208
Run like a spoiled child!
Make it reckless!

185
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,666
Now I want you to trip
and make it big!

186
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,541
"Are you okay, little boy?"

187
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,291
Now give them
your catch phrase!

188
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,583
No big deal,
it was nothin'.

189
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:58,541
That was perfect!
Absolutely perfect, Shiro!

190
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,083
That was outstanding.

191
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,500
I never knew you were such
a great coach, Renge.

192
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,333
They're idiots!
They're all a bunch of idiots!

193
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,833
I've had enough of you people!

194
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,166
This is so stupid- none
of this is ever gonna help me

195
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,833
make her happy!

196
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,750
Who's her?

197
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,041
Wait Shiro! We haven't
taught you how

198
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,208
to apply the techniques
you've learned yet!

199
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,375
I swear, younger boys
are good for nothing.

200
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,250
I went to all that trouble
to coach him, and he quits.

201
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,708
I can't believe
he ditched us because

202
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,333
he didn't like the lesson.
What a selfish little brat.

203
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,083
There aren't many people who'd
enjoy that kinda lesson.

204
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,875
But never mind that, were you
listening to what he said?

205
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,958
I'm gonna run out of time.
Please, won't you teach me?

206
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,125
He said he was "gonna run out
of time"- what do you think

207
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:48,583
that means? I think,
maybe, it's a girl.

208
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,416
How did we let them
talk us into this?

209
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,666
It'll be okay, Haru-chan.
It was so easy to sneak in

210
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,041
and wearing this uniform
I really look like

211
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm in elementary school.

212
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,750
Yeah, you do. I understand
why they wanted you

213
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,500
to wear an elementary
school uniform.

214
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,708
I mean, we are sneaking
into an elementary school

215
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,041
and you totally fit in,
senpai. What I don't understand

216
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,458
is why they made me dress up
in this middle school uniform.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,375
Alright men, it's time
to initiate our mission.

218
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,375
What do you mean?

219
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,750
What mission?

220
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,458
I've assessed the situation.
We'll infiltrate

221
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,791
the elementary school.
You two are going in!

222
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,250
But where are we going?

223
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,500
Why did we even bother
with disguises?

224
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,916
We stick out like a sore thumb!

225
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,666
Oh, there's a reason,
a damn good reason.

226
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,041
This way, Haru-chan!

227
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,041
Isn't she the cutest?

228
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:55,291
Look at her in that miniskirt.
Haruhi looks like a little doll.

229
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,750
So basically, you just wanted to
see her dressed up like that.

230
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,041
This is it.
Shiro-chan's classroom.

231
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,333
When I was in elementary school
this was my classroom, too!

232
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,583
There's nobody here.

233
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,791
So the kid's classroom
is empty, is it?

234
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,625
This sure takes me back.

235
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,291
I wonder if doodles
are still on my desk.

236
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,083
Doubtful, the school changes
out the desks every year.

237
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,958
Let's check out
the cafeteria after this.

238
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,583
I wanna see the old gym.

239
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
Good idea, Kaoru!

240
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,375
Hey! If you're gonna
barge in here like that

241
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,041
then why'd we have to sneak in
here in these stupid disguises?

242
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,041
Don't worry about it.

243
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,541
There's no one here
to catch us.

244
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,083
If the teacher finds us-

245
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,875
-we'll have a hard time
explaining why we snuck in.

246
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,208
Shut up you guys!

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,291
Keep your lips
zipped, got it?

248
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,458
Haruhi's the cutest
thing I've ever seen!

249
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,291
It's alright, he's gone.
But you guys, we came here

250
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,208
to get the scoop on Shiro,
so what do you think

251
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
we should do now?

252
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,833
Well, Here's
something interesting.

253
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,083
What'd you find?

254
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,625
Hey! That's Shiro!

255
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,416
So he's in the
Classical Music Club.

256
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,375
He looks like
he's enjoying himself.

257
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,041
It's nice to see him with
a smile on his face.

258
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,250
I had no idea he
could look so sweet.

259
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,958
Yeah.

260
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,250
There he is!
There's Shiro-chan!

261
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,958
Excuse me, Takaoji?

262
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,500
I'm sorry, but have you been
practicing the new piece

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,666
teacher gave us?

264
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,791
The new piece? Not really.

265
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,041
If you want I can show it
to you. Do you wanna

266
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,416
come play it with me?

267
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,750
No thanks, you go ahead.

268
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,666
After all, there's
only one grand piano.

269
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,541
You should use it, Kahmishiro.

270
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,541
Thank you! I will then!

271
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,250
And if you want to join me
just let me know.

272
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
Pardon me, mademoiselle.

273
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,791
I've never seen a rose more
lovely than you, my dear.

274
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
Here, this is for you.

275
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,708
I was wondering if you could
tell me anything about

276
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,416
that young lady playing
the piano. Do you know her?

277
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,541
That's Hina Kameeshido.

278
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,000
Her name is Hina?

279
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,833
That's right, But you better
not fall in love with her.

280
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,083
Why?

281
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,291
Didn't you know? Hina
has to move away soon.

282
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,291
Her dad just got a new job
in Germany, so they have to

283
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,291
move there at
the end of the week.

284
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,916
What do you
think you're doing?!

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,250
I want you idiots
to leave immediately!

286
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,166
Put me down!
What are you doing?!

287
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,666
Let me go! Just put me down!
Where do you think...

288
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,750
It's time to go, guys.
Quit thrashing around.

289
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,291
What is your problem,
you big idiot?!

290
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,666
I'm sorry but
you're the idiot.

291
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,416
You said that you wanted
me to teach you how

292
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,875
to make women happy.
But that's not it, is it?

293
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,416
You're not concerned with the
happinesss of just any woman.

294
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,875
You've got your sights set on
one woman in particular.

295
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,458
You only care about one,
and that's Hina Kamishiro.

296
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,791
But I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do

297
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,875
to help you with that, Shiro.

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,458
Listen, Shiro.
I know that I told you,

299
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,833
it's the job of a host
to make women happy.

300
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,750
But when you care
for someone, you must

301
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,541
find the courage to express
what is in your heart.

302
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,208
You have to tell her
how you feel about her.

303
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,708
You didn't come to me looking
to become a full-fledged host.

304
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,708
You want to be
a full-fledged man.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,625
It doesn't matter anymore.
I've run out of time.

306
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:27,333
I just I wanted to hear her
play before she left for good.

307
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,708
That's all.

308
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,916
That piece she played.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,541
It's Mozart's Sonata in D major
for 2 Pianos, isn't it?

310
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,375
Wait a minute, since when
is there a grand piano

311
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,458
in this room?

312
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,541
Well, this is a music
room, after all.

313
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,500
So why wouldn't it
have a grand piano?

314
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,458
It is a music room, after all.

315
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,875
It is a music room.

316
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,875
It's always been there.
We just had it covered up.

317
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,625
Awesome.

318
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,166
Hey Takaoji. I noticed
that you're always

319
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,166
listening to me when I'm
playing. Do you like the piano?

320
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,166
If so then why don't
we learn to play together?

321
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:52,333
She played beautifully, but it
wasn't the piano that I liked.

322
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,541
For the next week you
will spend your mornings,

323
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,833
lunches, recesses,
and free-time after school

324
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,041
in piano lessons with me.

325
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,500
But, why?

326
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,125
You wanted to be
my apprentice, right?

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,708
Besides, that young lady
looked like she wanted

328
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,125
nothing more than
to play piano with you.

329
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,708
Welcome, princess,
we've been waiting.

330
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:03,125
I present to you, Shiro
Takaoji's piano recital.

331
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,166
If you please, princess.

332
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,083
Let's play together, Hina.

333
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,833
Okay!

334
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,250
We did a good thing.

335
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,416
He loves with all his heart.
So I guess that's

336
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,833
one more way Shiro
takes after you, huh, senpai?

337
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,791
Why, yes, I'd say so.

338
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,666
So you've been exchanging
emails with Hina everyday

339
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,916
now that she's in Germany?

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,750
Yeah, more or less.

341
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
I like her but she can get
pretty jealous for

342
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,916
an elementary school girl.

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,416
She'd be upset if she knew
I was with you ladies,

344
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,166
so let's keep this
our little secret.

345
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,750
Oh! Isn't he the cutest?!

346
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,083
His little girlfriend
is so lucky!

347
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,625
I wish I had a little
brother just like him!

348
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,958
Naughty boys are the best!

349
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,458
I could kiss you.

350
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,875
You brat, what are you doing.
Those are my guests.

351
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,250
Well, it looks like they've
found someone they like better.

352
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,791
It was so easy
to steal your customers.

353
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,625
I think there's
a new host king in town.

354
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,166
I thought he'd make it through
without exploding this time.

355
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,041
We should've known he was
gonna blow up sooner or later.

356
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,166
Shiro really does have a lot
in common with Tamaki-senpai.

357
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,666
I get the feeling that senpai
was also a spoiled brat

358
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,833
when he was a kid.

359
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,250
I was not a spoiled brat!

360
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,083
I was nothing like him
when I was a kid!

361
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,541
I was a sweet, innocent,
precocious, adorable child!

362
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,416
You hear me?!

363
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,041
All right,
we're headed to the pool!

364
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,291
We'll finally get to see
Haruhi in a swimsuit!

365
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,416
Oh, no! Honey-senpai is being
pulled away by the current!

366
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,000
Next time,
"Jungle Pool SOS"

367
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,625
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

368
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,666
We'll see you then!
