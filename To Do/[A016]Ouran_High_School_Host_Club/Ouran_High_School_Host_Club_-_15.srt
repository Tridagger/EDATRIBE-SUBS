1
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:44,416
Hikaru. Your phone. Hikaru.

2
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,666
Answer it for me, will you?

3
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,375
No way. Don't you
recognize that ringtone?

4
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,750
You've got to be kidding
me. We're only three days

5
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,083
into summer vacation. Why
can't he let us sleep in?

6
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,083
He's probably been
up since dawn.

7
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,416
Yeah, what?

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,291
She's gone! My beloved
daughter has vanished off

9
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,583
the face of the earth! She
must have been kidnapped by

10
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,250
a band of gypsies, I just
know it! Contact the police!

11
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,625
We have to request an emergency
deployment of the SDF!

12
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,291
Wait, slow down. You're not
making any sense. Now what?

13
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,958
What do mean
Haruhi's gone?!

14
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,708
Huh? So Haru-chan is
really missing?

15
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:32,291
And her family
is bankrupt.

16
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,666
It's the only explanation! I've
been trying to get through

17
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,291
to her home phone and
her father's work for

18
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,916
the past several days and no
one will answer!

19
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,666
They've been evicted and forced
into indentured servitude!

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,708
We have to
rescue them!

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,958
Haru-chan!

22
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,208
Boss please, not so loud.
Have you tried calling

23
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,083
her cell phone yet?

24
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,291
Cell phone?

25
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,666
Why on earth would she have
a cell phone?!

26
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:04,083
Of course! She was issued one
by a secret underground network

27
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,791
of commoners known as
"The Plebeian Exchange."

28
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,958
Not to interrupt your
delusion, but Haruhi

29
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,875
is currently in Karuizawa.

30
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,458
Haruhi was turned out

31
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,291
of her home,
kidnapped by gypsies,

32
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,166
and forced into servitude
in Karuizawa?

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,583
Moron.

34
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,333
Thank you. Have a nice day!

35
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,166
Hi! Good morning!

36
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,750
Ah. Who would've thought
working at a bed-and-breakfast

37
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,458
could be the ideal way to
spend my summer?

38
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,583
The Refreshing Battle
in Karuizawa.

39
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,916
So she's gone off and left
us, huh?

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,750
Looks like it.

41
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,750
Good Morning, masters.

42
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,291
Good morning.

43
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,375
Breakfast is waiting for
you downstairs

44
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,708
Alright- we'll be down in
a minute

45
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,125
Very good, sirs.

46
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,041
It's just no fun without her.
What are we going to do now?

47
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,833
At first I was a little
apprehensive about

48
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,291
not telling the guys my
plans for the summer.

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,666
But it isn't like
they really have

50
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,875
the free time to keep tabs on
me anyway, right?

51
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:46,000
This is place is so tranquil.
Fresh air. Quaint setting.

52
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,000
The perfect highland getaway
for a girl to catch up

53
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,458
on her studies.

54
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,875
It's going to be great.

55
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,125
Haruhi!!!

56
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,791
Despair not! Daddy's come
to save you!

57
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,500
And by "great," evidently I
mean "a nightmare".

58
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,458
Oh my! What dashing young
men you are!

59
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,958
These hunks must belong
to Haruhi!

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,583
Another fluttering tranny?

61
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,125
Why don't you Call
me Misuzu-chi!

62
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,208
He's an old friend of Ranka's.
They used to work together

63
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,750
at the same shop
years ago.

64
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,750
Well, naturally you
would know.

65
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,958
Kill me.

66
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,583
I went into business for
myself two years ago

67
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,291
and believe you me running
this adorable little pension

68
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,416
is like living a fairytale!

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,708
So then, is Haru-chan like
your indentured servant?

70
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,875
She's more like an
unpaid employee.

71
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,083
This also happens to be

72
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,625
Ranka's preferred method
for keeping track of

73
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,541
his daughter while he's
busy working.

74
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,625
What the-? How do you know
all of this stuff?

75
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,916
Kill me.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,666
Take my little girl under
your wing, he says.

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,166
He practically begged me.

78
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,625
And since I still can't afford
the expense of hired help,

79
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,625
it works out for everyone.

80
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,708
She's a model employee, really.
It's such a shame I can't pay

81
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,958
her anything. Oh. Tell me
what you boys think of this

82
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,750
cute little apron she's
wearing. I made it myself!

83
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,166
You are quite an
exquisite seamstress!

84
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,333
A job, huh?

85
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,416
I don't get it. You turned
down our invitation

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
to Bali for this?

87
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,541
And we even asked
her to go with us

88
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,041
to Switzerland didn't we?

89
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,416
We did.

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,208
Yeah well, I still don't have
a passport remember?

91
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,333
Which is precisely why I
recommended one of our

92
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,291
domestic resorts. And at
a discount no less.

93
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,666
Traitors. Asking Haruhi to go
on summer vacation with you

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,458
behind my back. Have you
no feeling of loyalty?

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,083
Of any solidarity?

96
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,125
Togetherness is our guiding
principle. I work myself

97
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,583
to the bone upholding that,
and this is the thanks I get?

98
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,750
Why was your cell phone-

99
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,750
-turned off?

100
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,916
I just don't think about
it really.

101
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,916
Did you say you have a
cell phone?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,041
We convinced her she
should borrow one of ours

103
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,458
so we could keep
in touch.

104
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,583
It's part of a special
friends and family plan.

105
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,833
Yeah, we're in each other's
top five.

106
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,916
Top five?!

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,666
La-la-la.

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
Friends and family?

109
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,791
But I'm Haruhi's daddy
and buddy so I'm part

110
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,291
of the plan too, right?

111
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,291
Senpai, whatever planet
you're on, come home.

112
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,958
Speaking of which, why are
you even here? I'm gonna

113
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,250
have to see you guys everyday
when the new term starts.

114
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,458
Don't I have the right to
spend my summer vacation

115
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,750
the way I want to?

116
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,833
According to the handbook,
jobs are prohibited.

117
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,291
I, uh... had no idea.

118
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,541
Hey, Did you hear? Haruhi
went and got herself a job

119
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,250
without the school's
permission.

120
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,791
No way...! That's grounds
for expulsion.

121
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,833
I think Karuizawa is way better
than Switzerland anyway.

122
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,041
And overseas travel is
so exhausting.

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,416
Of course, you do have the
right to spend your vacation

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,875
as you please.

125
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,583
But then again. Like it or
not, so do we.

126
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,625
And you know, I for one
find Pension Misuzu to be

127
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,291
exceptionally charming.

128
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:06,708
Nooooooo!

129
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,750
Rise and shine, my
sleepy-headed Senpai.

130
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,125
Haruhi's made a special
breakfast just for you.

131
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:29,750
Oh. How lovely. Come sit
with me. Stay a while.

132
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,500
No. I can't. I'm an employee
here and you're one of

133
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,791
our honored guests.
It's not allowed.

134
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,791
But who's to find out, if
it's only the two of us?

135
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:46,291
Stay here with me and silly
rules will no longer matter.

136
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,125
Senpai.

137
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,583
Uh, Senpai? Hello?

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,916
I'm so sorry, boys. I'd love
to have all of you as guests,

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,916
but I'm afraid there's only
one vacant room left.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,333
Only one room, you say.
Well, that settles it.

141
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,583
I'll have to stay here
to represent the club

142
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,666
Hey! That isn't fair!

143
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,250
Have you no feeling of loyalty?
Of any solidarity, boss?

144
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,583
Togetherness is our
guiding principle.

145
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,291
My own words twisted and
thrown right back in my face.

146
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,375
Here's an idea. We bet
you'll like it.

147
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,166
Why not hold a
little competition?

148
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,458
Call it "the guest
relations odd-jobs contest

149
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,083
at Pension Misuzu."

150
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,583
It's very simple. We all
just lend a hand around

151
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,291
the place for the afternoon.

152
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,833
And whoever makes the best
impression on Misuzu-chi

153
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,166
g ets to sleep in the
vacant guest bedroom

154
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,041
That's Brilliant! I think it's
an absolutely delightful idea!

155
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes. The winner of the
contest will be determined

156
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,208
by how refreshing they are.
Remember: refreshing is

157
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,333
the name of the game
in guest-relations!

158
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,375
Refreshing! Refreshing! Yay!

159
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,541
Now. Don't think this is going
to be a walk in the park.

160
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,458
'Cause I'm planning on
working you boys to the bone!

161
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,208
Sounds like a blast.

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,875
You may not believe this,
but this is the first time

163
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,291
I've ever held a
hammer in my life.

164
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,958
Just watching you work makes
me feel tired!

165
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,875
You there! No complaining!
Three-point deduction!

166
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,750
Oh the pain. The pain.

167
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,500
And no whining either.
That'll be another three-

168
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,416
You think that's gonna
change our minds?

169
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,333
Welcome!

170
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:56,041
We- We have reservations made
for a second-floor bedroom.

171
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
Yes, of course. Right this
way, ladies.

172
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,958
We've been
expecting you.

173
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,416
Although, we weren't expecting
you to be so young and pretty.

174
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,833
Fine, fine. Not exactly subtle,
but they do get the job done.

175
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,000
So, Five refresher points
for them- Ah-ha, Mori.

176
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,833
The legs on this table
are wobbly.

177
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,416
Would you Be a dear and fix
it out back please?

178
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,750
Sure thing.

179
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,666
Nothing wasted in word or
deed! Five refresher points!

180
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,541
So what's a
refresher point?

181
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,125
Haruhi. What do you think
guests are after when

182
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,000
they come all the way out
to vacation in Karuizawa?

183
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,458
Let's see. The
nice weather?

184
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,791
Oh, it's much more
than that.

185
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,833
They come for what they
can't get in the city

186
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,583
-refreshing air,
refreshing scenery,

187
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,291
and refreshingly
gorgeous young men!

188
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,166
And now, thanks to your friends
and their little contest,

189
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,875
my Pension will earn a
reputation for being the

190
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,958
premiere hot spot for
vacationers in search of

191
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,458
the finest eye candy
Karuizawa can offer!

192
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,958
Okay. Sounds like
you have a plan.

193
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,000
And it's uncanny how
much you remind me

194
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,791
of someone else I know.

195
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,916
Why does it always end
up feeling like I bring

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,458
the Host Club with
me wherever I go?

197
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,125
Kyoya-senpai. You're keeping
your distance from all this.

198
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,958
Of course. Winning means I'd
end up staying here alone,

199
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,708
which frankly doesn't appeal
to me. I'll just sit back

200
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,333
and watch things unfold,
then head for the cottage.

201
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,458
The Cottage? You mean,
your family's?

202
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,583
That's right. We all have one
in the area.

203
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,333
Then why make such a fuss
about staying here?

204
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,041
So who's your favorite to
win? There must be someone

205
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,708
you have in mind. Do you Care
to bet?

206
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,666
No thanks. I don't
have clue.

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,750
Really? It's easy enough to
tell at a glance.

208
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,666
Honey-senpai's brand of cute
doesn't quite fit Misuzu's

209
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,416
notion of refreshing.
So I'm afraid he's out.

210
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,708
Tamaki comes a little closer to
the ideal, provided he keeps

211
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,666
his mouth shut. But we both
know the likelihood of that.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,458
Ordinarily you'd figure
Hikaru and Kaoru.

213
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,750
Then again, seems we have a
dark horse.

214
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,208
Oh my.

215
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,583
Gorgeous!

216
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,541
That's twenty more
refresher points to Mori!

217
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,541
So then you think he's
the one?

218
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,750
Except that if Honey-senpai
drops out, Mori-senpai is bound

219
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,750
to along with him. His
competing in the game at all

220
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,958
is more or less
conditional to that.

221
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,458
Which means.

222
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,125
Victory will be ours.

223
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,791
Well Maybe not. I couldn't
help but notice that

224
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,416
the only room still available
is a single bed,

225
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
so if you did win you
couldn't both stay.

226
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,375
No big deal. We can just
bring another bed over

227
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,625
from the cottage.

228
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,583
Yeah- Or we could even
squeeze into the single.

229
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,958
How sweet. I guess
you guys really are

230
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,916
always together, huh?

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,333
Always.

232
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,625
The two of us have been
together since we were born,

233
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,166
so we haven't ever
needed anybody else.

234
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,041
We never bothered making other
friends until a few years ago.

235
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,208
We thought the world
was made up of idiots.

236
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,416
Oh really?

237
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,291
But then.

238
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,333
Well, That was before we knew
you. We'd totally let you

239
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,958
sleep with us.

240
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,166
Thanks, I'll pass.

241
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,583
The contest isn't quite
decided yet.

242
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,208
There are still a
number of ways to make

243
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,375
this game more interesting.

244
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,666
This guy's always got
something up his sleeve.

245
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,458
Does that qualify
as "refreshing?"

246
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,416
Oh yeah? Thinking about
helping the boss, are you?

247
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,208
We're not going to lose.
It's no use.

248
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,333
There. All in a day's work.

249
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,208
Ugh! Your Repairs are
totally un-refreshing.

250
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,833
Three-point deduction.

251
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,750
He used up all of his energy
in trying to be refreshing

252
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,375
that his work suffered for it.
Is he alright in the head?

253
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,041
He's never had an actual
job before, you know.

254
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Hey, cut it out!
That's cold!

255
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,666
We have to chill
the watermelon.

256
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
That's how our guests
like it.

257
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,791
So refreshing!

258
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,833
I'll lose to those two idiots
if this keeps up.

259
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,916
Failure is not an option!
Haruhi's respect for me

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,166
is on the line!

261
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,541
She... She has to understand
that I'm worthy of

262
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,208
being considered part of her
Top Five!

263
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,958
Grandiose ambitions aside,
I think your approach

264
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,916
to winning is a bit skewed.

265
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,500
Kyoya. Can't you see that
her esteem for me as

266
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,875
a father-figure hangs in
the balance?

267
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,583
If I may offer
some advice.

268
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,750
There is something that only
you can pull off.

269
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,500
That is, if you choose the
right music.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,083
Oh, let's stop
in for some tea.

271
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,208
Alright.

272
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,583
So much for us.

273
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,625
Kaoru?

274
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,083
You're out here alone?
Where's Hikaru?

275
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,958
He went to get some trash
bags for us.

276
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,083
Oh.

277
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,666
Do you still think
you'll win?

278
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,958
I don't know.

279
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,500
Kyoya-senpai's
created a monster.

280
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,375
The boss didn't even know
this place had a piano

281
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,375
before he pointed
it out to him.

282
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,416
Look out!

283
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,708
I am so sorry! Are you
two alright?!

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,666
Don't worry,
we're okay.

285
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,625
Right?

286
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,916
Yeah. Thanks, I'm fine.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,916
Kaoru!

288
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,833
You're hurt!
Let me see!

289
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,458
I'm fine. It's only
a little cut.

290
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,041
Hikaru?

291
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,125
Don't scare me like that.

292
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,541
Hey, I'm sorry. Do
you forgive me?

293
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,125
Bravo! Bravo!

294
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,166
One-hundred points for
refreshing brotherly love!

295
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,750
A perfect score!

296
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,208
And the Victory goes to...
the Hitachiin Brothers!

297
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,208
So begins the long, dark
night of my soul.

298
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,166
Congrats, you guys.

299
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,416
Oh, it was
nothing really.

300
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,166
What the-? Hang on a second!

301
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,708
Was all of
that staged?

302
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,208
Well now, who
could say?

303
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
I'm okay. I promise.

304
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,583
You should be happy that we
won without having to

305
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,708
resort to the "quarreling
brothers" strategy. Right?

306
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:23,500
Come on, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do?

307
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,333
I didn't mean to kick you out
of bed. It was an accident!

308
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,416
Accident or not, my back
is killing me.

309
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,083
Get us some breakfast please.
I'll have two pieces of

310
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,041
baguette toast with
clarified butter

311
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,333
and garnet seal syrup.

312
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,208
I'll take poached
eggs with bacon,

313
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,416
and a bowl of
whole-grain cereal.

314
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,666
The kind with those little
pieces of dried fruit in it.

315
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,875
Hold on!

316
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,083
We don't even have that stuff
on the menu.

317
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,125
Behave!

318
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Just who in the world do
you think you are?

319
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,958
Acting like members of some
privileged aristocracy

320
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,458
on holiday.

321
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
We are aristocracy.

322
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,916
So are you, boss.

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,375
You are missing the whole
point of travel. When in Rome,

324
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,875
do as the Romans do that's
what I say. Just look at this!

325
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,208
Karuizawa cuisine
fit for a king!

326
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,041
Cold pasteurized Jersey steaks.

327
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,375
Fresh juice,
Highland vegetables.

328
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
Smoked salmon cooked over
cherry wood -

329
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,250
the local pride, I might
add. And last but not least,

330
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,583
freshly baked breads with
homemade jam. Bon appetit!

331
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,958
Since when have you-

332
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,666
-been such a
connoisseur?

333
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,041
Since he started
picking Misuzu's brain.

334
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,666
He's been in the kitchen
all morning long.

335
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,500
We arrange them like so.

336
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,666
Brilliant!

337
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,458
While you two were sleeping the
day away I decided to start

338
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,666
a "refreshing host" workshop.
I even wrote a manual.

339
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,333
You really need a life.

340
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,875
While you are acting as my
apprentice, you may not treat

341
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,083
me as your Senpai. That is the
first rule I have written.

342
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,583
Really?

343
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,250
Hey, wait. Have you got to
rule number five yet?

344
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,583
It says We have to be up by
6 a.m.!

345
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,000
Have Kyoya-senpai and
Honey-senpai read

346
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,416
through the manual yet?

347
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,125
Hey, look, we're sorry, boss.

348
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,208
We didn't mean to stir
up painful memories.

349
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,375
Good morning.
Arai Produce.

350
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,833
Good morning to you.
Working boy, eh?

351
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,708
A High Schooler?

352
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,375
Yes ma'am. I'm helping out at
my Uncle's shop for the summer.

353
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,166
How refreshing! Haruhi,
would you put these

354
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,000
in the refrigerator for me?

355
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,291
Okay.

356
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,375
Haruhi Fujioka?

357
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,041
Hey, Arai.

358
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,791
What do you mean you two
are going out on a date?!

359
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,750
Where would you like to
go first, Hikaru?

360
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,583
All kissing is forbidden! And
no sharing ice cream!

361
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,583
Next time, "Operation Haruhi
and Hikaru's First Date."

362
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,750
The Ouran Host club will
be waiting for you.

363
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,083
We'll see you then.
