1
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,375
The beach?

2
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,500
Of course! The beach!

3
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,166
But why?

4
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,875
Don't you remember
what you said?

5
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,083
You said you'd like
to go to a real beach.

6
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,333
Did I say that?

7
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,041
Yes, Haruhi.
Here's the fun part!

8
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,125
We've brought some swimsuits
for you to choose from.

9
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,875
Pretty cute,
don't you think?

10
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:52,416
Not that one! I think that
this swimsuit would look

11
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,083
much cuter on Haru-chan.

12
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,458
I don't think you get it.
Honey-senpai.

13
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,875
Just look, this uniform barely
hides the fact that Haruhi's

14
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,958
as flat as a cutting board.

15
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,875
A one-piece suit like that
one would only upset her

16
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,125
because it draws attention to
her lacking feminine physique.

17
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:14,166
That's why we carefully selected
this two piece suit, see?

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,333
The ruffles help hide the fact
that she's so flat-chested!

19
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,375
You punks had better
quit sexually harassing

20
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,916
my little girl!

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,208
I've had enough of you!

22
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,000
That mean we're
not going to the beach?

23
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,250
Who said that we're not going?

24
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,041
Really? So you wanna
go after all?

25
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,000
Can Usa-chan come, too?

26
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
I have no problem with that.

27
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,458
Huh? We're really gonna go?

28
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,666
Why not? Let's go to the beach!

29
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,583
The Sun, the Sea,
and the Host Club!

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,750
So, why'd we come to Okinawa?

31
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,291
Because Kyoya's family
has a private beach here.

32
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,500
It's beautiful, isn't it?

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,375
Yeah.

34
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,625
But why couldn't we have gone- 

35
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,166
-to the Caribbean?

36
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,041
Or even Fiji?

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,541
Do you think a commoner
like Haruhi has a passport?

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,041
Ah.

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,791
You do realize that I can hear
what you're saying, right?

40
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,083
It's so beautiful.

41
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,875
Tamaki, being alone here
with you and looking out

42
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,500
at the sea,
it's like a dream.

43
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:30,125
It's no dream, it's real,
but if I could have my way,

44
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,750
my princess.

45
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,416
I'd be in your dreams
every night.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,208
Oh, Tamaki.

47
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,875
Hey, take it easy, Hikaru!

48
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,708
I'm sorry! I'll get it!

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,458
Wait for me, Kaoru!

50
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,291
It's not my fault!
The ball is rolling away!

51
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,083
Why?

52
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,750
Her alone time with Tamaki is
up. Next lady, please proceed.

53
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,250
This sucks. I thought going
to the beach meant a day off.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,916
Um, Haruhi?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,125
Aren't you going to
go swimming with us?

56
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,458
No, uh, I like looking at
the sea from a safe distance.

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,125
Well, if you're not going
to swim would you mind

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,208
if we sat here
and talked with you?

59
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,000
But why?

60
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,208
You girls should go swim.

61
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,333
You've got cute swim suits on;
why not show them off?

62
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,416
I can't believe he fooled us.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,916
Who'd have thought he'd
bring the ladies with us?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,791
We certainly
didn't expect it.

65
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,458
You were invited on this
all-expenses-paid vacation

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,666
for a reason.

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,291
And that is to keep
our clients entertained.

68
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
We know, but with
the ladies here-

69
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,666
-Haruhi can't change
into her swimsuit.

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,625
Don't worry- I've got it
all under control.

71
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,541
My little angel shouldn't be
prancing around in a swimsuit,

72
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,625
at least not in front
of two perverts like you.

73
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:03,333
And then, once the sun has
begun to set. Haruhi and I

74
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,666
will take a romantic stroll
along the shore together.

75
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,041
Oh wow, what a pretty sunset.

76
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,541
Oh, senpai, I'd love to be
with you here forever!

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
It'll happen just like that!
The greatest day of my life!

78
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,625
I don't know if
I can handle it!

79
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,083
What's the matter with Tamaki-
is he having a seizure?

80
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,416
I wouldn't worry about it.

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,250
He gets like this occasionally.

82
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,541
Haru-chan!

83
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,041
Wanna go hellfish shunting?!

84
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,958
I think you're trying to say
"shellfish hunting".

85
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,041
But this doesn't seem to
be that kind of beach,

86
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:41,833
Honey-senpai. You're not going
to find many shellfish here.

87
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,541
What the hell?! No way!

88
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,666
One, two, one, two.

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,166
Mori-senpai.

90
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,083
My family's private
police force has stopped by.

91
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,541
They wanted to make it up to
Honey-senpai for attacking him

92
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,083
at the water park.

93
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,083
So they've brought shellfish.

94
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,791
Amazing! Look
how many we've got!

95
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,333
We're gonna have some
fancy side dishes tonight!

96
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,875
It's gonna be delicious!

97
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,250
My, my, certainly looks like
they're enjoying themselves,

98
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,208
all is right with the world.

99
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,166
Senpai!

100
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,750
Dinner is gonna be awesome!
It's a major haul!

101
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,875
Oh, I'm just so proud!
Look at my little girl!

102
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,333
It's a major haul!

103
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,541
It's a major haul!

104
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,916
Say what?

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,583
Dinner is gonna be awesome!
It'll be a real treat!

106
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,500
Tell me Haruhi? Don't you think
Isn't this crab-Crab-tivating?

107
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,041
Oh yeah!

108
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,541
You're so cute.

109
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,208
Cen.

110
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,375
Ti.

111
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,458
Pede!

112
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,708
Hey, Haruhi.

113
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,416
Now, I know most girls aren't
really the bug-loving type

114
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,958
and I certainly didn't
think you were but-

115
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,791
-don't you think you could've
been easier on that little guy?

116
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,875
Oh c'mon it's not dead.
It takes a lot more than that

117
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,333
to kill a bug.

118
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
Haruhi is so brave and manly.

119
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,000
But still so sweet.

120
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,333
He's the best!

121
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,250
Well, isn't that just great.

122
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,083
Haruhi's not normal. I thought
girls were afraid of bugs.

123
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,666
I'm sure she's
afraid of something.

124
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,250
Hey, Boss! Listen up!

125
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,958
We just thought up
a new game to play that

126
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,125
could be a lot of fun.
What do you say?

127
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,958
It's called the "Who can find
out Haruhi's weakness game"!

128
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,500
So, think you're up to it?

129
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,708
But that game sounds terrible.

130
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Besides, she'd only

131
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:52,458
share her weakness with
someone she was really close to.

132
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,500
What are the rules?!

133
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
Now that's more like it!

134
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
The deadline is
sunset tomorrow.

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,833
Whoever finds out
her weakness first, wins.

136
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,166
And I have the perfect prize
for the game's lucky winner.

137
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,791
We wanna play, too!

138
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,583
I guess that means
we're all competing.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,750
Where'd you get
those pictures of Haruhi?!

140
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,916
Hey, wait a minute.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,208
Where did you get
those pictures Kyo-chan?

142
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,833
I have my sources.

143
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,416
How about we just leave
it at that for the moment.

144
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,708
This is the place.

145
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,458
It's the most haunted
spot in all of Okinawa.

146
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,291
The locals don't even
come out here.

147
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,000
They say that the only time
you can even find this cave

148
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,541
is at low tide.

149
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Evidently, many people have
died down here from drowning.

150
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,375
And their souls still linger,
taking revenge on anyone

151
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,291
who happens to come inside.

152
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,500
Look!

153
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,125
What's going on? Are you
trying to freak me out?

154
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,875
What's wrong with you? I thought
everyone was afraid of ghosts.

155
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,750
But I've never seen
a real one.

156
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,250
Haru-chan! Would you
come over here?!

157
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,333
What the?

158
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,083
Are you sure it's okay to drive
a truck like this on the sand?

159
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,333
Well, we're ready whenever
you are, private police people,

160
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
please lower the door!

161
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,250
Yes Sir!

162
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,333
It's dark and scary in here!
I feel like I can't breathe!

163
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,208
What's wrong, Honey-senpai?

164
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,375
Mori, uh, you're my
senpai, not a sentai.

165
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,291
This game's harder
than I thought it'd be.

166
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,541
No joke. I'm totally
bored with it already.

167
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,166
What kind of heroine is she?

168
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,625
She's gotta be afraid
of something, right?

169
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,833
What's up, boss?

170
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,791
What are you doing?

171
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,083
I found some rat snakes!

172
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,875
Surely she'll freak out
when she sees these.

173
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,458
Anyone would think those
are creepy, so it isn't really

174
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,041
a weakness.

175
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,458
Hold on. I thought there weren't
any rat snakes in Okinawa.

176
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,541
Another side dish!

177
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,166
Look up here, Haruhi!

178
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,416
What's up?!

179
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
The breeze up here feels great!

180
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,666
It's dangerous be careful!

181
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,375
This feels so good.

182
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,583
Hey! There are
chicks up there, man!

183
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,708
Aren't we lucky!
You ladies wanna hang out

184
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,541
with a couple of locals?

185
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
No thanks. Please,
just leave us alone.

186
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,041
Aw c'mon. We just wanna
show you girls how to have

187
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,583
a good time.

188
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,208
This is a private beach. You
guys are not allowed to be here!

189
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,750
Private? Does that
mean we're alone?

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Why don't you stop
bothering them?

191
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,458
Weren't you jerks listening?

192
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,375
You better just leave 'em alone.

193
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,541
Oh, Haruhi!

194
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,041
Why You little runt.

195
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,208
Those aren't rat snakes! Those
are poisonous habu snakes!

196
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,125
What do I do with them?!
Come on guys, help me out!

197
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,166
Tamaki!

198
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,750
It's Haruhi!

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
What're you gonna do now, loser?

200
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,458
Don't hurt him!

201
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,125
Now don't you try and act
all tough, you little sissy boy!

202
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,625
I got an idea, kid.
How'd you like to take a dip?

203
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,166
Haruhi!

204
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,833
Hope you can swim!

205
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,291
Haru-chan!

206
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,583
Boss!

207
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,375
Where'd they go?

208
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,500
We took their ID cards and
respectfully asked them

209
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,083
to leave. The girls all went
back to the hotel and I've

210
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,250
called a doctor, he should be
arriving here any minute now.

211
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,458
Thank you.

212
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,625
I'm fine, you guys.
I don't need a doctor.

213
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,333
What were you thinking?
You know you're not like

214
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,708
Honey-senpai. You're not
a martial arts master.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,458
Why did you confront them?
What made you think

216
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,666
you would stand a chance?
You against two boys.

217
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,416
But it doesn't matter that
they're boys and I'm a girl.

218
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,458
I was there- I had
to do something.

219
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,958
I didn't have time to think-

220
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,166
That's no excuse, you idiot!
Don't forget you're a girl!

221
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,125
Look, I'm sorry you had
to come save me, senpai,

222
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,291
but I don't understand
why you're so mad at me

223
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,375
right now. I don't think
I did anything wrong!

224
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,750
You don't think so?
Fine. Whatever you say.

225
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,333
But I'm not speaking to
you until you can admit that

226
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,166
you were wrong!

227
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,791
Ta-da!

228
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,708
Here ya go!
Don't they look yummy?!

229
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,791
I apologize that there aren't
any maids around

230
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,625
to help you cook, senpai.

231
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,041
It's no big deal. We appreciate
you letting us stay here.

232
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,750
Hey,Takashi, will you
go get Haru-chan?

233
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,083
It's awfully gloomy
out there, huh?

234
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,583
It looks like it's gonna rain.

235
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,375
It's not just gloomy outside.

236
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,958
It's pretty gloomy right here
in the dining room as well-

237
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,708
just take a look at senpai.

238
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,750
Come on, quit moping, boss.

239
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
You shouldn't have
picked a fight with her

240
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,583
in the first place.

241
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,125
Haruhi, where'd you
get that dress?

242
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,583
From my dad, he must've
repacked my bags when I wasn't

243
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,416
looking. He's always
trying to get me to wear

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
this frilly stuff.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,333
That's awesome!
Way to go, Dad!

246
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,541
You look so cute, Haru-chan!

247
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,666
Well, this is uncomfortable.

248
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,375
Yeah, kind of awkward.

249
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,041
Let's dig in, Haru-chan!

250
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,666
These are the crabs we caught!
I bet they're delicious!

251
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,958
Wow, these crabs.

252
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,625
Taste in-crab-ible!

253
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,125
Get it?

254
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,625
Don't you think you've
had enough? Give it a rest.

255
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,291
Excuse me? I thought that
you weren't speaking to me.

256
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,375
You trying to be cute?

257
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,125
Okay fine, I get it.
It seems you refuse to admit

258
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,791
that you were wrong. See if I
care, then- I'm going to bed...

259
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,958
Kyoya, would you show me
to my room, please?

260
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,916
No problem. Well,
excuse me, everyone.

261
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,500
Maybe, he's right, maybe
I do need to learn a way

262
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,291
to protect myself.

263
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,750
Why did you confront them?
What made you think

264
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,958
you would stand a chance?
You against two boys.

265
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,458
So that's it;
he got to you, huh?

266
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,541
Well, it wouldn't hurt you to
learn martial arts or something.

267
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,250
But it's not like we're going
to force you to learn it.

268
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,625
Besides, that's not
the real issue here.

269
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,041
To be honest, we were
all a little worried about

270
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,125
how recklessly you acted.

271
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,791
What do you mean? I didn't
cause you guys any trouble

272
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,166
or anything.

273
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,333
That's not true, Haru-chan.

274
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,791
I think you should
apologize, okay?

275
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,208
You made us all worry.
Especially Tama-chan.

276
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,791
I think you need to
apologize to him the most.

277
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,333
So you, were worried
about me, but why?

278
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,666
You're hopeless.

279
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,291
You think?

280
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,541
Guys, I'm really sorry.

281
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,875
Aw, apology accepted
you little mutt!

282
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,333
You're so cute. We forgive you!

283
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,625
Is something wrong?

284
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,333
I'm not feeling so good.

285
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,958
You must've eaten too much crab.

286
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,541
Be strong, Haru-chan!

287
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,875
Let's get her to the
nearest restroom! Hurry!

288
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,166
Well, that was a waste
of a good meal.

289
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,000
I was in such a hurry,
I ran into the closest room

290
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,708
I could find. Where am I?

291
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,250
Are you okay?

292
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,166
I apologize, sir,
I didn't mean to intrude.

293
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,833
Don't be silly. It's just me.

294
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,666
Kyoya-senpai.

295
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,666
Senpai, I'm sorry. I really
didn't mean to make everybody

296
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,291
worry about me today.

297
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,791
Thanks, but I wasn't
especially worried.

298
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,208
Although, I did
have a hard time

299
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,458
separating Kaoru and Hikaru
from those two punks.

300
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,416
They almost beat them
half to death.

301
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,166
And because of you, I had to
send each of the girls a bouquet

302
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,125
of flowers to apologize.
They've been looking forward

303
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,500
to this trip and we don't
want to disappoint them.

304
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,333
I'll pay you back
for the flowers, senpai.

305
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,125
Each bouquet cost 50,000.

306
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,291
That's a grand total
of 600,000 yen, Haruhi.

307
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,791
Why did you turn the lights off?

308
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,500
If you want to, you could
pay me back with your body.

309
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,833
Surely, you aren't so naive
that you actually believe

310
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,125
a person's sex doesn't matter.

311
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,958
You've left yourself completely
defenseless against me.

312
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,375
So that's it.

313
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,541
You won't do it, Kyoya-senpai.

314
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,416
I know.

315
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,083
Because it wouldn't do you
any good. You wouldn't gain

316
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,791
anything from it.

317
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,416
You're right.

318
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,708
You're a fascinating
young woman, Haruhi.

319
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,125
But I've learned
something from this.

320
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:29,041
I guess I never realized,
what a nice guy you are, senpai.

321
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,208
I know what you're doing;
you're just trying to prove

322
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,166
what Tamaki said earlier.

323
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,416
Well think about it,
you idiot! You are a girl!

324
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,458
I know that you're
trying to prove his point.

325
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,875
You're just posing
as the bad guy.

326
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,041
Kyoya?

327
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,041
Do you have any lotion?
This sunburn is worse than I-

328
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,250
You bastard!

329
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,250
Here. Use as much
as you want, you big goof.

330
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,958
Nothing to be
gained from it, huh?

331
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,125
An interesting thought,
in its own way.

332
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,875
What were you doing
alone with him?

333
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,291
Nothing, really.

334
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,375
You expect me to believe
that nothing was going on?!

335
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,833
You were alone in his bedroom!
And why were the lights out?!

336
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,583
Don't you lie to me!

337
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,416
Never mind. You've
been through a lot today;

338
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,291
I'm sure you're tired.
You should get some sleep.

339
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,333
Senpai.

340
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,750
What's wrong, Haruhi?

341
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,333
It's nothing!

342
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,666
I just remembered there's some
business I have to take care of.

343
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
What business could you
have in a wardrobe?!

344
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,125
Haruhi, are you afraid
of thunder and lightning?

345
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,041
Why'd you lock
yourself in there?

346
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,750
It seems like it'd be
scarier locked up like that.

347
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,458
I'm all right. I'm used to
getting through stuff like this

348
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,583
by myself.

349
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,000
By yourself.

350
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:16,291
You're always by yourself,
all alone in your home.

351
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,083
You never call us for help
even though we're so close.

352
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,041
I get it.

353
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,000
I understand now, Haruhi.

354
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,458
I'm sorry I acted
the way I did.

355
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,541
You grew up without
relying on anyone else.

356
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,458
But not anymore.

357
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,625
You can come out now.

358
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,375
You don't have to be afraid.

359
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,041
I'll always be here
for you, Haruhi.

360
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,416
I promise that
you'll never be alone again.

361
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,958
Are you sure it's a good idea-

362
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,125
To leave the two of them alone?

363
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
She's with our Prince, Tamaki.

364
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,291
What could possibly go wrong?

365
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,541
Hey, Boss? We're coming in.

366
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,958
With the blindfold on you
can't see anything and then

367
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,041
the earplugs help
muffle any sound!

368
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,291
Wow, yeah, you're right!

369
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,500
You nasty pervert.

370
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,041
What kind of foreplay is that?!

371
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,958
It's not like that!
It's not what you think!

372
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,625
You'd better watch
your back, Haruhi.

373
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,416
I never would've pegged
the boss as an S&amp;M pervert.

374
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,791
I told you- it wasn't
like that at all!

375
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:48,625
I see. Well, now
I know what S&amp;M is.

376
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,208
I can't believe I almost
let you get away with it.

377
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,166
I wasn't doing anything freaky;
I was trying to help you!

378
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,458
Let's go.

379
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:03,291
Hey! Don't leave
without me! Wait you guys!

380
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,208
I never noticed! Haruhi is
perfectly suited to attend

381
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,041
an elite all-girls' school!
And that's exactly why

382
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,875
I can't let her transfer!

383
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,458
Next time, "A Challenge from
Lobelia Girl's Academy!"

384
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,791
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

385
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,083
We'll see you then!
