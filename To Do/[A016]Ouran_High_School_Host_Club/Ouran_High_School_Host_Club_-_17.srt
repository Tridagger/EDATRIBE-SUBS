1
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,166
Since adopting the zaibatsu
system as its corporate model

2
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,666
generations ago, the Otori
Group has advanced

3
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,500
the medical field to
unprecedented heights.

4
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,375
Today, we continue that
proud history of innovation

5
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,666
and leadership through
our cutting-edge approach

6
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,041
to hospital administration.

7
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,666
A prospective successor
to this legacy will do well

8
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,250
to remember that merely
standing in the shadow

9
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,625
of his brothers' achievements
will not suffice

10
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,666
to ensure his future.

11
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,166
Hey, Kyoya, I just had
the most brilliant idea!

12
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,666
How did I wind up here?

13
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,666
Mama, hurry up!
It's right over here!

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,166
Alright, alright.

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,000
I was sleeping comfortably
in my own bed just

16
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:23,083
a few minutes ago. No, wait.

17
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,458
Tamaki was carrying on
about some sort of exhibit.

18
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,625
He had his heart set on all
of us going, I think.

19
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,958
Doesn't this sound fascinating?

20
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,458
Commoners hold events
like these all the time.

21
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,166
They're called "expos,"-
That's commoner lingo

22
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,958
for "exposition."

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,333
Products from all over are
gathered under one roof

24
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,166
so that underprivileged
people can cope with

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,416
the emptiness of
not being able to travel.

26
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,416
That makes this the
perfect opportunity for us

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,375
to better understand Haruhi,
by allowing the Host Club

28
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,708
to study commoners in
their natural environment.

29
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,083
You guessed it, Kyoya. We're
going to go on a field trip!

30
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,625
Haruhi won't
be joining us today,

31
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,375
incidentally as her
presence might harm our

32
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,208
credibility as
impartial observers.

33
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,875
Oh, come on. You can't just
lie here in bed all morning!

34
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,000
Today's the last day
of summer vacation!

35
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,958
For your information I was
up until 5am, you morons.

36
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,708
Which if you hadn't
noticed makes me

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,541
a little less than happy
about being woken up.

38
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,041
Kyo-chan isn't much
a morning person, huh?

39
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,208
You have no room to talk.

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,500
Hey what does that mean?

41
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,958
Okay Enough with
the commoner shtick.

42
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,416
If you formulaic halfwits feel
like wasting all afternoon

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,208
on worn-out old clichés.

44
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,125
Go right ahead
and suit yourselves.

45
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,750
Well, if that's
what you really want.

46
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,708
You heard the man. Now let's
dress him to the nines

47
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,666
and head for the Expo!

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,916
Hey Everyone! Look at that!

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,583
Wow, all of those suits
look exactly the same!

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,875
Mass production!
Mass production!

51
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
They have something here called
a pet shop! That will be

52
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,208
our very first
destination, men!

53
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,541
They serve ice cream
on the roof-top!

54
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,583
They're holding some
super-special event

55
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,333
up there, too! Sweet!

56
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,333
What kind of event?

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,333
Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!

58
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,083
Oh right. That's how.

59
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,041
Looks like I'm at the Izumi
shopping center, which isn't

60
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,125
exactly within in walking
distance of home.

61
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,375
Guess I'll call
to have a car sent out.

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,916
Yay!

63
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,416
Oh, wow, sorry.

64
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,083
Mama!

65
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,208
Tamaki's a dead man
when I get my hands on him.

66
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,708
Kyoya-senpai?

67
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,791
I didn't expect
to see you here today.

68
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,333
How much money do you
have on you, Haruhi?

69
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,875
What?

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,041
Kyoya's Reluctant Day Out.

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,458
Kyoya-senpai. Are you sure
this is where you want to eat?

72
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,000
There are much
nicer restaurants

73
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,166
to choose from upstairs.

74
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,541
Well, you don't
have much on you,

75
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,541
so our choices are limited.

76
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,791
Just be sure to get a receipt.

77
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,583
Tamaki will
reimburse you tenfold.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,250
How did this happen? All
I wanted was a little peek

79
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,791
at the products expo.
Why did I have to run

80
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,750
into Kyoya-senpai?

81
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,166
And why did he have
to be in such a foul mood?

82
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,375
Haruhi, I think it's
our turn. How do I order?

83
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,125
Oh, uh here. Why don't
I order for both of us?

84
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,708
Do you know what you want?

85
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,250
You pick. Just get us
a lot of it.

86
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,916
Well, Okay. That and that one.
Both with fries too please.

87
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,708
He's so cute,
and just my type!

88
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,958
Okay Coming right up.
Would you be interested

89
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,291
in adding one of our
delicious dessert.

90
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,583
Thank you, no.
I don't care for sweets.

91
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,041
Gorgeous and cool,
I think I'm in love!

92
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,750
Before you decide, we have
a new shake that's absolutely-

93
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,375
I have given you my answer.

94
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,291
Please be sure
to include our receipt.

95
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,166
Kyoya-senpai.

96
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,291
Just because you're in a bad
mood today doesn't give you

97
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,541
the right to go around
talking to people that way.

98
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,041
The poor girl was
just doing her job.

99
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,875
Her job is to serve us food,
not irritate me with some

100
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,291
weak sales pitch.

101
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,000
Now what?

102
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,250
Nothing, I just don't think
I've ever actually seen you

103
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,541
eat before. Somehow I thought
the experience would be

104
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,833
more refined. I'm surprised
this food even appeals to you.

105
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,000
It doesn't appeal to me
in the slightest.

106
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,208
No doubt you'll say I'm
callous for admitting it,

107
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,000
since you bought this tripe.

108
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,500
Of course not.

109
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,541
I will think it, though.

110
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,583
There is an understanding
between makers of food like

111
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,458
this and those that eat it
- quality takes a backseat

112
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,666
to convenience.

113
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,500
Refinement isn't part
of the equation.

114
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,208
It's meant to be eaten quickly.
Besides, no one of consequence

115
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,041
is here to witness my
momentary lapse of manners.

116
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,375
He must be taking a break from
the whole "nice guy" act today.

117
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,375
I guess rich people have
to let their hair down every

118
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
once in a while.

119
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,958
Hey.

120
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,375
For the record I'm saying
that it benefits me nothing

121
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,250
to keep up appearances
in a place like this.

122
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,958
And that includes
any special treatment

123
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,750
I might give you here.

124
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,500
Really? Never would
have guessed that

125
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,083
in a million years.

126
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,250
Oh my gosh, girls!

127
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,500
That guy in the glasses
is a total hottie.

128
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,000
You're right. He's gorgeous!

129
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,791
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

130
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,875
I was wondering
if you're not using this chair

131
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,583
can my friends
and I borrow it?

132
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,708
Why not?

133
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,208
Thank you so much!
That's awesome!

134
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,333
You're quite welcome.

135
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,208
I've never seen
this side of Kyoya before.

136
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,875
Is he always this indifferent
when there's nothing

137
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,458
for him to gain?

138
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,333
Welcome. Won't you come in?

139
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
Tamaki couldn't be this
apathetic if his life

140
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,375
depended on it. How is it
that the two of them

141
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,916
compliment each other so well?

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
You're probably wondering
how Tamaki and I

143
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,166
compliment each other so well.

144
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,041
Oh great -now he's
inside my head!

145
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,791
What is he, psychic?!

146
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,625
The answer is simple.

147
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,708
I have something to gain.

148
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,916
There's no better motivator
than self-interest.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,791
I have to look out for
number one, you know.

150
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,625
Tamaki-senpai would be crushed
if he heard you say that.

151
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,041
On the contrary.

152
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,791
He's understood our arrangement
from the very beginning.

153
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,541
The same goes for all
of them: Hikaru, Kaoru,

154
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,625
Honey-senpai, Mori-senpai.

155
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,541
The glue that holds the
Host Club together is

156
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,500
our mutual egocentricity.
It's the principle that

157
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,000
drives the alliance between
our families and ensures

158
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,625
each of our futures. Though.

159
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,125
Well, let's just say
there's still quite a bit

160
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
you don't understand
about that.

161
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,375
Although Tamaki's a fool and
self-sacrifice does come

162
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,500
naturally to him.
So I guess the point of this

163
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,041
is we are very
different creatures.

164
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,833
Senpai, I thought you were
going to take a taxi home.

165
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,625
I am, but I might as well
have a look around first.

166
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,125
Black pearls from
Ishigaki Island.

167
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,375
Odd to find them here,
considering how much

168
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,875
they go for.

169
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,250
You're kidding. Really?
That's incredible.

170
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,291
How can you tell, senpai?

171
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,458
I am the product
of excellent breeding.

172
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,833
Breeding, huh?
Well, That would account

173
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,833
for the wall of ice
he's putting up between us.

174
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,833
So, Kyoya-senpai, why is it
that after all this time

175
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,708
I still know next to
nothing about your family?

176
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,791
Because there's really
nothing for you to know

177
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,833
about my family, at least
nothing that should

178
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,666
be of interest to you.

179
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,791
Well that seems a little bit
unfair, don't you think?

180
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,625
Just what do you mean "unfair?"

181
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,916
I mean that when it comes
to my personal life,

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,791
you even keep tabs
on who my father's friends

183
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,208
from work are while I barely
have a clue about yours-

184
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,916
So I call that unfair.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,833
That's a very intriguing
notion, in its own way.

186
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,375
You've got two older
brothers, right?

187
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,916
For starters, you could tell
me something about them.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,791
What kind of people are they?

189
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,291
Please allow me
to introduce my sons.

190
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,041
They are the Otori legacy.

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,125
Ah. What fine
young men they are.

192
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,333
Truly a credit to their line.

193
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,708
You must be very pleased.

194
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,166
They all appear to be
remarkably brilliant,

195
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,625
though of course only the
oldest will succeed his father.

196
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,500
Kyoya is the most
handsome of the three,

197
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,541
but you're right -
with two older brothers

198
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,166
ahead of him
he doesn't stand a chance

199
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,625
of becoming the
family's patriarch.

200
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,625
They're rather exceptional.

201
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,583
Enough so that my father
puts a lot of stock in them.

202
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,708
Though as the third son,
things work out

203
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,750
a little differently for me.

204
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,208
An irreproachable academic
record and social finesse

205
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,875
are accomplishments your
brothers laid claim

206
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,083
to long ago, so your own
achievements will have to

207
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,416
outshine these considerably in
order to impress me, Kyoya.

208
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,166
I didn't realize there
was so much pressure

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,541
on you to succeed.

210
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,291
Pressure?

211
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh no, Haruhi.

212
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,041
I can think of nothing
more fun than this.

213
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:56,250
Dear me, pieces from the
Komatsu Shoin collection.

214
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,083
I never thought that
I would find them here.

215
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,125
Why Madam, you have
an astonishing eye.

216
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
Um, Senpai?

217
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,541
Um, Senpai?

218
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,416
You know, they have such
exquisite color, don't they?

219
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,458
To tell you the truth,
I'm not really even

220
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,458
supposed to have
these out on display.

221
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,625
The bulk of the Komatsu
collection has been

222
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,500
privately held for ages.
Pieces rarely come up for sale.

223
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,166
With all due respect,
these are fake.

224
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,041
Hey, get out of here, kid.

225
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,791
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,916
The shade of blue
is strongly reminiscent

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,708
of Shoin's work,
but looking closely

228
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,791
around the base you'll
notice the color graduation

229
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,708
isn't quite dark
enough to be authentic -

230
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,500
that and the lacquer
is too clear.

231
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,041
That's enough out
of you, Mr. Expert!

232
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,416
I'll report you for
obstructing my business!

233
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,958
Just as I thought.

234
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,416
The brushstrokes on this seal
are uncharacteristically broad

235
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,791
as well.

236
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,125
For your sake I hope
you have a certificate.

237
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,500
That is if you
still insist it's real.

238
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,625
Of course it's real! I have
the certificate at home!

239
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,458
Ah, then surely
you won't mind if I call

240
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,416
the Komatsu family right now
to verify your claim.

241
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
My own family has
had dealings with them

242
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,750
for generations.

243
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,625
It would only be
a matter of minutes.

244
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,458
Young man,
I can't thank you enough.

245
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,791
After everything
you've told me, Senpai,

246
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,708
stepping in on
a complete stranger's behalf

247
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,875
seems a little out
of character for you.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, that? Well, now,
she's hardly a stranger.

249
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,500
You mean you don't know?

250
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,541
Her husband is the CEO of a
major electronics company.

251
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,791
Allow me to--

252
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,625
This is my first time
to meet her personally.

253
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,416
But the ring on her
left hand is unmistakable.

254
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,166
My family has dealings
with her husband's company.

255
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,291
Ah, one of the Ootori boys!

256
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,250
Imagine running
into you here incognito!

257
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,458
The next opportunity
I have, I'll be sure

258
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,250
to take advantage
of one of your family's

259
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,333
beautiful health resorts.

260
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,791
We'd be honored.

261
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:36,250
Big surprise. Kyoya-senapi
is Kyoya-senpai after all.

262
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,833
Now hang on a second-
That woman's ring.

263
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,833
There's no way
he could have.

264
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,916
Hey, Haruhi.
Did you know this?

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,916
Did I know what?

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,083
Is melon the preferred
flavor among snack makers?

267
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
It doesn't make sense.

268
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,875
If the primary ingredient
is corn, why go to the trouble

269
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,083
of artificially making
it taste like fruit?

270
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,583
Seems counter-intuitive.

271
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,833
That's an intriguing notion,
in its own way.

272
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,541
Oh, was I being funny?

273
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,833
Earlier you were
going on and on about how

274
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,208
you and Tamaki-senpai
are nothing alike,

275
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,375
but what you just
said about the candy?

276
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,958
It sounds exactly like him!

277
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,625
You think so?

278
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,541
This does seem like
something he and the twins

279
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,333
would fawn over.

280
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,583
Very well, I'll buy them.
Haruhi, your wallet.

281
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:39,875
Oh yeah, I forgot. Just be
sure to save me your receipt.

282
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,208
No, you're too heavy!
Oh! You're too heavy!

283
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,791
Hey Tama-chan,
the show's about to start!

284
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,333
Hey, kiddos,
I hope you're ready!

285
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,291
It's back to school time!
Have all of you

286
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,000
boys and girls
been keeping up with your

287
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
summer homework assignments?

288
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,416
What's that?

289
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,625
Ugh! You haven't!

290
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,166
What have you been
doing all this time?

291
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,208
Stop goofing around
and get a move on!

292
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,541
What is Renge doing up there?

293
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
It seems like recently-

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,125
-she's practically
been around every corner.

295
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,208
What do we have here?

296
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,625
A bunch of naughty
little children

297
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,333
who aren't ready for school?

298
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,416
It's too late now!

299
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,833
I, Doctor Namahage,
will never let you leave!

300
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:19,208
This is a job for
The Ouran Host Club Rangers!

301
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,750
Unhand her!

302
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,333
Oh no! It's my arch nemesis,

303
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,833
dreaded shadow leader
of the Host Rangers!

304
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,416
Host Black!

305
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,000
Um, what happened
to Kyo-chan??

306
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,500
Uh.

307
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,208
Hey, senpai?

308
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,708
Why do you think
Tamaki-senpai is always

309
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,208
so eager
to help people in need?

310
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,625
You mean when
there's nothing to be gained

311
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,583
from it? Who knows?

312
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,875
So then, when you help
someone, how exactly do you

313
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,666
benefit from it?

314
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,166
Money, or fame?
A specific material gain

315
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,250
of some sort?
Or is it more abstract?

316
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,083
Because as I see it,
Tamaki gets something out of

317
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,500
helping others that doesn't
necessarily involve

318
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,500
their paying him back.

319
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,208
So maybe when you get right
down to it -the two of you

320
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,041
aren't that all different.

321
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,750
Kyoya.

322
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,333
Would you find a map of all the
public schools in this area?

323
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,208
I'd like to help this man
find his daughter.

324
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,500
Besides, that young lady looked
like she wanted nothing more

325
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,791
than to play piano with you

326
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,166
It's an absolute tragedy
to see a brother and sister

327
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,000
at odds this way!
We have to do something

328
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,375
to help them!

329
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,750
If you really want to
surpass your brothers,

330
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,583
then you can do it,
but I think you're the one

331
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,708
who's lost hope
and given up.

332
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,625
Hey, Kyoya, I just had
the most brilliant idea!

333
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,583
We should start
a club together.

334
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,291
Attention shoppers. This is an
announcement for a lost child.

335
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:05,750
Attention shoppers. This is an
announcement for a lost child.

336
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,666
A little boy named Kyoya Otori
is lost inside the store.

337
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,583
Repeat: Kyoya Otori is lost.

338
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,666
His guardian Suou
is waiting for him at the

339
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,416
2nd floor information counter.

340
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,583
Kyoya is 5-feet, 11-inches
tall, with black hair

341
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,041
and wearing
prescription glasses.

342
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,041
Is that him?

343
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,666
Matches the description.

344
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,333
He's a little big to be lost,
don't you think?

345
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,708
Hey mister, is there
something wrong with you?

346
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,375
That damn idiot.
I'll kill him!

347
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,833
Oh Kyoya!
There you are!

348
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,500
We were so worried
-why is Haruhi with you?

349
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,833
Oh boy! Oh boy! Haru-chan
has come to play with us!

350
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,625
Hooray! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

351
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry, guys,
but I'm exhausted.

352
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,625
It has been
a very long day for me.

353
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,541
Hey, stop it! Quit licking me!
That tickles!

354
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,250
What's with the dog?

355
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,958
Isn't she beautiful?

356
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,208
I got her at this amazing
place they call a pet shop.

357
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey! Cut it out, Antoinette!

358
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,333
How exactly am I
like this moron?

359
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,291
I know you want me to
believe your only reasons

360
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,083
for helping that woman
earlier were selfish ones.

361
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,666
But that isn't
the truth, is it?

362
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,666
Because from where
we were standing.

363
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,041
There's no way you could
have seen her ring.

364
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,166
There was a flag
blocking our view.

365
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,166
It just doesn't make sense.

366
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,250
You go to all that trouble
acting like you're such

367
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,666
a big jerk when being a nice
guy comes so naturally to you-

368
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,708
-it seems counter-intuitive.

369
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,291
That's a very intriguing
notion, in its own way.

370
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,125
Hey, what's going on?!
Who is that kid?

371
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,583
Oh, this ought to be good!

372
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,666
You'll have to do better
than that, Chika-chan!

373
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,416
Next time, "Chika's 'Down
with Honey' Declaration."

374
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,625
The Ouran Host Club will
be waiting for you.

375
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,541
We'll see you then.
