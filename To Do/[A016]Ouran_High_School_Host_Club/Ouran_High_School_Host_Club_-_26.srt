1
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,208
Haruhi?

2
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,291
You sure you don't
want any breakfast?

3
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,125
No thanks.

4
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,500
Well, I'm off then.

5
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,666
Welcome, miss.

6
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,375
I know you.You're one of
the Ootori family's sons,

7
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,791
aren't you?

8
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,916
Unfortunately, you're the
third son so you can never

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,333
be the family's successor.

10
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,625
What can I do for you
today, madamoiselle?

11
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,583
You can tell me how much
Haruhi Fujioka is still

12
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,791
in debt with the Host Club.

13
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Haruhi?

14
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,375
Someone to see you.

15
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,458
How are you today?

16
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,625
I couldn't help but notice
that my Tamaki seemed

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,833
to have a soft spot for you.

18
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,083
Just what are you getting
at? Are you saying you're

19
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,375
jealous of me?

20
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,916
Oh listen to you!

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,541
Tamaki won't be coming today.

22
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,708
I warned him I would be
upset if he ever showed

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,875
his face at the Host Club again.

24
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,916
I wonder what
happened to Tama-chan?

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,333
I'm getting worried,
something's up with him

26
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,750
after what he said yesterday.

27
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,208
As of today, Lady Éclair
Tonnerre and I are officially

28
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,458
engaged. Furthermore,
the Host Club will be

29
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,583
permanently dissolved--
after the Ouran Fair.

30
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,000
Alright gentlemen,
no more idle chatter.

31
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,333
Our guests are waiting for us.

32
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,083
Senpai, it's like
you don't even care.

33
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,250
It's our job to take care
of our guests to the best

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,916
of our abilities. Remember,
They're looking to all of us

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,083
to entertain them.

36
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,083
Their happiness is
of utmost importance.

37
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,625
He's right, Kao-chan!

38
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,958
Honey-senpai,
What're you doing?!

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,083
C'mon, Hikaru.

40
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,125
Let go Mori-senpai!

41
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,500
Thank you for all
of your hard work, Haruhi.

42
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,791
After that request
from Lady Éclair.

43
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,875
Your debt has been paid.

44
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,125
Now you've finally repaid us
for that Renaissance vase

45
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,583
you broke.

46
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,791
So, You're free to quit
the Host Club, if you want.

47
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,833
This is Our Ouran Fair.

48
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,583
When they're young many
assume they have all

49
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,791
the time in the world but
really that is never the case.

50
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,500
Don't waste your time
with something that will

51
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,791
ultimately have no value.

52
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,625
You don't know anything
about the Host Club.

53
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,666
Kyoya-senpai works around
the clock to make sure

54
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,166
that everyone here is
enjoying themselves.

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,375
And did you ever stop to think
that entertaining others

56
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,833
might give each
of us fulfillment?

57
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,875
How can you possibly say
that what we do here

58
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,458
is just a waste of our time?

59
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,125
And I don't care what you say
I think Kyoya-senpai

60
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,916
is amazing.

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,958
I see so that must be
the honor student Kyoya

62
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
told me about.

63
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,666
I'm concerned about our
standing with Grand Tonnerre.

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
They've recently been buying
up Japanese companies

65
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,416
right and left.

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,958
Don't worry, everything will
be fine. Once we finally have

67
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,833
an heir, the Suou family
will prosper once again.

68
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,666
After all, its not like the
boy can turn against us.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,208
But, Tamaki has never been
interested in anything

70
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,333
involving the family. What have
you done to change his mind?

71
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:47,291
I told him that if he asked
Lady Éclair to marry him .

72
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,291
I would allow him
to see his mother.

73
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,583
But you can't be serious?

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,000
Your child is having to make
amends for the indiscretions

75
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,250
of your youth,
my dear son.

76
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,916
Tamaki won't be coming today.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,416
I warned him I would be upset
if he ever showed his face

78
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,625
at the Host Club again.

79
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,958
Tell me, are you
Tamaki's lover?

80
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,916
No miss, not at all.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,416
I see. That's good to hear.

82
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,416
Then I guess you must mean
nothing to him.

83
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,375
While I may not be his lover.

84
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,875
I know that I am
not nothing to him.

85
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,583
I think it's best you
not have any contact with

86
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,916
your friends for a while.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,375
It'll make it harder
for you to leave.

88
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,333
Come in.

89
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,791
There is a visitor here
to see you, ma'am.

90
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,500
Please have them come in.

91
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,750
Mr. Otari, why are you here?

92
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,166
I should be asking you
the same question.

93
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,750
Don't you worry about him.

94
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,541
Sir, It's a pleasure
to see you again.

95
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,500
It's my fault that Kyoya
joined the Host Club.

96
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,791
I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,041
But sir. I don't understand
what you're doing here.

98
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,208
We're terribly sorry
we had to ask you to come

99
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:06,083
all this way. I hope the
trip hasn't burdened you.

100
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,875
No, on the contrary,
I'm always quite happy

101
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,125
to avoid the press.

102
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,208
From what I understand,
my medical equipment company

103
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:19,375
is about to be bought out from
under me by Grand Tonnerre.

104
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,208
And you know, it probably
serves Kyoya right.

105
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
The company I was
considering handing over

106
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,833
to him will forever
be out of his hands now.

107
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,000
Excuse me sir but
there's one more thing.

108
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,291
I've a favor to ask you.

109
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,750
Kyoya-senpai,
what's with this outfit?

110
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,708
We told you, it's a costume
for the special parade.

111
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,875
You look so cute Haru-chan!

112
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,625
I don't understand why
am I the only person

113
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,958
dressed as a girl?

114
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,708
Aw c'mon it's cosplay
so its okay for you

115
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,041
to dress like a girl.

116
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,375
I am one, you know.

117
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,500
Well?

118
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,916
No luck. He's not there.

119
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,791
I can't believe
senpai didn't show.

120
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:19,125
I really thought he was gonna
make it despite what she said.

121
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,416
Hello, Shima? Been a while,
hasn't it? It's Kyoya.

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,666
This is about
Master Tamaki, isn't it?

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,708
I'm sorry Kyo-ya
but the Master will be

124
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,333
departing for France soon.

125
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,083
I tried to talk him out of it
but he said the Suou family

126
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,333
had forgiven his beloved mother
and that he was finally

127
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,916
going to get to see her again.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He also said that if he stayed
at Ouran any longer.

129
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,125
his capriciousness would only
continue to make trouble

130
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,666
for you and everyone
else in the club,

131
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,958
How could he be so stupid?

132
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,083
Evidently Tamaki is planning
to return to France.

133
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,791
Tama-chan is going
to leave us?!

134
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,291
You kidding me?! We just can't
let it end so suddenly!

135
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,416
Hikaru.

136
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,041
Excuse me, sir.

137
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,458
Yes?

138
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,666
I was just thinking.
If the Master's mother really

139
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,041
is as remarkable
a woman as he claims

140
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,791
she is then I can only imagine
that she would be upset

141
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,583
with the manner in which the
Master has chosen to leave

142
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,625
Ouran Academy.

143
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,833
Do you know when
he's leaving, Shima?

144
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,250
I'm afraid his flight
is this evening.

145
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,208
Why's he leaving so soon?

146
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,333
He would have left sooner
but he said he had to wait

147
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,750
until the Oran Fair was ending.

148
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,625
Tamaki!

149
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
Tama-chan!

150
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,958
No way!

151
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,041
The Ouran Fair
isn't even over yet!

152
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,708
My family's car should be
in the parking lot!

153
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,375
Haruhi, Let's go!

154
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,375
We're in a hurry can
you drive us?

155
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,208
I'm sorry sir, but.

156
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,708
What is it? What's wrong?

157
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,000
Well you see, the thing is.

158
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,500
You want to tell me
your orders? Let me guess,

159
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,500
you were hired
to protect Lady Éclair.

160
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,916
I'm truly sorry it has come
to this but as you know,

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,458
as members of the
Ootori private police

162
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,708
we answer to your father.

163
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,666
Damn it!

164
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm terribly sorry sir but
we've been ordered not

165
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,833
to allow any of you to
leave, even if we have

166
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,750
to stop you by force.

167
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,708
Hikaru, take the carriage.
If you use the back hills

168
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
bypass you can cut them off.

169
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,958
It's Haninozuka.

170
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,916
And Morinozuka!

171
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,583
C'mon!

172
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,416
Haruhi. Go get
that idiot. Hurry.

173
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,125
Now go! This is your chance!

174
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,333
Don't just stand there!
Stop that carriage!

175
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,625
Takashi. Don't go easy on 'em!

176
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,375
Don't worry, I won't.

177
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,750
I warned you guys! Picking on
my friends is a big no-no!

178
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,458
You should never underestimate
the Ouran Host Club.

179
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah.

180
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:22,250
Hikaru, Kaoru, Haruhi,
please bring him back.

181
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,500
Hikaru! Don't you think
we should slow down?

182
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,833
Somebody could get hurt!

183
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,166
We're not slowing down
'til we get the boss back!

184
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,708
But Hikaru.

185
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,708
If it wasn't for Tamaki
then the two of us

186
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,833
would still only be lost souls.

187
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,708
We were able to become
friends with Haruhi

188
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,250
and the others because the Host
Club brought us together.

189
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,458
To think that all of it could
end so suddenly like this--

190
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,125
--is something that
I can't tolerate!

191
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:08,708
No Hikaru! Hikaru! Hikaru!

192
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,833
Hikaru are you okay?
Is your arm hurting you?

193
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,000
This can't be the end, boss.

194
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,291
Its just not fair,
the Host Club's the only thing

195
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,291
that made us happy, damn it.

196
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,125
Hikaru.

197
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,041
Well, I'm off then.

198
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,291
What? You can't talk
to your dad about it?

199
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,291
What's the matter, Haruhi?

200
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,125
What do you mean?

201
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,541
I'm just not hungry
this morning, that's all.

202
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,666
You can't fool me,
kiddo. The last time

203
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,583
you skipped breakfast was
after your mom's funeral.

204
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,000
And it was a while before
you could eat again.

205
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:58,125
So, I won't get to see
mommy anymore?

206
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,375
There are many things
in this world that you

207
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,750
cannot ever change no matter
how desperately you try.

208
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,625
Just remember Haruhi
you have to stay brave,

209
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,875
even if it seems like
your world is crumbling

210
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,166
around you sometimes.

211
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,916
What's she doing?

212
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,833
What's the matter, Tamaki?
You haven't said

213
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,958
a word since we left.
You're a host, aren't you?

214
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,125
Come on, entertain me.

215
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,166
I have a question,
are you sure about this?

216
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,125
Will you even be happy married
to me or are you just,

217
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,083
following orders?

218
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,708
Haruhi?!

219
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,375
That's Haruhi Fujioka?

220
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,083
What are you doing,
Haruhi?! This is dangerous!

221
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,208
Stop that carriage now!

222
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,833
Senpai! Please come back
to Ouran!

223
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean it! Stop the carriage!

224
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,208
All of us would be completely
lost without you, Senpai!

225
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,708
But they, they all said they
were put out by the Host Club.

226
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:59,375
You really are an idiot!
What's wrong with you?!

227
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,750
After all this time we've been
together you still can't tell

228
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,916
when we're joking and
when we're serious?!

229
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,666
Everyone loves being
in the Host Club!

230
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,666
We really do!

231
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,083
Even me, Senpai. I love being
part of the Host Club too!

232
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,541
Haruhi!

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,041
Haruhi!

234
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,958
Senpai!

235
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,333
That was reckless, Haruhi.
You have to be more careful.

236
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,083
Look at you,
you're soaking wet.

237
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,583
A little water
never hurt anyone.

238
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,875
Besides, people are always
telling me that I'm dripping

239
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,458
with good looks.

240
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,708
Tama-chan! Haru-chan!

241
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Hey Boss!

242
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,416
Oh man he's such a moron.

243
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,333
Let's go ahead.

244
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,541
Miss Éclair, you heard
the stories that housekeeper

245
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,708
tells back home, haven't you?

246
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,500
The one who's always talking
abut her son who loved to play

247
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,541
the piano for her.

248
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,291
Is he really as sweet
as you say he is?

249
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,166
Thanks Eclair.

250
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,208
I was going to give him
the opportunity to see

251
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:26,958
his mother again.
He's such a fool.

252
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:34,375
But even so, even for someone
like me, he still smiled.

253
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,666
I'm sorry that we
caused you concern.

254
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,083
It looks as though Grand
Tonnerre will not be purchasing

255
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,666
my company after all.

256
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,791
An unexpected backer turned
up they bought the company

257
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,500
before Tonnerre had a
chance and the backer said

258
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,875
that he was turning all the
management rights over to me.

259
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:15,916
That was a bold move.
Which funds manager was it?

260
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,833
A student investor,
called "K.O.".

261
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,208
He cleverly left his name out
of the deal but it didn't

262
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,708
take me long to figure
out who it was.

263
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:29,750
"K.O." is Kyoya Ootori the new
backer was none other than

264
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,208
my own son.

265
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,041
At least we know we don't have
to worry about the future.

266
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,500
I thought I knew how brilliant
Kyoya was but it seems

267
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,458
he's even smarter
than I thought.

268
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:45,125
Maybe so but I think your son is
the one who's truly amazing.

269
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,666
I am responsible for the
entirety of Kyoya's education.

270
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,750
I always knew that he would
surpass his older brothers

271
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,041
someday.

272
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:58,458
However, I must say I'm shocked.
While I can imagine Kyoya

273
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,583
taking over a company, I never
dreamed he'd turn around

274
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,541
and give it right back
to its original owner.

275
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,958
As Kyoya grew up I
was constantly dangling

276
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,666
the Ootori family companies
in front of his face,

277
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,500
torturing him with something
he could never have.

278
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,666
Now not only has he taken it
out from under me by force

279
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,166
but he's basically told me he
doesn't want it and has thrown

280
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,958
it back in my face.

281
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,125
Do you understand
what that means?

282
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,333
It means he's
finally found it.

283
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,958
He's found something that has
an even greater value to him.

284
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,583
And that's probably
thanks to Tamaki.

285
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,291
Though our companies sometimes
cause us to compete.

286
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,208
I think we'll get along
just fine from now on.

287
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,291
Agreed, I think we can
get along famously .

288
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,125
Just like our two sons do.

289
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,458
I almost forgot,
there was one thing that

290
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,458
I wanted to run by you.

291
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,708
That honor student girl,
Haruhi Fujioka, was it?

292
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,458
I think that she would make a
wonderful bride for my Kyoya

293
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,208
in the future. I just wanted
you to know my intentions.

294
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,333
Well unfortunately it looks like
we're not going to get along

295
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,666
after all I'm sorry but that's
one thing I could never allow,

296
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,958
my friend.

297
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,416
Only those with excellent
social standing and those from

298
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,625
filthy rich families are lucky
enough to spend their time here

299
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,708
at the elite,
private school Ouran Academy.

300
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,500
The Ouran Host Club is where
the school's handsomest boys,

301
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,375
with too much time on their
hands, entertain young ladies

302
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,375
who also have too much
time on their hands.

303
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,250
Think of it as Ouran Academy's
elegant playground for

304
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,500
the super-rich and beautiful.

305
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,041
Remember, you're to come and
visit us in Music Room #3

306
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,875
whenever you'd like.

307
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,833
The Ouran Host Club will be
waiting for you.

308
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,958
And we wanna thank you from
the bottom of our hearts.

309
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,666
We'll see you then!
