1
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,708
I'm happy to say you're
daughter's future here

2
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,333
at Oran Academy is
assured. Her test scores

3
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,583
are nothing short of brilliant.

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,375
That's the trouble; she's
too smart for her own good.

5
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,833
She insisted on going through
the entire application process

6
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:16,500
without my help. After she'd
aced the entrance exams,

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,250
she even tried to persuade me
not to come with her today.

8
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,916
Can you imagine?

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is that right?

10
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,291
Miss Fujioka. Would you
mind if your father

11
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,375
and I spoke privately?

12
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,291
You're more than welcome
to explore the grounds,

13
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,458
if you like. Of course, most
of the students are gone

14
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,625
for Spring Break, but you might
make some new friends even so.

15
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,291
Go on, sweetheart. Let Daddy
and the nice Dean here

16
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,541
handle all the boring
paperwork for you, okay?

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,708
Alright, thanks, Dad.

18
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,708
She's quite an
independent spirit.

19
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,875
Children of her
intelligence often are.

20
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,958
It must be lonesome for you.

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,500
I wonder if she'll
enjoy herself here.

22
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,625
A rabbit? But it's stuffed.

23
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,166
Hey! Wait! Hold on a minute!

24
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,750
Haruhi in Wonderland.

25
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,416
I'm okay.

26
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,291
Ow-w-w-w.

27
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,875
Oh, come on.
That isn't fair.

28
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
Excuse me.

29
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,791
I got myself kinda
stuck in this thing.

30
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,958
If you wouldn't mind

31
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,791
giving me a hand,
I'd really appreciate-

32
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,500
Hey! Where are you going?

33
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,000
He disappeared!
Wait, please come back!

34
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,041
Where'd that thing come from?

35
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,000
There's got to be some other
way out of here, right?

36
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
Unless.

37
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,708
Female?

38
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,083
Banana?

39
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,541
Okay; so now I'm in a pool?

40
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,291
You've cried quite a bit, huh?

41
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,083
You must have, to fill a pool
this size. See, this water

42
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,583
is an accumulation of all the
tears you've shed in life.

43
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,666
It's rather
impressive, actually.

44
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,125
Looks as though you've
been through more

45
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,291
than your fair share
of hardships.

46
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,833
Speaking of which, I'd get
out of there if I were you.

47
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,250
It isn't safe.

48
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,500
What in the world?

49
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,333
What were those things?!

50
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,416
This place is way more
dangerous than I thought.

51
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,708
Hang on; am I back
to my original size?

52
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,500
Not yet. But we can take
care of that for you,

53
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,791
if you're interested.

54
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,916
What are you
talking about?

55
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,000
It won't be cheap, though.
Ah. We have guests.

56
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,708
Yes, hello. Might my
little sister and I have

57
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,250
a bit of mushroom?

58
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,208
Of course. We can settle your
tab at the end of the month.

59
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,375
You know, I think you're
the most shrewd caterpillar

60
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,291
I've ever met.

61
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,458
What kind of stuff are you
always writing down in

62
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,875
that book of yours, huh?

63
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:25,083
Oh Anything. And Everything.
That's odd. You said

64
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,416
"always" just now, and yet
you and I have never met.

65
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,041
"Always?" Did I?

66
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,291
That's weird, isn't it?

67
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,875
I'm getting smaller.

68
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,666
I'm getting bigger!

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry, That's not exactly
what I had in mind about

70
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
getting back to size.

71
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:09,208
Hey, look! That little baby's
crawling away all by himself!

72
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,250
It's not any of my business.

73
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,833
Nice going!

74
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,500
You may refer to me as Duchess.

75
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,750
The woman making banana
soup over there is my cook.

76
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,541
And this worthless
lay-about is my cat.

77
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,750
Pretty amazing cat. I've never
seen one smirk like that before

78
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:49,000
Why do I have to be
the stupid cook?!

79
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,750
It's not fair! I quit!
You're always having fun and

80
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,375
I always have to play
the villain!

81
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,750
Tamaki, you idiot!

82
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,666
So, does this mean
you're the baby's mother?

83
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,791
Are you concerned
for the child?

84
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,958
I'm just glad
he found his way home.

85
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,708
It's the best thing for him.

86
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,208
Being with your mother
is always the best thing.

87
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,666
Well, I'm afraid
I must be off now.

88
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,958
Would you look after him
while I'm gone?

89
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,375
For how long?

90
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,791
I couldn't say. I've been
summoned to appear in court.

91
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,833
Court?

92
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,250
You know she's just pulling
your leg. That doll

93
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,083
doesn't really even belong
to her in the first place.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,625
Hey, what happened to--?

95
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,625
Mr. Cat.

96
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,625
Wait!

97
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,291
Over here.

98
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,708
Pretty neat, huh?

99
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,208
Um, sure.

100
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,875
I can disappear.

101
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,541
And reappear. Anywhere.

102
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,833
That's great.

103
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,333
So, listen, I'm a little
turned around.

104
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,291
Do you mind telling me the
best way to get out of here?

105
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,416
That all depends-

106
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,583
On where it is
you're trying to go.

107
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,875
Home, of course.
Back to where I was before.

108
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,333
I'm afraid leaving here without
an audience with the Queen-

109
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,500
-Is strictly forbidden.

110
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,458
An audience with the Queen?

111
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,125
You might say-

112
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,291
-That the Queen-

113
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,541
-Keeps close tabs-

114
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,583
-On all her subjects.

115
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,625
This is ridiculous. If you
wanna talk, come out

116
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,125
and stand still,
both of you.

117
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,666
Both of us?

118
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,291
What do you mean?

119
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,750
Never mind.

120
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,416
I hope he comes back soon.

121
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,833
'Scuse me.

122
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,500
No room.

123
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,458
Yeah. No room
left, sorry.

124
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,333
There's no --

125
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,708
Room. I got it.

126
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey you! Don't just
brush us off like that!

127
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,875
We were only kidding! There's
plenty of room left! See?

128
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,833
Can I ask you guys a
question about this place?

129
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,583
Your hair's pretty
long, huh?

130
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,750
What?

131
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,041
That's actually a rather
good look for you.

132
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,291
Be that as it may, you'll
still have to wear it

133
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,291
much shorter in the
future you know.

134
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,708
And why exactly do you even
care about my hair?

135
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,375
So you're wearing a
skirt today?

136
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,333
Yeah, well, believe it or not,
I am a girl.

137
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,708
Not that matters
either way.

138
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,875
You know, if you keep scarfing
down junk food like that,

139
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,625
you're gonna
get cavities.

140
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,250
Be sure to Brush your teeth
when you're finished.

141
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,083
Okay.

142
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,666
So I guess nose bubbles
do pop.

143
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,375
A riddle!

144
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,833
A riddle?

145
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,875
In what way are lean and
fancy tuna alike?

146
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,458
Aren't they the
same thing?

147
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,666
Incorrect! They're not the same
thing at all! Even in dreams,

148
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,666
commoners are
still commoners.

149
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:27,708
Hey! Would you like a glass
of red wine?

150
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,916
Sorry. The consumption
of alcohol by minors

151
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,458
is against the law.

152
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,458
I guess getting her to play
Alice was a bit of a stretch.

153
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,916
She's just not feeling the
part. Still, though.

154
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,916
She's kinda cute.

155
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,541
Yes, she is.

156
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,208
It's always
Three O'clock here.

157
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,708
Which means it's always
snack time!

158
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,750
So, then.Where is this
place we're in anyway?

159
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,333
I mean, a little while ago
I was at Ouran Academy

160
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,666
filling out the enrollment
paperwork with my Dad.

161
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,083
Riddle me this. What do
your father and I share

162
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,500
in common now because
of you?

163
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,250
Because of me?

164
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,458
Wait, this is Ouran
Academy, isn't it?

165
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,375
What will you do once
you've enrolled?

166
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,958
After you've enrolled here,
what will you do?

167
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,416
What will I? Study
I suppose--

168
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,583
And What else?

169
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,500
What else?

170
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,958
Yes. Is that all?

171
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,166
Well yeah.

172
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,791
What for?

173
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,416
What?

174
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,666
What for?

175
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,541
See, there's something specific
I want to be when I grow up.

176
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,291
That's why I'm enrolling
here at Ouran;

177
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,500
to prepare myself for
a bright future.

178
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,541
That's really sweet.

179
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,750
So what do you want to be
when you grow up?

180
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,416
Well my dream is
to be--

181
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,750
What good are dreams if all
you do is work?

182
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,375
There's more to life
than hitting the books,

183
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,375
I hope you know.

184
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,500
But, I have
to study to do well.

185
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,166
That's all fine, but what
about having a good time.

186
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,583
Having a good time?

187
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,083
Having a good time.

188
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,375
Having a good time!

189
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,375
Having a good time.

190
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,416
Having a good time.

191
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,500
What was that for?

192
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,625
The Queen is now
holding court.

193
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,375
The Queen?

194
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,250
The Duchess is scheduled
to be executed.

195
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,375
That's an outrage!

196
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,666
One does not fight the
Queen's whim. Trust me.

197
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,041
Well, I can't sit here
and do nothing!

198
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,083
Even when she's dreaming,
Haru-chan is still Haru-chan.

199
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,583
Uh-huh.

200
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:18,458
Duchess. You stand before us
now, accused of coming to

201
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:24,000
the royal music festival
by invitation.

202
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,291
Do you confess to
your transgression?

203
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,041
What transgression?

204
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,333
Who disrupts this court?

205
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:44,833
I do! I'm here as legal
counsel for the accused!

206
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,458
With all due respect, your
Majesty, it is my duty

207
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,708
to attend the royal
music festival!

208
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,166
Even if it means leaving
your precious child alone?

209
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,125
Your crime is not a question
of attendance,

210
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,500
but of abandonment. This act
is unforgivable.

211
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,041
To cause such loneliness in
a child.

212
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,083
Your Majesty, the child
wasn't abandoned.

213
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,750
When a mother has to be away
providing for the family,

214
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,541
her children know that
she's doing it out of love.

215
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,625
Sure, they might get lonely
from time to time,

216
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,041
but they understand! Besides,
if you execute the Duchess,

217
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,625
how is her child any
better off?

218
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,000
Silence yourself, young
lady! There's no room

219
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,958
for your emotions
in this courtroom.

220
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,541
That's impossible!

221
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,541
Passing judgment
without emotion!

222
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,333
You might as well be left up
to a machine!

223
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,291
Astounding insolence. Tell me.

224
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,208
Precisely how long have you
been in the legal profession?

225
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,500
Are you even qualified to
practice law in this court?

226
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,375
Are you not in fact
guilty yourself?

227
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,958
Why don't we discuss
your crime?

228
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,541
What are you
talking about?

229
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:57,333
I submit one Renaissance
vase, destroyed by you.

230
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
That's the vase
from earlier.

231
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,000
But it was definitely in
one piece at the time.

232
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,291
I couldn't have been the one
who broke it.

233
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,708
A likely story, but if not
you, then who's the culprit?

234
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,958
I have no idea. But I'm
telling you it wasn't me!

235
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,541
What the?

236
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,375
Or was it?

237
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,375
Witnesses! Those party to the
crimes of this so-called lawyer

238
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,500
are commanded to come
forward and testify!

239
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,541
It would be my privilege,
Your Majesty.

240
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,250
What are you
doing here?

241
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,958
This girl has what might
be charitably called

242
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,000
a drab approach
to student life.

243
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,125
What?

244
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,500
School work, school work,
school work!

245
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,125
She won't let the slightest
bit of fun offset her routine.

246
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,875
Oh yeah? Well at least I have
a routine, Tamaki-sempai!

247
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,375
What's going on?

248
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,708
Now how is it
you know my name?

249
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,750
My name; how do you know it?

250
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes, how is it that you know his
name? However do you know it?

251
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,625
How do I know?

252
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah; and somehow
you knew we were twins.

253
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,958
And about my little black
book, lest we forget.

254
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,833
And about my cavity.

255
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,208
How is that?

256
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,041
How is that?

257
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,250
How is that?

258
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,500
How is that?

259
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,000
How is that?

260
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,333
How is that?

261
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,541
Well, I?

262
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,208
Hasn't it sunk in yet?

263
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:49,750
You've made a lot of wonderful
friends here, Haruhi.

264
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,416
Now haven't you?

265
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,958
Dad, you're the King?
Then does that mean?

266
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,250
Does that mean- It couldn't be.

267
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,291
You've gotten so big.
Where does the time go?

268
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:15,958
I'm sorry. I made it
so hard for you.

269
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,041
And so. Now is the time to
make up for that Haruhi-

270
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,916
don't be afraid to enjoy
yourself, alright?

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,333
Mom.

272
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,375
Haruhi?

273
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,708
Wow. I don't think I've ever
seen you doze off before.

274
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:56,125
Hurry up and get ready. We have
guests coming any minute now.

275
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,250
You guys have way too much
fun, you know that right?

276
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,875
I have to admit it,
though. Around here,

277
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,166
I can hardly even
tell when I'm awake!

278
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,916
Isn't this exciting, Haruhi?
The Host Club is about to bask

279
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,833
in the warm glow of
full-scale media coverage!

280
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,208
Media coverage? Don't you
just mean the school paper?

281
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,416
Next time: "Covering the
Famous Host Club."

282
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,666
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

283
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,958
We'll see you then!
