1
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,166
This place has
four library rooms.

2
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,375
You'd think one of them
would be quiet.

3
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,583
How're things
in Heaven, Mom?

4
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,166
I can't believe it's been
ten years already.

5
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm beginning to think that
rich kids only come to school

6
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,166
to have a good time.

7
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,125
An abandoned music room.

8
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,583
I guess this is the only
place I'll be able to study

9
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,250
in peace and quiet.

10
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,166
Welcome!

11
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:23,166
When I opened the door,
I found the Host Club.

12
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,833
"Starting Today,
You Are a Host!"

13
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,125
Only those with
excellent social standing

14
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,291
and those from filthy rich
families are lucky enough

15
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,708
to spend their time here
at the elite private school,

16
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,000
Ouran Academy.

17
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,875
The Ouran Host Club
is where the school's

18
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,208
handsomest boys, with too
much time on their hands,

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,125
entertain young ladies who
also have way too much time

20
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,000
on their hands.

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,416
Just think of it
as Ouran Academy's

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,375
elegant playground for the
super-rich and beautiful.

23
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,333
This is a Host Club?

24
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,875
Oh wow, it's a boy!

25
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,000
Hikaru, Kaoru, I believe
this young man is in

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,625
the same class
as you, isn't he?

27
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,208
Yeah, but he's shy.

28
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,083
He doesn't act very sociably so
we don't know much about him.

29
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,708
Well, that wasn't very polite.

30
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,750
Welcome to the Ouran Host
Club, Mr. Honor Student.

31
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,541
What? You must
be Haruhi Fujioka!

32
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,250
You're the exceptional honor
student we've heard about!

33
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,208
How did you know my name?

34
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,041
Why, you're infamous.
It's not everyday that

35
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
a commoner gains
entrance into our academy.

36
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,041
You must have
an audacious nerve

37
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,708
to work hard enough to
fight your way into this school

38
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,750
as an honor student,
Mr. Fujioka.

39
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,000
Well uh, thank you, I guess.

40
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,250
You're welcome!

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,791
You're a hero to other
poor people, Fujioka!

42
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,875
You've shown the world
that even a poor person

43
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,583
can excel at an elite
private academy.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,791
It must be hard for you to
constantly be looked down upon

45
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,166
by others.

46
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,708
I think you're taking this
"poor" thing too far.

47
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,375
Spurned! Neglected!
But that doesn't matter now!

48
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,708
Long live the poor!

49
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,916
We welcome you, poor man,
to our world of beauty!

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,916
I'm outta here.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,041
Hey! Come back here,
Haru-chan!

52
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,250
You must be like
a superhero or something!

53
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
That's so cool!

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,041
I'm not a hero.
I'm an honor student.

55
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,000
And who're you
calling "Haru-chan"?

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,125
I never would've imagined
the famous scholar

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,083
would be so openly gay.

58
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,083
Openly what?

59
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,958
So tell me what kind
of guys you're into?

60
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,291
Do you like the strong,
silent type?

61
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,458
The boy Lolita? How about
the mischievous type?

62
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,666
Or the cool type?

63
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,833
I, uh. It's not like that!

64
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,958
I was just looking for
a quiet place to study!

65
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,416
Or maybe.

66
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,208
You're into a guy like me?
What do you say?

67
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,000
We were going to feature
that Renaissance vase

68
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,250
in an upcoming
school auction!

69
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,833
Oh, now you've done it,
Commoner.

70
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,416
The bidding on that vase
was supposed to start

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,750
at 8 million yen!

72
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:12,541
What? 8 million yen? How
many thousand yen is that?

73
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,125
How many thousands
are in a million?

74
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,833
Uh, I'm gonna have
to pay you back.

75
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,000
With what money?

76
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,291
You can't even afford
a school uniform.

77
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,833
What's with that grubby
outfit you've got on, anyway?

78
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,791
Well, what do you think
we should do Tamaki?

79
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,125
There's a famous saying
you may have heard Fujioka.

80
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,875
"When in Rome, you should
do as the Romans do."

81
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,291
Since you have no money,
you can pay with your body.

82
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,500
That means starting today,
you're the Host Club's dog!

83
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,333
I don't know if
I can handle this, Mom.

84
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,833
I've been captured by
a bunch of boys that're

85
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,708
calling themselves a host club!

86
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,166
Poke, poke.

87
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,666
Um, Tamaki, what's
your favorite song?

88
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,875
What song? The one
that reminds me of you,

89
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,583
of course.

90
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,333
I baked you a cake today.
Would you like to taste it?

91
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,833
Only if you'll feed it
to me, darling.

92
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,958
Oh wow. You're so dreamy!

93
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,958
May I have a word
with you, Tamaki?

94
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,958
I've recently heard
the host club is keeping

95
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,208
a little kitten
without a pedigree.

96
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,583
I don't know
if I'd call him that.

97
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,125
Speak of the devil!

98
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,916
Thanks for doing the
shopping, little piglet.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,333
Did you get
everything on our list?

100
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
What? Piglet?

101
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,000
Hey, wait a minute,
what is this?

102
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,583
Just what it looks like.
It's coffee.

103
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,083
I've never seen this
brand before.

104
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
Is this the kind
that's already ground?

105
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,958
What do you mean?
It's instant coffee.

106
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
It's instant?

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,666
Whoa. I've heard of
this before.

108
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,791
It's commoner's coffee.
You just add hot water.

109
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,875
I didn't know
there was such a thing!

110
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,750
So it's true then.
Poor people don't even

111
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,625
have enough free time to
grind their own coffee beans.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,541
Commoners are pretty smart.

113
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,541
100 grams for 300 yen.

114
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,541
That's a lot less than
we normally pay.

115
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,958
I'll go back and
get something else.

116
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,041
Excuse me for not buying
you guys expensive coffee.

117
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,291
No, I'll keep it!

118
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,375
I'm going to give it a try.

119
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,000
I will drink this coffee!

120
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,166
Alright Haruhi!

121
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,791
Get over here and make some
of this commoner's coffee!

122
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,333
I hate all these
damn rich people.

123
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,833
Oh, Tamaki, now you're
taking the joke too far.

124
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,375
Your palate won't be able
to stomach that crap,

125
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,166
you don't have to drink it
just because he bought it.

126
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,208
I'm sorry. I was
talking to myself.

127
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,458
Haruhi!

128
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm comin'.

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,625
Here.

130
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,791
Let the tasting begin!

131
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,791
I'm a little scared
to drink this stuff.

132
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,958
I'm afraid if I drink this
my father will yell at me.

133
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,666
What if I let you drink it
from my mouth?

134
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,250
Well, then I would drink it.

135
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,583
This is
ridiculous.

136
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,166
So he had this nightmare
that made him bolt up right

137
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,375
out of bed.

138
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,833
Hikaru! Don't
tell them that story!

139
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,625
I asked you not
to tell anyone that.

140
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,333
Why are you so mean to me?

141
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,583
I'm sorry, Kaoru.

142
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,250
I didn't mean to upset you
but you were so adorable

143
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,500
when it happened I had
to tell them. I'm sorry.

144
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,750
I forgive you.

145
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,208
I've never seen brotherly
love quite like that!

146
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,041
What're they so excited about?
I just don't get it.

147
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,416
Sorry, we're running late.

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,833
Hello Honey! Hey Mori!

149
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,750
We've been waiting here
for you guys. Hi!

150
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,166
I'm sorry. I was
waiting for Takashi

151
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,125
to finish his kendo
meeting and I fell asleep.

152
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,708
And I'm still not
completely awake.

153
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,583
So cute!

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,791
Is that boy really
a 3rd year student?

155
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,750
Honey-senpai may seem
young and childish

156
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,791
but he's a prodigy.

157
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,125
And then Mori-senpai's allure

158
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,583
is his strong and
silent disposition.

159
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,541
Haru-chan!

160
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,791
Hey Haru-chan,
do you want to go have

161
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,458
some cake with me?

162
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,583
Thanks but I don't
really like cake.

163
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,583
Then how would you like to
hold my bunny Usa-chan?

164
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not into bunnies.

165
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,375
Are you saying
you don't like Usa-chan?

166
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,000
I guess he is
kinda cute, huh?

167
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,958
Take good care
of him, okay?

168
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,750
You'll notice that our
club utilizes each man's

169
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,916
unique characteristics
to cater to the desires

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,125
of our guests.

171
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,458
Just so you know,
Tamaki is number one

172
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,250
around here.
He's the king.

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,458
His request rate is 70%.

174
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,041
What's this world coming to?

175
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,000
And in order for you to pay
off your 8 million yen debt

176
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,958
with us, you will act as
the Ouran Host Club's dog

177
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:31,791
until you graduate. I'm sorry.
I meant our errand boy.

178
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,000
You can try to run away
if you want to, Haruhi,

179
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,750
but just so you know,
my family employs

180
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,750
a private police force
of 100 officers.

181
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,166
By the way, do you
have a passport?

182
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,625
You're going to have
to work hard to pay off

183
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,625
that debt, my little nerd.

184
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,000
Please, don't do that again.

185
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,125
You need a makeover
or no girl's going to look

186
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,583
twice at you.

187
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,333
Yeah, well, I'm not trying
to get girls to look at me.

188
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,250
Are you kidding me?

189
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,250
That's the most
important thing.

190
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,666
You have to learn
to be a gentleman

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,875
and please the ladies, like me.

192
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,083
I just don't think
it's all that important.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,416
Why should I care about
appearances and labels anyway?

194
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,375
I mean, all that really
matters is what's on

195
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,958
the inside, right?
I don't understand why

196
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,291
you even have
a host club like this.

197
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,291
It's a cruel reality,
isn't it?

198
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,250
It's not often that God creates
a perfect person like moi;

199
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,875
beautiful both
inside and out.

200
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,500
Say what?

201
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,916
I understand how
you feel since not everyone

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,875
is blessed as I am. But
you must console yourself.

203
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,000
Otherwise how would
you go on living?

204
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,333
And think about this Haruhi.

205
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,791
Why do you think they put
works of art in museums?

206
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,250
Because beauty should
be shared with the world!

207
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,875
And those born beautiful
should promote--

208
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,916
There's a word to
describe people like him.

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,375
--in the first place.
I did it for those who are

210
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,666
starved for beauty--

211
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,666
What is it?

212
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,791
--day and night
pursuing beauty.

213
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,000
And although--

214
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,083
Aw, man, I wish I could
remember that word.

215
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,166
--I have chosen to share
my expertise with you.

216
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,041
Here's a tip. When
setting down your glass,

217
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,250
extend your pinky finger
as a cushion.

218
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,750
And that way when
you set it down,

219
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,875
you won't be
making a lot of noise.

220
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,708
Gentlemen do not--

221
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,458
Maybe "A pain in the neck"?

222
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,875
No, there's something
that fits him perfectly.

223
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,250
But above all else Haruhi,
you must remember--

224
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,791
--how effective a glance
to the side can be.

225
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,291
I got it!

226
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:26,958
Oh, did I strike a chord?

227
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,666
"Obnoxious!"

228
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,083
Uh, I'm sorry,
Tamaki-senpai.

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,250
You're a hero, alright!

230
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,125
Uh-huh!

231
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,208
But he is a pain in the neck.

232
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,125
I'm sorry senpai but your
lesson did strike a small chord

233
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,375
with me.

234
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,083
Really? It did?

235
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,625
Let me teach you
more, my friend.

236
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, he got over
that with quick.

237
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:52,916
Boss?

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,333
Call me "King"!

239
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,916
You can teach him
all the basics of hosting--

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,833
But he's not going to get
very far with the ladies

241
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,833
if he doesn't look
the part, you know?

242
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,500
He's not exactly host club
material but maybe if

243
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,125
we took off his
glasses it'll help.

244
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,125
Hey! I need those!

245
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,666
I used to have contacts
but I lost them on

246
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,375
the first day of school.

247
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,291
Hikaru! Kaoru!

248
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,416
Got it!

249
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,916
Kyoya, my hairstylist!

250
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,250
Mori-senpai, go to the eye
doctor and get him some

251
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,583
contact lenses!

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,958
What about me Tama-chan?

253
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,000
Honey-senpai.

254
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,875
Yes sir?

255
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,750
You go have some cake.

256
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,291
It's just us Usa-chan.

257
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,125
Everyone else
said they were too busy.

258
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,416
Here! Change
into this uniform!

259
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,750
What? But why?

260
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,625
Don't ask questions!

261
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,875
No way! Okay,
fine! I'll change!

262
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,000
But you two
have to get out!

263
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,333
Um, Senpai?

264
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,041
Aren't you done changing yet?

265
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,416
You sure it's really okay for
me to keep this uniform?

266
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,041
Cute! You're as pretty
as a girl! Adorable!

267
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,000
Haru-chan,
you look so cute!

268
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,000
If we had known that's
how you really look--

269
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,708
--we would've helped
you out sooner.

270
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,083
Who knows? Maybe he'll
draw in some customers.

271
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,291
You know, that's just what
I was thinking!

272
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,666
Our errand boy is
moving up the ranks!

273
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,208
Starting today,
you are an official member

274
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,083
of the Host Club.

275
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,375
I will personally train
you to be a first-rate host.

276
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,875
If you can get 100 customers
to request your service

277
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,000
we will completely forget
about your 8 million yen debt.

278
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,250
A host?

279
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,791
So tell me Haruhi.
Do you have any hobbies?

280
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,958
What do you like to do?

281
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,208
I'm curious,

282
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,208
what kind of products
do you use on your skin?

283
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,958
Yes, it's so pretty.

284
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,708
I can't do this anymore.

285
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,333
I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do!

286
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,666
So why did you join
the host club Haruhi?

287
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,916
All I have to do is get 100
customers to request me

288
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and they'll forget about
my 8 million yen debt.

289
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,000
I know just the story.

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,375
I see, your mother was sick
and passed away 10 years ago?

291
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,625
Who does the chores
around the house?

292
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
Oh, I do them myself.

293
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,291
My mother taught me.
She was an amazing cook.

294
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,083
And when she went to the
hospital she left me

295
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,416
all kinds of great recipes. It
was fun to create each dish,

296
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,250
especially when they
turned out well.

297
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,708
And it made me happy
to see my dad enjoy it.

298
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,833
I've had a hard childhood
but Dad and I have

299
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,208
managed to make it
through okay.

300
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,291
So uh--

301
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,833
Is it okay if tomorrow--

302
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
--we request to sit
with you again?

303
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,958
Yeah, I'd really
appreciate that, ladies!

304
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,541
Why's he so popular?

305
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,583
He's a natural.

306
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,041
No training needed.

307
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,625
Have you forgotten about me?

308
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,250
Oh no! Sorry Princess.

309
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,375
I'm just a little bit concerned
about our newest host.

310
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,958
Well, that's obvious, Tamaki.

311
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,958
You sure have been
keeping an eye on him.

312
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,125
Of course. I have to.

313
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,458
I'm training him
to be a gentleman like me.

314
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,291
Haruhi! Come here
for a minute.

315
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,291
What's up?

316
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,583
I'd like you
to meet someone.

317
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,000
This is my regular guest,
Princess Ayanokoji.

318
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,333
It's that girl
from earlier.

319
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,500
Miss, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

320
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,375
That was so cute!

321
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,291
That air of bashfulness
was very good!

322
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,000
Super good!
Amazingly good!

323
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,208
Um, Tamaki?

324
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,916
You're so cute!
I'm never gonna let you go!

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,458
Mori-senpai! Help me!

326
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,916
Mori-senpai, you really
didn't have to go that far.

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Come on little one,
let Daddy give you a big hug!

328
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,500
I've already got a dad.
I don't need another one!

329
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:17,833
Hey, what happened to my bag?
Are you kidding me?

330
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,416
But how did that happen?

331
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,291
I didn't think there were
bullies at this school.

332
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,875
Guess they're everywhere.

333
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,500
Oh, it's you again.

334
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,583
I bet you love having
Tamaki making you over

335
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,458
and fawning over you.
It's useless though,

336
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,208
you're always going to be
a second class citizen.

337
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,208
I have a feeling that girl's
the one who threw my bag

338
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,666
in the pond.
I can't be bothered with her

339
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,750
right now though. I've
gotta find my wallet

340
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,500
or I won't have any money
for food this week.

341
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,666
Hey, commoner!
You've got some nerve

342
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,625
skipping out on
the club like that!

343
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,625
Why is your bag all wet?

344
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,458
It's no big deal. I got it.

345
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,833
I just can't find
my food money.

346
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,166
Hey, you don't have to do
that, you'll get wet!

347
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,166
A little water
never hurt anyone.

348
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,250
Besides, people are always
telling me that I'm dripping

349
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,166
with good looks.

350
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,166
Oh! Hang on a second!
This what you're looking for?

351
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,958
What's the matter? You're
staring off into space.

352
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,541
You're not falling
for me, are you?

353
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,708
No way!

354
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,041
How did your bag end up
in the pond anyway?

355
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,583
Well, uh, I guess
I accidentally dropped it out

356
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,833
the window at some point.

357
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,625
Oh really?
That must've been terrible!

358
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,875
I can't imagine what I'd do
if my bag fell into the pond.

359
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,291
Why did she request me when it's
obvious she doesn't like me.

360
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,250
And you actually made
Tamaki search that dirty,

361
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,833
old pond with you?
How astonishing!

362
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,291
You do realize he's a blueblood
and not a commoner, right?

363
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,750
The only reason he's
paying attention to you

364
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,625
is because he's trying to
turn you into a gentlemen.

365
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,833
Don't start thinking he
cares about you just because

366
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,583
he's doting on you.

367
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,666
Now I understand.
You're jealous of me.

368
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,916
No Haruhi! Leave me alone!
Somebody help.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,375
He just attacked me!

370
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Someone do something!
Teach this commoner a lesson!

371
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
Why did you do that?

372
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,625
Do something Tamaki!
Haruhi just assaulted me!

373
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,791
I'm disappointed in you.

374
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,166
You threw his bag
into the pond, didn't you?

375
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,500
You don't know that. Do you
have any proof that I did?

376
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,750
You know, you're
a beautiful girl.

377
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,166
But you aren't classy enough to
be our guest, dear. If there's

378
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,791
one thing I know, Haruhi
is not that kind of a man.

379
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,666
But why, Tamaki? You idiot!

380
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,500
Now how am I
going to punish you?

381
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,416
Because it is
your fault, after all.

382
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Your quota is now 1000!

383
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,916
One thousand?

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,625
Come on.

385
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,625
I've got high expectations
for you, my little rookie.

386
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,583
This is the only spare
uniform we have.

387
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,041
Sorry but it's better than
a wet one, right?

388
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,166
Thanks a lot you guys.
I'm gonna go change.

389
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,250
Haruhi, here you go.
I brought you some towels.

390
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,916
Haruhi.

391
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,416
Yeah?

392
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,458
So, you're a girl?

393
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,625
Biologically speaking, yeah.

394
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,333
Listen Senpai, I don't
really care whether you guys

395
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,875
recognize me as a boy
or a girl. In my opinion,

396
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,958
it's more important for
a person to be recognized

397
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,291
for who they are rather
than for what sex they are.

398
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,083
Well, isn't this an
interesting development?

399
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,125
Oh yeah!

400
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,000
You know, I have to say Senpai,

401
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,250
I thought you were
pretty cool earlier.

402
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,291
Now, I could be wrong,
but I think we may be

403
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,291
witnessing the beginnings
of love here.

404
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
Being a host and getting fussed
over by a bunch of girls

405
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,458
might not be that bad. I
wonder how I can pull it off?

406
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,833
I've got it! I'll just call
everyone dude and bro now!

407
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,333
Don't start getting full
of yourself just because

408
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,541
you're popular. If you're
going to be a host--

409
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,458
Wow! Another customer's
requested me!

410
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,041
Don't take my customers!

411
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,625
Next time, "The Job
of a High School Host".

412
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,208
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

413
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,250
We'll see you then!
