1
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,666
Welcome to the Host Club.

2
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,083
What are these things
all over the room?

3
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,291
Are they furniture?

4
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,958
If my memory
serves me correctly,

5
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,500
they're called kotatsu.

6
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,708
Oh, I wondered what
those looked like.

7
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,166
I've never seen one before.

8
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,500
Neither have I.

9
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,166
Indeed it is a kotatsu,
normally they're only used

10
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,666
in the winter.

11
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,583
It may be a little early in
the season for one of these

12
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,125
but I figured it was
perfect for you ladies.

13
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,666
After all, you're always one
step ahead of the crowd,

14
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,416
aren't you?

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Now my darlings. I hope
that you will enjoy today's

16
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:02,708
home-style kotatsu service,
presented by our Host Club.

17
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,250
I never really thought of
sitting under a kotatsu as fun.

18
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,166
Well, the ladies
seem to enjoy it.

19
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,125
Let me guess, this
kotatsu service is one

20
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,583
of Tamaki-senpai's
ideas, isn't it?

21
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,291
Yeah.

22
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,333
What's the matter? Do you have
something against kotatsus?

23
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,750
Not at all, I was just
thinking about something.

24
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,958
Now correct me if I'm
wrong but the Host Club

25
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:32,166
was originally founded by both
you and Tamaki-senpai, right?

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,625
That is correct.

27
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,750
Okay, well here's what I don't
get. Why would somebody

28
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,166
as cool as you fall
for a crazy idea like

29
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,583
a high school host club?

30
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,500
Well, Because it was
a crazy idea.

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,916
Back then the third son of
the Ootori family was about

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,625
to begin his final spring
in middle school.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,041
And so Kyoya met him.

34
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,375
Kyoya Ootori!

35
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,916
Kyoya, wait up!

36
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,041
What's up? My dad
told me he went to the

37
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,875
completion commemoration
for your family's

38
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,541
new hospital yesterday.

39
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,416
He was totally surprised! He
said it was like a who's who

40
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,375
of the top people
in every field!

41
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,500
He asked me to be sure
to tell you thank you.

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,958
This is the son of the chairman
of a major electronics company.

43
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,208
It's no big deal. I hope
you'll be able to attend

44
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,000
the next one with your father.

45
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,291
Hey Kyoya!

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,000
We just heard that you're at
the head of the class again.

47
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,916
This is the son of a major
department store family.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,625
And you're gonna be
class rep again for the

49
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,875
3rd Year in a row,
how cool!

50
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:06,000
And this is the youngest son
of a well-known Diet member.

51
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,333
Whoa, look over there!
It's Kyoya!

52
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,750
He looks so handsome!

53
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah he does.

54
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,666
And these are some
frivolous-minded girls.

55
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,500
Hey, Ootori!

56
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,291
How'd you like to come
visit my family's villa

57
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,125
in the mountains?

58
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:24,208
This one's the son of a
prestigious funds manager.

59
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,041
You guys can come too.

60
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,666
It's beautiful up there
you can see so many stars!

61
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,708
We even built
a small observatory.

62
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,208
My father likes to use
the villa for vacations

63
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,416
so we might see him
while we're there.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,541
I couldn't care less
about stargazing.

65
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,791
That sounds like
a great idea.

66
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,666
--but I'm very interested
in meeting your father.

67
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,541
My, my, my Kyoya.

68
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,916
You're really going to impose
on their vacation just

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,250
to meet his father?

70
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,791
I'm not imposing.
I was invited. He asked me

71
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,208
to join him at the villa.

72
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,541
It's simply a give-and-take
situation Sis.

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,916
Why does everything have
to be so manipulative

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
with you? Did you think that
maybe they honestly just

75
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,750
wanted you to come look
at the stars with them?

76
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,208
I think it's really sweet.
Two young men bonding

77
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,500
underneath the stars.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,625
Fuyumi would you
please stop it.

79
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,583
I've asked you a million
times to stop rummaging

80
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,333
through my drawers like that.

81
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,791
What was that? Uh, I'm
not rummaging I'm just

82
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,333
trying to organize
all of your clothes

83
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,166
for you, Kyoya.

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,875
It won't go back in
I know it--

85
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,458
Why don't you just let
the maid take care of that?

86
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,250
Listen Kyoya.

87
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,125
I know dad's really strict and
he puts a lot of pressure

88
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,541
on you but you're different
than our older brothers.

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,791
Remember, he doesn't expect
as much from you.

90
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:56,083
So it's okay if you
take it easy sometimes.

91
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:01,291
I know. I'll never be successor
of the Ootori family.

92
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,416
I'm not like my brothers. All
they had to do was follow

93
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,583
the path that they
had been promised.

94
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,166
A path that keeps heading
upward. It's because

95
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,708
I'm the third son
that I can't relax.

96
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,375
I'll surpass father's
expectations of me and I will

97
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,166
respect my brothers
and never step on

98
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,625
their toes in the process.

99
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,750
How can I demonstrate my
abilities without exceeding

100
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,125
the limits of being
the "third son"?

101
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,416
I have a daunting task.
I must paint the

102
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,291
perfect picture on
a canvas that has already

103
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,500
been placed inside
a magnificent frame.

104
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:43,166
You're such a bright boy,
Kyoya. Everything you do,

105
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,541
you do exceptionally well.

106
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,125
But tell me will
you ever be happy?

107
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,791
To be honest, whether I'm
happy or unhappy has nothing

108
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,000
to do with it.

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,208
My oldest brother had already
graduated from medical school

110
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,833
and was in training
at the same hospital

111
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,333
as my father
as his successor.

112
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,291
My second brother was
still in medical school

113
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,083
and was planning
to get an MBA after

114
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,708
he graduated so he
could support our brother.

115
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,208
And then, there was me,
the third son.

116
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,875
Kyoya.

117
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,291
Today is the day that
Suou's son is going to be

118
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,416
transfering into
your class, right?

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,541
We've done business with
the Suou group for many years

120
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,166
now and we have a wonderful
relationship with them.

121
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,375
But competition is
still a possibility,

122
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,541
so I've been thinking.
Your befriending young Suou

123
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,083
would be in our
family's best interest.

124
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,291
But whatever you do Kyoya,
don't forget. Always keep

125
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,833
your friends close
and your enemies closer.

126
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,875
Yes sir. I remember.

127
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,958
Staying at the head
of the class isn't enough.

128
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,416
Both of your brothers did the
same when they were in school.

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,333
I'm sure you're aware that
it'll take more than that

130
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,000
to satisfy me.

131
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,750
I'm counting on you, Kyoya.

132
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,875
Yes sir. I know that.

133
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,000
I was confident that
I had the ability to see

134
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,375
through other people's facades
but they could never see

135
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,250
through mine.

136
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,000
It didn't matter what this
Suou guy might be like

137
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,416
making friends with
him would be easy.

138
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,833
I would do anything
that my father wanted.

139
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,041
Tamaki Suou. So, his son
was conceived while

140
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,333
the chairman was overseas.

141
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,625
The chairman eventually
decided to take him in

142
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,875
since he had no
other children and

143
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,041
was recently divorced.

144
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,916
And so the chairman's love
child becomes the heir

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,583
to the Suou group overnight.

146
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,625
Well isn't he a lucky fellow?

147
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,541
Class Representative,
vice-representative,

148
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,208
please come this way.

149
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,250
Allow me to introduce you
to our new student,

150
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,625
Tamaki Suou.

151
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,541
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

152
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,666
This is class
representative Kyoya Ootori

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,500
and vice-representative
Ayame Jonouchi.

154
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,958
You have the most
beautiful straight hair that

155
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,958
I've ever seen.

156
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,500
I would assume that
your heart is just as

157
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,750
blindingly beautiful
as that hair of yours.

158
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,541
Maybe it's
a cultural difference?

159
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,500
Nice to meet you, Ootori.

160
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,875
The pleasure is all mine.
You know, if you'd like,

161
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,500
I can take you on
a tour of the school.

162
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,833
That'd be great.
Thank you very much.

163
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,458
Up ahead of us is the
west school building all

164
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,791
special classrooms
are on the other side.

165
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,875
Oh, I forgot. I was
wondering Ootori do you

166
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,916
have a kotatsu at your house?

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,625
Oh Surely you do. I think
kotatsus are simply amazing!

168
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,375
I've always thought it was
cool that the Japanese

169
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,916
sit on the floor.
I told myself I would

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,750
sit under one
once I got to Japan.

171
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:59,125
But at home,
the décor is all western.

172
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,291
Ah, so he's one of those.
There are a number of

173
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,083
foreigners enamoured
with Japanese culture.

174
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,250
Unfortunately, we don't
have any kotatsu either,

175
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,541
we do have Japanese
décor though.

176
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,583
What happened? Did I step on
a land mine or something?

177
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,333
I can't believe it.
You don't have a kotatsu?

178
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,458
I'm sorry Ootori.

179
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,291
It was rather insensitive
of me to ask you that.

180
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:29,708
I guess you're family isn't as
close as they could be, huh?

181
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,250
Look, it's okay you don't
have to hide it anymore.

182
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,875
I'm well aware that the
kotatsu is a symbol for

183
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,916
a happy home life in Japan.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,375
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
here in Japan you playfully

185
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,375
kick each other's feet under the
kotatsu while building familial

186
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,541
bonds of trust and watching
Costume Grand Prix, right?

187
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:50,208
And of course, you also eat
plenty of mandarin oranges!

188
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,541
I feel sorry for you, you and
your family are missing out.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,916
I hate to correct you but I
think you've got the wrong idea.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,416
If its that important to you,
we can always put a kotatsu

191
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,666
in our home for you to visit.

192
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,875
Thank you Ootori! Yay!

193
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,958
You're such a good friend!
You're my best friend!

194
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,666
Hey, Ootori. I don't
wanna be too forward

195
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,500
or anything but since
we're pals do you think

196
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,166
it's okay for me to call you
by your first name?

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:26,208
Bravo! Kyoya! My pal!
Mon ami! Yahoo!

198
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,458
My, my, my Kyoya.

199
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,791
You became his best
friend in one day.

200
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,166
I don't think he even knows what
it means to be "best friends".

201
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,416
To be honest, I can't be
positive he's even fluent

202
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,791
in Japanese.

203
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,083
Sis, how many times
do I have to tell you?

204
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,500
Would you please
quit rummaging through

205
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,333
my drawers like that?

206
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,583
Today he drew me in,
got me to play everything

207
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,916
at his pace. Well,
at least now know he's

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,458
a complete idiot.

209
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,625
Kyoya, you have too many things
crammed into these drawers.

210
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,458
Once you pull something out,
there's no way

211
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,208
to get it back in.

212
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,750
Then don't pull anything out.

213
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,625
Kyoya, I need to ask
a favor of you.

214
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,791
You see, I really
want to go to Kyoto.

215
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,500
I got so excited about
the kotatsu that I forgot.

216
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,208
I always said that once I got
to Japan I'd go to Kyoto.

217
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,750
The Great Buddha at Nara.
Goryokaku Park,

218
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,750
I want to see Sheesa
and Namahage.

219
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,541
I want to see everything!

220
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,875
One problem none of
those things are in Kyoto.

221
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,000
He's an even bigger idiot
than I thought

222
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,208
How about we see each of
those things, one at a time?

223
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,083
Why don't we go to Kyoto
this weekend and then

224
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,083
on our next school holiday
we can go to Okeenawa.

225
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,541
Thank you, Kyoya!

226
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,541
You're the greatest! Like a
god! Like the great Buddha!

227
00:12:55,625 --> 00:13:02,375
Kyoya! Mon ami! Mon ami!
Kyoya! Yahoo! Yahoo!

228
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,916
Again with the "mon ami"
business. It's only the

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,625
second day I've known him and
I'm already a god in his eyes.

230
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,791
For some reason it seems like
I just can't get my head

231
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,416
around this guy.
Before I knew it,

232
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,958
he had completely
won over our class.

233
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,958
Kyoya! I found a Namahage!

234
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,250
Namahage! Namahage!
Namahage!

235
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,250
No that's a Shisa.

236
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:35,208
My, my, my, Kyoya. I knew I'd
find you up late studying.

237
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,083
Wait a minute,
are those travel guides?

238
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,875
Oh wow, so you guys are
going to Hokkaido next?

239
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,583
That's wonderful!

240
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,208
But if you need a guide,
I'm sure that you could

241
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,625
ask the family driver.

242
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,208
That's not good enough not
for this Tamaki Suou guy.

243
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,375
When we went to Kyoto
he wanted to see the

244
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,708
daimoanji bonfire even though
it's still spring time and

245
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,625
as we were eating
Okinawa soba noodles

246
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,958
he tells me he wants
to compare them to

247
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,583
Shinshu soba noodles.
Then he went on about

248
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,166
whether a shisa or a namahage
would win in a fight.

249
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,500
And then, after all that.

250
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,583
I'm sorry for asking you
to do all of this.

251
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,791
You're right. It's not
your responsibility, Kyoya.

252
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:21,791
I'm Sorry. I've overestimated
your ability to entertain me.

253
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,458
But this time I'm going to make
sure I'm ready for anything!

254
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,708
I promise that while the two
of us are in Hokkaido,

255
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,791
I will cater to your
every whim, Suou!!!!

256
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,416
We're going to Hokkaido?

257
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,875
I know you want to enjoy
your life to the fullest but

258
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,166
don't you think
we should be spending

259
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,666
our time studying
for finals right now?

260
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,708
We can go to Hokkaido
when they're over.

261
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,375
I think you should start
hitting the books, my friend.

262
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,083
My, my, my, Kyoya.
Kyoya what on earth is

263
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,333
the matter with you?

264
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,958
That bastard!

265
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,458
He's an idiot. I knew that
but I honestly had

266
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:04,333
no idea that he that he was
such a total dumbass!

267
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,416
Next week, let's go
to Hokkaido, okay?!

268
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,708
I've never wanted
to hit someone so badly

269
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:17,750
in my entire life!
DAMN! I HATE HIM!

270
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,875
Okay, calm down.
He may be an idiot but

271
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,833
he is the Suou family's heir.
Getting emotional

272
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,333
isn't going to help anything.
Obivously father's testing my

273
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,875
ability to cope with
certain situations.

274
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,250
Even so, I won't forget
this you bastard.

275
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,500
Damn you, Tamaki Suou.
You really expect me

276
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,958
to buy a kotatsu just for you?

277
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,625
I was going to tell Kyoya that
if he can't stand the kid

278
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:45,416
then there's no reason to force
himself to hang out with him.

279
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,791
But you know, I've never seen
him so passionate about

280
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,625
anything before.

281
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,083
It's been a while since I've
had a day off from Tamaki.

282
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,958
Your friend has come
to visit today.

283
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,500
My friend?

284
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:39,875
Beautiful, isn't it?
It brings me to tears.

285
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,208
To be honest, the first time
I heard him play the piano

286
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,625
I was in complete shock.
Not because my brothers

287
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:51,291
were in tears but because
without even realizing it,

288
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,750
that beautiful music had
brought me to tears as well.

289
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,625
Sorry for just dropping
by out of the blue like this.

290
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,791
If that's how you feel,
then go home.

291
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,833
So what happened
to studying for finals?

292
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,375
Have you finished yet?

293
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,250
Wow, your house is gigantic
Kyoya! I wonder if this one

294
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,333
could be any bigger than my
house the one I have in France.

295
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,875
What're you trying to say?

296
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,416
Well. I don't know about
your mansion in France

297
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,208
but I'm sure your estate is
bigger than mine, right?

298
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,500
Well uh, I wouldn't know
because I've never been

299
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:28,458
in the main estate before. And
uh, the second estate is small.

300
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,833
So Kyoya, are you the successor
to the Ootori family estate?

301
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,500
Is this guy actually trying
to pick a fight with me?!

302
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,458
There's no way that'll
happen my brothers they're

303
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,625
the first in line.

304
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,708
I'm sure that I'll just end up
working for them someday.

305
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,833
Really? That's a surprise.

306
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,166
Maybe I'm wrong but I get
the feeling you want more

307
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,625
than that I mean.
When I look in your eyes

308
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,250
I can tell you're not happy
with your situation.

309
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,666
I'm surprised you'd
give up so easily.

310
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,875
This has nothing to do with
whether I'm giving up or not.

311
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,541
It's just the way things are!

312
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,375
You wouldn't understand
because you'll be successor

313
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,583
to your family's estate without
even lifting a finger.

314
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,458
Damn it.

315
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,916
Its not certain that I'll be
the Suou family successor.

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,083
My grandmother doesn't
like me. So if things

317
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,916
stay the way they are now
then I'm not the heir,

318
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,958
I'm not anything. I'm kind
of in a probationary period.

319
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,083
I can't believe I
didn't tell you that.

320
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,250
To be completely honest
with you. I'm not really

321
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,875
all that interested in
my father's line of work.

322
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:38,291
And besides, look at me. I can't
let these looks go to waste.

323
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,791
And you know, I am
incredibly smart so maybe

324
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,166
I could be a brilliant
scientist. You know what

325
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,875
I'd love to do more than
anything? I want to open

326
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,583
an animal kingdom in the
north. When I close my eyes

327
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,291
I can see it!

328
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,833
Shut up, Tamaki!

329
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,625
Do you expect me
to believe that crap?!

330
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,666
How can you possibly give
up on being your family's

331
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,625
successor so easily?!

332
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,583
You have no idea what it's
like for me! You actually

333
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,875
have a chance at it all
you have to do is try!

334
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,875
Take advantage of your
fortunate circumstances!

335
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,666
Don't you realize the position
that you've been blessed with?!

336
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,958
I can't believe you, damn it.
Who the hell are you?!

337
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,375
Of course, I know that my
brothers are no more suited

338
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:39,541
for the position
than I am, but.

339
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,750
I will always feel the
frustration of not being able

340
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:47,833
to step outside of my frame
because I am the third son.

341
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,791
Hold on. It sounds to
me like you're the one

342
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,541
who isn't trying.

343
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,458
If you really want to
surpass your brothers

344
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,250
then you can do it.
But I think The one who's

345
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,000
given up here--
is you, Kyoya.

346
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,166
Oh yeah and by the way
where's that kotatsu

347
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,541
I asked for? Not to be
a pain but I thought

348
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,625
you'd have it ready
for me by now that's

349
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
why I stopped by your place.

350
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,666
What is it? Hey,
what's so funny.

351
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,041
Let me guess, you've got
the kotatsu ready to go

352
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,458
and you're trying
to hide it from me.

353
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,750
It's not all about you,
you know.

354
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,458
Kotatsu are only used in
the winter. So if you want

355
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,291
to sit under one you'll
have to wait until then.

356
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,541
Now would you quit
being a dumb ass?

357
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,791
Oh man your face, it looks evil.
So you're finally showing

358
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,458
your true colors?

359
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,625
Hey Kyoya, I just had
the most brilliant idea!

360
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,541
We should start
a club together!

361
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,125
We could start our club
activities as soon

362
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,958
as we get into high school.

363
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,375
And we can finally
make use of our good looks

364
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,375
with a high school host club!

365
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,291
Sleep first and then dream.

366
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm serious! I already know
who we should ask to join!

367
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,708
We have to ask
Haninozuka-senpai and

368
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,000
Morinozuka-senpai from the

369
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,375
high school and those
2nd Year twins.

370
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,750
It seemed like the more I
listened, the more ridiculous

371
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,833
his plans became. But for some
reason, I got the feeling

372
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,958
that if I shared his world. I
would experience something

373
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,458
different than anything I had
ever experienced before.

374
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,583
As a special event during the
school festival the Host Club

375
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,000
will be open to the public
for the next two days.

376
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,333
We'll entertain our guests
even more extravagantly than

377
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,666
we usually do.

378
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,916
Next time, "The Host Club
Declares Dissolution!"

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,666
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

380
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,375
We'll See you then!
