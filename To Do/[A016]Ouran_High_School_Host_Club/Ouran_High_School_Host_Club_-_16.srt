1
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,375
Haruhi Fujioka?

2
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,958
Hey, Arai.

3
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,875
So, uh, these
your friends?

4
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,583
Oh, yeah, this
is Hikaru and Kaoru-

5
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,500
they're in my class.
And this is-

6
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,916
-my sen-

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,458
While you act as my apprentice,
you can't treat me as Senpai.

8
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,375
An acquaintance of mine.

9
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,750
Misuzu.

10
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,291
Please don't add
any sound effects

11
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,083
to my moment of despair.

12
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,500
"Operation Haruhi
&amp; Hikaru's First Date"

13
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,625
I haven't seen
you since graduation.

14
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,041
Yeah- you cut all your hair
off. That's such a shame.

15
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,416
I don't think so. I
mean, since I cut it,

16
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,375
it has been easier to manage.

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,750
So how's Ouran treating you?
Do you keep in touch

18
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,916
with anyone from middle
school anymore?

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,833
Yeah. A little. Kazumi still
calls me. What about you?

20
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,625
So, then he's
a friend of Haruhi's

21
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,208
from middle school, huh?

22
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,041
They've had zero contact since
graduation so in my opinion-

23
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,458
they're not friends,
just former classmates.

24
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,708
So these guys are all in
a club with you?

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,750
Host Club.

26
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,416
Oh. Is that so?

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,416
Hey, Haruhi! Don't you think
you should be working?

28
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,708
You shouldn't be slacking off!

29
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,958
Misuzu said
I could take a break!

30
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,166
Hey, quit making more garbage
I'll have to take out.

31
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,583
It's not garbage.
I'm making a hamster home.

32
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,708
But senpai,
you don't have a hamster.

33
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,625
I'm not your senpai. I'm just
an acquaintance of yours.

34
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,208
Wow, who knew you Ouran
guys were so funny?!

35
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,125
You know, it's such
a prestigious school.

36
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,541
I've always imagined it was
a whole different world.

37
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,625
It's a different
world, alright.

38
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,416
To be honest with you Fujioka.
I was kinda worried

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,458
that you were gonna have
a hard time going to such

40
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,458
an elite school.

41
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,875
I'm glad to see
you're doing well.

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,333
Um, I mean. It's not like
I was the only one who was

43
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,041
worried about you,
lots of people were.

44
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,875
What's with him? He's
trying to use the refreshing

45
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,125
innocence approach.
Someone should tell him we

46
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,333
already had a
refreshment contest.

47
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,166
You're being
unusually critical.

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,416
I'm just sayin'.

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,125
It's obvious this guy
has a thing for Haruhi.

50
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,666
It's sickening to watch
him try and flirt.

51
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,083
Hikaru! What's wrong with you?!
Quit acting like such a jerk!

52
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,750
Hey, it's no big deal.
He's right; I did have

53
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,333
a thing for you once.

54
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,916
But who cares, you already
turned me down, right?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,708
Why do you look
so surprised?

56
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,083
Well, I didn't know.

57
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,083
You have to fill us in
on this story, Arai.

58
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,958
Now When did this happen?

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,208
Well, it was about a year ago.

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,833
There she is! Fujioka!

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:39,208
I heard you're taking the honor
student exam for Ouran Academy.

62
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:43,291
You are? Well, you just might
make it in with your grades.

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,125
Although. I was sure you'd
be going to Higashi High.

64
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,666
I'm taking the test for
Higashi, too. I don't know if

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
I'll be accepted to Ouran.

66
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,083
Yeah. Well, I guess I'll just
cheer for you. I'd have liked

67
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,458
to go to the same high school
as you, though.

68
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,416
Well, okay, then. You really
should have said something

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,791
to me sooner.

70
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,250
You mean?

71
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,958
I'm pretty sure Ouran has
more than one honor student

72
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,416
scholarship to award.

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,208
Oh, that...

74
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,625
And even if there is only one,
you can't give up on going to

75
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,750
the school of your dreams
for someone else's sake.

76
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,291
If only one of us gets in, there
won't be any hard feelings,

77
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,875
right? We should
both do our best.

78
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,333
I know!

79
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,458
Let's go and ask
the counselor about it.

80
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,916
Fujioka!

81
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,708
I- I want. I want
you to go with me!

82
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,541
Yeah.

83
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,291
I wanted check the
application deadline, too.

84
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,416
Let's go to the
staff room together.

85
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,500
Haruhi.

86
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,791
You broke this innocent man's
heart just to get a laugh

87
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,583
from some sick joke?

88
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,625
No, that's not what happened-

89
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,875
This crime's pretty
serious, huh?

90
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,666
I'm so sorry.

91
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,333
So you're turning me down
again a whole year later?!

92
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,791
Don't worry, Fujioka!
I'm over it already!

93
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
You didn't realize what
I meant so that means

94
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,500
you weren't interested.

95
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,708
But you know, I was always
drawn to that faraway look

96
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,416
in your eyes.

97
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,291
And the way you would
look someone in the eyes

98
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,166
when you spoke to them.

99
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,791
I liked that about you, I always
thought you were special.

100
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,916
You think that much of my
little girl? Don't worry;

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,375
I'll never forget
your gallantry!

102
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,500
Wow. You guys went to Kyoto
for your middle school

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,125
field trip? How unusual that
you stayed in the country.

104
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,416
Nah, it's quite normal
for us, really.

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,708
Well, I've always
been a fan of Kyoto.

106
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,083
I can't tell you how many times
I've had to tour the temples

107
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,875
with him.

108
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,333
What should we do Hikaru?
They're having a good time

109
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,750
over there-
we could join them.

110
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,125
No. I'm not going to.
I can't believe the boss

111
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,875
is actually hanging out
with that jerk.

112
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,083
Hikaru! Kaoru!

113
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,458
Get over here! This may be
our only chance to hear

114
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,125
what Haruhi was like
in middle school!

115
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,083
Sorry, but I'm not interested!

116
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,375
Man, how stupid can you
guys get? Where's the fun

117
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,708
in sitting around talking
about somebody's past?

118
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,375
I don't see the appeal.

119
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,416
Besides, doesn't that guy
realize Haruhi doesn't

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
want anything to do with him?

121
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,166
She's got plenty of friends.

122
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,500
So she doesn't need
you around, get it?

123
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,666
That's not something
for you to decide, Hikaru!

124
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,916
I'm not gonna tolerate
you insulting my friends

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,958
anymore! You got that?

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,500
But why- why should anyone
else even matter to you?

127
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,791
I thought we were your
friends! Are we or aren't we?!

128
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,875
Hikaru! Wait for me!

129
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,166
Their world is still
so small. It's such a shame.

130
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,791
That's some temper
you've got there.

131
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,125
Aren't you a bit old for that?

132
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,458
Don't pretend like you
weren't upset, too.

133
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,458
Well, maybe I was, but I'm
more rational than you.

134
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,041
I don't think I've seen you
act so selfishly before,

135
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,541
like a little child.
Haruhi was surprised.

136
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,083
Well, I couldn't help it.
I was really upset

137
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,375
but I can't figure out why.

138
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,000
Here's an idea; why don't you
go apologize to Arai?

139
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,375
I'm sorry about that, Arai.

140
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,541
It's okay. I don't know what
I did, but whatever it was

141
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,625
it sure seemed
to set him off, huh?

142
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,500
Hika-chan.

143
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,708
I was outta line.

144
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:27,333
Thanks, don't worry about it.
Well, see you soon, Fujioka.

146
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,000
Bye, guys!

147
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,333
Bye bye!

148
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,708
So, Kaoru, tell me why you're
pretending to be Hikaru.

149
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey! What happened to that
scratch on your cheek?

150
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,625
I just covered it up with
some concealer!

151
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,041
I don't think Hikaru's
temper is going to let up

152
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,166
anytime soon.

153
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,333
He's no fun when he's like
this, so I've got a small favor

154
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,250
to ask of you.

155
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,250
How would you like to go out
with me tomorrow on a date?

156
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,541
Sorry to keep you waiting.

157
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,250
Hold on. Where's Kaoru?

158
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,916
Well, uh.

159
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,875
I was gonna take Haruhi
out to make up for what

160
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,291
happened yesterday, but I
seem to have caught a cold.

161
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,083
You're not feeling too good?

162
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,541
Will you take her
out in my place?

163
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,250
She's expecting me to hang out
with her all day so make sure

164
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,916
you show her a good time.
And it better go well or she's

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,208
never gonna talk to you again!
Think you can you handle it?

166
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,291
Yeah, that shouldn't
be a problem.

167
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,375
Are you sure?

168
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,791
Hey, come on.
You think I can't do it?

169
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,791
Well, you've never really
gone out with anyone before.

170
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,750
So just listen carefully, 'k?

171
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,625
You have to tell other
people how you feel

172
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,416
or they'll never know.

173
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,916
And remember.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,291
What were you thinking, Kaoru?

175
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,291
What should do we do?
Wanna go home?

176
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,125
No, I told him I'd hang
out with you today

177
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,333
so we might as well,
but what's up with that outfit?

178
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,125
Is it weird?

179
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,125
Kinda.

180
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,541
Haruhi!

181
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,250
Be careful,
boss they'll see us!

182
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,208
Why did Hikaru and Haruhi
end up on a date anyway?!

183
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,541
I don't understand!

184
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,541
How are yesterday's events
even related to this?!

185
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,333
You know, this might be
Haru-chan's first date.

186
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,708
You're going to pay for that!
And look at what she's wearing!

187
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,083
It's cute! Super cute!!

188
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,166
Oh, I can explain.

189
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,666
Good morning, Miss Fujioka.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,583
Time to get ready.

191
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,375
Hey! What are you doing?!

192
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,041
No fair! No fair! No fair!

193
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,625
I dunno, boss.

194
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,541
It's hard for you to understand
but it would be good

195
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,625
for Hikaru find other people
he can feel close to.

196
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,166
The only people
we've ever been able

197
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,875
to depend on are ourselves.

198
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,666
We didn't care what anyone
else thought about us.

199
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,333
That's probably how we ended
up so self-centered.

200
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,458
So you're admitting it?

201
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,416
I guess you could say Hikaru's
immature, he lets his emotions

202
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,958
take over. See, I'm not
sure he's even aware of it.

203
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,958
But I can tell that
he cares about Haruhi.

204
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,500
He just doesn't know how to
react so his emotions run wild.

205
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,125
He's selfish and wants
all of her attention.

206
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,833
Are we or aren't we?!

207
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,375
He wants to be acknowledged
by her but doesn't know

208
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,791
how to make that happen.

209
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,291
If you want true friends,
friends who aren't only

210
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,958
your toys, you have to learn
to respect them. That's the

211
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,000
only way you can have a
meaningful relationship.

212
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,666
And I think it's about
time that Hikaru learned

213
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,625
that lesson himself.

214
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,958
Kaoru, that was amazing.

215
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,125
So in other words,
this date is basically a test

216
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,000
to see if Hikaru can
handle being thoughtful

217
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,541
towards others, right?

218
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,916
Just promise me you won't
interfere with them, okay?

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,541
Fine but then why are you
making us follow them?

220
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,958
Because, there's no reason
we should miss out on

221
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,375
watching something
this interesting.

222
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,500
So, where do you
want to go, Haruhi?

223
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,958
Kaoru said he'd plan everything.
So I didn't really give it

224
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,833
much thought. Any ideas?

225
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,750
Well, there's not anything
that I need to do here.

226
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,833
Be sure you show her
a good time!

227
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,041
I know... why don't we
go to that outlet mall

228
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,416
by the train station? They've
got cheap clothes there.

229
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,708
That's cool but do you need
to buy some clothes?

230
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,250
No, there's no way I'd buy
my clothes at that place.

231
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,500
Then let's skip it.

232
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,916
What a pain.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,916
Everything looks fine now, but
Misuzu said it might rain.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,291
I sure hope there aren't
any thunderstorms today.

235
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,125
I never knew you were
so into the weather.

236
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,083
How can he call himself
a Host Club member?!

237
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
This is the lamest excuse
for a date I've ever seen!

238
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,125
Look at him! I should
switch with Hikaru!

239
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
I'll show her a good time!

240
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,833
That would ruin everything!

241
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,750
Get out there Kyoya! Act
like a punk and pick a fight

242
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,958
with Haruhi so Hikaru
will have to rescue her!

243
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,333
Where do you dream
this stuff up?

244
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,625
Ice cream! Ice cream! Does
anyone want ice cream?!

245
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,083
Bad idea.

246
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,958
That was creepy; that old guy
kinda looked like Honey-senpai.

247
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,583
One ice cream, please.

248
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,208
Hey, you shouldn't run off
like that, Haruhi!

249
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,708
I heard this place is famous
for their ice cream.

250
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,875
Here. I'll let you
have the first taste.

251
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,500
If it sucks then
we're playing a penalty game.

252
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,375
What a pretty young lady!
Here's another one for you,

253
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,750
on the house.

254
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,250
Thank you, sir.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Delicious!

256
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,625
You're right.
It is pretty good.

257
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,000
What do you think
you're doing?!

258
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,375
It was finally going
well, you idiot!

259
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,041
You think I'm gonna let them
share an ice cream cone

260
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,750
like a couple?!
That's indirect kissing!

261
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,500
According to this,
they're pickled yams.

262
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,041
That's pretty weird, huh?

263
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,708
C'mon, pickled food is so lame.
Who'd want to eat that crap?

264
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,041
Try it.

265
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,000
It's not that bad.

266
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,166
I'll take two bags
of these, please.

267
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,875
You're not supposed
to buy souvenirs until

268
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,458
the last day of your trip.

269
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,583
You're gonna be in Karuizawa
for a while, right?

270
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,666
These are a gift.
I'm getting them for Kaoru.

271
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,333
Hey, listen, do you think
the others would be up for

272
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,916
souvenir shopping tonight?
We could always come back

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,458
to these shops later and pick
out a few more gifts for Kaoru.

274
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
I don't understand.
How can you tell

275
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,041
that I'm upset about Kaoru?

276
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,000
I just can.

277
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,791
Well, let's go.

278
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,333
We take our eyes off of them
for a second and suddenly

279
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,833
everything's great!

280
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,625
That's true but I get
the feeling Haruhi's

281
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,000
the one in charge here.

282
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,833
It looks like the
ice cream stand helped

283
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,083
smooth things over.

284
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,583
I doubt it.

285
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,500
We should get going,
if we get caught.

286
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,583
It's gonna ruin everything.

287
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,458
And anyway, I don't think
the boss can handle

288
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,708
much more of this.

289
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,416
It looks like
so much fun. Lucky.

290
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,416
Did you just
hear something?

291
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,625
What? No, I didn't hear
anything; it does look like

292
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,291
it's going to rain, though.
Think we should head back?

293
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
Probably.

294
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,541
Then, let's head to the
street and, hail a cab, okay?

295
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,666
Is that you, Fujioka?

296
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,750
What are you up to?

297
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,333
Hey Arai, what are
you doing here?

298
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,083
Well, this is my uncle's store.

299
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,000
You guys out doing
some shopping?

300
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,375
Yeah but we were
just about to leave.

301
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,791
Yeah? We've got a car
that can take you back.

302
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,083
Let me just ask my uncle

303
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,250
I don't wanna be
a bother...

304
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,125
It's no problem.
I wouldn't want you

305
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,375
to get caught in the rain.

306
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,208
Don't worry about it,
we're getting a taxi.

307
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,833
C'mon, don't waste
your money on a taxi.

308
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
Hey, we should
accept his offer.

309
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,250
The sooner we get home,
the better.

310
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,666
Well, I guess you'll be
riding home alone, then.

311
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,791
Hikaru.

312
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,625
Just do whatever
you want, okay?

313
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,166
You guys can catch
up and reminisce

314
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,833
but leave me out of it!

315
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,458
Wait!

316
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,666
Not again. Why's he so
upset about you hanging out

317
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,666
with an old friend?
I mean, surely he's got

318
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,416
some of his own, right?

319
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,541
The two of us have been
together since we were born,

320
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,375
so we haven't ever needed
any other friends.

321
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,708
Check out that lightning!

322
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,708
I sure hope those two didn't
get stuck in the rain.

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,166
Tamaki dear, please
try to settle down.

324
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,166
I should go
look for them, huh?

325
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:48,208
Hello? This is Pension Misuzu.
Oh, it's you Arai. What is it?

326
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,791
What? Haruhi and Hikaru?

327
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,750
Thank you. Hikaru should
have his cell with him

328
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,500
so I'll try giving him
a call. G'bye now.

329
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,500
Evidently Hikaru left Haduhi
in front of the produce shop

330
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,958
and decided he would head
back on his own.

331
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,291
Arai said Haduhi took off
after Hikaru and that's when

332
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,458
it started pouring. He
was worried so he called

333
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,541
to make sure they
made it home okay.

334
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,291
Hey, what's up boss? You've got
great timing- think you can

335
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,083
send a cab to get me? I haven't
had any luck hailing one.

336
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,416
You idiot! I want you to turn
around and start looking

337
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,583
for Haruhi, right now!

338
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,625
What kind of jerk would leave
a girl out in a thunderstorm

339
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,666
like this by herself?!
Now you listen to me,

340
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,291
Haruhi is terrified of thunder!
Whenever she hears it,

341
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,291
she gets so scared she
can't even move!

342
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,250
Why don't you spend less
time concentrating on

343
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,166
your jealousy and worry
about someone else for once!

344
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,833
What does he mean by that?
How the hell was I

345
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,708
supposed to know,
if she never told me?

346
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,541
I sure hope there aren't
any thunderstorms today.

347
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,916
Did you just hear something?

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,958
Hey, we should
accept his offer.

349
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,208
The sooner we get
home the better.

350
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,000
There's no way I could've
figured that out!

351
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,041
Haruhi? Hey,
are you in here?

352
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,208
Haruhi?

353
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,166
You have to tell other people
how you feel or they'll

354
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,708
never know. Remember.

355
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,333
Whenever you care a lot
for someone, Hikaru.

356
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,625
It's important you pay
attention to any subtle

357
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
little hints they drop.

358
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,625
I don't understand.

359
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,000
How can you tell that
I'm upset about Kaoru?

360
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
I just can.

361
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,666
Haruhi.

362
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,833
Hika-

363
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,791
Sorry.

364
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,916
I'm sorry for running off
and leaving you.

365
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:58,500
And for the things I said about
your friend Arai, I'm so sorry.

366
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,750
Thanks, Hikaru. I forgive you.

367
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,291
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,291
What's up?

369
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,250
Hey! Good morning, Arai!

370
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,291
I brought you a watermelon. My
uncle's got the best in town!

371
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,041
Oh Wow! It's huge!

372
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,250
It's certainly
an impressive melon.

373
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,916
Here.

374
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,583
Thanks a lot.

375
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,458
By the way. A question
about your strategy

376
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,625
did you ever consider the
possibility the date might go

377
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,250
too well and those two
might fall in love?

378
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,333
Nah, it's still
too soon for that.

379
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,666
Hikaru's kind of a dummy.

380
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,625
Hey! Come down here!
It's time for some melon!

381
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,375
Well. Then he's lucky because
our club's full of dummies.

382
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,208
What's going on
Kyoya-senpai? You never talk

383
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,458
during the preview.

384
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,458
Well, I make it a rule
not to do anything if

385
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,875
there's nothing in it for me.

386
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,166
Next time, "Kyoya's
Reluctant Day Off"!

387
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,208
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

388
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,083
We'll see you then!
