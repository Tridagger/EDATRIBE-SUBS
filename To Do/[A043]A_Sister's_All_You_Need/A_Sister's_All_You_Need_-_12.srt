When I was in sixth grade,

my mother was so ill
she had to be hospitalized.

00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,833
On top of that, my father would
come home late because of work,

00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,833

You can't always

I asked you not to put them in.

10

Do you want to grow up to be
big and strong, or not?

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
Thought so. Eat up.

You look tougher already!

Could you at least
stop cooking carrots

14

into the meat?

I looked all the time.

So...

21

I always went straight home
after school and read books.

life behind for a bit.

the most interest

No, she had nothing
to do with this.

She almost never stops
talking about you at home

54
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,125
so I had to come meet you.

55

Like how you got
a hundred on a test,

and how good a kid you are
for doing your homework.

57

She's always comparing me
with you,

58
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,750
like we're both her kids.

59
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,333
So naturally,

60
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,791
I started to think of you
as my responsible little bro.

61
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,750
I don't know if I'm happy
to be thought of like that.

Who wouldn't be worried
if someone they considered

Wow that's really... nice.

This came out of nowhere,
so obviously I was shocked.

But she was going out of her way
to help a total stranger,

a lot of manga.

novels like this.

some of these, too.

Since you're new, let's start
with a shorter story.

91

Maybe a light fantasy?

00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,750
I bet you'd connect with
a school story more.

93

Maybe you'd prefer
a female protagonist, too.

94
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,583
Come on, you don't have to
devote so much energy to it.

Of course I do.

Well, what if you don't like
the one I pick out?

You can just let me
borrow something else.

00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,000
But for now, I think I'd like

to read the one
you're most into at the moment.

Ayane Mitahora came over
to my house every week.

She was a pretty high school
girl who'd hang out with me.

cleaned up when it was over.

[ITSUKI whimpers, grunts]

181
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,333
Why would a beautiful girl

182
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,416
fall for a boring guy
who likes reading?

183
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,875
This isn't some stupid novel.

184
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,833
She even got rejected!

185
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,250
What does that make me?

186
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,458
The protagonist rejects
a minor character,

187
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,625
whose mom works
for my family.

188
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,583
I'm not a minor character.

189
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,125
I'm not even
a background character.

190
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,916
Damn it all.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,958
I wanna be the protagonist.

192
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,375
I guess.

193
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,500
I'll try writing.

194
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,875
[typing]

195
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
It was as though I had
a revelation of sorts.

196
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,333
[typing continues]

197
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,541
There wasn't really
a logic to it.

198
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,875
But I was certain I could write
something in that moment.

199
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,916
My fantasies and love
for little sisters.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,375
My failures, frustrations.

201
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,375
My inferiority complex.

202
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,000
My longing to become
the protagonist.

203
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,583
And my overwhelming sense of
hope that pushed me forward.

204
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,958
I wanted to give everything I
had to the story in front of me.

205
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,833
Just you wait, world.

206
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,708
You'll see.
I'm the protagonist!

207
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,458
[sighs]

208
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,166
[gasps]

209
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,791
[ITSUKI]
Kanikou.

210
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,416
I didn't realize
you were already here.

211
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,916
Yeah, I could tell.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,375
I take it you had a nice dream?

213
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,625
Yeah, sorta.

214
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,458
[NAYUTA]
Hmm? What kind of dream was it?

215
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,958
It was all about my ex.

216
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,000
[gasps]

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,083
I'm kidding.

218
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,833
I dreamt about the old me.

219
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,000
Felt like a completely
different person.

220
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,916
As you all know,
they've finally decided

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,583
to make "Mahou Academy"
into an anime.

222
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,875
So let's toast to me entering
a new chapter in my life!

223
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,750
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

224
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,625
Congrats, big bro.

225
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,166
Yeah. Congrats.

226
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,458
Thank you all so much!

227
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,250
You know this was supposed
to be kept a secret, right?

228
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,916
Yet you immediately
opened your big mouth.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,041
Come on, it's not
that big a deal.

230
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,833
At least I didn't
post about it online.

231
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,708
Just try to show
a little restraint, moron.

232
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,291
[ITSUKI] Well, we've got plenty
more years to work on that!

233
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,208
[TOKI]
You're damn right, we do.

234
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,083
We're gonna be so busy,
you'll wanna drop dead.

235
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,291
You'd better be prepared.

236
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,625
Despite how these two usually
treat each other,

237
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,000
they do get along well.

238
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
That sounds like
it could be kind of nice.

239
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,291
-[water running]
-[dishes clanging]

240
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,291
I thought I'd bring you
over a little present!

241
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,458
It's an indie board game
I found the other day.

242
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,958
Seemed appropriate
for your new beginnings.

243
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,416
"The Life of
a Light Novel Writer," huh?

244
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,916
This game already sounds
sad and bleak.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,208
True.

246
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,416
But even so,
we might as well try it.

247
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,833
From the looks of it, it's a lot
like your standard dice game.

248
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,041
[MIYAKO] Yeah, I think I've
played one just like it.

249
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,666
The person with the most money
at the end wins, right?

250
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,916
[HARUTO]
Nope!

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,458
In this game,
there are other values,

252
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,500
like popularity and happiness
that affect the outcome.

253
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,416
The game lasts for 30 rounds

254
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,458
and the player who gets the most
happiness points by the end

255
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,833
is declared the winner.

256
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,333
[CHIHIRO] Then what do you use
the money for?

257
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,416
[HARUTO] Apparently, you can
pay to have your dice roll

258
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,750
increased a little.

259
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,125
[ITSUKI]
Ah. Gotta remember that.

260
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,916
There's a lot of detailed rules.

261
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,541
But let's jump in.

262
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,125
It says that the youngest
player goes first.

263
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, that'd be me, then!

264
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,083
All right, where do
I place my piece?

265
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,583
[HARUTO] There's major,
mid-level, and minor labels,

266
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,500
or you can be
an internet novelist.

267
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,958
Each starts on
the "Newcomer Prize" space.

268
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,458
And you can even switch
courses later, if you want.

269
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,458
[CHIHIRO] Then I think I'll
start at the mid-level label.

270
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,500
Let's see.

271
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,583
I gotta roll a four to debut.

272
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,041
Meaning the game
doesn't even start

273
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,625
until you win
the newcomer award.

274
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,333
Show me a four.

275
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,083
-[gasps]
-[dice clatter]

276
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,333
[CHIHIRO]
Yes! I successfully debuted!

277
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,250
All right, I'm up next.

278
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,875
I might as well go
for the major label.

279
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,125
I mean, why not?

280
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,791
So I need to roll a six.

281
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,625
You make it sound so easy.

282
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,541
Well, in real life, the chances
are more like a hundred to one.

283
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,375
So these odds aren't
all that bad.

284
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,375
[NAYUTA exclaims]

285
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,750
[ITSUKI]
Seriously?

286
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
[NAYUTA chuckles]

287
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,208
Then I might as well go
for an astronomical debut

288
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,708
at a major label, too!

289
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,000
[grunts]

290
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,416
These guys don't know
what they're missing.

291
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,125
I have a freakin' anime.

292
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,416
That entry barrier's too high.

293
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,041
I think I'll go for
a minor label instead.

294
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,541
And I've debuted!

295
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,083
[sighs]

296
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,000
Then I guess I'll try out
the internet novelist route

297
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,458
since no one's gone
for that yet.

298
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,583
Oh cool, I don't even
need to roll.

299
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,833
And that concludes round one.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,375
Okay, back to me.

301
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,291
[ALL laugh]

302
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,666
[CHIHIRO]
Great!

303
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,083
I released a new volume
and got 500,000 yen.

304
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,166
[HARUTO]
Nice. Here's your cash.

305
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,208
[NAYUTA]
Oh, hey!

306
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,250
I released a new volume too!

307
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,916
But I got three million yen.

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,750
That's quite the difference,
despite them both being newbies.

309
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,375
Well, that's one more reason
to go for a major label!

310
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,708
A five?

311
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,958
That's so close!

312
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,375
Guess it's my turn again.

313
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,875
Let's see.

314
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,791
I got two 200,000 yen
for releasing a new volume.

315
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,416
It must be tough to work
for a minor label.

316
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,125
-[HARUTO] And it's my go.
-[TOKI snoring]

317
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,083
[HARUTO] Hey, someone said
they enjoyed my work.

318
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,333
I gain one happiness point.

319
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,083
And that ends round two.

320
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,958
My story creates a buzz,
so my popularity goes up a rank.

321
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,833
So what does it mean
when my popularity goes up?

322
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,791
[HARUTO] Apparently,
you can get more royalties

323
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,916
and extra bonuses
when you roll the die.

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,708
Huh. That sounds good.

325
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,458
I just made one million
because of reprints.

326
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
I failed to debut again.

327
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,583
Uhh.
Just 200,000 again.

328
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,750
Uploaded a novel online.

329
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,666
Nothing really happens.

330
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,125
Rejected again.

331
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,333
Rejected again!

332
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,916
Again.

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,291
Again!

334
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,500
Rejected... again.

335
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,958
Dude, give it up.

336
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,208
Go try the minor
or mid-level labels.

337
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,750
No way!

338
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,666
I'm sure if I don't give up,
my dreams will come true!

339
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,708
But you're letting everyone else
get way ahead of you here.

340
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,458
Like for example: Nayu,
how much money do you have?

341
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,416
Something like
20 million yen.

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
-[ITSUKI] Twenty mil?
-Major labels, man.

343
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,333
And all I've got is 300,000
from my side gig.

344
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,458
But you're still the most
popular one of us,

345
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
aren't you, Fuwa?

346
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,000
[MIYAKO] I guess each route
is a little different.

347
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,416
You don't earn much on
the internet novelist route,

348
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
but it's easy
to get popular.

349
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,666
You have a lot of money
and popularity at a major label,

350
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,583
but neither at a minor.

351
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,916
Yeah, sorry for being
such a winner.

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,541
But you'll get used to it.

353
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
[dice clatter]

354
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,583
Let's see.

355
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,958
I missed a deadline,
so I miss five turns,

356
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,541
and lose three happiness points?

357
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
Don't you think that's
a bit too harsh

358
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,041
for just missing a deadline?

359
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,500
[MIYAKO]
What do you mean "just"?

360
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,375
At major labels, publishing
gets really strict.

361
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,958
I've heard that if
you miss a deadline,

362
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,875
they might not let you release
a book for another year.

363
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,208
Well, good to know it's not all
sunshine and rainbows there.

364
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,958
I think I'll go for
a mid-level label now.

365
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,458
What ever happened
to following your dreams?

366
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,166
[ITSUKI]
Oh. Six.

367
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey.

368
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,875
I just got an offer
from a mid-level label.

369
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,250
[sighs]

370
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,958
Being a 'net novelist
is pretty comfortable.

371
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,291
But you know what?
I'm goin' for it.

372
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,375
My series is now an anime!

373
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,458
And I get two million yen,
too, yeah!

374
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,416
They're making my series
into a live-action movie!

375
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
And I get a million yen!

376
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,416
But I miss two turns and lose
three happiness points?

377
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,458
Wait, what's going on?

378
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,791
These stupid trolls
are flooding my blog!

379
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,666
If my popularity
is higher than six,

380
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,958
I lose three happiness points,
miss two turns,

381
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,458
and my popularity rank
drops by two?

382
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,291
What did I do to deserve
such a terrible fate?

383
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,625
Win a million betting on horses?

384
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,416
What does that have to do
with being a writer?

385
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,250
My editor lost my manuscript!

386
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,833
I miss two turns and lose
five happiness points?

387
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,083
[ITSUKI]
Oof.

388
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,833
That's pretty depressing.

389
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,416
[CHIHIRO] My media venture
falls through

390
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,333
because my editor screwed up.

391
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,791
Minus five happiness points.

392
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,041
Could you not, editor?

393
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,458
I kinda feel bad.

394
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,958
I know this is a game,

395
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,291
and you just drew a
completely random unlucky event,

396
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,291
but I'm still sorry
about your editor.

397
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,833
My anime was a failure.

398
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,291
Minus five happiness points.

399
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey look.
Just like me.

400
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
Looks like my publisher
got bought out.

401
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,541
And now I get to go
to a major label

402
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,500
and start a brand new story.

403
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,583
I'm not sure if this is
a good thing or a bad thing.

404
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
[CHIHIRO] Because
the protagonist of my book

405
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,208
didn't end up
with the heroine they wanted,

406
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,000
I ended up getting a stalker.

407
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,041
So I lose three turns and four
points from my happiness meter.

408
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,291
Geez, a stalker?

409
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,083
Does that kind of thing
actually happen?

410
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,000
[TOKI] And things
only got worse from there

411
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,958
for our band
of troubled writers.

412
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,208
Until...

413
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,041
Finally done!

414
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,833
[CHIHIRO]
I swear, I had no idea

415
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,458
want the readers wanted
from me after a while.

416
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,166
[HARUTO] I never should have
published my book.

417
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,416
I should have just treasured
my time on the internet scene.

418
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,583
[MIYAKO]
So who won this thing, anyway?

419
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,041
Didn't we say that the person

420
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,791
with the most
happiness points wins?

421
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,291
[MIYAKO] Wait,
everyone's in the negatives?

422
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,458
[CHIHIRO]
Makes sense.

423
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,000
Most of the events
took points away.

424
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
I barely remember
anything positive.

425
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,166
Yeah, and since
Itsuki took forever to debut,

426
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,750
he just didn't have
as many chances

427
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,500
for anything bad
to happen to him.

428
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,625
I know I won the game
and everything,

429
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,875
but I don't feel good.

430
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
And this game is...

431
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,875
Yeah.

432
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,541
It's pretty damn realistic.

433
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
I hate to say it,

434
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,125
but I have seen most of
the game's events happen.

435
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,375
What? That's crazy!

436
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,500
Is the life of a writer
really this bad?

437
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,166
Yeah. It's not exactly easy to
be happy with a job like this.

438
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,916
[MIYAKO]
It sounds so hard.

439
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
Well...

440
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,833
we wouldn't still be here
if it wasn't fun, too.

441
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,291
You've got such a good attitude,
Itsuki!

442
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,875
Get off me, Kanikou!

443
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,250
[NAYUTA] Nope!
I'm gonna get even closer!

444
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,625
I'm gonna crawl in your mouth,
so open up!

445
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,958
[laughs]

446
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,166
Well, this is my stop.

447
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,458
I'll see you all later.

448
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,833
-Bye! Get home safe!
-See you around!

449
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,125
[joyful squeals, laughter]

450
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,083
Sorry, you guys.

451
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,416
Go on without me!

452
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,333
[MIYAKO]
Um, Mr. Toki?

453
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,416
Yes?

454
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,666
Could you tell me more

455
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,125
about what it's like
to be an editor sometime?

456
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,833
I'd love to learn about it.

457
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,083
Yeah, sure, no problem.

458
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,333
You thinking about
being one yourself?

459
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,416
Yes.

460
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,916
Okay.

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
Then want to work
part-time at our office?

462
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,291
Yeah!

463
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,500
[giggling]

464
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,875
Out of everyone
in the whole world,

465
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,000
Itsuki loves me!

466
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,708
And that's a fact!

467
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,208
He just needs to become
a protagonist like me.

468
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,958
I don't know what that'll mean,

469
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,625
since he's always been the best
writer in the universe to me.

470
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,083
I guess I'll just have
to keep inspiring him.

471
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,583
I don't want to lose.

472
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,458
At all.

473
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,708
[MAN 1] What?
You're seriously buying that?

474
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,583
Wasn't the anime terrible,
though?

475
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,000
[MAN 2]
That anime never happened!

476
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,916
But, dude, the novels
still kick ass.

477
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,708
I gotta try harder.

478
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,375
[fast typing]

479
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,583
Huh?

480
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,958
"Mahou Academy"'s
gonna be an anime?

481
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,291
Seriously?
This is real right now?

482
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,208
-[TOKI] Yeah.
-Hell, yes!

483
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,458
My time has finally come!

484
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,333
[TOKI] Let me tell you
the whole story first.

485
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,041
This opportunity only came up

486
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,541
because another
anime project fell through.

487
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,416
So basically,
you're the replacement.

488
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,083
There's really
no time or budget,

489
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,250
and frankly, the chances of it
being a success are low.

490
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,500
Plus, the whole thing with Fuwa.

491
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,500
So do you wanna do this?

492
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,458
I do.

493
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,125
[TOKI]
You sure?

494
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,166
You can't know how things'll
turn out if you don't try.

495
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,541
So you bet your ass
I'm gonna try.

496
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,291
What I said sounded cool
and all, but...

497
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,250
No, it'll be okay.

498
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,708
I can get through this.

499
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,375
After all, I don't
have a little sister.

500
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,625
And as long as I have
this yearning for one,

501
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,583
I can keep going forever!

502
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,958
Yeah.

503
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,875
Now let's do this!

504
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,875
[typing]

505
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,250
I have to tell Itsuki the truth!
