1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,000
[groans]

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,208
[groans]

3
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,166
[groans]

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,125
All right, why are you groaning?

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,875
Are you stuck
on your manuscript again?

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,041
What do you mean
am I stuck again?

7
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,208
And what's stressing me out
isn't the actual story

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,541
but the summary.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, so then
you've finished writing

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,916
volume five
of "Mahou Academy"?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,583
Congrats.

12
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,041
Save your praise.
I'm only halfway through.

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,458
What? Only halfway?

14
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,208
Doesn't it go on sale
next month?

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,708
Why are you writing the summary

16
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,250
if you haven't finished
the book?

17
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,916
[ITSUKI] They use it
on my publisher's websites

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,666
and for bookstore announcements.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,833
[CHIHIRO] But you already know
what's going to happen, right?

20
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,416
It can't be that hard
to write a summary

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,625
of those events,
can it?

22
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,000
I've got the overall idea, yeah.

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,541
But I can't be
a hundred percent sure

24
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,750
that what I write
will follow that.

25
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,875
Judging from
previous experience, it won't.

26
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,458
How can you write a summary
of a story that's not written?

27
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,416
Now do you see
why I'm groaning?

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,250
I have to capture
the reader's attention

29
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,791
by writing something intriguing

30
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,208
while simultaneously not giving
any plot points away

31
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,500
and do it in a very
limited amount of space.

32
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,875
I'm used to free-form writing,
not following all these rules.

33
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,125
Then there's the fact
I don't know

34
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,333
how things will play out.

35
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,833
[CHIHIRO]
You realize that not knowing

36
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,375
what's going to happen
in your own story

37
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,333
is your fault, right?

38
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,666
[groans]
There's no choice!

39
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,416
I'll just have to B-S my way
through it like I always do!

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,583
Did you just say "like always"?

41
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,458
I don't understand
the writing business sometimes.

42
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,958
[NARRATOR]
A few days have passed

43
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,791
since our heroes'
most recent shocking event.

44
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,750
Sieg and Hilde
have finally been able

45
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,458
to return to
their peaceful academy life.

46
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,416
But one day,
they receive terrifying news

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,666
that may change
their lives forever.

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,833
The siblings vow to uncover
the truth behind this news

49
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,125
with the help
of their closest comrades,

50
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,291
Nobushige and Yuuna.

51
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,625
Together, the four set off

52
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,958
with a particular destination
in mind,

53
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,166
only to find that
they may have been dragged

54
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,916
into an unimaginable incident.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,125
There is a distinct possibility
that a secret

56
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,833
at Vlad Magic Academy
may be revealed soon, as well.

57
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,500
And I just can't shake
the feeling

58
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,875
that there might be
a big change

59
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,416
occurring between
our beloved heroic siblings.

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,833
The super popular
little sister academy

61
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,833
battle love comedy continues!

62
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,625
You'll never guess what could
happen in volume five.

63
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,125
And you won't have to,

64
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,083
when it soon hits the shelves
of a store near you!

65
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,333
[HARUTO] I brought you
some special chocolate.

66
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,750
Hmm? Give me one reason
why I should accept

67
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,708
special chocolate from you.

68
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,708
Look.

69
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,208
It's beer?

70
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,166
[HARUTO]
Yup, Valentine's Day beer.

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
Hence, special.

72
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,416
[ITSUKI]
Then there's chocolate in it?

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,041
Nah. But they replicate
the smell of chocolate

74
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,500
using roasted malt.

75
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,125
So basically, it's a stout.

76
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,791
The kind of stout they only make
at this time of year.

77
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,500
And it's damn good.

78
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,208
Want some?

79
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:55,958
I...

80
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,041
Yeah, I guess.

81
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,250
[HARUTO laughs]

82
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,333
Just look at that covetous face.

83
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,958
You're a dirty boy, aren't you?

84
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,291
[ITSUKI] What are you
talkin' about, man?

85
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,666
It sounded okay,
but I don't need it.

86
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,500
There's no reason to hold back.

87
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,791
You yearn for it so badly
you can't contain yourself.

88
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,291
You want this hard black bottle
to pour some thick,

89
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,166
hearty liquid down
your throat, don't you?

90
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,875
Uh... What?

91
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,416
Don't put words in my mouth.

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,916
Come on. Beg for it.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,125
You know you want to.

94
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,291
Begging you would be way
too embarrassing.

95
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,250
What the hell is this?

96
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,208
[HARUTO]
I'm practicing being a dom.

97
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,750
I thought my female fans
would like this kind of thing.

98
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,500
Gotta say, watching you tease
Itsuki like that was pretty hot.

99
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,208
I maintain there was
nothing weird going on,

100
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,791
and he was just
offering me a drink.

101
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,708
[MIYAKO]
Wow, it smells really good.

102
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,625
I agree, so can I have some?

103
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,666
You know the rules.
Stick to root beer, kid.

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,250
Okay, okay.

105
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,041
[MIYAKO] Wow. So, you actually
have some on you?

106
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,416
Oh, yeah! Ever since
finding it in Okinawa,

107
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,125
I can't get enough
of this stuff!

108
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,583
Boy, it's got
quite the strong smell.

109
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,041
Sure does!
That's the best part!

110
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,416
You guys ready to find out
if this is any good?

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,958
[HARUTO]
Oh, no, hold up a sec.

112
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,833
Huh?

113
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,083
Gotta take a couple pics.

114
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,791
[camera shutter clicking]

115
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,916
[ALL laughing]

116
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,166
[ITSUKI] Trying to show off
your gay appeal again?

117
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,083
[HARUTO] Trying?
More like succeeding.

118
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,750
I've been getting
boat loads of new fans,

119
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,166
so I figure I'll stick
with this routine

120
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,583
until the anime's over.

121
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,916
[MIYAKO]
Must be weird working

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,458
with a whole new demographic.

123
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,250
Now you've gotta juggle novel
and anime fans.

124
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,875
That reminds me, I heard
you declined all anime,

125
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,208
live-action, and movie offers
so far, Nayu.

126
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,916
Wow, you did?

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,458
And that's not a joke.

128
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,500
Miss Nayuta Kani is
the top-selling author

129
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,458
at our publisher.

130
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,833
Yeah?

131
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,375
Why'd you turn them down?

132
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,916
Because if I took one of them,

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,583
I'd end up working a ton more.

134
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,750
I barely have enough time
with Itsuki as it is.

135
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,125
I don't want to throw away days
I could see him.

136
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,125
Yeah, doing an anime adaptation,
like, triples your workload.

137
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,791
There's a meeting every week,

138
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,958
you gotta write side stories
to bundle with the Blu-rays.

139
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,750
And you have
to supervise it all.

140
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,333
As soon as we're wrapped,
I'm gonna need

141
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,291
some serious
tabletop RPG time.

142
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,500
[sighs]

143
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,291
Just like back
when I was in school.

144
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,166
Well, do your best, bud.

145
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't drop dead from overwork.

146
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,250
This taste's more like coffee
than chocolate.

147
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,500
Better get something sweet
to pair it with.

148
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
-[NAYUTA giggles]
-Hmm?

149
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,708
If that's not a sign
telling me to whip out

150
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,125
my Valentine's Day chocolate,
I don't know what is.

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
There had better not be
anything weird in them.

152
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,958
I bought them from a store
so don't worry.

153
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,166
Though I did originally plan
to make some of my own

154
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,000
and put a few
secret ingredients in them,

155
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,666
but Myaa vetoed that idea.

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,333
Is anyone here surprised?

157
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,958
Not at all.
Thank you for your service.

158
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,333
Hey. Would it kill you
to treat them like a gift

159
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,791
and not like a snack?

160
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,666
Here. Your obligatory
chocolate, Itsuki.

161
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,958
And some for you too, Fuwa.

162
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,708
Oh. That's very nice
of you. Thanks!

163
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,333
[MIYAKO]
This beef stew is delicious!

164
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,125
How is the meat so tender?

165
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,791
[ITSUKI]
It's just leftovers from what

166
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,041
Chihiro made last night.

167
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,291
And it tastes
even better with age.

168
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,625
[HARUTO] Every time
I have Chihiro's cooking,

169
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,083
it blows me away.

170
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,083
I wish I could trade
my little sister in for him.

171
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,833
Oh. So good!

172
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,166
I'm lucky to have such a
talented future brother-in-law.

173
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,875
I swear, he could serve this in
a fancy restaurant if he wanted.

174
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,458
If I'm not mistaken, he added
chocolate to the recipe somehow.

175
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,375
I think he said the polyphenols
would do something to the meat?

176
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,375
[doorbell rings]

177
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,458
Huh?

178
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,333
[ITSUKI whimpering]

179
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,083
It's my editor! Run!

180
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,625
Oh, how nice.

181
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,291
Glad you're having a good time.

182
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,416
Uh...

183
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,791
-And you seem a little worn out.
-[door closes]

184
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,083
That's because I had to go
to Hokkaido to find Puriketsu.

185
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,000
I locked him in a hotel there
for a week

186
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,083
so he would finish
his illustrations.

187
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,750
That doesn't sound
especially legal.

188
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
Now I'm back for you!

189
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,500
I'm sure you're aware that we're
well past your deadline, yes?

190
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,125
And I'm sure you're aware
what will happen

191
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,625
if you cause
any more delays, yes?

192
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,750
Uh, yes.

193
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,708
Hey, Kani, Fuwa, sorry about
the unwelcome intrusion.

194
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,083
And I don't believe we've met.

195
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,416
What's your name?

196
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,833
Oh. I'm Shirakawa.

197
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,458
I went to college with Itsuki.

198
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,875
That so?

199
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,000
Then I'm your old classmate's
editor, Toki.

200
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,291
It's a pleasure.

201
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,666
So, what do you want
from me?

202
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,125
I'm not done
with the manuscript.

203
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,333
Don't take that tone with me.

204
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,708
Uh, whatever.

205
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,958
Your readers sent over
some chocolate.

206
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,166
-Sweet.
-Guess I was right

207
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,833
to bring Fuwa's along, too.

208
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,250
Oh!
[laughing]

209
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,208
How does it feel to be
so severely beaten, Haruto?

210
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,625
It feels fine?

211
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,041
Hasn't Fuwa's series sold

212
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,833
more copies
than yours though?

213
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,791
Yeah, but Itsuki's got
a lot of female fans

214
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,000
to get chocolate from.

215
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,291
[laughs]

216
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,750
That's it, give me your energy,
my fans!

217
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,041
I'm so popular right now,

218
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,583
I feel like
I could save the world!

219
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,125
If we're being honest,
they actually like the persona

220
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,125
you've built yourself,
not the real you.

221
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,750
Yeah, you better believe it!

222
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,541
After all, I'm the only one
in the whole world

223
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,000
who loves Itsuki
for his true, perverted self.

224
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,958
[clears throat]
Say what you will, losers.

225
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,666
It doesn't bother me.

226
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,083
Now then, I shall feast upon
the offerings awarded to me

227
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,125
by my leagues
of devout followers!

228
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,625
See, that's how I was hoping
you'd treat my chocolate.

229
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,625
[chuckles]

230
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,083
[chuckles]

231
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
[laughs]

232
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,041
Let this be a reminder
of how many people

233
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,416
are looking forward
to the rest of your story.

234
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Don't you dare let
them down, okay?

235
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,333
Yeah, I know.

236
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,291
Oh, it's you, Miyako.

237
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,083
Sorry, but I'm expecting
a guest today,

238
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,083
so I can't hang out.

239
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,250
Your editor I met the other day?

240
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,125
No, a tax accountant.

241
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,500
Accountant?

242
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
As an author,
I'm essentially self-employed.

243
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,500
So around this time of year,
I do my final return

244
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,083
so I can get
some of my taxes back.

245
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,166
Get some of it back?

246
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,958
What does that mean?

247
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,583
[ITSUKI] So I get paid royalties
from my publisher, right?

248
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,041
Well, before that happens,

249
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,500
a percentage
of what I would be paid

250
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,166
is withheld for taxes.

251
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,458
But in most cases,
you withhold too much.

252
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,166
So when you declare
your actual earnings

253
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,541
in your final return,

254
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
the amount you overpaid
in taxes

255
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,041
come back to you.

256
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,375
Oh, wow.

257
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
I guess you really are
a functioning adult.

258
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,500
I take offense to your surprise.

259
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,708
So what's this accountant like?

260
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,708
I haven't met them yet.

261
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,583
Though Haruto says
they're really reliable

262
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,083
and experienced with clients
in the publishing business.

263
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,666
[MIYAKO]
Interesting.

264
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,416
Well, good luck dealing
with all your taxes then!

265
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,041
-Oh, and your manuscript.
-Uhh!

266
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,750
[doorbell rings]

267
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,291
Just a second.

268
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,208
You're Itsuki Hashima,
I presume?

269
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,833
Uh, yeah, that's me.

270
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,125
And, uh...

271
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,291
I'm guessing that makes you
my accountant?

272
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,166
Yes, I'm Ashley Ono.

273
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,458
Nice to meet you.

274
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,250
Yeah. It's nice
to meet you too.

275
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,083
Hmm.

276
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,875
Uhh.

277
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,708
You keep this place
pretty clean,

278
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,208
considering you're young
and single.

279
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,625
Well, that's enough chit-chat.

280
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,000
To begin, I'm going to need

281
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,083
to see your payment records

282
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,208
from your publisher.

283
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,416
Yeah. Sure.

284
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,750
Uh...

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,250
Huh?

286
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,500
You might want to sit down.

287
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,708
This could take a while.

288
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,458
Okay.

289
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,416
Huh.

290
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,708
You've already taken
the time to sort

291
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,916
all of your receipts by month.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,625
You're more organized
than I expected.

293
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,333
Uh, thanks, I guess.

294
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,083
Now let's see.

295
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,750
Are you registered
at this address?

296
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,250
[ITSUKI]
No, still at my parents'.

297
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,166
Good, that'll work
to our advantage.

298
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,541
Let's treat this as your office

299
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
and count the rent
as an expense.

300
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,708
Have a car?

301
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,916
I don't. Not yet.

302
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,291
You should buy
some expensive import one.

303
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,333
That doesn't seem necessary.

304
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,916
Well, I was kidding.

305
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,458
But I do think
you should spend

306
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,208
a little bit more money.

307
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,541
Unlike other freelance jobs,
authors don't have

308
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,500
as many necessary expenses
to write off

309
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,416
[ITSUKI]
For most self-employed jobs,

310
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,125
you have to pay
for tools and materials

311
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,375
to get your work done.

312
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,500
But authors don't have most

313
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,791
of those expenses.

314
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,375
In fact, there aren't
many other jobs

315
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,666
that cost as little
as being an author does.

316
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,958
There's very little
upfront investment.

317
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,791
The more things you buy,
the more things

318
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,208
I can potentially turn
into a tax write-off.

319
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,291
And that's basically how we
accountants prove our worth.

320
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,000
I trust you've written off
those books?

321
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,166
[ITSUKI]
Yeah.

322
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,375
What about
the other paraphernalia

323
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,333
in this room?

324
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,750
Not really, just the stuff

325
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
I bought specifically
for research.

326
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,666
Oh my.

327
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,708
So you're a good boy then.

328
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,250
There's nothing I love more
than leading good little boys

329
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,750
like you down
the path of evil.

330
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
Wha...

331
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,583
Oh, nothing.

332
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,416
I took the liberty
of doing some research

333
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,208
on your various works.

334
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,500
It seems you're fond
of little sisters.

335
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,041
No, I love them!

336
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,083
Huh.

337
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,791
Well, I believe I've seen
this one somewhere before.

338
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,875
She's the main heroine
of "Oreimo"

339
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,833
and the protagonist's
little sister, Kirino Kousaka.

340
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,791
I'm impressed her influence
has spread far enough

341
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,291
that an accountant
would know her.

342
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,208
And who are these two
scantily-clad young ladies?

343
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,833
The main heroines of "Haganai:
I Don't Have Many Friends,"

344
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,916
Kobato Hasegawa
and Maria Takayama,

345
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,458
both amazing little sisters.

346
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,791
[ASHLEY]
They're the leads?

347
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,833
You'd think the author

348
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,291
is infatuated with young girls.

349
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,916
Yeah, he totally is.

350
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,541
What about the girl
on the left?

351
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,291
The main heroine and resident
little sister

352
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,958
of "Oregairu,"
Komachi Hikigaya!

353
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,666
[ASHLEY]
I'm sensing a pattern here.

354
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,375
I take it all of the figures

355
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,250
you have displayed here
are little sisters?

356
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,125
-Yes.
-That's good.

357
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,375
Then we have plenty of reason

358
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,041
to count them
as research materials.

359
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,750
What? No!
I bought those solely

360
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,916
so I could admire their beauty

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,916
from the comfort
of my own home!

362
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,583
I refuse to categorize them

363
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,166
in such a disrespectful way!

364
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,000
Research materials it is.

365
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,291
No! I just can't!

366
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,458
Sweetie, do you want me
to maximize

367
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,625
your tax return or not?

368
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,500
Yes, I do. But...

369
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,500
I cannot sully the beauty
of the little sisters!

370
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,250
If you let me count them
as expenses,

371
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,083
you'll be able to buy
new little sister figures

372
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,750
with the money you get back.

373
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,708
These figures have and always
will be research materials.

374
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,291
Thank you for showing me
the light.

375
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,833
[giggles]

376
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,875
You mean showing you
the darkness.

377
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh, I see you have
a lot of games, as well.

378
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,291
I'm not sure I understand
the title of this one.

379
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,375
So... what kind of game

380
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,000
is "Little Sister in Love
with Big Brother

381
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,833
and Masturbates daily
Wearing his Undies"?

382
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,791
That right there is a game
where the little sister

383
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,166
is in love
with her big brother

384
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,333
and masturbates every day

385
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,458
wearing her
big brother's undies.

386
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,291
And this one?
"We're Related,

387
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,625
"We Can't Do Such Things!

388
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,458
"The Beautiful Sister Wife
Getting Absorbed

389
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,083
in a Forbidden Relationship."

390
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,333
What's it about?

391
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,333
To put it simply,
it's about a sister wife

392
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,041
who gets absorbed
in a forbidden relationship.

393
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,000
And just what is
a sister wife?

394
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,208
Someone's little sister who is
also their wife obviously!

395
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,375
Well, that seems
rather complicated.

396
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,958
Let's see.

397
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,791
"Big Brother's
Counter Attack.

398
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,458
"One Year since
Little Sister Was Killed

399
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,916
by a Giant Ant Eater."

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,583
That game was a waste of money.

401
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,833
The sister wasn't even in it.

402
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,125
Of course she wasn't.

403
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,375
The title says
she's already dead.

404
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,875
So what's "Fuck-a-Sis?"

405
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,250
It's a game where you fuck
your little sister.

406
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,833
The ending moved me to tears.

407
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,166
[ASHLEY] And "It's Not Strange
for a Little Sister

408
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,875
to Eat Big Bro's Poop, Right?"?

409
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,125
Well, was it strange?

410
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,708
Yes, that's why I liked it.

411
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,750
Looks like you spend the
majority of your money online.

412
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,333
I assume these four-hundred

413
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,750
to six-hundred yen purchases
are digital books?

414
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,958
Yeah, most things
in that price range are.

415
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,500
And here we have
subscription fees

416
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,166
for some streaming sites.

417
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,458
Is that music?

418
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,625
Yeah. Something like that.

419
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,875
What about these
ten-thousand yen charges?

420
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,208
What are they?

421
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,958
Well, other than music,

422
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,833
I might have bought some
magic gems here and there.

423
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,041
And what are those?

424
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,666
It's a currency
to buy loot boxes

425
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,000
on a social network game.

426
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:26,958
Oh.

427
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,375
All right, and what kind of game
are you using those on?

428
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
"Legion of Little Sisters."

429
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,666
If that title
is anything to go by,

430
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,666
I know just what kind
of game it is.

431
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,458
It's pretty much exactly
what you think.

432
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,375
Wait, so can we write off
the gems, too?

433
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Well, that's the plan,
but we can only do so

434
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,666
if you're using it
for your work.

435
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,291
What if it's not for work?

436
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,291
Then you're going
to make it for work.

437
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,250
What? How?

438
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,125
Just have the protagonist
say this in your new volume.

439
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,833
[ASHLEY/SIEG] The odds of me
getting out of this alive

440
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,208
are slim to none.

441
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,791
[SIEG] The chances
are comparable to pulling

442
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,875
an ultra-rare item
from a loot box!

443
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,416
[ASHLEY] You change
the character so he's hooked

444
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,083
on social network games.

445
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,500
[ITSUKI]
I can't do that!

446
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,791
Then it doesn't have to be
the main character.

447
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,666
I believe in my research
I found that there is

448
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,583
a reoccurring villain
who's out to get him?

449
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,875
[CHROM]
Little sisters are nothing more

450
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,541
than a means to an end.

451
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,916
The only things I take seriously
are fighting you

452
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,541
and buying loot boxes
in social network games.

453
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,541
We're ruining established
characterization either way

454
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,000
and making him a joke
of a villain in the process!

455
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,333
Even the hero looks stupid

456
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,291
taking a guy like that
so seriously!

457
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,541
Ruining characterization
a little bit won't hurt.

458
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,708
[ITSUKI]
Yes, it will!

459
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,083
Which is more important,

460
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,083
your tax return
or how perfect your work is?

461
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,166
Obviously how perfect
my work is!

462
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,958
Oh, give me a break.

463
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,500
You authors are all the same.

464
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,041
[ITSUKI grunts]

465
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,291
We're both just looking out
for our livelihoods here.

466
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,666
You leave me with no choice.

467
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,375
I'll have to work my magic

468
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,583
and figure out another reason

469
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,083
to write this game of yours off.

470
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,916
Why were we even arguing
if you could always do that?

471
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,041
I'm so exhausted.

472
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,125
I still don't understand
why she made me give

473
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,708
detailed explanations
of adult games and videos.

474
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,166
Wait a minute, did she do that
so she could laugh at me?

475
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,750
-Hey, Haruto?
-Hmm?

476
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,625
What was with that
sadistic accountant?

477
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,250
[laughs]
She gets the job done.

478
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,833
[sighs]
I guess.

479
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,875
I mean, my refund will be
three times more than last year.

480
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,041
[HARUTO]
Exactly.

481
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,208
[doorbell rings]

482
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,250
-Hmm?
-Uh?

483
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,291
There we go.

484
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,333
Someone's here?

485
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,500
You have a meeting or something?

486
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,458
Not quite.

487
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,708
[HARUTO]
Huh?

488
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,166
[gasping]

489
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,875
I was just stopping by
to return Itsuki's receipts

490
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,500
and give him
a copy of his paperwork.

491
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,875
[giggles]

492
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,708
But I wasn't expecting
to see you here, Haruto.

493
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,500
I wasn't expecting
to see you either!

494
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,166
I haven't forgotten
how much fun we had together

495
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,958
doing your taxes last year.

496
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,583
I have to admit,
I had a little fun

497
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,125
on the side
with Itsuki's as well.

498
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,833
But that was nothing
when compared to yours.

499
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,000
What the hell did she do
to you, man?

500
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,541
She made me explain the plots
of adult games and risque manga.

501
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,125
I feel for you, dude.
She did the same thing to me.

502
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,708
[ASHLEY]
Well, Haruto was different.

503
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,416
The collection
he has is remarkable.

504
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,791
He must have had at least
one hundred naughty games

505
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,000
hidden in his room.

506
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,291
From one man to another,

507
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,541
you're gonna chafe yourself.

508
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,875
What? No, I won't!

509
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,000
It's all just for research,
I swear!

510
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,375
[giggles]

511
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
Apparently, your buddy
Haruto here loves maids.

512
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,791
Especially the submissive types

513
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,541
that secretly and gently support
their master from afar.

514
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,708
Playing their role,
yet yearning for affection.

515
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,333
Come to think of it,
you do have a lot

516
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,583
of that character archetype
in your stories.

517
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,375
And somehow they always end up
in maid outfits.

518
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,000
Well. It's, like,
every man's dream

519
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,041
to have a gentle girl
devote herself to him.

520
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,166
I'm just giving my readers
what they want.

521
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,833
But what you like
the most is

522
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,791
taking those gentle girls
who devote themselves to you

523
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,041
and thrusting your desires
upon them.

524
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,541
Showering them in your "love,"

525
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,291
if you know what I mean.
[giggles]

526
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,541
That is so not true!
She speaks lies!

527
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,333
What was it, "Top-Heavy Maid,
Bound and Sticky Four"?

528
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,625
Then there's "Master,
Up My Ass Please,

529
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,291
The Innocent Female Slave,
Genuine Love Edition."

530
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,125
Then "I'll Make You Suck It."

531
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,083
And worth noting is that
the limited edition

532
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,416
includes a download patch code

533
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,208
with maid outfit
pose illustrations,

534
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,208
and you bought it.

535
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,500
Like I said, it's all just
for research, I promise you!

536
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,250
[ITSUKI] And what could
an author like you

537
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,208
possibly learn
from illustration gallery D-L-C?

538
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,166
Don't think I've forgotten
a single thing from last time.

539
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,875
The day you spent hours reciting

540
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,791
every filthy detail
of your collection

541
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,625
was one of the best days
of my life.

542
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,541
[HARUTO] I could never go
through that humiliation again.

543
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,291
Would you still say that
if I told you

544
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,875
I'd put a maid outfit on
next time?

545
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,041
Huh!

546
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,250
I'd be sure to answer
your every beck and call, too.

547
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,291
Fuck me up, Master.

548
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,291
Why do I get the feeling
you just imagined me

549
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,916
in some naughty situation?

550
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,333
I-- I did no such thing.

551
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,791
Oh, but I don't mind.

552
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,791
There's no reason to deny it.

553
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,166
Aah!

554
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,333
[ASHLEY] You imagined me
down on the floor

555
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,625
with my outfit
slowly coming undone.

556
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,583
The image of an innocent,
fair maiden

557
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,333
drove you wild with desire.

558
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,833
Isn't that right?

559
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,291
You're an earnest boy,

560
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,458
so of course
you feel some guilt.

561
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,291
But you just can't stop
your novelist imagination

562
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,041
from picturing
every possibility.

563
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,916
And from this moment forward,

564
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
every morning when you wake up,

565
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,666
you're going to imagine me
in the same position.

566
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,166
And despite being plagued
by such guilt,

567
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,291
there's nothing
you can do but satisfy

568
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,291
the physical needs
these thoughts evoke in you,

569
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,625
hating yourself all the while.

570
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,416
Every single day.

571
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,833
Without fail.

572
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,250
[HARUTO]
I wouldn't do such a...

573
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,291
Such a wonderful expression,
Haruto.

574
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,875
It thrills me beyond words
when I see that trembling face.

575
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,083
What am I watching here?
Some kind of kinky roleplay?

576
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,958
-Itsuki, my dear.
-Uhh...

577
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,333
You'll use me again next year,
won't you?

578
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,416
Uh, yeah,
that was the plan, at least.

579
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,750
[giggles]

580
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,291
That's a good boy.

581
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,166
As a reward,
how about I call you,

582
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,750
big brother?

583
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,000
-Hmm?
-That get you going?

584
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,458
You serious?

585
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,791
No way.

586
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,333
[ASHLEY]
As much as I'd like to play

587
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,208
with you two
for a little while longer,

588
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,208
sadly, I have
somewhere else to be.

589
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,666
Oh, what a shame.

590
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,291
Thanks for bringing
the paperwork.

591
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,416
Welcome.

592
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,416
Take this info
on hometown taxes.

593
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,625
A few recommended
donation sites are listed

594
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,541
so take a look
if you're interested.

595
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,916
Thanks.

596
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,458
And for the record,
I like to go for the sake.

597
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,458
I do hope you'll call me
back next year.

598
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,583
Big Bro.

599
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,625
[ITSUKI]
Yes, ma'am!

600
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,000
All right!

601
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,916
Big bro's gonna donate
to a local government

602
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,333
that'll give him sake in return
for his adorable little sister!

603
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,416
Whoa, snap out of it, man!

604
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,458
I know she looks young,
but she's actually 32!

605
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,500
You know what that means?
She's an old hag!

606
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,041
You fool!

607
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,833
Age has nothing to do
with being a little sister!

608
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,708
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

609
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,250
Authors are always
such fun to play with.

610
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,666
I hope you'll entertain me
next time, too.

611
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,166
