1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,291
Does Miyako have...

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,541
a boyfriend or what?

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,958
Huh?

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,500
So, you got a thing for her?

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,458
Well, I--
I don't know, man. Maybe.

6
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,000
Uhh.

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,458
Can you blame me?
She's a really nice girl.

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,625
Isn't she?

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,791
Yeah, she's pretty cool.

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,541
A boyfriend though.

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,541
Wouldn't be surprised
if she had one.

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,791
-What you doing with your phone?
-One sec.

13
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,083
There, I just asked her.

14
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,208
Uh-- Dude, what?

15
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,083
That's way too upfront!

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,000
You want to know,
so I'm finding out.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,458
Are you sure it isn't weird?

18
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,583
[phone chimes]

19
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,583
Huh?

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,958
What the...

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,541
He's asking if I'm taken?
Is he interested in me?

22
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,750
That doesn't make sense.
He likes Nayu.

23
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,750
Uhh.

24
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,958
What does this mean?

25
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,583
[phone vibrates]

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,333
Uh, she already texted back.

27
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,125
[phone chimes]

28
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,708
[MIYAKO]
"Don't worry about it."

29
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,333
Are you kidding me?

30
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,583
[grunts]

31
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,583
Yes! I'm so gonna
ask her out soon.

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,250
And if she says yes,
I'll be back on the upswing.

33
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
You're certainly
passionate about this.

34
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,166
Just optimistic.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,583
I'm at rock bottom
'cause of my anime.

36
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,708
So, I've got nowhere else
to go but up.

37
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,750
I understand.

38
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,416
You want a wingman?

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,333
[ITSUKI]
Why did I say that?

40
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,750
I don't even know
what a wingman does!

41
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,416
Oh, by the way, Itsuki.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,875
Yeah?

43
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,958
I've been thinking about
throwing a surprise party.

44
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,375
A party for who?

45
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,625
Myaa! Her birthday is
on April 29th,

46
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,958
and that's coming up
a lot sooner than I realized!

47
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,958
[chuckles]

48
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,166
Oh!

49
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,000
And I assume
you want to use my place?

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,166
Yup.

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,375
A birthday party.

52
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,000
That might be a chance
for Haruto to make his move.

53
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,458
-Let's do it.
-[chuckles]

54
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,750
I'll tell Haruto
and Chihiro too.

55
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,791
Now I just need
to find a gift.

56
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,125
I'm gonna need your advice
for this one. Got it!

57
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625
Why are you asking me?

58
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,166
[NAYUTA]
I never had any friends

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,583
to celebrate birthdays with,

60
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,791
so I wouldn't know what to get.

61
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,125
Oh. Right, I forgot.

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,333
But, you know, I didn't
have friends either.

63
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,666
Yeah, but you write rom-coms,

64
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
so you should have
some experience.

65
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,500
That's a completely
different beast.

66
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,125
My characters are
so easy to please,

67
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,250
they'd be happy if the hero
gave them anything,

68
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,958
even if it's literally crap.

69
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,250
How should I know
what girls really want?

70
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,416
For the record, I'd be happy
to get literal crap

71
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,833
as long as it's from you.

72
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
Whatever, if anyone
gives you crap

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
as a gift,
that means they hate you.

74
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,583
[NAYUTA]
You wouldn't be like "Whoa,

75
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,250
"she's happy with me
giving her crap?

76
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,458
She must really love me!"?

77
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,583
[giggles]

78
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,125
-Admit it, you would be.
-No!

79
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,500
Okay, well, what if she was
a little sister?

80
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,333
How dare you! I would
never give a little sister crap!

81
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,583
[sighs]

82
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,250
Now if a little sister
gifted me crap,

83
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,250
that's different.

84
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,791
Why the hell
are we talking about crap

85
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,500
when we're trying
to eat brown food?

86
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,500
Probably because
you brought it up?

87
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,666
Sorry about that.

88
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,500
-[typing]
-[sighs]

89
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,333
What to get, what to get.

90
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,708
Thinkin' hard over there?

91
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,083
Oh, yeah!

92
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,041
I want to get her something
that she'll love!

93
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,666
You really do care
for Miyako, don't you?

94
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,791
[chuckles]

95
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,208
Well, yeah, I love her.

96
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,291
I've been meaning to ask you
about that, actually.

97
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,916
Is there a reason
you're so clingy with her?

98
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,125
Myaa's just a sweet girl.

99
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,125
She lets me rely on her
and always looks out for me.

100
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,666
And she's the kind of person

101
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,083
who'll cry
or get angry for my sake.

102
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,958
She's like an older sister
that way.

103
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,625
She's being such
a little sister right now!

104
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,083
You okay?

105
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,833
Uh? Yeah, I'm fine!

106
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,375
Now what were we talking about?

107
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,333
Right, a present.

108
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,333
Uhh.

109
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
[ITSUKI]
Hmm.

110
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,000
She has lots of friends
buying her presents.

111
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,875
Maybe get her something
they won't think of.

112
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,666
Like her favorite
author's autograph?

113
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,166
That's a good idea!

114
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,458
Do you happen to know
who that is?

115
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,500
Maybe I know them!

116
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,791
Sorry, no clue.

117
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,625
Hmm. Not to worry.

118
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,583
This is what
we've got technology for.

119
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,458
[phone chimes]

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,625
Hmm?

121
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,291
Favorite author?

122
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
Umm.

123
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,166
It's a little awkward getting
this from an author friend.

124
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,750
But I guess it has to be him,

125
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,208
even though
I can't always keep up

126
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,791
with everything in his plots.

127
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,958
[NAYUTA]
Hmm.

128
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,333
I got a response, and apparently
her favorite author is you.

129
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,458
What?

130
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,166
Oh. So, she's a fan
of mine, huh?

131
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,333
What was she doing
hiding it this whole time?

132
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,666
[chuckles]

133
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,541
She said that's only
if she had to choose.

134
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,041
What's wrong, Kanikou?
Are you jealous?

135
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,083
No, I'm not. I'm far from it.

136
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,583
I'm sure she likes
your stuff just fine.

137
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,125
Now, down to business.

138
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,833
This autograph isn't about
to write itself!

139
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, everybody.

140
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,000
-[popping]
-[screams]

141
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,083
[ALL]
Happy birthday!

142
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,958
I bet you assumed
we all forgot, huh, Myaa?

143
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,750
So did we surprise you?

144
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,458
Yeah. Very much so.

145
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,708
Can't ask for
a better outcome than that!

146
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,750
[MIYAKO]
Thanks, Nayu.

147
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,500
[NAYUTA crying]

148
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,500
[MIYAKO]
Uh! Is something wrong?

149
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, no, there's nothing
wrong at all!

150
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,375
Happy birthday, Miyako.

151
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,291
Come check out all the food!

152
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,083
[MIYAKO] Did you make
all of this, Chihiro?

153
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,291
[CHIHIRO chuckles]
Yeah.

154
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,541
Wow.

155
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,625
You're surprisingly good
at girly stuff.

156
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,875
What do you mean?
I'm not girly at all!

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,583
[NAYUTA]
And this one's from me!

158
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,625
[MIYAKO]
Thank you!

159
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh. Should I open it?

160
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,958
Sure.

161
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,875
[MIYAKO]
Huh?

162
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,291
It's an SD card?

163
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,375
What's on it?

164
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,916
Oh, just a novel.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,166
Wait, really?

166
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,000
Duh! And you're
the main character!

167
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,833
-I wrote it especially for you.
-Huh?

168
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,750
No way!

169
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,041
You wrote a story

170
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,750
where I'm the main character?

171
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,458
Better keep that away
from our editors.

172
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,625
They'd do anything to get it.

173
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,708
When you're done,
I have to read it!

174
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,125
That's out of the question.

175
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,625
I wrote that story for her eyes

176
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,083
and her eyes alone.

177
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,000
[grunts]

178
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,833
Thanks a lot, Nayu.

179
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm really excited to read it.

180
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,791
Great!

181
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,916
[giggles]

182
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,000
By the way, Myaa.
I gotta ask.

183
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,041
How does it feel
to be 21 now?

184
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,250
How does it feel?
Let me think.

185
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,500
I thought I'd feel more grown up
by 21, but I don't.

186
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,666
You know what I mean?

187
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,041
-Ah, right!
-[sighs] I totally do.

188
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,041
I felt the exact same way
back when I was your age.

189
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,541
Yeah, me, too.

190
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,083
I'm surprised to hear that
from you, Fuwa.

191
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,750
Well, I still read books
and play games every day.

192
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,083
It doesn't feel
all that different

193
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,666
from when I was in school.

194
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,916
Sure, but you're not
in school anymore.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,750
You and Itsuki are independent,
working adults.

196
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,125
Compared to you,
I'm still far behind.

197
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,333
You okay?

198
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,291
You know, when I was younger,
I thought

199
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,250
being this age meant you were
just automatically mature.

200
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,333
Like I'd already have
a goal for my future.

201
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,541
And I'd be working hard
towards it.

202
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:27,208
And... I'd be in love,
living happily ever after.

203
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,583
What do you mean?
You're a sophisticated woman

204
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,750
who's had plenty
of relationships!

205
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,208
I'm sorry, but that was a lie.

206
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,208
What?

207
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,416
What I said about
my past relationships.

208
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,333
If I'm being honest, I've never
been on a real date before.

209
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,458
Huh?

210
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,791
[MIYAKO]
The truth is...

211
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,333
I'm actually not this mature,
experienced woman

212
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,916
that you want me to be.

213
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,291
Oh, Myaa.

214
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,750
I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

215
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,250
Do you hate me now?

216
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,000
Mmm, no! of course not.
I could never hate you!

217
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,291
Nayu!

218
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,916
I don't love you
because of your experience

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,250
or because you're mature,

220
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,166
even though I still believe
that you are.

221
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,625
It's because
you're a good person.

222
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,750
[sniffles]
Nayu.

223
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,416
Whether you've been
with ten guys or zero,

224
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,208
you'll always be
my deeply beloved big sister.

225
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,416
Nayu. Nayu!

226
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,166
[sobbing]

227
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,625
Oh, you!
You're such a little sweetheart!

228
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,125
And I love you too!

229
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,958
[sobbing continues]

230
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,875
I could almost kiss you!

231
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,333
Hey, you can if you want.

232
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,041
What?

233
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,833
I'm saying I wouldn't mind
if you kissed me.

234
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,916
It wouldn't be that big a deal.

235
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, I won't.

236
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,708
But only because
your lips belong to Itsuki.

237
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,875
[giggles]

238
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,375
That's a good reason.

239
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,416
And no one thought to ask
my opinion about this?

240
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,416
[exhales]

241
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,625
Huh?

242
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,958
Hmm.

243
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:13,833
Hmm?

244
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,291
[touchpad clicking]

245
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,458
[heroic music playing]

246
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,125
[heroic music continues]

247
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,125
I love you...

248
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,166
Princess.

249
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,125
And I you, Ikki.

250
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,750
Whoa, wait,
this is a dirty novel!

251
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,333
Not to mention
the knight's appearance

252
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,416
is clearly just Itsuki!

253
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,041
[groans]

254
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,500
Huh?

255
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,625
[heroic music continues]

256
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,500
[moans loudly]

257
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,333
[MIYAKO]
Universe!

258
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,708
[MIYAKO]
I'm blown away.

259
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,166
It's not entirely fantasy
or smut

260
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,791
but sort of a mythology.

261
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,041
Either way, I couldn't stop
reading it for a second.

262
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,666
Uh...

263
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,333
[birds chirping]

264
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,125
Nayu really is amazing.
Isn't she?

265
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,750
I thought I'd feel more grown up
by 21, but I don't.

266
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,333
Could I ever become like them?

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,166
[ITSUKI typing]

268
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,458
-Hey.
-[ITSUKI] Hmm?

269
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,416
Do you remember
a couple weeks ago

270
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,916
when you said
you'd help me with something?

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,375
[ITSUKI]
Oh, you mean Miyako?

272
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,708
Uh-huh. That.

273
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,458
[ITSUKI]
Yeah, what about it?

274
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,833
I was kinda counting
on you, wingman.

275
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:24,916
[ITSUKI]
What?

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,666
You know,
at the birthday party?

277
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,375
I thought you might try
and find some way

278
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,250
to nonchalantly help
a brother out.

279
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,208
[typing stops]

280
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,166
[ITSUKI]
I forgot.

281
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,666
[groans]
Yeah, that's what I figured.

282
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,791
Even Nayu did better than me.

283
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,666
Her and Miyako almost made out.

284
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,791
Not that I would have complained
if I actually got to see that.

285
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,333
[ITSUKI]
Well, tell you what.

286
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,416
I'll help you out
next time for sure.

287
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
Cool. Counting on you, buddy.

288
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,750
[ITSUKI]
Yup. On that subject...

289
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,500
how exactly do you
want me to help?

290
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,125
Just so I'm clear.

291
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,791
What? I don't know.

292
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,666
I figured you'd come up
with something, Captain Rom-Com.

293
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,875
I swear, none of you know
what a romantic comedy is.

294
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,583
[exhales deeply]

295
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,541
How about this?
Let's go to an amusement park.

296
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,416
Okay, why there?

297
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,041
The volume I'm on has a scene
that takes place at one,

298
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,958
so I wanna go for research.

299
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,541
We can invite Miyako and Kanikou
and make it a group thing.

300
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,166
Oh, I get you! You're settin' up
a double date for us.

301
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,833
-Nice!
-It's not a date, dude!

302
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,833
I-- I'm just trying to write
a better story here.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,458
[PEOPLE chattering]

304
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,250
[groans]

305
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,833
So busy.

306
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,750
It's Golden Week.
What do you expect?

307
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,916
I'm so stupid!
How did I forget that?

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,583
-Don't worry, I did too.
-It happens.

309
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,916
When you make your own hours,
the days blend together.

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,458
I'll never get you writers.

311
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,500
[exclaims excitedly]

312
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,333
You sure look excited.

313
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,791
I'm super excited!

314
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,125
I haven't been
to a place like this

315
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,416
since I was a little kid!

316
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,083
You haven't? Really?

317
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,583
Then why don't you look around
and pick

318
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,791
what we're all gonna do first?

319
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,666
Uh... always the generous one?

320
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,833
Let's see.

321
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,416
"High speeds exceeding
300 kilometers per hour.

322
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,708
A blood-pumping race
filled with spills and thrills."

323
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,208
[grunts]

324
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,625
Are we sure we want to go
on this one first, Kanikou?

325
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,375
What? Don't tell me you can't
handle a little thrill ride.

326
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,791
It's not that. I've just
never been on one before.

327
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,000
I was little when my family
took me to one of these places.

328
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,083
Oh, you're just
like me, then! Ha!

329
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,541
Our first time will be together!

330
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,458
[ITSUKI]
I don't know if we're talking

331
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,708
about the same thing here!

332
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,000
But wouldn't it be a lot better

333
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,500
if we started on a calmer ride?

334
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,208
You are not winning
this fight, man.

335
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,375
I don't like these rides
very much, either.

336
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,166
But she wants to ride it,
so here I am.

337
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,333
-[NAYUTA laughing]
-[groans]

338
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,000
Here we go!
Isn't this exciting?

339
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,375
I've made peace with my death.
Let's do this.

340
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,750
I'm getting butterflies
in my stomach.

341
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,083
Yeah, I hear you. I've had
that feeling all day long.

342

[steady beeping]

343
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,291
[NAYUTA]
Oh!

344
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,875
Wasn't that so much fun?

345
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,625
It went in circles
and then went whoosh

346
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,041
and then sped up
and went bwam

347
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,291
and then dropped us!

348
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,583
Can you tell I loved it?

349
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,125
Hell, yeah!

350
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,625
I especially liked that part
where it rattled a ton,

351
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,208
then went bam
and flew off!

352
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,708
It was, like,
the best thing ever!

353
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,041
[NAYUTA chuckles]

354
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, it was
pretty damn intense.

355
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,208
Sure was. I might have
thrown up in my mouth a little.

356
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,041
Okay, which ride
should we go on next?

357
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,333
-There's lots to choose from!
-Doesn't matter!

358
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,208
We'll ride 'em all eventually,
so who cares?

359
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,750
All right! That's what
I like to hear!

360
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,833
You've joined
the thrill-seeking dark side!

361
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,166
What's wrong, Haruto?

362
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,666
The lines are only
getting longer.

363
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,916
Wait. Why don't we
take it easy after that one?

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,125
Yeah. I'd appreciate that.

365
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,750
All right, fine, you two.

366
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,750
Since both of you insist,
we can go on a calmer one next.

367
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,208
[BOTH laughing]

368
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,791
-[MIYAKO screaming]
-[HARUTO whimpering]

369
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,958
Think you can handle it?

370
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,250
For you, I'd handle
just about anything.

371
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,125
Miyako, you doin' okay?

372
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Really.

373
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,208
Just a little bit tired.

374
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,125
Hey, you're not the only one.

375
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,666
Uh, wanna take
a quick break, then?

376
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,583
[NAYUTA] You think this one
will live up to the hype?

377
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,500
[ITSUKI]
Hopefully.

378
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,166
[HARUTO]
Here you go.

379
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,166
Uh! Awesome. Thanks so much!

380
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,250
Uh! Huh?

381
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,333
Ah! I, uh, take it this isn't

382
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,375
what you normally do
on your days off.

383
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,708
So what do you do?

384
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,458
Hmm?

385
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,500
I usually go shopping
or to karaoke with some friends.

386
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,833
That sounds fun.

387
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,750
And what about you?
What do you do?

388
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
I'm usually holed up
in my room

389
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,166
playing video games
or reading books.

390
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,125
Oh, right, you mentioned that.

391
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,333
-Still, I'm pretty surprised.
-Uh--

392
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,166
I always thought
you were the kind of guy

393
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,416
who goes out
every chance he gets.

394
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,166
Man, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

395
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,958
I've always been more
the indoor type.

396
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,083
You know what?
I have been staying in

397
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,375
and reading more often lately.

398
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,125
Ever since I met Itsuki.

399
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,250
Yeah?

400
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,416
Oh, that reminds me,
have you gotten around

401
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,541
to reading the story
that Nayu wrote?

402
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,833
Yeah, I have.

403
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,083
How was it?

404
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,541
It was great.
But more than anything,

405
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,833
it made me realize just
how good a writer Nayu is.

406
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,708
It almost feels wrong
to be hanging out

407
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,333
with her all the time now.

408
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,583
Wrong like how?

409
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe...

410
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,625
I feel like
she's wasting her time

411
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,791
with someone like me.

412
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,916
I don't know.

413
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,625
Or like
we don't really match up.

414
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,958
[HARUTO chuckles]
I think I know how you feel.

415
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,833
And take it from me,

416
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,833
you shouldn't worry
too much about it.

417
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,083
What makes you say that?

418
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,625
In my line of work,
I'm surrounded by all brands

419
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,916
of genius day in and day out.

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,916
If I kept worrying about how
I don't fit in, I'd go crazy.

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,791
That's why
I don't think about it.

422
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:35,916
[chuckles]

423
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,250
Yeah, I guess you're right.

424
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,000
Uh-- Yeah.

425
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,208
[sighs]

426
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,083
Now that we've gone
on all the rides...

427
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,291
Let's bring the day full circle
and go on the first one again!

428
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,541
Yeah, that'd be awesome!

429
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,041
[whimpers]
Sorry, but I still have

430
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,666
the taste of vomit in my mouth.

431
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,458
I'll pass too.
But you go have fun without us.

432
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,875
You're so hopeless.
Well, let's go, Kanikou.

433
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,125
Yeah!

434
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,208
Uh--

435
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,916
We'll be back in a bit, Myaa!

436
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,333
Cool. We'll be right here.

437
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,375
-Hey, stop pulling my arm!
-[NAYUTA giggles]

438
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,541
[NAYUTA]
I'm so excited!

439
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,750
[ITSUKI]
I know, I know.

440
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,208
[NAYUTA]
That part where it rattles

441
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,916
-then flies off is the best!
-[MIYAKO] Honestly,

442
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,708
they were made for each other.

443
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,708
Yeah.

444
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,791
They should
just go out already.

445
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,958
[HARUTO]
So that's how it is.

446
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,125
I had so much fun!
When are we going again?

447
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,041
Not on a holiday.
[chuckles]

448
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,583
So, you make any progress?

449
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,750
Hmm?

450
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,708
Haruto?

451
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,791
Sorry.

452
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,416
Nothing really happened.

453
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,250
Aww, man. You coward.

454
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,625
[HARUTO chuckles]

455
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,125
It's all right.

456
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,041
I'll just keep
doing things my way.

457
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:18,083
[wind whooshing]

458
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,208
So, uh, no need
to help anymore.

459
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,083
Huh?

460
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,583
Oh. Okay.

461
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,541
Yeah.

462
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,708
'Cause that wouldn't be fair
to anyone, would it?

463
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,250
Hmm?

464
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,500
Don't worry. It's nothing.

465
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:27,916
[PEOPLE chattering]

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,583
Hmm.

467
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,291
So, how is it?

468
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,916
[exhales]

469
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,208
[laughs]
I'll have to get

470
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,541
the original creator's
opinion on it.
