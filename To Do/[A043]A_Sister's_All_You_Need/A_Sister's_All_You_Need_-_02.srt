1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,916
[ITSUKI]
Hmm.

2
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,916
Hmm.

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,833
Hmm.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,250
That's not right.

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,125
I'm just trying to study
for a test,

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,125
but my school's library
is too crowded.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,208
So, I was hoping you'd let me
study here instead.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,083
I'm just trying to study
for a test,

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,083
but my school's library
is too crowded,

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,708
so I was really hoping
you'd let me study here instead.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,958
Okay!

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,791
[inhales deeply]

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,208
[NAYUTA] And what are you
doing here, Myaa?

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,208
Uh!

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,125
[high-pitched voice]
I won't tell, big brother.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,250
[normal voice]
Still not right.

17
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,583
[doorbell rings]

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,333
Oh. You're looking
for a place to study?

19
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,291
Must be tough being
a college student.

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,333
It's not easy. So, yeah.

21
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,708
[doorbell rings]

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,208
Hmm?

23
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,708
Maybe he's not home.

24
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,708
Hey! Turns out
the door was unlocked.

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,083
Don't just go in!

26
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,208
[high-pitched voice]
I'm embarrassed.

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,291
Could you turn off the lights?

28
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,875
[normal voice]
No. That's cute,

29
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,125
but I want Hilde
to be more true to herself.

30
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,166
I just want
to hold on to you

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,833
and never let you go!

32
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,875
[normal voice] No, she needs
to be even more straightforward!

33
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,416
[high-pitched voice] The truth
is that I love you, big brother!

34
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,541
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Hmm?

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,541
[laughing]

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,291
[screaming]

37
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,583
Well, what have we got here?

38
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,708
We've got nothing!

39
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,958
I promise I'm not insane,

40
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,875
I've got a good reason
to be doing this!

41
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,208
-I swear!
-Oh yeah, I know, don't worry.

42
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,958
You were just acting out a scene
in your novel. I get it.

43
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,333
What was that shriek?
Did you find Itsuki?

44
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,750
-[gasps]
-[ITSUKI screams]

45
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,791
Why are you naked, you pervert?

46
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,333
This is normal for authors!

47
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,666
He has to live the experience
to write about it!

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,166
If he doesn't, he can't paint

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,833
a convincing picture
for his readers!

50
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,875
It's research!

51
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,458
[MIYAKO]
So, he has to get naked?

52
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
[ITSUKI] Will you two get out
of my bathroom already?

53
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,166
[sighs]

54
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,708
Man, why can't I
figure this out?

55
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,458
[doorbell ringing]

56
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,791
What, did they forget something?

57
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,125
I heard you the first ti-- Huh?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,083
So, uh, dude why are you
dressed like that?

59
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,166
It's nothing weird, I swear!
Uh...

60
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,000
[giggling]

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,541
[sighs]
Well, seeing that

62
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,083
just ruined my day.

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,083
What? But you're in college.

64
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,625
Aren't there naked guys
just walking around everywhere?

65
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,916
You have a warped understanding
of education.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,291
Everything I've seen
on the internet

67
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,041
is all about drinking
your weight in liquor

68
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,666
and waking up
with a sticky face.

69
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,791
Not everything you see online
is true!

70
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,041
Fair enough. So, does that mean
you're a virgin?

71
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,291
Uh!

72
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,041
Of course I'm not a virgin.

73
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,750
I've had plenty of boyfriends,
so, you know...

74
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,500
Ah, I'm jealous.

75
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,208
You're so mature.

76
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,000
I wish I could do naughty things
with Itsuki all the time, too.

77
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,458
Wait, what-- Why--

78
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,041
The way you said that
makes it sound like

79
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,500
I do that stuff with him,
and you know I don't.

80
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,541
He's a former classmate,
and nothing more.

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,958
[NAYUTA] Oh yeah. You two went
to the same college.

82
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,625
How could I forget that?

83
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,625
[MIYAKO] He did quit
after about six months,

84
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,291
so I can't really blame you.

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,250
So, hey. Can you tell me
what he was like back then?

86
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,291
Hmm...

87
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,166
[yawning]

88
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,083
Tired today, are we?

89
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,500
Yeah, I got called in
in the last minute.

90
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,250
Barely slept at all.

91
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,541
I know that feeling.

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,750
My boyfriend
wouldn't let me rest

93
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,041
for a second last night.

94
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
Wouldn't let you rest?

95
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,500
Hmm?

96
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,625
Oh, that guy's
always off on his own,

97
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,958
typing up a storm.

98
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,666
[GIRL 2] Yeah, I think
his name's Hashima?

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,250
Kinda creepy.

100
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,000
[GIRL 1]
He can't have many friends.

101
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
[MIYAKO]
I got this sense that he had

102
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
something more important

103
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,875
than class,
goofing off, or work

104
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,708
that he was devoting
his time to.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,041
Something that I didn't have.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,708
He must've been writing
that novel every chance he got.

107
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,666
I swear, you could hear
the clicks of his keyboard

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
between every spoken word
in that room.

109
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,916
He'd go straight home
when class was over.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,041
And as far as I know,
never talked to anyone.

111
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,583
Sounds just like him.

112
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,208
[laughing]

113
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,666
Yeah, that sucks, man.

114
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,000
Please don't laugh.

115
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,250
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,958
Really though, Nayu's one thing.

117
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,958
But for Miyako
to see you like that?

118
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,041
You probably ruined
the poor girl's day.

119
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,458
[ITSUKI grunts]

120
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,541
Actually, how did the two of you

121
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,083
become friends, anyway?

122
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
At first glance,
you don't really seem

123
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,250
to have anything in common.

124
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
That's a good question.

125
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,000
[MIYAKO]
Hey, Hashima.

126
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,166
What are you always typing
on that laptop of yours?

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,166
Hmm? Uhh!

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,291
It's notes and stuff.

130
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,208
Oh, come on,
I won't tell anyone.

131
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm writing a novel.

132
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,333
Well, that makes sense.

133
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,958
I guess you want
to become a novelist

134
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,916
one day then, huh?

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,291
I don't want to become one.

136
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,583
I already am one.

137
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,916
Oh.

138
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,958
-So, I picked up your book.
-Hmm?

139
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,500
I read through it
yesterday after class.

140
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,916
You did?

141
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,875
Yes, but I can't say
I understood it.

142
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,333
Like, what exactly about kissing
his little sister

143
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,208
granted the guy
magic powers?

144
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,583
[scoffs]

145
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,125
Like my work is something
that a college chick

146
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,625
who can't keep her legs closed
could ever understand.

147
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

148
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,416
I've never even had a boyfriend.

149
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Besides, who in their right mind
would understand it?

150
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,250
It's crazy!

151
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,458
You can't honestly think

152
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,125
that this will connect
with readers.

153
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,291
Oh, I can't, can I?

154
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,291
You happened to have read
the second in a series.

155
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,333
The "Genesister of
the New World," volume two.

156
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
And it sold
one hundred thousand copies.

157
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
You're kidding me!
That garbage?

158
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,166
How dare you call
my masterpiece "garbage"?

159
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,125
Who are you to even say that?
You couldn't understand it!

160
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,000
"This will never connect
with your readers."

161
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,375
Connected with
a hundred thousand people

162
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,750
smarter than you.

163
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,416
Sorry that my work is
a little too advanced

164
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,833
for your reading comprehension.

165
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,875
Being an idiot isn't something
to be ashamed of.

166
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,583
But to ignore how stupid you are
and blame the world around you

167
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,541
because you can't
understand it is.

168
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,375
Why don't you just jump back
into the black hole

169
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,666
you crawled out of,
you dumbass tramp?

170
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
[thwack]

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,166
Uhh.

172
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,875
You-- You don't have
to be so mean!

173
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,833
You deserve
worse than that. Jerk!

174
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,958
[sobbing]

175
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,083
Wait. What? I...

176
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,916
I guess there might be
a slight possibility

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,333
that I went too far,

178
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,583
or maybe I said
something uncalled for there.

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,250
and it really pissed me off,

Will you get a clue?

I told you, I'm not easy,
and I'm not crying!

188
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,166
But you have tears
in your eyes--

I am not crying,
and I am not easy!

All right, all right,

You're not crying,

Man, this sucks so hard.

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,750
What if they think
I'm some weirdo now?

196

If it's any consolation,
you don't have to worry.

Everyone already thinks
you're a freak.

After that,
we just started talking.

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,625
I would borrow books
and video games from him,

202
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
and he'd ask me about fashion.

I just realized something that
I should have known long ago!

College was nothing
but a waste of time

for a popular top-ten

I could tell Itsuki believed

what he was saying
from the bottom of his heart.

217
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,125

his mind so quickly.

when that idiot friend of ours

suddenly dropped out of school.

229
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,125
I wish I'd gone to school
with Itsuki, too.

and think you're trying

to seduce voice actors
to be in your show.

into this, too!

my books to sell

of the person I am.

let you do that?

a scene about squeezing tatas.

And I gotta live it
to write about it.

May I remind you that you have

perfectly good breasts
of your own to grab?

00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,375
Yes, but the cup size
of the character in question

340
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,416
is just about
the same as yours.

341
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Did you think that
that would convince me?

Please!

get this over with.

Oh, I need them bare,
if you would.

348
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,708
And you conveniently forgot
to mention that until right now?

349
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,958
What if I said "pretty please"?
With sugar on top?

350
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,541
The next time I need a favor,
you had better say yes!

a good show, hot stuff.

00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,666
J-- Just for
a few seconds, okay.

356
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,500
And don't be too rough
on them either.

357
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,625
I humbly thank you
for this treat.

358
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,541
[moans]

359
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,166
Give it up!

360
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,791
I said I only wanna flirt
with little sisters, man!

361
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,291
And mark my words,

362
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,833
one day I shall create
the ultimate little sister!

363
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,583
I don't even know how to respond
to that at this point.

364
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,708
Like, I actually have
a little sister.

365
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,666
And let me tell you, they're not
as great as you make them seem.

366
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,750
All she does is complain
about every little thing I do.

367
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,375
Plus, she'll smack me
for nothing

368
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,708
and tell me my books
are gross or boring.

369
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,583
Then she gets on my case
about interviews,

370
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,375
because they're "inconvenient."

371
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,583
-It's depressing.
-Oh, whatever!

372
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,041
Don't compare
that piece of trash

373
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,166
in little sisters' clothing
to my little sister!

374
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,916
Whoa, damn, dude!

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,333
She may not be perfect,
but she's not that bad!

376
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,708
I'll have you know,
she used to be

377
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,666
as cute as a button
when she was little!

378
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
And the last time I got sick,

379
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,208
she even went out and bought
some gelatin for me.

380
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,083
Also, you don't even have
a little sister!

381
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,333
Yes, I do.

382
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,708
Huh?

383
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,375
For she lives in my heart!

384
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,041
-Okay.
-[CHIHIRO sighs]

385
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm done.

386
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,916
[MIYAKO giggles]

387
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,416
Interesting.

388
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,958
All right, I think
I've got my fill.

389
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,208
I should be able to write
a good scene now.

390
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,625
Good.

391
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,666
Glad I could be of assistance.

392
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,125
Now it's time to get
on that ass, girl!

393
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,291
[MIYAKO]
What?

394
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,208
[ITSUKI groans]

395
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
Chihiro.

396
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,750
Water.

397
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,916
Chihiro went home
a long time ago.

398
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,875
[sighs, groans]

399
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,125
Yo. Itsuki.

400
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,958
I don't wanna go.

401
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,166
Do you remember your own name?

402
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,875
You can't make... me.

403
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,250
[HARUTO]
And what's your address?

404
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,250
Where do you live?

405
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,791
Get outta here.

406
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,166
[chuckles]

407
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,375
All right.

408
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,291
[exhales sharply]

409
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,458
-[keyboard clacking]
-Hmm?

410
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,000
[MIYAKO] Itsuki and Nayu
are both working hard.

411
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,083
But what am I doing?

412
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,250
[yawns]

413
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,208
That's enough progress
for one sitting!

414
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,666
Glad it went smoothly.

415
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,875
[NAYUTA] It only went
so smooth because of you.

416
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,208
Thanks again for helping out
with my research.

417
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,541
Uh...
[chuckles]

418
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,250
You're welcome, I guess.

419
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,041
Well, it's getting late, so I
think I'm gonna head out now.

420
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,791
[ITSUKI] Besides,
I wouldn't want my books to sell

421
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,625
just because
of the person I am.

422
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,291
[mouse wheel clicking]

423
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,833
Just you watch.

424
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,875
[HARUTO] While you geniuses
are sitting at a standstill,

425
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,958
I'm going
to keep moving forward.

426
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
[door closes]

427
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,875
[HARUTO]
I'm home.

428
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,708
You're late again, big bro!

429
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,708
So?

430
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
Don't "so?" me.

431
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,250
How many times
do I have to tell you

432
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,166
to let me know
if you're going to be late?

433
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,916
Oh. Yeah, I forgot.

434
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
[grunts]

435
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,291
You never forget to make
your creepy social media posts.

436
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,000
It's part of my work.
I'm building a persona!

437
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,166
That's lame. Who would want
to read something like that?

438
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,416
There's plenty of female fans
who are into that kind of thing.

439
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,916
Okay, sure,

440
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,208
but aren't your books marketed
towards virgin guys?

441
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,250
What are you gonna do
with some more female fans?

442
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,583
So what? Because
it's marketed towards guys,

443
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,625
I'm not allowed to hear some
opinions from the other gender?

444
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,125
-[GIRL grunts]
-[HARUTO groans]

445
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,166
You're such a jerk!
And a pervert!

446
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,333
Go play one
of your raunchy games!

447
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,958
So, mind if I ask

448
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,000
how Kani's manuscript
is comin' along?

449
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,625
It's as perfect as usual.

450
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,333
I'm her editor, and I can't find
a single thing wrong.

451
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,666
Must be nice working
with someone that easy.

452
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,041
It would be, if she could just
figure out what a deadline is.

453
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,875
How's our favorite
little sister-obsessed author?

454
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Well, he's a handful,
like always.

455
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,500
Which reminds me,
I should call him.

456
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,458
-[phone buzzes]
-[ITSUKI snoring]

457
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,750
[ITSUKI] No matter
what you want in life,

458
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,041
there's always someone else
who already has it.

459
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,583
And unfortunately,

460
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,375
it usually means a whole lot
less to that someone.

461
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,125
It's nothing short of a miracle

462
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,750
when you do actually have
what you want.

463
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,083
And you can blame
the absence of this miracle

464
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,541
for most comedies.

465
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,583
And tragedies.

466
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,666
It may not be fair...

467
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,708
but that's just how
the world works.

468
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,291
-[phone buzzing]
-[ITSUKI snoring]

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,041
Yup?

470
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,291
[TOKI on phone]
Itsuki,

471
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,416
how's the progress
on your manuscript?

472
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,041
Uh, it's coming along fine.

473
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,500
[TOKI]
That better be the truth.

474
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,666
Yeah.

475
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,583
[ITSUKI grunts]

476
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,833
[groans loudly]

477
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,416
[ITSUKI]
I want a little sister!

-[CHIHIRO] Uh...
