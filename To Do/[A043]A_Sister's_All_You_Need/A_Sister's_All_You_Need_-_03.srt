1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,666
-Mmm.
-[page turns]

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,333
It is freezing in here.
What gives?

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,625
I know you've got a heater,
crank it up.

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,458
[ITSUKI]
Been broken since morning.

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,583
[sighs]

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,500
Just when I needed it most.

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,833
[MIYAKO]
When's it getting fixed?

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,375
Three days.

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,333
So for now we're getting by
with this kotatsu,

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,375
but it's pretty hard
to concentrate on work.

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,541
It sucks.

12
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,916
That's perfect!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,875
Huh?

14
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,375
How about something like this?

15
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,708
Hmm?

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,416
Uh... How could I forget
about such a classic?

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,833
Hey, it happens.

18
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,041
-Uhh...
-[ITSUKI chuckles]

19
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,916
You wanna go to the beach
in winter?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
Well, you see how good
this looks?

21
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,458
I bet the author went to a beach

22
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,125
in Okinawa for research.

23
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,875
-Oh.
-[line ringing]

24
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,791
[HARUTO on phone]
What's happenin', Itsuki?

25
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,958
Hey, Haruto.

26
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,250
Not much, not much.

27
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,208
Just thinkin' about taking
a little trip.

28
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,916
-Wanna come?
-[HARUTO] Huh? To where?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,458
Okinawa.

30
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,458
[HARUTO]
What?

31
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
Okinawa!

32
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,833
Ahh--

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,083
The temperature is
seventeen degrees Celsius.

34
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,166
It's almost like winter
doesn't exist here.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,541
Ah.

36
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
I'm beginning to suspect
that you actually wanted

37
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,833
to come here
to avoid three days

38
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,666
in that ice box
of an apartment.

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,958
And how did you convince me
to come with you, again?

40
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,500
Spend all your time complaining
and you won't have any fun.

41
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,916
Cheer up!

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,166
It would have been a waste
if you didn't come.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,250
The off-season makes it
cheap to book.

44
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,333
Just like how it's a waste
that Haruto didn't skip

45
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,291
his anime script meeting
to come, too.

46
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
[HARUTO]
Man, Okinawa.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,083
I'm jealous.

48
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,416
This beer is good on its own,
but pair it with goya champloo

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
and it's something else
entirely!

50
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,708
Yeah!

51
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,000
I was trying to imagine what
hibiscus beer would taste like,

52
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,333
but I was way off.

53
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,666
Turns out it's sweet,
tart, and delicious!

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,208
Hmm. I wanna have a taste, too.

55
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,125
No. The drinking age
is twenty, remember?

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,041
A couple more years and you can
retire your juice box, kid.

57
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,416
You know,
I might as well ask.

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,333
Is the fact that you see me
as a kid related

59
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,166
to why you don't see me
as a potential lover?

60
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,791
[spurts]
Uhh...

61
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,166
[coughing]

62
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,583
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
very well.

63
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,166
You're gonna have
to speak louder.

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,125
Yeah, you're fighting
an uphill battle

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,791
if you want to convince me
that you didn't hear that

66
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,708
when you literally did
a spit-take.

67
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,458
It's not my fault
you weren't loud enough.

68
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,083
Is the fact that you see me
as a kid related

69
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,625
to why you don't see me
as a potential lover?

70
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,000
Was that loud enough
or do you need a hearing aid?

71
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,458
I saw your mouth move
but nothing came out.

72
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,791
Maybe the music's too loud.

73
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,625
I'm going deaf over here.

74
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,541
-I love you, Itsuki.
-[MIYAKO giggles]

75
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,750
What a coincidence,
I love to ski too!

76
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,416
You wanna go out
with me sometime?

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,333
Go? We just got here!

78
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,083
-We could just bang.
-I don't know,

79
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
I've heard that
gangs can be pretty violent.

80
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,166
-You could fuck my face!
-[MIYAKO gasps]

81
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,375
[ITSUKI]
Pluck your bass?

82
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,791
I'm more of a guitar guy.

83
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,916
All right,
that one sucked, come on.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,583
Yeah, well so did that
confession four puns ago.

85
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,833
Hmm. So more romantic then?

86
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,416
You're as beautiful
as the moon!

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,625
Yeah, sure.

88
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,958
Hey. You know this.

89
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,958
It's Natsume Soseki's take
on "I love yo--"

90
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,291
Yes, I do.

91
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,583
It's a quote I recognize
and chose to ignore.

92
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,208
Ah, classic Itsuki.

93
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,541
And that's why I love you...

94
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,750
Boo? You're a ghost now,
I get it.

95
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,166
-[NAYUTA] Hmm.
-[groans]

96
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
I'm clearly running out
of ideas, can we stop?

97
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,083
Yeah, fine.

98
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,000
But only if you let me have
some of that beer.

99
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,000
[ITSUKI]
We already said no, but here.

100
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,833
-You can eat one of my eggs.
-[chuckles]

101
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
[eating noisily]

102
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,416
[MIYAKO]
Uhh...

103
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,291
I said "eat," not "fellate."

104
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,791
You dog. How can you
just shove your huevos

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,541
in an innocent girl's face
like that.

106
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,791
We really ought to do something

107
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,875
about these
extreme fetishes of yours.

108
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,250
I can't believe we bring you
out in public.

109
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,125
[keyboard clacking]

110
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,583
[knocking on door]

111
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,541
Hmm?

112
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,875
The convenience stores
in Okinawa are awesome.

113
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,083
You wouldn't believe
how many different varieties

114
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
of hard drinks there were.

115
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,708
Want some?

116
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,208
Just us?

117
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,625
Yeah, Nayu passed out
after bathing.

118
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,791
[ITSUKI]
Hmm.

119
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,375
How is it?

120
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,583
Not too bad.

121
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,375
Hey, Itsuki?

122
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,416
Hmm?

123
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,083
Question:

124
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,666
how do you feel about Nayu?

125
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,791
[ITSUKI]
She's a perv.

126
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,375
Well, yes, but that's not
what I meant.

127
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,583
She says she loves you
all the time.

128
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,958
So, like...

129
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,541
do you ever think about
going out with her?

130
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,750
There's not too much
to think about.

131
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,875
Especially when I gave her
a straight answer ages ago.

132
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,041
Turned her down, of course.

133
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,083
[gasps]
You did?

134
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,041
Back when?

135
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,666
To answer your question
from the other day,

136
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,583
sorry, but I can't
go out with you.

137
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,666
[gasps]

138
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,041
[sobbing softly]

139
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,541
The day after I rejected her,

140
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,750
she started paying me
regular visits.

141
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,958
And here we are.

142
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,041
Oh.

143
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,541
What's that look for?

144
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,000
Well...

145
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,833
until hearing
your side of the story,

146
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,458
I just assumed you were
a jerk leading her on.

147
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
I'm glad that's not the case.

148
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,041
I can't believe
you thought I'd do that.

149
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,000
So then is it safe to assume
that you don't have

150
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,791
any feelings for Nayu at all?

151
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,125
That's a silly question.

152
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,291
I'll tell you one thing,
it'd be a hell of a lot easier

153
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,625
if I didn't care
for her at all.

154
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,583
Yeah.

155
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,583
So have you ever read any
of Kanikou's books at all?

156
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,458
Not really.

157
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,833
If you don't have any plans

158
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,333
to become a novelist yourself,

159
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,708
you should
give 'em a chance.

160
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,250
Honestly, you're missin' out
on something good

161
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,416
if you don't.

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,125
I mean it.
If you can find the time

163
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,541
to read my stuff,

164
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,666
read hers instead.

165
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,125
It's a better use of your time.

166
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,625
[snoring]

167
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,625
You have been busy.

168
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,791
Haven't you?

169
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,750
[MIYAKO] So it sounds like
we're definitely hitting up

170
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,916
Shuri Castle
and Churaumi Aquarium,

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,666
but where else
do you two want to go?

172
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,166
-Deserted island.
-Huh?

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,875
Well, there's a part in my story

174
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,458
where the characters end up
on a deserted island.

175
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,666
So I'd like to do some research
for that while I'm here.

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,083
Hmm?

177
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
I don't know about deserted.

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,375
How about a remote one?

179
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,708
Uh!

180
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,166
Check please!

181
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,333
[NAYUTA]
The ocean!

182
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,625
[BOTH laughing]

183
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
Ooh, the water's so cold.

184
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,041
I don't care if it's cold. We're
here. We gotta go swimming!

185
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,625
[MIYAKO] How do we do that?
We don't even have swimsuits.

186
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,583
[NAYUTA] We don't need
no stupid swimsuits.

187
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,500
No one's here to see anyway.

188
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,833
Whoa, Nayu what are
you doing? Stop it!

189
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,166
Itsuki! Turn around
and don't look back!

190
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,333
[ITSUKI]
Splash!

191
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,125
Girl! Would you put
your clothes back on?

192
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,125
It's freezing.

193
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,125
Duh! We dipped our feet in it!

194
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,500
Actually, I'm starting
to get used to it.

195
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,791
Come on.
You're turn, hop in!

196
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,500
Stop splashing.
You're getting me wet!

197
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,083
Itsuki, get your butt
in the water!

198
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,333
Don't be stupid.

199
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,041
[laughing]

200
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,541
[MIYAKO[ I wonder if my world
will ever be radiant

201
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,208
and carefree like that.

202
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,541
Sorry, did you say
something, Myaa?

203
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,958
Oh, it was nothing.

204
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,208
Itsuki, I've still got
my eye on you.

205
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,416
I'll break your collarbone
if I catch you peeking!

206
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
[ITSUKI]
I'm good, thanks!

207
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,833
[shuddering]
It's so cold!

208
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,750
What's up?

209
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
[NAYUTA]
Well, I was just thinking.

210
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,458
It's not like it's
the first time I've noticed,

211
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,541
but your body is well-toned.

212
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,208
Did you used to play sports?

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,166
[MIYAKO]
I did karate from grade school

214
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,041
until halfway
through middle school.

215
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,291
Then played tennis,
and was on the basketball team

216
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,375
in high school.

217
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,083
Though I didn't really want to.

218
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,000
[GIRL] You'll never get popular
doing karate.

219
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,500
That's not exactly my priority.

220
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
And besides, my sensei told me
that I have a lot of potential.

221
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,250
Whoa. Then are you gonna try
for the Olympics or something?

222
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,375
I don't know
about going that far.

223
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,166
[GIRL] Then just join
the tennis club with me!

224
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,333
It'll be fun!

225
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
[MIYAKO] I wonder
what would have happened

226
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,291
if I had stuck with karate.

227
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,833
Maybe I would have been able
to make something of myself.

228
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,625
Or maybe
I would have just given up

229
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,041
at some point along the way

230
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,625
and ended up exactly
where I am now.

231
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey, that's cold!
Now you've done it!

232
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,750
[BOTH laughing]

233
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,208
[MIYAKO]
Take this!

234
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,208
Oh, man!

235
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,750
This is so crazy?

236
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,291
That's the sound
of my friends having fun

237
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,333
while I sit here
behind a rock.

238
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,791
[evil laughter]

239
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,541
I've captured
your little sister,

240
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,833
and now she's mine!

241
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,291
Oh!

242
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,750
Prepare... for your demise!

243
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,083
Huh?

244
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,250
Aah!
[crunch]

245
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,750
Megalodon!

246
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,291
[MEGALODON]
It's not like I was trying

247
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,666
to save you or anything.

248
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,375
[scoffs]
Stupid!

249
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,166
It's finally over, big bro.

250
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,750
Now we can get married.

251
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,041
You don't care
that I have sharkskin?

252
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,750
That's never been a problem.

253
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,041
Dude, whoa!

254
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,500
Whoa's right!

255
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,500
This is my new work,
inspired by the whale shark

256
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,291
that shook me
to the core in Okinawa.

257
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,166
Titled: "The Whale Shark's
Little Sister!"

258
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,375
Hell yeah!

259
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,500
This is seriously
some quality stuff!

260
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,708
[laughs]
See, you're a man of culture.

261
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,875
Unlike my editor, who skimmed
and rejected it on the spot.

262
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,500
[SETSUNA] Wait, but how do
their pieces fit together

263
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,541
when they're
from two different puzzles?

264
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,083
I saw a show
about salmon spawning,

265
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,291
and they just sprayed
their seed all over the eggs.

266
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,833
Which is not what we do.

267
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,583
Sharks may be fish, but their
eggs are internally fertilized.

268
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,166
So they've got
the right parts.

269
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,750
For real?
So shark dicks are a thing?

270
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,166
Uh-huh. And I've got it
all planned out.

271
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,666
In the final scene,
when the protagonist

272
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,791
and heroine get together,
it's a beautiful moment

273
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,041
that can only be conveyed
through the eyes of a shark.

274
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,833
Yet my editor refuses to push
the envelope a little.

275
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,375
Give me a second, I got to draw.

276
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,666
Wait, right now?

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
-Hmm.
-[pencil scratching]

278
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,750
What do you think about this?

279
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,041
Uh...

280
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,208
This looks...

281
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,041
I want some salmon roe.

282
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,666
What? Why's that?

283
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,375
We were just talking about
fish eggs and stuff, remember?

284
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,333
The topic must have
made me hungry, that's all.

285
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Okay, then go eat some.

286
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,625
Oh, you can't tell me
you don't wanna come too!

287
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,958
Hmm?

288
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,000
I thought we would just hit up

289
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
a conveyer belt
sushi place nearby.

290
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
And somehow, we're here.

291
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,333
[SETSUNA]
We wanted salmon roe,

292
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,875
and Hokkaido's got
the best there is!

293
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,500
[ITSUKI] Then explain to me
why we ended up

294
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,625
at a ramen place!

295
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,916
[SETSUNA]
As we were passing by,

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
I saw the ramen
and it so looked good,

297
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,750
my stomach changed its mind.

298
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,291
[ITSUKI sighs]
Whatever.

299
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,958
[slurping noisily]

300
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,208
[ITSUKI]
Okay, this is pretty good.

301
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,291
[SETSUNA]
Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,958
[ITSUKI] You know what?
On second thought,

303
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,333
we came all the way out here,

304
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,041
we might as well make
the most of it.

305
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,208
[wind howling]

306
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,208
[SETSUNA humming tune]

307
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,166
I can't feel my face.

308
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Hey, how much farther do we
have to walk to this hotel?

309
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,250
Hmm? I-I think
it's just up ahead.

310
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,541
I'm dreading
even having to ask this

311
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,291
but you do know
where the hotel is, right?

312
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,958
You worry too much!

313
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,041
I'm, like, seventy percent sure
it's in this direction.

314
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,541
Seventy?

315
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,875
We've got maps, you know.

316
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,916
Let me see.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,291
It's in the complete
opposite direction, you dumbass!

318
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,166
[snoring]

319
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,750
[SETSUNA]
Whoa!

320
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,041
Holy crap!

321
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,791
This seafood bowl is the best!

322
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,833
Damn right,
look at all that shrimp!

323
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,958
-Let's chow down!
-Let's chow down!

324
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,583
[eating noisily]

325
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
[ITSUKI chuckles]

326
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,625
There's more salmon roe
than there is rice!

327
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,833
This is ridiculous!

328
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,666
Talk about overkill!

329
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,916
I told you Hokkaido's
friggin' awesome!

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,833
Oh, no.

331
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,083
I guess eating half
your weight in sea urchin

332
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,583
and salmon roe
makes you sick.

333
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,250
I always heard that they put

334
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,041
shiso leaves
and pieces of ginger

335
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,208
on top of seafood bowls
to help with digestion

336
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,791
and ease your stomach.

337
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,750
But I had no idea of the pain
that protected me from.

338
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,333
I need a whole plant.

339
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,958
[sizzling]

340
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,583
We still have an hour to kill
before our flight boards.

341
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,500
Oh. That reminds me,

342
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,541
I think I've decided
to stay here for another week.

343
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,625
What?

344
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,708
I figured
I should take the time

345
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,041
to check out the Snow Festival,

346
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,250
since I'm already in town.

347
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,791
And you're just
telling me this now?

348
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,291
You're welcome to stay, too.

349
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,625
No, I think I've had
my fill of snowstorms.

350
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,458
See you later.

351
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,750
I'm gonna go cancel my flight

352
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,166
before it's too late.

353
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,125
I'll stop by
your apartment soon, cool?

354
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,291
Cool.

355
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,833
-[cell phone rings]
-Hmm?

356
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
-Yo.
-Itsuki?

357
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,041
If this is about
volume five's draft,

358
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,583
I haven't written it yet.

359
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,708
Don't sound so proud
of yourself.

360
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,416
And while that is a problem,
that's not why I'm calling.

361
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,666
-What, then?
-We're trying

362
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,250
to track down Puriketsu,
have you see him?

363
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,791
You're looking for Setsuna?
Yeah, I was just with him.

364
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,125
Why, is something wrong?

365
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,666
He hasn't sent us
his illustration

366
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,083
for this month's print.

367
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,083
At this rate, we're going
to miss the deadline.

368
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
For this month?
That's really bad.

369
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,708
Now tell me where he is.

370
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,583
When I find that brat
I'm gonna kill him,

371
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
but not before I get him
to finish this illustration.

372
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,541
Is that so?
Too bad he's gone.

373
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,208
You know that guy,
he just wanders off

374
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,458
and does whatever he wants.

375
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,791
[TOKI]
Non-stop service to Haneda?

376
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,791
Oh, no.

377
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,875
Itsuki,

378
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,625
where are you right now?

379
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,708
-Oh, just Hokkaido.
-What?

380
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,750
Ehh!

381
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,666
Sorry, Setsuna.

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,375
Try not to let him kill you.

383
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,666
[SETSUNA]
What gives?

384
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,916
Why won't you let me draw

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,583
the illustrations
for your new series?

386
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,000
I've done it before!

387
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,375
Because it's not worthy.

388
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,083
Why are you so full of yourself?

389
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,375
All of a sudden, my art
isn't good enough for you?

390
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,708
No, man!

391
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,916
The opposite.

392
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,625
Opposite?

393
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
The fact is,
this new series of mine

394
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,875
just isn't worthy
of your work.

395
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,625
Your art quality
vastly outweighs my story.

396
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,541
So until something changes,

397
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,916
I won't be able to partner up
with you again.

398
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,250
If that's the reason,
I don't mind so much.

399
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,375
Man, it's always fun
when this childish side of yours

400
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,708
comes out to play.

401
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,583
[ITSUKI]
I don't know when,

402
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,375
but someday I'll write
a series worthy of your art.

403
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,041
Wait for me until then, buddy.

404
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,750
[GIRL laughing]

405
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,833
[GIRL 1]
Take this!

406
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,083
[GIRL 2]
Oh, now you've done it!

407
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,416
Geez!

408
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,250
[thunder rumbling]

409
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,958
What the--

410
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,375
Whoa, the temperature dropped
so suddenly.

411
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,750
What's going on?

412
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,791
-[wind howling]
-[girls scream]

413
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,666
-Huh!
-Uh.

414
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,166
[BOY 1]
What is that?

415
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,791
Huh!

416
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,875
Hilde!

417
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,125
[BOY 2]
There's no doubt about it.

418
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,541
This was caused
by someone's magic!

419
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,625
[BOY 1]
I'm coming!

420
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,500
[BOY 2] Sieg, wait!

421
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,541
It's too dangerous!

422
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,666
[SIEG]
I'll be fine!

423
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,750
Some magic blizzard.

424
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,000
Could never hope to sever

425
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,125
the intense bond
between siblings!

426
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,625
Yep.
[grunts]

427
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,291
That's a realistic scene,
if I do say so myself.

428
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,625
Looks like my trips
to Okinawa and Hokkaido

429
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,166
were worth it after all!

430
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,500
Hmm?

431
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,125
I still can't believe
you went to Hokkaido

432
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,125
only two days
after you went to Okinawa.

433
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,750
You're so reckless
with your money.

434
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,333
I'm an author. The research
is worth every penny.

435
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,750
Whatever you say.

436
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,083
Looks great!

437
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,458
Take the first bite.

438
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,625
Whoa! I've never tasted
anything like this!

439
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,208
I'm glad
they're to your liking,

440
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,666
'cause I had to get
a little creative.

441
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,500
I used the chiraga
you got from Okinawa

442
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,875
and the crab you got
from Hokkaido.

443
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,208
Well, there you go.
That explains it.

444
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,625
The fat from the pork
and the juices from the crab

445
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,083
play well off each other.

446
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,375
And there's this
harmonious trio of texture.

447
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,666
The crispy wrapping,
the juicy, tender crab,

448
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,541
and the crunchy chiraga.

449
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,541
These ingredients
from north and south Japan

450
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,291
make this such a unique dish.

451
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,541
We've gotta think
of a name for it.

452
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,500
The South.
Down-South. Southern.

453
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,375
Wait, what about the North?
We need both.

454
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,708
The Southern Northern.

455
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,666
SouthNorth.

456
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,500
No, The NorthSouthern. Ehh.

457
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,625
"North and South
Spring Rolls" works.

458
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,125
Well, whatever they're called,
they're unusual.

459
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,125
[door opens]

460
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,250
[CHIHIRO]
I'm going now.

461
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,583
See you later!

462
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,916
[ITSUKI]
Later.

463
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,125
I wish that you'd come home

464
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,625
every once in a while, big bro.

465
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,625
Why would I do that?

466
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,875
[chuckles]

467
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,125
Oh, yeah.

468
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,500
Here, I bought some souvenirs
for the family.

469
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,791
Different chocolates
you can't get here.

470
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,458
[chuckles]

471
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,750
Thanks, this is
really thoughtful!

472
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,541
I'm sure Mom and Dad
will be ecstatic.

473
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, and you can have this too,
if you want.

474
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,208
Wow!

475
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,458
Thanks a bunch!

476
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,416
A whale shark.

477
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,916
Hey, now we have
matching phone straps!

478
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,541
[ITSUKI]
Yeah.

479
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,916
Be careful getting home.

480
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,833
[CHIHIRO]
I will. Goodnight!
