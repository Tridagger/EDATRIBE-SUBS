1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,166
[EMI] Weird.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,625
Seems a lot more
crowded than normal.

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,000
I was told today
was the first day

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,458
of a local star festival.

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,750
Perhaps that is the reason
all these people are here.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,666
Yeah, okay,
there's this huge crowd,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,291
but something's kinda odd.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,541
Look at the MgRonald's
we came all the way to see.

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,125
I mean, it's
practically deserted.

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,791
What is going on?

11
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,208
This is no place
for proper drama.

12
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,166
Without a busy restaurant,
how are we gonna make things

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,291
super awkward?

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,833
On top of that,
with no one around,

15
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,916
this jerk might get wise to
what's about to happen to him,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,375
which would defeat
the whole purpose.

17
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,250
[EMI groans]

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,541
Luckily,

19
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,375
the perfect place is
standing right over there!

20
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,708
SFC!

21
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,625
That's where we can
convene our council of war!

22
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,916
Rika's maybe enjoying
this a little too much.

23
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,416
[RIKA] First, you're gonna
have to confess everything

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,625
you might know, think, or
feel about this "Maou" guy.

25
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,583
That way, we can plan
the best course of action

26
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,875
in order to get
this battle finished!

27
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,250
[EMI] Given he's
the Devil and I'm a Hero.

28
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,583
I doubt our battle
will ever finish.

29
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,833
Also,

30
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,708
I'm still wondering how
Suzuno's gonna handle

31
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,708
Rika's misunderstanding.

32
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,333
Guess I'll just
have an iced coffee, please.

33
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,666
How 'bout you two?

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,708
I would like to order the
number eight combination:

35
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,000
a maple biscuit
with an iced tea.

36
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,125
Milk in the tea, please.

37
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,375
Iced coffee for me.

38
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,291
You got it, and consider
this my treat, ladies.

39
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,500
Um, so that's all.

40
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,041
Thank you kindly.

41
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,583
Allow me to present you with
a special Grand Opening coupon

42
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,291
for our guests
who come in today.

43
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,625
Oh, thank you.

44
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,333
[SARUE] And now, I shall
lovingly prepare your order.

45
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,833
Surely, your food and drinks
will appreciate being consumed

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,875
by such lovely maidens.

47
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,375
Your change, m'lady; don't
spend it all in one place.

48
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,875
[gasps]

49
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,000
Order up.

50
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,375
[SARUE] Apologies for the wait.

51
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,333
I have your order
for you right here, Miss.

52
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,541
And it was indeed a crime to
keep such a lovely lady waiting.

53
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,125
[RIKA] Yeah.

54
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,875
He's like one of those guys you
figure might be a good catch,

55
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,375
but then he's way more creepy
than even he realizes.

56
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,833
I mean, what are
those glasses about,

57
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,166
and all that cologne?

58
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,416
[EMI] You're not
making sense.

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,583
Sorry.

60
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,958
[RIKA] Never mind.
Let's go find a table.

61
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
Okay.

62
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,750
I think the best
place for us to start

63
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,583
is at the very
beginning, girls!

64
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,375
His name is
Sadao Maou, right?

65
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,666
Come on, don't hold
anything back, either of you.

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,541
I wanna know it all!

67
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,833
[EMI grumbles]

68
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,958
To me, he's my neighbor
at my new boarding house.

69
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,708
I can safely say he
is a good neighbor.

70
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,000
[EMI] Oy, this girl.

71
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,875
I want for you to
join me in my quest

72
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,791
to eliminate King Satan,
and then return home with me.

73
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,625
[EMI] All that, and now
he's a "good neighbor"?

74
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,875
Well, she's cool as a cucumber,
I'll give her that much.

75
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,083
[RIKA] And you, Emi?

76
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, I'd happily kill
him first chance I got

77
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,041
if that gives you a clue.

78
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
[RIKA] Conflicting opinions.

79
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,583
But you do have that tendency
to put up a front, Emi. Lots.

80
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,291
Look, Rika, I'm gonna
be perfectly frank;

81
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,041
there is nothing between Maou
and me and there never will be.

82
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,041
I have completely different
reasons for not wanting him

83
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,958
and Suzuno to be together,
so get it straight

84
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,916
and get it out of your
thick skull: we are not

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,083
fighting over him,
understood?

86
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541
Perfectly.

87
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,291
See, this is that front I
was just telling you about.

88
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,833
Why are you so set
on the two of us

89
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,791
being some sort
of item to begin with?

90
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,791
It seriously pisses me off!

91
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,625
That man is cruel, cagey,
greedy and insensitive.

92
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,583
He's beyond broke and acts
like you owe him for some

93
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,166
random umbrella and has no
common sense whatsoever!

94
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,458
[loud growl]

95
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,166
[ASHIYA] I would not say
such things if I were you!

96
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,333
Ashiya?

97
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,208
What are you doing here?

98
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,166
[MAOU] Ashiya sure is taking his
sweet time with his mission.

99
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,083
[ASHIYA] You want me
to exhaustively consume

100
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,875
all the fried chicken options
at this new "Sentucky" place?

101
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,666
Technically, it's not
just about eating.

102
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,250
[ASHIYA] It would be
one thing if you wanted me

103
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,083
to exhaustively consume
all the offerings of

104
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,875
the fried-food flash sale at the
supermarket near the station

105
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,750
where I can get
it for half off.

106
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,791
But, unfortunately,
our army does not have

107
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,833
the financial reserves
to contribute to the sales

108
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,291
of your present nemesis.

109
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,875
We cannot waste money on SFC!

110
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
[MAOU] Will you
just listen to me?

111
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,291
These methods are being
employed for a good reason.

112
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,708
To win the battle,
we must know our enemy.

113
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,416
Are you telling me my top
advisor has forgotten that?

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,708
I have not, Sire.

115
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,333
[MAOU] I'm not saying
to simply eat.

116
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,666
I want you to eat in an
exhaustive investigation

117
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,041
of their strengths, weaknesses,
and everything in between!

118
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,791
The expense is necessary
for my rise to power.

119
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,916
Help me.

120
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,250
Since you feel that
strongly about it, Sire,

121
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,750
far be it from me to refuse you,
or buckets and buckets

122
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,791
of fried chicken.

123
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,791
However!

124
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
I, Shiro Ashiya,
will make certain

125
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,708
my thoroughgoing
investigation employs

126
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,583
the minimum possible
expenditure.

127
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,375
[MAOU sobs] Ashiya!

128
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,250
[ASHIYA sobs] Sire!

129
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,583
You can count on me!

130
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,416
[MAOU sobs] Ashiya!

131
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,791
[URUSHIHARA] Gag me.

132
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,166
[MAOU] I know
I said "exhaustive,"

133
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,291
but he's taking too long!

134
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,541
[CHIHO] Mister Maou?

135
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,375
[MAOU] Hey, Chi.

136
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,583
What's up?

137
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,333
I just finished up all
of the chores on my list

138
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,125
for the day.

139
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:19,750
What next?

140
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,416
Oh. Yeah, right.

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,541
Let me think.

142
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,750
[MAOU] Wow; everyone
seems really bummed.

143
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,416
Well, I guess that's
not a huge surprise.

144
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,125
There's a pretty decent-sized
crowd having fun outside

145
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,541
thanks to the Star Festival.

146
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,541
But look how empty
our restaurant is compared

147
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,708
to that stupid SFC.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,250
What do I do?

149
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,416
I can't just keep
twiddling my thumbs!

150
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,833
So, y'think maybe we
should stand outside

151
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,208
and invite people to
eat over here instead?

152
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,666
[MAOU] Soliciting customers.

153
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,083
Could work.

154
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,250
But it might be better
to wait on intel from Ashiya.

155
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,125
The critical delivery
isn't here yet,

156
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,750
so how can we get
the public's attention?

157
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,666
Should I make a move now?

158
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,666
No.

159
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,666
I mustn't make a move now!

160
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,083
I can't predict
this battle at all.

161
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,833
I'm on the front lines
of a fast food war.

162
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,625
Why is it so complicated?

163
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,666
You okay, Maou?

164
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,166
We know you're Shift
Manager tonight,

165
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,333
but you don't have to take
care of everything yourself.

166
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,041
We can help.

167
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:15,916
[MAOU] That's right!

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,791
I command an entire army again!

169
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,708
If I show fear, unrest will
spread amongst my men!

170
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,750
Now is not
the time to act!

171
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,208
At the moment, the tides
are merely in their favor.

172
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,583
But worry not, those tides will
turn again, so we shall wait!

173
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,125
And in the meantime,

174
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,750
we will prepare for
our moment to shine.

175
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,875
[MAOU screams]
Polish the windows!

176
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,875
--[GROUP] Yes, sir!
--[KAWA-CCHI] What?! All that...

177
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,250
[MAOU] Please tides,
move quickly!

178
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,791
[EMI] You are the last person I
expected to see in this place.

179
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,000
And also, why the heck
were you hiding from us?

180
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,208
I wasn't hiding; I noticed
you when you came in,

181
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,291
and hoped to avoid
making a scene.

182
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,041
That said, I cannot allow you
to abuse the master of my house

183
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,416
in such a disrespectful manner.

184
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,708
It would stain my honor!

185
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,375
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,708
Oh, wait, you being here
is a perfect opportunity.

187
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,250
Ashiya, I need your
help real quick.

188
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,333
It's a matter of dignity--
yours and Maou's.

189
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,541
You what?

190
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,250
Why should I help you
with anything ever?

191
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,625
Like ever ever?

192
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,333
Okay, I'm sure you're here
to research this place.

193
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,333
You have to be.

194
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,625
You can get whatever
you want; on me.

195
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,458
[ASHIYA] Well,
if you insist.

196
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,041
[EMI] I swear, you must
be the greediest,

197
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,666
cheapest creature
in existence.

198
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,208
Don't get the
wrong idea, Hero;

199
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,125
I have a responsibility
to prioritize

200
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,875
the household budget
above all else.

201
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,250
And for that duty,
I shall bear any indignity;

202
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,000
I shall suffer any disgrace.

203
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,500
[EMI] You "shall" be an idiot.

204
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,333
[ASHIYA] At any rate,
due to budget constraints,

205
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,541
I was unable to research
salads and desserts.

206
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,041
With your help, I
shall be able to order

207
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:35,791
each one of them.

208
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,000
[RIKA] Um.

209
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,416
Help me out, Emi;
I'm a little lost.

210
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,750
Is he your friend?

211
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,708
--[ASHIYA] Absolutely not!
--[EMI] Absolutely not!

212
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,916
I don't know
who you are, Miss,

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,458
but in terms of this
group's relationships,

214
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,333
I am Miss Kamazuki's neighbor
and Emi Yusa's nothing.

215
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,958
Pleased to meet you,
I'm Shiro Ashiya.

216
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,958
[RIKA] Oh, nice
to meet you.

217
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,583
I'm one of
Emi's co-workers.

218
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,208
My name is
Rika Suzuki.

219
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,458
Hold on a sec, if you're
Suzuno's neighbor,

220
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,375
that means you live
with Sadao Maou, right?

221
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,750
Yes, that's right.

222
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,666
You have the pleasure of
knowing him, Miss Suzuki?

223
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,875
[RIKA] No; but I do wanna
know everything about him.

224
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,708
From the beginning?

225
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,291
No.

226
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,708
Not the sort of everything you
might be worried about, Ashiya.

227
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,916
It's fine.

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,541
Basically, this is about
a man Emi doesn't want

229
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,666
other girls getting close
to, so I wanna know why

230
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,666
and what makes him
such a bad catch.

231
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,166
[ASHIYA] I'm sorry, what is
she talking about exactly?

232
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,333
[EMI] I'm honestly not
so sure myself anymore.

233
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,250
[ASHIYA] So he's a man she
doesn't want other girls

234
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,708
getting close to, huh?

235
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,041
Interesting.

236
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,416
A matter of dignity indeed.

237
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,875
It seems you have let
the cat out of the bag, Hero.

238
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,250
Nice.

239
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,666
Well, the truth is, and
apologies, Miss Kamazuki,

240
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,916
I haven't told you this yet,
either, but Maou and I once ran

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,833
a very successful
company together.

242
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,541
[RIKA] What?

243
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,541
A company?

244
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,125
Um.

245
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,333
Ashiya?

246
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,125
You don't know what he's
talking about, do you?

247
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,958
That doesn't make sense,
you look a little young

248
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,666
to have run a business;
how old are you, anyway?

249
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,041
The main focus
of our company

250
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,166
was Real Estate Management,
with occasional forays

251
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,916
into Construction
and Odd Jobs.

252
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,625
But we discovered
our true passion was

253
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,083
in Personnel Placement.

254
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,833
We had such
a great name.

255
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,083
The Maou Syndicate.

256
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,125
[SUZUNO] Maou Syndicate?

257
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,958
[EMI] Personnel
placement, my butt.

258
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,416
[ASHIYA] And Miss Yusa?

259
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,958
She worked for a rival company.

260
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,250
Emi.

261
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,375
You had an actual career
in construction before?

262
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,041
So, then how old are you?

263
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,291
Um. It's kind of a
long story, I guess.

264
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,291
If I recall correctly,
you were just a temp

265
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,291
at the time.

266
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:20,708
Wha--?

267
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,833
I see.

268
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,458
So you're saying the
Hero is a temp worker.

269
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,250
Yeah, you are
not helping.

270
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,041
[ASHIYA] Though we had
our fingers in many pies,

271
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,708
we were still fairly small,
so management had to command

272
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,458
our teams on-site.

273
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:36,083
But Yusa had both skill and
the support of her own company.

274
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,166
More often than not,
she was the one competing

275
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,750
with us for clients.

276
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,666
We were all so young,
and all with the same

277
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,166
level of experience.

278
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,916
That was smack in the
middle of the recession, too.

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,083
Thus, with a major
firm taking business

280
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
out from under us.

281
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,458
Our little company went down
like a house of cards.

282
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,083
The last person to ever
battle us for a job was her.

283
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,583
We lost; and the
company went bankrupt.

284
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,000
We drifted; eventually
winding up in our small,

285
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,541
nondescript apartment.

286
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,875
Then, almost a year later,
we saw Miss Yusa again.

287
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:06,958
[EMI] It's them.

288
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,125
[ASHIYA] And that's it.

289
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,500
I imagine she has
complex feelings, too.

290
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,958
Her failed competitors
from the past.

291
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,875
She still manages to check in
on us every now and again.

292
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,125
I see.

293
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,416
But!

294
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,166
Maou has not given up
on his dream of running

295
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,958
a successful business.

296
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,208
Currently, he is working
intensely at MgRonald's

297
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,375
to learn all he can about
management from the ground up.

298
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,166
It only took him a year to
be appointed shift manager.

299
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,375
And now.

300
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,458
I am forced to play
housewife all day long.

301
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,041
Oh, how far I have fallen.

302
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,416
Yet still!

303
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,333
We intend to start
a brand new business

304
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,291
with Maou as Chairman very soon.

305
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,208
And I shall to do all in my
power to support our dream!

306
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,083
Entrepreneurship,
however, is a gamble.

307
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,208
Knowing that kind of
risk is a part of our lives,

308
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,083
I can understand why Yusa did
not want Miss Kamazuki to get

309
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,791
too close to us, lest she
become unexpectedly dragged into

310
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,041
that gamble as well.

311
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,875
It's far too late for
that; I'm more dragged in

312
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,083
than you know.

313
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,541
...He sees Yusa as an
enemy, and thus hates her

314
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,166
on a fundamental level.

315
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,375
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but I doubt the sort of thing

316
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,500
you're imagining about
them would ever happen.

317
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,541
Wow, that is
very impressive.

318
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,875
I can't get over how
we're all around the same age.

319
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,541
Now, I'm the jerk for having
such a nutty idea and blowing it

320
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,958
all out of proportion.

321
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,916
[RIKA] What the heck, Emi?

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,833
Why didn't you
mention any of this?

323
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,250
Well, it's not like you
ever would have listened.

324
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,541
My family actually
runs a small factory,

325
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,208
and whenever times get really
tough, which believe me they do,

326
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,875
we pull through it
by working together.

327
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,125
I know you said you feel
fallen, but the truth is

328
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,333
Maou needs you so he can work;
he eats all the meals you make,

329
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,666
sleeps on the futon you air
out, and wears the underwear

330
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,375
you've washed
for him, right?

331
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,333
Yes.

332
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,416
Then you're
the foundation

333
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,750
of this whole operation!

334
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,875
And I think you need
to be prouder of yourself.

335
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,291
I dunno; I just have this
feeling that since you guys

336
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,833
are so supportive of each other,
things are going to work out

337
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,166
for you.

338
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,083
It's funny; you're the
first person who's ever said

339
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,750
something like that to me.

340
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,291
Thank you for
the encouragement.

341
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,166
I feel a bit stronger for it.

342
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,916
[EMI] Rika?

343
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,166
What? What? What?

344
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,875
Yeah, "what, what,
what" is right.

345
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,375
What in the world
has come over you?

346
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,291
Oh, uh, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing!

347
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,958
She said "nothing"
five times.

348
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,166
[RIKA] I mean, wow.

349
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,875
Everybody's got a past, huh?

350
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,291
Anyway, this should clear
up all your misunderstandings,

351
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,708
so why don't we go home?

352
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,416
No way; now I'm
personally invested

353
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,208
in sizin' up Maou.

354
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,208
For starters, if
he's really that gifted,

355
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,458
I should probably go ahead
and network with the guy,

356
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,083
just in case.

357
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,833
Network?

358
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,541
You're a nutcase.

359
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,666
So, Ashiya.

360
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,208
You have to report
on the enemy, yeah?

361
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,250
Let's go over together!

362
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,416
Yeah, how about no?

363
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,291
All of us.

364
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,708
Together, Yusa.

365
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,916
But not before I obtain one
of those maple biscuits,

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,500
as well as a salad
with an extra side

367
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,666
of Thousand-Island dressing.

368
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,583
To go please.

369
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,958
[EMI] Hey, wait.
An extra side?

370
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,000
[ASHIYA] ...Miss Kamazuki,
thank you for your help.

371
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,541
Allow me to treat
you to dessert.

372
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,708
I hate this day so much.

373
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,583
Just when I think today
couldn't possibly suck any more,

374
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,458
it totally does.

375
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,166
[SARUE] Why so serious, Miss?

376
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,875
You cannot allow things
in life to trouble you,

377
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,875
or you won't be able
to enjoy your delicious

378
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,208
Sentucky Fried Chicken!

379
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,583
Yeah, thanks, I guess.

380
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,416
No matter how much one
worries, whether we like it

381
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,166
or not, things
change over time.

382
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,666
Whatever it is you've got going
on right now will end up

383
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,083
completely out
of your control.

384
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,208
So the sooner you accept
that, the better it'll be

385
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,291
for everyone.

386
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,541
This is the first
time I've been given

387
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,166
unsolicited advice on life
by a fast-food worker.

388
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,041
[SARUE] Oh, I apologize
for being presumptuous.

389
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,166
But if I might share
just one more thing.

390
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Men have a tendency to
take advantage of women

391
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,625
who appear vulnerable.

392
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,875
You should be on your
guard at all times.

393
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,541
What is that
supposed to mean?

394
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,458
[SARUE] Oh, nothing.

395
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,458
Nothing at all.

396
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,541
Thank you so much for
visiting today.

397
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,083
Please come back
and see us again soon.

398
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,750
[MAOU] Great, they're giving
out Grand Opening coupons?

399
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,791
That's right, and I
did try their food.

400
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,208
Their trademark fried chicken
is incredibly good.

401
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,000
And depending on the part
of the chicken you order,

402
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,625
you can even eat the bones.

403
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,958
Even bones?

404
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,958
Wait, I don't think
humans normally do that.

405
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,166
[ASHIYA]
There's more, sire.

406
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,583
Evidently, they're
serving organic coffee.

407
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,625
Coffee made
from ogres, why?

408
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,708
[ASHIYA]
"Organic," Sire;

409
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,625
it means "grown with
natural pesticides."

410
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,000
But ogres are already
full of natural pestilence.

411
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,875
Luckily, apart from
those small discrepancies,

412
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
there is not
much difference.

413
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,833
Customer service
was fairly average.

414
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,708
I imagine the only reason
they have such a crowd

415
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,291
is that humans are hopelessly
dazzled by new things.

416
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,958
[MAOU] I see.

417
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,958
In any case, we can at least
try putting up a good fight.

418
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,791
Thank you for
the information.

419
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,500
[ASHIYA] Though it is
appreciated, Sire,

420
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,458
I hardly deserve
your thanks.

421
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,375
I know it's not much, but let
me contribute to your sales.

422
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,583
I require two
Big Mig combos.

423
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,791
Both with cheese.

424
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,000
And both with
large soft drinks.

425
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,958
Urushihara will
most surely complain,

426
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,625
but this will be
our dinner tonight.

427
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,000
[MAOU] If he
complains about the food,

428
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,875
you have my permission
to give him a good beating.

429
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,166
[ASHIYA] Will do.

430
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,291
[URUSHIHARA sneezes]

431
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,791
Before I go.

432
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,958
You can expect great things
from those young ladies.

433
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,000
[MAOU] Oh good.

434
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,416
I'm not really sure
what that means.

435
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,458
[ASHIYA] Well, Sire.

436
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,625
I pray for your
success in battle.

437
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,750
Wow, okay, first of all,
they seem really tight,

438
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,000
and then, beyond that,
he's so professional.

439
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,041
You're surrounded
by amazing people.

440
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,750
Oh, can I count myself
among the gifted ones?

441
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,541
Why not?

442
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,750
Knock yourself out.

443
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,250
These seats are much
harder than Sentucky's.

444
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,333
[MAOU] Um.

445
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,708
Excuse me, ladies.

446
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, what?

447
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,916
We'd appreciate it
if you'd sit down only after

448
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,250
you've placed
an order up front.

449
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,375
[EMI] Ugh.

450
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,250
Okay, how about a small
iced coffee then?

451
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Happy, Maou?

452
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,333
Again, kind miss;

453
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,041
we like customers
to order at the register.

454
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,291
Up front.

455
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,750
While you're at it, I'll
order an apple pie, too,

456
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,916
and you can bring it to the
table to show some gratitude.

457
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,958
Yeah, still not---

458
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,375
[RIKA] So, you're
the Sadou Maou.

459
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,875
Somehow you aren't
as charismatic as I was

460
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,125
hoping you'd be.

461
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,625
Sure didn't expect the
restaurant to be empty

462
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,875
with you in charge.

463
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,000
Why would you say
something like that?

464
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,833
Who do you think you are, lady?

465
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,541
You know, Mister, I don't
really appreciate your tone.

466
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,208
You want me to
complain to corporate?

467
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,666
I don't mind letting 'em
know about you.

468
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,208
[MAOU] Oh, shut it.

469
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,666
Restaurants have rules that
even customers have to follow.

470
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,750
Besides, who are you
to threaten me?

471
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,708
I'm Rika Suzuki, and Emi and
I happen to be co-workers.

472
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,958
I got'cher number.

473
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,958
These two ladies and
your friend, Mister Ashiya,

474
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,666
told me quite a bit about you.

475
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,541
[MAOU] Ashiya?

476
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,541
When?

477
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,875
What did he say?

478
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,250
[ASHIYA sneezes]

479
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,375
Oh, he only had wonderful
things to say, but Emi seems

480
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,666
to find you the complete
opposite of wonderful,

481
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,291
so I decided to check you
out and see for myself.

482
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,250
Since I honestly don't
understand what you're saying

483
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,083
or why you're here, I'm just
gonna go with you being nosy.

484
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,833
Not sure which is worse:
no customers or Emi being here.

485
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,166
Come on, Mister Maou.

486
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,666
You shouldn't talk like that.

487
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,916
Miss Yusa is
a valuable customer.

488
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,333
Here!

489
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,125
I brought you your iced
coffee and a yummy apple pie,

490
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,541
fresh out of the oven.

491
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,791
Thank you, Chiho.

492
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,125
And I'm sorry; you know
how I get around him.

493
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:44,916
[CHIHO] Don't
worry about it.

494
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,166
I understand.

495
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,333
[SUZUNO] Good Chiho,
it's nice to see you again.

496
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,208
Yeah, you too!

497
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,541
Hope all's well.

498
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,958
Oh, we haven't met;
are you Miss Yusa's friend?

499
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,708
Yes.

500
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,583
We work together.

501
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,875
I'm Rika Suzuki.

502
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,208
Nice to meet you;
I'm Chiho Sasaki.

503
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,875
Miss Yusa has been
nothing but kind to me.

504
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,000
She's adorable.

505
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,208
Pardon?

506
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,041
For real, this little
girl is the cutest thing

507
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,083
I've ever seen!

508
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,750
[EMI] Rika!

509
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,083
Stop being a weirdo!

510
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,625
[RIKA] It's totally not fair
how many awesome people

511
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,125
you have in
your life, Emi!

512
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,333
This precious thing
is so sweet and works

513
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,750
her poor little tushie off.

514
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,375
That's it; I'm
stealing her from you!

515
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,125
[EMI] You're acting like
a drunk old pervert.

516
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:18,958
Stop it!

517
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,083
Okay, fine.

518
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm sorry, Chiho.

519
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,875
I just get a little carried
away; can't help myself.

520
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,041
[CHIHO] Oh.

521
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,208
That's cool,
but it was super confusing.

522
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:28,916
Well?

523
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,541
What are you gonna do?

524
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,500
Got a plan?

525
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,750
[MAOU] What?

526
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,958
Didn't you just tell
Mister Ashiya that you

527
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,625
would try to put up
a fight or something?

528
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,041
[RIKA] Listen, I'm gonna
be straight with you;

529
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,833
I want to see you work
your magic, so get to it.

530
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,791
[MAOU] You have major
daddy issues, don't you?

531
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,916
[RIKA] Emi has Mister
Ashiya, Chiho, and me;

532
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,875
I mean, this girl has got a lot
of talented people in her life.

533
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,125
I'm sitting here choosing to
believe you're not the idiot

534
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,250
you appear to be;
so prove me right.

535
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,166
Just to be sure
we're on the same page here,

536
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,916
are you implying I look stupid?

537
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,625
Implying's maybe not
a strong enough word.

538
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,166
How dare you?

539
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,000
Fine!

540
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,625
To hell with SFC's coupons!

541
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,708
Time to fight
fliers with fliers!

542
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,583
Come on in and try

543
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,625
some delicious
MgRonald's food!

544
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,291
Come on in!

545
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,041
You know you want to!

546
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,250
It's no good.

547
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,583
[MAOU] What?

548
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,375
Then we advertise
that our food's easier to eat

549
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,500
since it doesn't have any bones!

550
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,458
Chiho! Go!

551
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,541
Come one, come all!

552
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,125
Try a Big Mig burger!

553
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,375
They don't have any bones,
so the eating's easy!

554
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,166
Isn't it fairly
normal for hamburgers

555
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,666
not to have any bones?

556
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,333
That was funny;
you're a silly girl.

557
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,583
[MAN B] Silly and cute!

558
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,916
It didn't work.

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
[MAOU] I know.

560
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,458
No more Mister
Nice Maou, Kawa-cchi,

561
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,708
it is time for us to begin
Operation: Let People Use

562
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,500
the Restroom Even if
They Don't Buy Anything!

563
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
Uh, isn't that
actually still nice?

564
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,625
This is depressing.

565
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,958
Hey, there's
the guy I'm looking for!

566
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,458
Mister Nabe!

567
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,125
Oh good; you finally made it!

568
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,750
[MR. NABE] Well, it was
a request from you, Maou,

569
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,666
so I couldn't refuse; I'm
sorry it took me longer

570
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,916
than I thought.

571
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,208
No problem; you're a life
saver, oh and please,

572
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,958
you have to stay and eat;
whatever you want is on me.

573
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,583
Thanks for the offer,
but my wife said she's

574
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,000
making me dinner, and since
you were my last delivery,

575
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,041
I'm gonna head on home.

576
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,375
See you on the
next cleaning day.

577
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,125
Say "hi" to Miss Kisaki!

578
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,291
[MALE PART-TIMER A] Amazing!

579
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,750
He gave us really nice ones.

580
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,208
[KAWA-CCHI] Let's hurry up
and decorate before

581
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,958
the dinner rush starts!

582
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,208
Yeah, this is awesome!

583
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:17,916
Maou.

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,291
Got some more for you!

585
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,041
I'm not sure if we've

586
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,291
got enough ornaments.

587
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,958
If not, we can
use the flyers.

588
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,583
[FEMALE PART-TIMER B]
Is it really okay to use those

589
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,041
to make more ornaments?

590
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,958
As the current shift
manager, I say you bet it is!

591
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,208
What's going on?

592
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,375
Mister Maou came up
with a super cool idea,

593
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,375
thanks to the Star Festival.

594
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,083
He thought it would be fun to
have our customers write wishes

595
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,291
on strips of paper and
decorate the trees with them.

596
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,666
Then the really smart
part was when he got our manager

597
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,708
to make a request from Regional.

598
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,791
They're letting us give
a complimentary small drink

599
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,666
to any customers who decide
they want to participate.

600
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,916
He got the trees
from that older guy

601
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,208
who came in earlier.

602
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,916
They met a while back,
volunteering for

603
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,583
neighborhood cleanup together.

604
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,458
Mister Maou found out Mister
Nabe grows bamboo in his yard,

605
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,000
so they worked out a deal.

606
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,250
Hang on.

607
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,458
Maou volunteers for
neighborhood cleanup?

608
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,375
Of course, we can't be
sure if this will directly

609
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,666
affect our sales tonight,
but at least everyone here

610
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,291
seems to be in a better mood,
so not a total loss!

611
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:17,125
[CROWD] Wow! Nice! This
is really coming together!

612
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,333
Okay, that was
pretty good.

613
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,958
Well, I don't
know about "good,"

614
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,041
but I guess he's
a hard worker.

615
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,208
No way.

616
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,166
How pretty!

617
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,750
This is the MgRonald's
with that cute girl

618
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,916
who makes funny quotes!

619
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,541
[MAN C] I saw
her pic on Twitter!

620
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,958
Wait, you
saw me where?

621
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,583
Mommy, I'na write
a wish and put it up, too!

622
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
Get out!

623
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,083
Look at what a couple o' bamboo
trees can do for the feng shui.

624
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,750
I gotta redecorate!

625
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,583
Guys.

626
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,041
Assume your battle stations!

627
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,791
War is upon us!

628
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,750
[GROUP] Yeah!

629
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,791
Hi, welcome!

630
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,291
Good evening, all!

631
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,750
As soon as you know your order,
go ahead and get in line!

632
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,458
For two?

633
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,791
I think we have some
empty seats over there.

634
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,041
Sure, just follow me.

635
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
Thank you for coming in.
