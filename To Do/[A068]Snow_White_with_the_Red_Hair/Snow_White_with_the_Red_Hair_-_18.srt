1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,125
Shirayuki!

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,541
Found you!

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,083
Let go of me!

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,250
[OBI groans]

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi!

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,458
Obi!

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,125
[KAZUKI] I'm taking you to
where you truly belong.

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,750
Pops is gonna be so happy.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,875
Good. So you're awake.

10
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,875
[KAZUKI]
What the...?!

11
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,208
Umihebi?!

12
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,458
[rustling]

13
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,083
[KAZUKI] After we took
you out of the castle,

14
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,375
you and I were attacked by
one of those evil woman's

15
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,000
companions when we
were by ourselves.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,041
So in other words,
you're saying

17
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,625
I was kidnapped
from my kidnappers?

18
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,333
I'm so sorry,

19
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,500
but you won't be able
to go back home anymore.

20
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,125
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

22
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

23
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,083
Do you maybe wanna
sneak into town?

24
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:24,750
What?

25
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,083
Like right now?

26
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,750
Well, that sounds fun, too.

27
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,875
But you are leaving
for Tanbarun tomorrow.

28
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,666
I think we might get in
trouble if we went tonight.

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,708
That's true.

30
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,750
We'll go when you get
back from your trip.

31
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,000
Just us.

32
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,250
[SHIRAYUKI] That moment
feels like a lifetime ago.

33
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,416
I haven't heard Zen's voice in
what seems like an eternity.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

35
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,416
[KAZUKI]
Now's our chance.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
We have to get out
before things get worse.

37
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
Shirayuki. Can you do this?

38
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,083
I know it's scary.

39
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,000
I can!

40
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,041
Whoa, what are you doing?!

41
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
[SHIRAYUKI] Would you want to
wear this during an escape?

42
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,416
[KAZUKI]
Uh.

43
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
I have to be strong.

44
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Kazuki, let me
have a look at your face.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958
[gasps] Why?

46
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,541
It's nothing.

47
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,000
We need to treat it before the
swelling gets any worse, okay?

48
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,666
[KAZUKI]
I, uh...

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,875
Nah, We'll do it later.

50
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
[KAZUKI] Damn it!
We're already on the boat.

51
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,833
I was afraid of that.

52
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,041
Now what?

53
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
There's not a lot of movement,

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,875
so the ship must be anchored.

55
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,750
With any luck, we're
still close to the shore.

56
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,041
[KAZUKI grunting]
She locked it,

57
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,208
so we're not going to be
able to sneak up on deck.

58
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,416
Knowing her, there're
probably guards, anyway.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,625
Got any ideas?

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,875
[gasps]

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,916
It's a Chitoka seed!

62
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think I've got a plan.

63
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,625
Why do we get stuck
guarding these two brats

64
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,875
when we could be ashore,
having some fun?

65
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,125
[yawns]

66
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,916
[PIRATE B]
Quit complaining.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,083
If you want to go, go.

68
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
You'll get beat senseless,
but who cares.

69
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,833
Uh?! Hey, look!

70
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,250
[PIRATE A gasping]

71
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,083
Come on!

72
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,166
[PIRATE A yelps]

73
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:29,375
[PIRATES coughing]

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,833
[PIRATE B]
Did those kids set a fire?!

75
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,333
[PIRATE A]
I can't see anything!

76
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,666
Kazuki!

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,625
[PIRATE A]
Hey!

78
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
[BOTH groan]

79
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,833
[KAZUKI]
I can't believe it,

80
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,541
your plan worked!

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,541
What are those things?

82
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Chitoka seeds.
They're a good food source,

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,750
and they also happen to smoke
a lot when you burn them.

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,875
I figured we could use
that to our advantage.

85
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,875
Just out of curiosity, what
did you do back in Clarines?

86
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm an apprentice to the
chief court herbalist.

87
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,500
Fascinating.

88
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,625
Is that what you wanted
to do with your life?

89
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,875
Yes, absolutely.

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,416
[KAZUKI]
All right.

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,041
It looks like the coast
is clear out there.

92
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,125
Now, when you get up on deck,
break left and run.

93
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
Then, jump off into the water.

94
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,833
[KAZUKI gasping]

95
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,458
[UMIHEBI] Where are you dears
off to in such a hurry?!

96
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,458
You look like little minnows.

97
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,750
Careful, this snake'll
swallow you head first.

98
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,208
Hey!

99
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,625
We're almost there.

100
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen, look!

101
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,666
We found this.

102
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,208
[gasps] My watch.

103
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,583
[MITSUHIDE] Apparently, Obi
picked it up at after the fight.

104
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,833
When he went in search of
Shirayuki he left it here.

105
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:30,041
[SHIRAYUKI] I will give it
back to you when I return.

106
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,750
[ZEN]
I see.

107
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,125
[ZEN]
Huh?

108
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,458
[MIHAYA]
Uh!

109
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
[ZEN]
Ah! What... was that for?

110
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,166
It's not that we
don't appreciate you

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
maintaining your composure
throughout all this.

112
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,916
But you need to vent some of
your frustration and anger.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,916
If not, you'll
spontaneously combust.

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,625
Heh.

115
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,333
So you're just helping me
burn off some of the steam?

116
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,791
That's oh, so kind of you.

117
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Was it too hard?

118
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,208
[ZEN]
I'll put it this way,

119
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,000
you're going straight to
the Punishment Chamber

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
when we get back Mitsuhide.

121
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,541
Ah! Why just me?
It was Kiki's idea!

122
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,291
Wise decision, Prince Zen.

123
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,500
There is one more thing, though.

124
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,500
Obi left this message for you.

125
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,791
[gasps]

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,875
[RAJ] Thank you for waiting.
Ready to go?

127
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,875
The plan is to visit a
self-governing vigilante group.

128
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,208
Although, they prefer
to be called

129
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,458
the Lions of the Mountain,

130
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,125
they're mostly known
for fighting bandits,

131
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,208
but they've taken on the
Claw of the Sea before.

132
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,000
Interesting. Hopefully they'll
have useful information.

133
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,416
Also, you'll be happy
to hear this.

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,250
[RAJ]
What?

135
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,666
I have a promising lead.

136
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,625
[whistle blows]

137
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,708
[MUKAZE] According to Itoya's
account of the ordeal,

138
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,541
the Claw left their mark at
the scene of the disappearance.

139
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,458
They most likely
tracked down Kazuki

140
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,333
and took him back to the ship,
along with the girl.

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,750
Contact our men in the village!
And prepare the ship.

142
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
We're going after the Claw!

143
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,125
[MEN]
Yeah!

144
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,333
[MAN A]
Let's move out!

145
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,625
What about you?

146
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,875
There's something that
I want to look into.

147
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,833
I'll need your help.

148
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,041
[MUKAZE]
You, over there!

149
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,500
[OBI grunts]

150
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,375
[MUKAZE] Itoya informed me
who you've been working for.

151
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,791
Do you intend to tell the
prince about our operations?

152
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,083
All you need to know is I'm not
gonna let you out of my sight.

153
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,083
[PIRATE A groans]

154
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:51,916
[PIRATE B yelps]

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,458
[PIRATES groaning]

156
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,541
[coughs]

157
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,916
I see you're still as cruel
as you've always been!

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Those men are your comrades.

159
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,916
Sometimes bad boys
need to be hurt a little.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,375
That way they'll
learn their lesson.

161
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,041
I think they both have
severe internal bleeding.

162
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,083
The one farthest from
us is hyperventilating,

163
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,416
which is a bad sign.

164
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,833
[UMIHEBI]
Oh!

165
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,625
So you know a thing or two
about medicine, my pet.

166
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,666
Don't touch her!

167
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,708
Oh, are you a hero, now?

168
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,125
[KAZUKI growls]

169
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,958
[yelps]

170
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,666
Failing at a job is one thing,

171
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,041
but you of all
people should know

172
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,125
what happens to those
who disrespect me.

173
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,583
Dolls are meant to be
beautiful and silent.

174
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,458
Otherwise, no one'll
want to play with them.

175
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,291
I'm not a doll for anyone.

176
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm a Lion of the
Mountain, now and forever!

177
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,666
Please don't tell me
you think those idiots

178
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,125
are on their way to save you.

179
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,416
[KAZUKI] Pops isn't a cruel,
heartless delinquent!

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,125
He's nothing like you!

181
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,041
So you do think he's coming.

182
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,791
Sounds like your pretty face
has made you delusional.

183
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
[KAZUKI]
It's not just me!

184
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,583
[UMIHEBI] Hm? You mean this
darling redheaded thing

185
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,958
is important to the
Lions of the Mountain?

186
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, do tell.

187
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,208
[KAZUKI growls]

188
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,875
[UMIHEBI] And don't leave out
a single detail, either.

189
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,333
They're about two
kilometers ahead of us,

190
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,583
to the south-southeast.

191
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,208
All right. Move quickly!

192
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,583
[bird squawks]

193
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,625
[OBI]
Huh?

194
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,083
Why'd you stop?

195
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,583
[ITOYA]
Who is that?!

196
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,041
There you are...

197
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,916
Obi.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,750
I failed you, master. I'm sorry.

199
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:07,125
Ha, ha! I'm sorry, too! That hit
was from Kiki and Mitsuhide.

200
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,958
What is with that weird voice
you're using, anyway?

201
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,583
You'll scare people if
you don't knock that off.

202
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,208
[OBI]
You mean Shirayuki?

203
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,708
No, fool. I mean Ryu.

204
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,458
[OBI]
Hm. Guess you're right.

205
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
"I'm leaving and
taking the package

206
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,666
for Shirayuki from Prince Zen."

207
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,458
You could've given more
details, but it was helpful.

208
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,416
And it worked.

209
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
Good.

210
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,625
[OBI]
I wasn't sure if you'd learned

211
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,000
how to train the birds,
yet. I'm impressed.

212
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,166
I had Kihal show me
the ropes, first.

213
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,333
Then I snuck in and blended
with the soldiers.

214
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,250
Whoa, that's unbelievable.

215
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,958
He taught that bird to
follow the sound of a bell?

216
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,625
[chirps]

217
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,333
I wish Shirayuki was
here to see it, though.

218
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,958
Who might the two of you be?

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,458
[SAKAKI]
I know one of them is the leader

220
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,916
of the Lions of the Mountain.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,791
[MUKAZE] Oh, so someone here
thinks they know my face.

222
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,208
The Lions of the Mountain.

223
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,750
[MIHAYA]
Your Highness,

224
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
I know where I've seen the man
with the ponytail and scar.

225
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,916
He was the one in the port
with the boy that night.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,625
[ZEN] These are the men
who kidnapped Shirayuki?

227
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,375
Wait, what are you
talking about?!

228
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,875
I thought we already established

229
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,250
that the Claw of the
Sea took Shirayuki.

230
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,875
Kazuki took her from the
castle along with Itoya,

231
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,625
the guy with the
ponytail over there,

232
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,541
and, they are Lions
of the Mountain.

233
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,500
But then, when
Itoya stepped away,

234
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,416
she was taken again,
with Kazuki.

235
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,875
That time it was probably
the Claw of the Sea.

236
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,208
[RAJ]
What?! I don't understand this!

237
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,750
Lion of the Mountain fellows,
explain it to me!

238
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,958
Are you people
from the government?

239
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,083
We are.

240
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,833
I am Prince Raj Schenezade
of Tanbarun!

241
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,416
[ITOYA, MUKAZE grunt]

242
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,375
[RAJ] I demand that you give me
all the information you have!

243
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,875
What do you know
about the girl?!

244
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,458
I honestly couldn't care
less what you demand.

245
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,291
[gasps]

246
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,458
[MUKAZE]
Shall we go?

247
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,208
[ZEN] I'm curious as to your
reason for refusing him.

248
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,958
My understanding was this:

249
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,666
The Lions formed
to fight bandits

250
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,375
and protect the citizens.

251
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,416
So I'm confused why you were the
ones who snuck into the castle.

252
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,875
Why would you use
violence against Obi?

253
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,000
Why take an innocent girl?

254
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,208
For the kid.

255
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,583
Kazuki was a slave to the
Claw before he joined with us.

256
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,666
Itoya!

257
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,166
[ITOYA]
After they'd had enough of him,

258
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
they sold him to some nobles
who only kept him around

259
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,916
because he was pretty.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,875
They treated him
like a living doll.

261
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,250
That's why!

262
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,500
When Kazuki heard Shirayuki's
story, he identified

263
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,750
with an unfortunate girl
who was stolen by a prince

264
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,500
against her will just because
her red hair caught his eye!

265
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,208
He wanted to take her to a place

266
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,791
where such fools
couldn't find her.

267
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,708
[ZEN]
And how did that work out?

268
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,875
What did Shirayuki say
when you told her?

269
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,166
Did she agree to go with you?

270
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,375
You didn't let her have a
say in the matter, did you?

271
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,833
You dragged her out by force.

272
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,250
[gasps]

273
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,541
We were a bit too rough
with her. I'm sorry for that.

274
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,958
I can tell you're close
with Shirayuki.

275
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,875
That you care.

276
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,333
Yes. I will save her.

277
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,000
[MUKAZE]
The Lions of the Mountain

278
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,500
are people that have grown
tired of noble tyranny.

279
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,791
They've been driven from
their homes unjustly.

280
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,333
They're who we are
and who we protect.

281
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,541
We don't abide by
the rule of kings.

282
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,333
That's why our people trust us.

283
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,000
But we want to save those
kids as much as you do.

284
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,833
So, since we share
a common goal,

285
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,583
we might as well work together.

286
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,916
Will you agree to let the
rest go and move forward?

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,416
Well, Raj? Agreed?

288
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,250
Uh! Oh, yeah, I guess. Sure.

289
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,750
Then it's a deal.

290
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,625
[ZEN] An entire port town
working for the Claw?

291
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,041
Yes.

292
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,666
We've had our eye on that
place for quite some time.

293
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
There's a wharf there,
which is convenient.

294
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,416
I'd say it's definitely
worth checking out.

295
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,583
[ZEN]
I see.

296
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,875
What's the matter, Mihaya?

297
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,791
I've never seen you so serious.

298
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, you know, just feeling
like more of an outsider

299
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,750
now than I ever have
before, that's all.

300
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,875
Even that stray cat
bastard is in the fold.

301
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
But it's fine.

302
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
I'll let you know if I have
anything that needs to be said.

303
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,791
Oh, I can't wait!

304
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,583
I don't believe I was
addressing you, you--

305
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,125
Stray cat bastard?

306
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,500
We'll be at the port town
once we clear this next hill.

307
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,125
Hey, was that your real voice?

308
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,625
I think you forgot to use
the scary one this time.

309
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,750
[OBI]
Huh?

310
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,041
[MUKAZE] That's definitely
one of the Claw's boats.

311
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,125
See that ship anchored
at the wharf?

312
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,041
Yeah. I wonder if their
boss lady's on that one.

313
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,666
For the first time ever, I
actually hope that she is.

314
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,291
You mean the Claw of the
Sea's leader is a woman?

315
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,833
[MUKAZE] Yes, but she's more
like a snake than anything.

316
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,291
Cold, dead eyes with
a heart to match.

317
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,875
She terrifies weak men into
doing whatever she says.

318
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,625
No matter how miserable it might
make them in the long run.

319
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,333
Obi. What'd you find?

320
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,916
Seems we hit the jackpot.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,125
Some guys said they saw

322
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,083
a pretty, blonde boy
around earlier.

323
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,083
He was being escorted
onto the Claw ship

324
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
that's anchored at the wharf.

325
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,208
Kazuki.

326
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,583
[ZEN]
And Shirayuki?

327
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,583
I couldn't find anyone
who had seen her.

328
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,708
Although, just because
they didn't see her

329
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,291
doesn't mean she isn't there.

330
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,041
[ITOYA] In a way, this is
like a hostage situation.

331
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,666
They have the upper hand
if we try to pick a fight.

332
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,458
Which makes things difficult.

333
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,250
So then, how do we proceed?

334
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,875
Wait until the crew
goes into town

335
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,625
and sneak them off the ship?

336
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,666
[KIKI]
Prince Zen.

337
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,875
I have a proposal that
I think could work.

338
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
[PIRATE C]
Huh?

339
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:41,375
[PIRATE C]
28, 29, 30!

340
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,833
You're going to kill him!

341
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,125
Please, stop! You don't
have to do this!

342
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,625
Fine, pull him up.

343
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,291
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:16:56,041 --> 00:17:01,791
[KAZUKI coughs, pants]

345
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,833
[UMIHEBI]
Are you just dyin' to talk now?

346
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,958
Come on, why do
those silly Lions

347
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,708
want that precious Red so badly?

348
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,916
I told you. I don't
know anything.

349
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,041
They never let me in on it.

350
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,458
All I overheard is that
it was some kind of job

351
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
they were doing.

352
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,375
Then, we still haven't convinced
you to stop playing dumb?

353
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,833
I suppose it doesn't matter.

354
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Oh, girlie, why don't we
figure out which master

355
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,750
I get to sell you off to?

356
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
You stand out so much.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
I think I should send you so
far away from your homeland

358
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,208
that no one will
ever recognize you.

359
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,583
You can't make me go.
I'm not scared of you.

360
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,416
[PIRATE C]
Boss, you've got a visitor!

361
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
They wanna make a deal!

362
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,750
Tell 'em she's busy!

363
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,958
[PIRATE C] Uh, looks like
pretty high quality goods!

364
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,458
[UMIHEBI growls]
They had better be.

365
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,541
Throw these brats
back in their room.

366
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
When I'm done with this,
we set sail.

367
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,625
[PIRATES]
Yes, ma'am!

368
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,458
[PIRATE C] I was looking
forward to more time ashore.

369
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,125
[PIRATE D] You can get just
as drunk at sea as on land.

370
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,916
[PIRATE C]
Yeah, that's true. Ha, ha!

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
Uh?

372
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,458
Try to relax. You need to
rest as much as you can.

373
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,291
Don't you want the truth?

374
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,666
About what's going on.

375
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,125
Who I actually am.

376
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,500
And why I was trying to find
you in the first place.

377
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
It doesn't matter.

378
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,208
You hurt my friend Obi
at the castle that night,

379
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,041
so it's not like I can trust
everything you'd tell me anyway.

380
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,833
However, just now, up on deck,

381
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,791
you endured a lot of pain,

382
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,458
and kept your mouth
shut for your friends.

383
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,083
I can at least
trust that action.

384
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,291
Uh?

385
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Besides, we can talk about
it when this is over.

386
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,833
As soon as we get out
of here and we're safe.

387
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,458
Let's do that.

388
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,458
[BOTH gasp]

389
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,208
[PIRATE C]
Set sail!

390
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,291
Damn it! They've pulled
up the anchor.

391
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,250
We've started moving again!

392
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

393
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,041
[PIRATES laughing]

394
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,375
[door creaking]

395
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,250
[PIRATE D] You stay in here
and keep quiet, or else!

396
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,458
[KAZUKI]
Uh?

397
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,208
What kind of girl gets
sold 'cause the jail

398
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,666
doesn't know what to do with
her, for cryin' out loud?

399
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,375
[KAZUKI]
Hey, wait!

400
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um, Miss, are you all right?

401
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,083
[gasps] Kiki!

402
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,958
[MITSUHIDE] You want to
pretend to be a criminal

403
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,708
and get sold to the Claw?

404
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,208
They're less likely to be
suspicious of a woman.

405
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,041
At the very least, if Shirayuki
is on the ship like we think,

406
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,416
then she'll have a
friend to protect her.

407
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,375
Bad idea, don't let her!
That'd be way too dangerous!

408
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,291
We have to save her somehow.

409
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm willing to take this risk
if it gets us any closer.

410
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,750
Your Highness,

411
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,875
I have some information
that you might want.

412
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,958
What is it?

413
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,625
Their base would
be weak right now

414
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,666
with the boss and
her crew at sea.

415
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,125
[ZEN]
What do you mean?

416
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,000
[MIHAYA] You remember that
my father was a count,

417
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,625
and that he circulated
with all kinds of people?

418
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,000
[ZEN]
I do.

419
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,875
The pirates, a female leader,
the back room deals.

420
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,208
Memories are flooding back
of my crooked father

421
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,583
and ruined older brother.

422
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,083
I think they were in
business with the Claw.

423
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
[BOTH gasp]

424
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,750
[MIHAYA] In fact, my family
was in so deep with them

425
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,000
that we were
once invited back

426
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,833
to the main base
of their operation.

427
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,000
[ZEN]
Wait.

428
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,791
Are you saying you
remember how to find it?

429
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,125
[MUKAZE]
Impressive.

430
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,666
We've been searching for years,

431
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,833
but I don't think we've come
close to locating their mansion.

432
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,916
Now, I probably wouldn't
be offering to help

433
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
if the situation
wasn't so desperate,

434
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,166
but this information
will cost you.

435
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,041
[ZEN growls]
Why am I surprised?

436
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,125
Of course you'd say that.

437
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,750
Mihaya, will you
please tell us wh--

438
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,000
This actually doesn't concern
Prince Zen or Clarines.

439
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,875
The Claw of the Sea's base
is in Tanbarun territory.

440
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,250
That means it concerns
you, Prince Raj.

441
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,166
This is technically
your problem.

442
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,583
Are you willing to
give me what I want

443
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,333
in exchange for the information?

444
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,083
Very well.

445
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,250
[MIHAYA]
Seriously?!

446
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
You're certainly not
the first scoundrel

447
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,250
to sell information to Tanbarun.

448
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,625
And I want to save Shirayuki.

449
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,541
If, in the process,
you can help us root out

450
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,583
a festering scourge on our
kingdom, I'd be grateful.

451
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,166
Such a gift warrants
a handsome reward.

452
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,958
Right, Sakaki?

453
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,541
[SAKAKI]
Indeed.

454
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,833
Keep it safe.

455
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
I will.

456
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,833
[KIKI]
Your Highness.

457
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,708
Let's go over the plan.

458
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
It's you!

459
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,791
Yes, I'm here.

460
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,083
Uh! Wait, you know each other?

461
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,583
You must be Kazuki.

462
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,250
The chief has been
worried about you.

463
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,083
Pops said that?

464
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,333
Shirayuki. I'm so
relieved to see you.

465
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,875
We tricked them into throwing
me in here like this.

466
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,375
There's nothing to worry
about now, all right?

467
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,875
Zen's very close by.

468
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:16,000
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]
Zen's here?

469
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,875
In Tanbarun?

470
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,833
Yes. He came to save you.

471
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,875
[SHIRAYUKI cries]

472
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,583
[KIKI]
You're going home.

473
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you.

474
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,166
[RAJ]
Pirates!

475
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,208
Understand that we will not
allow you to get away from us!

476
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,625
[ZEN]
Let go of Shirayuki.

477
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,541
Believe me, I am not one
you want to trifle with!

478
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,416
[UMIHEBI]
Do you care to die?!

479
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,916
[RAJ]
Don't underestimate... Tanbarun.
