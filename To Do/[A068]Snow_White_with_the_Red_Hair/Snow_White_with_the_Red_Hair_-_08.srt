1
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,416
[RYU]
Looks like it stopped raining.

2
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, good.

3
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,916
I should harvest
the roka fruit now,

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,625
while the smell isn't as strong.

5
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,833
[RYU] Right. Did you finish
organizing the file on Laxdo?

6
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,458
I did.

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,750
I wish I could be there to take
notes on their recovery, though.

8
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,041
I know the feeling. You could
if it weren't so far away.

9
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,583
Yeah, it's too bad.

10
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,041
[door closes]

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,541
[ZEN]
I don't know what to do.

12
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,916
She doesn't deserve this.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,291
[OBI]
Master!

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,333
No need to fear. Obi's returned!

15
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,416
Obi! You were only supposed
to be gone for two days!

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,583
[OBI] Well, I hadn't
been out in a while.

17
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,416
I guess I got carried away.

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,541
So, did I miss anything
big while I was gone?

19
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,416
[ZEN] Yes, as a matter
of fact you did.

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,166
Uh? What happened?

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,958
veryone believes that Zen
and Shirayuki are engaged.

22
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,833
So she's been getting a
lot of unwanted attention.

23
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,875
Some people are sucking
up to her now.

24
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,750
Others are trying to
figure out which houses

25
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,583
have lost favor with me and why.

26
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,458
I told Shirayuki to keep
an eye out, but still.

27
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,458
I hope it's not going to
interfere with her work.

28
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,041
[ZEN]
All right.

29
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,625
Obi, I want you to act as her
bodyguard until further notice.

30
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

31
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,416
For real?

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,250
You can't be serious, Master!

33
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,708
Did you forget about when I
stalked and threatened her?

34
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,500
[ZEN] It's up to her
to forgive you for that.

35
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,750
I see no reason to hold
it against you, now.

36
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,416
After all, when you left I
thought you might not come back.

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,791
But you did.

38
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,333
You've earned my trust.

39
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,625
[RYU] I'll start harvesting
on the west side.

40
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,833
Sounds good.

41
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,375
[KIKI]
Shirayuki.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,625
[OBI chuckles]

43
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,333
Well, I'm surprised to
see you two together.

44
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,708
You shouldn't be!

45
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,833
Kiki and I have been paired
up on watch quite a bit.

46
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,666
We've had fun haven't we, Kiki?

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,208
[KIKI]
No comment.

48
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,458
I'm confused.

49
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,166
You mean you already
knew this monkey

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,375
was one of Zen's attendants?

51
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Uh. Yes,
I did know about that.

52
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,250
The Master was pretty
mad when he found out

53
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,208
we had talked at Laxdo.

54
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,041
Zen suggested that Obi

56
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,875
should act as your
bodyguard for a while.

57
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

58
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,416
Garak agreed to allow
him in the gardens

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,041
if it's in your best interest.
As a matter of fact,

60
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,208
she said she would look
aggressively for any way

61
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,875
she could put him to good
use doing the dirty work.

62
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,125
Huh?

63
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,666
[KIKI] He's yours as
long as you need him,

64
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,083
and if you feel like you don't,
you can just send him away.

65
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,250
What? Hey, hold on! Kiki!

66
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,791
[OBI] Oh! Have I even
introduced myself?

67
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,291
I'm Obi, but I've gone by
many different names.

68
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,583
The rest is secret.

69
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,916
Uh, why're you
covering your face?

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
We're harvesting the roka fruit,

71
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,125
and they give off fumes
that get you drunk

72
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,250
when you breathe them in.

73
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,083
I'll remember that for later.

74
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
What are you doing?

75
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,291
[OBI]
I thought I could help out.

76
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, Ryu! This is Obi, and--

77
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,791
[RYU] Yes, I know.
It's fine with me.

78
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,708
As long as the prince and chief
herbalist have agreed to it.

79
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um. Yes, they have.

80
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,291
[OBI] All right, enough small
talk, let's harvest some fruit!

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Only pick the ones
that have a four-pointed star

82
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,333
on the end, and stay away
from the shriveled ones,

83
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,416
we can't use them.

84
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,708
[OBI]
Got it.

85
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
How do you feel?

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,333
[OBI]
What?

87
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Are the fumes affecting you?

88
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,416
[OBI]
I don't think so.

89
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,708
Is this the star shape
you're talking about?

90
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's it.

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,583
[OBI gasps]

92
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,875
What's wrong with you?

93
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,500
[OBI]
Oh! Oh.

94
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,250
Oops. I guess my hand
moved on its own.

95
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,458
[nervous chuckles]

96
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Well, make your
hands do something useful

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,541
and take these.

98
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,416
[OBI]
Sure thing. I'm sorry.

99
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,625
[OBI]
We're gonna put these bottles

100
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,250
in underground
storage now, right?

101
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah.

102
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,041
The ones they took down there
six months ago should be ready,

103
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,875
so let's check on those
and bring them back up

104
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,041
to the medicine room.

105
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,333
This must be the most
boring job ever.

106
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,833
Oh, no. The longer you do it,
the more interesting it gets.

107
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:47,791
Really? I guess it does seem
like you're enjoying it so far.

108
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,250
Being an apprentice
court herbalist

109
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,625
and friend of the prince
could have its perks.

110
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,916
Though it's obviously
not all fun and games.

111
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,375
[MITSUHIDE sighs]
That meeting ran long.

112
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,416
Hm? Hey, look.

113
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
[ZEN]
Um?

114
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,250
It appears to be going
well down there.

115
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,083
[ZEN]
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,458
I've got a question.

117
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,083
Do you sometimes wish
Zen weren't a prince?

118
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,000
Or that you had higher status?

119
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:14,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Mm!

120
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,125
[ZEN exhales]

121
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,666
[OBI]
Uh?

122
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Give me that.

123
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,916
Uh...

124
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,083
Watch what you say.

125
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,416
Next time I'll take
it as an insult.

126
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,541
[OBI]
Right.

127
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:43,375
That guy's got it all.
She is somethin' else.

128
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,541
Hey, hold on! Wait for me.

129
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,250
I'm sorry!

130
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,541
[GARAK] This batch's been
fermenting for six months.

131
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,583
You should take a sip so you
know what it tastes like.

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,583
Go on, try it.

133
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,791
You, too, Mister...?

134
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,458
I'm Obi!

135
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,375
Try some, Obi.

136
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,041
--[SHIRAYUKI] Burns!
--[OBI] Oh, yeah!

137
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,708
[laughs]

138
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,250
Pardon, Miss Garak.

139
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,083
I believe you gave them the
alcohol instead of the medicine.

140
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,041
Yes, I did!
Nice powers of deduction.

141
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,250
That's why I liked it!

142
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,333
[GARAK, OBI laugh]

143
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,291
[thump]

144
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,333
[RYU]
Uh?

145
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,166
[groans]

146
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,625
[RYU]
Shirayuki!

147
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,708
[OBI]
You all right, Miss?

148
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,541
[GARAK]
Oh, what have I done?

149
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,291
Come on girl, can't
you hold your liquor?

150
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,041
[ZEN exhales]

151
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,791
[OBI] Do you sometimes
wish Zen weren't a prince?

152
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,208
Or that you had higher status?

153
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,833
[IZANA]
Zen!

154
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,708
Prince Zen!

155
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,750
Huh?

156
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,166
[MITSUHIDE grunts]
Uh?

157
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
You called for me, Lord Brother?

158
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,125
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

159
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,208
[IZANA] I'd like to introduce
you to Mitsuhide Louen,

160
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,875
an Eastern Sereg Knight.

161
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,375
I've hired him to
be your attendant.

162
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,041
I don't need an attendant.

163
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,041
[MITSUHIDE] Prince Zen makes
quite an impression.

164
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
[ZEN exhales]

165
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,000
Where're you going?

166
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,375
[ZEN]
For a walk.

167
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,500
[MITSUHIDE]
I'll come, too.

168
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,708
[ZEN]
No, thanks.

169
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,833
Prince Izana gave me
strict instructions

170
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,166
to remain by your
side at all times.

171
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,666
Be honest.

172
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,916
You would have preferred to
work for my brother, right?

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh? That's not true!

174
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,000
Please, I could see it in
your face from the moment

175
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,291
he introduced us.

176
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,000
You obviously respect him more.

177
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,750
[MITSUHIDE]
He's even more observant

178
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,750
than I expected him to be.

179
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,166
I shouldn't have
let my guard down.

180
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,375
[window opens]

181
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,708
[MITSUHIDE] Uh! Prince Zen,
wait! Please come back!

182
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,500
Prince Zen!

183
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,000
[ZEN]
Atri!

184
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,750
It's about time!

185
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,583
You're late again today.

186
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,375
I was beginning to think you
weren't gonna make it at all.

187
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,416
[ZEN] Never underestimate
an escape artist.

188
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,125
[ATRI] But I heard you
had a bodyguard now.

189
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,625
Isn't it harder to get away?

190
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,000
[ZEN] Uh. I'd rather
not talk about that guy.

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,833
Why's that? Are you not
getting along with him?

192
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,791
[ZEN] No, I have nothing
against him, personally.

193
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,375
It's just kind of an
awkward situation.

194
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:50,041
He's been ordered to stay
by me. What do I say to him?

195
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,416
Wow. Must be hard for you.

196
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,625
Princes have it rough.

197
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,541
Why do you act like you
couldn't care less?

198
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,208
No. I do care.

199
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,500
It's just a world that
I don't understand.

200
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,875
I'm nothing but a humble
archer guard, y'know.

201
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,458
You don't understand
'cause you're dumb.

202
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,458
[ATRI] I'm handsome, so
I'm allowed to be dumb.

203
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,875
Plus, I'm a good archer.

204
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,208
[ZEN]
Oh, shut your mouth!

205
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,583
[BOTH grunt]

206
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,625
It's sad that you can't
appreciate my pretty face.

207
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,291
I pity you, Prince.

208
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,416
You're the one who's pitiful.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,583
[ZEN]
Hi-yah!

210
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,833
[ATRI]
Oh, yeah?

211
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,291
[groans]

212
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,458
[laughing]

213
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,083
Very funny.

214
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:25,958
I'll get you back.

215
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,875
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen!

216
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,750
Who's that?

217
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,833
[MITSUHIDE]
Your Highness!

218
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,166
I think your attendant's
looking for you.

219
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Where are you?

220
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,250
[ZEN] Yeah. Sorry,
I have to go now.

221
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
[ATRI]
I'll stay up here for a bit,

222
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,375
so no one sees me come down.

223
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,333
Don't want people to find
out you're friends with me.

224
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,125
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh. Prince Zen!

226
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,666
There you are!

227
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,375
[ZEN]
Let's go in.

228
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh. Great!

229
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,750
Your highness, please
wait for me! Prince Zen!

230
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,291
If you don't mind my asking,

231
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,833
are you friends with the boy
who climbed the tree just now?

232
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,625
[ZEN gasps]
You mean, you saw him?

233
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
I did.

234
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,125
[ZEN]
He's not my friend.

235
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,250
[MITSUHIDE]
What?

236
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,791
I'm not allowed the
luxury of friends.

237
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,125
Just stay out of it from now on.

238
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,375
I didn't mean to interfere.

239
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,041
And another thing.
You and I aren't friends.

240
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,958
You're only an attendant.

241
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,625
Don't forget that.

242
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,875
Understand?

243
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,041
All due respect...

244
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,125
You don't have to be cruel to
me. I'm still a human being.

245
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:46,250
[gasps] You mean, I hurt you?

246
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,625
You did. I'm not immune.

247
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,541
[ZEN] Sorry. I just
thought it was obvious.

248
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,250
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

249
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,375
[ZEN]
Forgive me. I meant no harm.

250
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,625
[MITSUHIDE] He was only a
boy, and didn't know better.

251
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,541
Zen bore an immense burden,

252
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,541
but back then I had
no way of knowing.

253
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,041
I would find out soon.

254
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,875
And it would be worse
than I imagined.

255
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,083
[ATRI] So that guy your brother
hired to be your attendant.

256
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,416
His name's Mitsuhide, isn't it?

257
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
[ZEN]
Yeah.

258
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,625
[ATRI] The soldiers all seem to
be talking about him these days.

259
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,791
Young guy. Just showed
up out of nowhere.

260
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,666
He's different.

261
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,041
Not like anyone I've ever known,

262
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,750
so I don't know how
to deal with him.

263
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,375
Soldiers and retainers are easy.

264
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,750
But he's straightforward,
which is weird.

265
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,250
[ATRI] I hear the guy knows
how to use a sword, too.

266
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,125
[ZEN growls]

267
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,208
Guessing he always beats you?

268
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,750
Oh, shut up.

269
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,166
You know you can't hide
anything from me, Prince!

270
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,416
I always know exactly
what you're thinking.

271
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
[ZEN]
Hm?

272
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,291
Seriously? No one talks
to me like that.

273
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,583
Why? Is that because I'm right?

274
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,500
Wow!

275
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,250
What did you use to
make this sandwich?!

276
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,666
I don't have a clue.

277
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,041
I just snuck into the mess hall

278
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,916
and threw whatever they
had onto some bread.

279
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,375
Is it bad?

280
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,333
No. It's pretty
delicious, really!

281
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,541
[ZEN] You're good at
working with your hands.

282
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,250
[ATRI]
Hm?

283
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,166
Honestly, the time I get
to spend out here with you

284
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,166
is the highlight of
my day. I mean it.

285
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,500
If you've fallen in love with me

286
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,166
I have to say I'm
not interested.

287
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,250
Don't worry about that.

288
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,875
You're not woman enough for me.

289
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,791
[BOTH laugh]

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,541
[ATRI]
Prince Zen?

291
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,583
Yeah?

292
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,250
Well, they put me on the
night shift after today.

293
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:13,291
So I won't be able to see
you in the daytime anymore.

294
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,208
I wanted to ask, though.

295
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,458
Think you'll be able to
sneak out here at night?

296
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,625
What'd I say?

297
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,125
Never underestimate
an escape artist.

298
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,458
[MITSUHIDE] Atri the archer
guard first came to the castle

299
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,583
about four months ago.

300
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,000
He and Prince Zen are
roughly the same age.

301
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,500
They're probably
meeting in secret

302
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,666
because their social status
means they can't be friends.

303
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,916
[MITSUHIDE] The soldiers
tell me Atri's nothing more

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,708
than a regular kid who emigrated
here from somewhere far away.

305
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,500
[MITSUHIDE] But something
about him bothers me...

306
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,041
I'm going to look
into this a bit more.

307
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,916
Why are you crouched down in the
middle of the hall like that?

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,833
Uh... Oh! Prince Zen!

309
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,000
Hi! How long have you
been watching me?

310
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,791
[ZEN sighs] Long enough
to think you're weird.

311
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,125
I wonder if it's
getting cold at night.

312
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,000
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh. Yes, I believe so.

313
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,375
[ZEN]
You know,

314
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,666
I understand why I can't be
friends with commoners.

315
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,375
I have to protect my
position and authority.

316
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,791
But how am I supposed to know
how close is too close?

317
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,583
My brother does it well.

318
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,208
He strikes a good
balance with everyone.

319
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,291
Maybe I should just copy him.

320
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,041
Then I wouldn't have
to figure it out.

321
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,125
Zen.

322
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,166
[ZEN]
No, stop. Don't say anything.

323
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,375
I'm fine.

324
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,208
It's just something
I've got to work out.

325
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,958
Don't worry about it.

326
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,625
[ZEN] You can go back
now if you want to.

327
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,125
[MITSUHIDE] I think I'll
stay here with you.

328
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,875
[IZANA]
This boy's an archer guard?

329
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,708
You're right. It's not
especially hard for

330
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,333
a foreigner to get a position
like that at the castle.

331
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,750
[MITSUHIDE] Even though he can't
gain access to the interior.

332
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,666
He can still pose a
significant threat

333
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,875
by having minimal
contact with Zen.

334
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,166
[IZANA]
Mm.

335
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,916
I've been able to get more
information on him.

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,541
I think the situation here
is a real cause for concern.

337
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,291
I'm glad I assigned a man
like you to this post.

338
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,041
It had been vacant
for quite a while,

339
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,416
but you were definitely
worth waiting for.

340
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,708
I'm honored, your grace.

341
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,291
Zen is rebelling.

342
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,541
He's in a phase where he thinks
he doesn't want to be a prince.

343
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,708
This boy, Atri. You say he
switched to the night shift?

344
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,333
That's what I've been told.

345
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,375
Uh!

346
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,125
[ZEN]
Atri. What--

347
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,500
[gasps]

348
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,708
Prince.

349
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,916
You came.

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,625
[ZEN] What happened
to you?! Who did this?!

351
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,541
Glad you could make
it, Your Majesty.

352
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,875
[ZEN groaning]

353
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,916
It wouldn't be wise of
you to run, Prince Zen.

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,166
Aren't they cute together.

355
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,791
Hey, what the hell?

356
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,416
Stop messing around.

357
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,208
You didn't have
to do this to me.

358
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,625
Atri?

359
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,375
We couldn't afford to risk
you letting your feelings

360
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,791
get in the way of our cause
this late in the game.

361
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,333
Don't insult me.

362
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,166
I'm the reason we've
gotten this far,

363
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,375
my resolve is as strong
as anyone here!

364
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,208
[gasps]

365
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,333
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen!

366
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,833
[REBELS murmur]

367
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,708
[MITSUHIDE] Your Highness!
What are you miscreants doing?

368
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,250
[REBEL LEADER] You must
be the infamous attendant.

369
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,833
We just need to talk
to Prince Izana.

370
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,083
[MITSUHIDE]
Oh yeah?

371
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,250
You are going to bring
him out here right now.

372
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,875
If you want us to give Prince
Zen back in one piece, that is.

373
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,833
[IZANA] Why don't I
save you boys a step?

374
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,875
[REBEL LEADER]
Uh?!

375
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,833
[REBEL LEADER]
Izana? But, how?

376
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,666
I bet he knew what was
going on. He's smart.

377
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,041
[ZEN]
Lord Brother.

378
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,666
[IZANA] Tell me who you are
and what it is you want.

379
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,291
[REBEL LEADER]
I refuse to tell you anything

380
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,750
until you lay down
your sword, Izana.

381
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,583
[IZANA]
I asked you a question.

382
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,916
[REBELS murmur]

383
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
We are all that remains
of the Lido family

384
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,833
you decimated with your schemes.

385
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,208
[gasps]

386
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,666
[REBEL LEADER]
Prince Izana.

387
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,833
Do you have any idea
how many of the people

388
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,250
who served our family
lost their livelihood

389
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,791
as a direct result
of what you did?

390
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,791
[IZANA] No, I'm not aware
of the exact numbers,

391
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,166
but I do know what kind
of people they were.

392
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,500
Those fools allowed
themselves to be victims,

393
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,750
to be used as pawns in
their lord's machinations.

394
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,791
They stole from good people
to line their own pockets.

395
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,000
[REBEL LEADER]
What did you say?

396
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,583
[IZANA]
I have agents in your country

397
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,875
who care more about your
people than you do.

398
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,458
As we speak,

399
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,166
those forces are winning your
citizens' loyalty for Clarines.

400
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,958
All the while you imbeciles
waste your time.

401
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,750
Your revenge mission
is quite futile.

402
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,416
How dare you?!

403
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,416
Atri! We don't need Zen anymore.

404
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,708
Kill him.

405
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,375
I'll deal with Izana myself.

406
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,750
Watch.

407
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,625
[MITSUHIDE gasps]

408
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,541
[REBELS groan]

409
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,333
[REBELS scream]

410
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,916
[gasps] You're done!

411
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,458
[REBELS yell]

412
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,833
[REBELS groaning]

413
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,583
Atri. Is it true?

414
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,541
You were a Lido rebel all along?

415
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,375
Yes, I was.

416
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,208
Now, all that I have left to
do is eliminate my target.

417
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,416
Tell me why!

418
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,541
[ATRI] I saw it from
the moment I met you.

419
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,958
My people and I were
pathetic by comparison.

420
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,000
[REBEL M yelps]

421
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,750
[ATRI]
You had everything I didn't.

422
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,500
A roof over your head.
All the food you could ever eat.

423
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,583
And the way you smiled at me.

424
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,291
You were born into a life I'd
never know no matter what I did.

425
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,208
It disgusts me that you did
nothing to deserve this.

426
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,250
You took things for granted,
and you'll die for it!

427
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,083
[ZEN whimpers, exhales]

428
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,250
No matter what
you think of me...

429
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,958
...you were my friend.

430
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,375
And that's how I'll
remember you.

431
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:54,916
[IZANA]
Mitsuhide!

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,541
[REBEL N groans]

433
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,708
[MITSUHIDE grunts]

434
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,166
[MITSUHIDE growls]

435
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,666
[ATRI]
Uh!

436
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,166
Someday you'll get yours.

437
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,250
[ZEN]
Atri.

438
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,375
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,333
Don't be sorry.

440
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,000
It's for the best.

441
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,291
It... It's so easy
to read your face.

442
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,416
You should really watch that.

443
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,583
And don't let this
get you all sad.

444
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,958
No!

445
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,958
I wonder, Prince, if... if you
hadn't been born into this,

446
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,000
would things have
turned out better?

447
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,708
[ZEN whimpers]

448
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,666
[MITSUHIDE]
He was still so young back then.

449
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,625
Barely more than a child.

450
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:19,291
Yet he bore a burden which
many adults couldn't carry.

451
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,166
I had no idea how
much he was hurting.

452
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,875
He stifled his cries and
learned to live with his pain.

453
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,291
That kind of burden is the
true birthright of a prince.

454
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen can't help it
that he's always been a prince

455
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,916
and that some people will always
try to take advantage of it.

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,083
[OBI] Master, I never noticed
how beautiful your eyes are.

457
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,375
[KIKI]
Stop it, that laugh is creepy.

458
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,333
[OBI] Boy, is this a
problematic place to spectate.
