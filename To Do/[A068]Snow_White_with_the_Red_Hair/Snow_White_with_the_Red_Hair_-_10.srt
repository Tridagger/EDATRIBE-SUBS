1
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right. Now I'm done.

2
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,166
That's quite a haul
you've got there.

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,958
Working too hard as usual?

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,375
Hi, Obi!

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,458
Oh, wow! You're in uniform.

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,250
[OBI] They're having special
guests at the castle today,

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,208
so the master said I had to be.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,875
But it feels weird. I'm not used
to wearing such fancy clothing.

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,916
I'm still tryin' to keep
up with all the rules

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,541
they have around here.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
I feel the same way,

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,000
but I'm determined to
stay on this path.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu! Are you ready yet?

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:50,000
It's about time to
go back! Hey, Ryu!

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,666
[OBI] I don't think
he can hear you.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,625
[bird chirps]

17
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,375
After all, the view
at my side is beautiful.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,291
[SHIRAYUKI] And I know
there's even more scenery

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,375
down the road waiting for me.

21
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,833
[whistling]

22
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,583
[bird chirps]

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,041
[RYU gasps]

24
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
C'mon, Ryu! It's time to go!

25
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,000
[RYU]
Uh?

26
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,458
[whistling]

27
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,708
[SHIRAYUKI, OBI]
Uh?

28
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,250
Did she call that
bird with a whistle?

29
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,958
Sure looked like it.

30
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um, thank you very much, miss.

31
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,583
You got Ryu's attention.

32
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,208
Look at your red hair.

33
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,625
I've never seen
anything like it before!

34
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,541
I know, I get that a lot.

35
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,875
Speaking of surprises,

36
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,416
that was amazing what you
just did with the bird!

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,375
You're the first person
I've actually talked to

38
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,750
since I arrived. I was a
ball of nerves until now.

39
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,125
What are you here for?

40
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,000
It's sort of a business meeting.

41
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,625
I have to speak with the Second
Prince about something big.

42
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,083
You're meeting Prince Zen?

43
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,791
Are you one of the guests
he said was visiting today?

44
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,583
[KIHAL]
I don't think so.

45
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

46
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,625
[KIHAL]
This is great.

47
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,500
I could really use
someone to talk to.

48
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,125
Do you have an extra
minute by chance?

49
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,791
[SHIRAYUKI] Um, I still
haven't finished my shift.

50
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,916
[RYU] Don't worry,
we're not in any rush.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,416
It's almost your break time,
anyway. I'll go back first.

52
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,750
Thanks!

53
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,583
[KIHAL]
So, what's your name?

54
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,000
[SHIRAYUKI] 
Shirayuki.

55
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm an apprentice court
herbalist here at the castle.

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,875
Nice to meet you,
I'm Kihal Toghrul.

57
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,875
But I'm not good at this formal
stuff, so call me Kihal.

58
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,083
Oh! And over there's
my good friend, Popo.

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're friends with it?

60
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,166
That's the most beautiful
bird I've ever laid eyes on!

61
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,458
I raised Popo, but on
the island where I live,

62
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,541
there's an entire flock
of birds just like him

63
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,125
living in the wild.

64
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,750
Now that you mention it, I think
I've heard of those birds.

65
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,541
On one of Clarines'
southern islands,

66
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,708
the people live and work
side by side with them.

67
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,250
Wait, then are you
from that island?

68
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,041
Yes. My family has been
there for four generations.

69
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,750
All the birds we live with are
the same species as my Popo.

70
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,458
When they spread their
blue- green wings,

71
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,000
they're magnificent!

72
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,500
It looks like the
whole sea is flying!

73
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,791
The birds hear everything from
up in the sky to under the sea,

74
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,083
and by listening to the
sound of the waves,

75
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,083
they can find the mineral
ores near the island.

76
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,250
They even know where
schools of fish are,

77
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,041
so we're always together
when we go out on the ocean!

78
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,125
Here's the mineral ore from
the sea, the walnut stone.

79
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,208
Look how shiny it is
once it's polished!

80
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,833
That's the whistle I heard!

81
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,625
Yes. The birds are
why I've come.

82
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,458
Our island is part
of another territory.

83
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,583
A year and a half ago, a new
lord inherited the lands.

84
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,750
He brought some of his
noble friends to visit.

85
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,708
And they hunted all the
birds they could find.

86
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's horrible.

87
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,375
[KIHAL]
I know. His friends loved it.

88
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,666
The birds' feathers
are very rare,

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,666
so they thought they could
get rich selling them.

90
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,250
I can't even think about
it without feeling sick.

91
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,291
[OBI]
Uh?

92
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,166
Once, they even targeted
Popo during a hunt,

93
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,708
and they almost killed him.

94
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,916
We've pleaded with them
so many times to stop.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,333
But they just keep shooting.

96
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,458
The lord told us we needed to
go talk to the prince about it.

97
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,291
That maybe he would care enough
to give us the time of day.

98
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,750
But I have a feeling,
even if I ask him,

99
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,916
he won't do anything, either.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,083
He'll probably just laugh at me.

101
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:12,166
Those higher classes do like
to look down on folks like us.

102
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,750
So you know,

103
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,166
that's not how I would describe
Prince Zen's character at all.

104
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,833
[KIHAL] Uh? Uh... Wait.
No, I don't believe you!

105
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,500
He's nobility, royalty,
even! He has to be awful.

106
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,291
But he's not.

107
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,833
[KIHAL]
Uh?

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,291
I'm very sorry.

109
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,541
It's just that everyone
is counting on me.

110
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,375
But, I'm not even
sure what to say.

111
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,500
[sniffs] I-I didn't
mean to bother you.

112
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,208
You didn't, but I
have to get back.

113
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,333
[KIHAL] Can I stay here until
I meet with the prince?

114
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Of course.

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,250
[whistling]

116
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,916
[ZEN] I understand what
you're asking of me.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,041
If I would make bird
hunting illegal,

118
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,625
and make Yuris Island
a nature reserve.

119
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,000
[KIHAL]
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,833
[ZEN] I'll consider it.
Expect my decision tomorrow.

121
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,375
However, weighing the evidence, 

122
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,916
I believe this should
be discussed

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,916
and settled among
the concerned parties,

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,750
Lord Brecker of Yuris Island,
and its resident, Kihal Toghrul.

125
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,583
[KIHAL]
Mm.

126
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,291
[BRECKER laughs]

127
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,041
Pardon my amusement.

128
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Highness, I do not
wish to waste your time

129
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,208
with such a trivial matter.

130
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,583
We understand each other
now, don't we, Toghrul?

131
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,375
Miss Kihal, a room
is prepared for you.

132
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,791
Please, make yourself at home.

133
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,083
[footsteps]

134
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
What did he say?

135
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,875
That the parties concerned
should discuss it.

136
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
I see.

137
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,583
[OBI] Worrying about this
isn't gonna do you any good.

138
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,041
Some herbs are protected

139
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,708
because of their unique
and special benefits.

140
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,750
Maybe the birds have something
equally special to offer.

141
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,083
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

142
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,875
[MITSUHIDE] Even if the birds
are important to the residents

143
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,458
of the island, the lord
obviously doesn't care.

144
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,833
For him, it's all about hunting

145
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,250
with his rich friends on
his land. End of story.

146
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,875
The island's mineral
ore is walnut stone.

147
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,833
Unfortunately, it's
not worth very much.

148
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,583
My hands are tied.

149
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,333
This is well within the lord's
rights, he and I both know it.

150
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,958
[KIKI] Hold on. What is this
trinket Lord Brecker brought?

151
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,916
[ZEN] Oh. It's a decorative
arrow souvenir.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,666
He never thinks to
question himself.

153
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,291
Men like that believe
their opinions

154
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,458
should just be accepted as fact.

155
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,958
[MITSUHIDE]
I'm curious,

156
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,041
why did the viscount bring
this to you in the first place?

157
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,375
[ZEN] Probably as a gesture of
good will and a formal greeting.

158
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,291
I'd never met him before today.

159
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,541
Uh-oh.

160
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,333
I hate to say it, but
you're being used, Zen.

161
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,500
Oh, just shut up.

162
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
Yeah, shut up.

163
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,291
Uh! Aren't you supposed
to back me up here, Kiki?

164
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,625
[ZEN]
All right, enough.

165
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,250
The point is, I wish I
could help that girl.

166
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,083
What the lord's been
doing is simply wrong.

167
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,958
[OBI]
May we enter?

168
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,791
[ZEN]
Shirayuki?

169
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,750
Zen, there's something
I'd like to ask.

170
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,458
So, Kihal, is it true that
with one whistle signal,

171
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,125
the bird will fly in any
direction you choose?

172
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,708
[KIHAL]
Yes, sir.

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,708
Everyone who has trained on the
island can do the same thing.

174
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,666
[ZEN] Can you send
it a great distance?

175
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,166
Certainly.

176
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,666
We often send them out to
fishing boats on the open water.

177
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,333
How do they know
where the boats are?

178
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,000
[KIHAL]
We use this.

179
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,000
[ZEN]
A bell?

180
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,000
[KIHAL]
Right.

181
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,416
These ones made
from walnut stones

182
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,125
each have their
own unique sound.

183
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,958
The birds can detect
the slightest nuance

184
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,416
in tone from bell to bell.

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,625
If they hear the ring
of the bell in advance,

186
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,458
they will land wherever they
hear that sound coming from.

187
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,000
Fascinating.

188
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
If at all possible,

189
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,333
I may want to use them as
a means of communication.

190
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,541
[KIHAL] Uh! Why would
you need that here?

191
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,750
[ZEN] Because of
another little birdie.

192
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,625
She said the ability
to control them

193
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,875
could have other
positive applications.

194
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,666
So I figured, if we can use
them for communication,

195
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,958
it would benefit the
kingdom in a new way.

196
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,500
It's definitely
worth investigating.

197
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
Let's test it over
a long distance.

198
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,041
Are you willing to help me?

199
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,458
Why a test?

200
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,041
Well, I'd like to see for
myself how well it works.

201
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,583
You mean, at the castle?

202
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,208
[ZEN]
That's right. Tomorrow evening.

203
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,875
I'll do it.

204
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,791
May I choose an assistant
to ring the bell, though?

205
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,208
Yes, I suppose that's fine.

206
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?! I have to ring it?

207
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Please, I'm begging you!

208
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,833
I know this is asking a lot,

209
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,625
but right now the castle still
seems like it's my enemy!

210
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
What do you mean by that?

211
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,166
I realize this was
the prince's idea,

212
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,166
but I still don't
really trust him yet.

213
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,125
Since you seem to have
so much faith in him,

214
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,666
then I would rather
work with you first,

215
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
so maybe I can learn
to trust him!

216
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, if you think that'll help!

217
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,541
[gasps] Oh, thank you!
Thank you, Shirayuki!

218
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,791
[OBI]
Heh.

219
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,500
[ZEN] The test will
proceed as follows:

220
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,708
The bird will be sent
bearing a document,

221
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,250
to a point ten kilometers
west of the castle,

222
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,750
at a lakeside watchtower

223
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,875
that would normally take
40 minutes, if by horse.

224
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,833
The assistant at the watchtower
will receive the document,

225
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,416
sign it, attach the bell,

226
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
and send the bird
back to the castle.

227
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
This must all occur within
no more than 25 minutes.

228
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,041
If all conditions are met,
then we've succeeded.

229
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,666
If not, this test will be
considered a failure.

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,458
To complete that whole
distance in only 25 minutes?

231
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,125
But it's only to the watchtower.

232
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,916
It's not just there, it's
there and back, moron.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,541
[ZEN] The bird handler
will be Kihal Toghrul.

234
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,375
Shirayuki will assist her.

235
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,375
Only three soldiers and a
messenger will accompany her

236
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,500
to the watchtower.
That is all.

237
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:12,000
[BRECKER] Hm? The little
apple-haired urchin?

238
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,416
[laughs] That's adorable.

239
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,791
I was wondering why
something so ridiculous

240
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,125
was brought up out of
the clear, blue sky.

241
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,416
You got the prince's
friend on your team, huh?

242
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Clever girl you are, Toghrul.

243
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,041
The prince's friend?!

244
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,208
What are you implying?!

245
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,208
[ZEN]
Lord Brecker.

246
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,958
Right now, we have
only one goal,

247
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,500
to see if these birds
can benefit Clarines.

248
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,041
I would like for you to
judge this objectively,

249
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,541
as a lord of this kingdom.

250
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,208
Hm?

251
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,250
Very well, Highness,
but I think it's only fair

252
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,458
that I accompany them to the
lakeside watchtower, as well.

253
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,833
For I myself am not suspicious,

254
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,458
but if those girls behave
dishonestly in any way,

255
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,333
then it would reflect
poorly on you.

256
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,375
[KIHAL growls]

257
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,583
[gasps]

258
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,041
[ZEN]
So be it.

259
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,875
Lord Brecker, Shirayuki,
and the others

260
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,833
will head to the
lakeside watchtower.

261
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,041
The bird will be sent
at four o'clock,

262
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,000
and the test will begin.

263
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,791
[KIHAL]
Shirayuki!

264
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,291
[bell rings]

265
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,708
This is your special
sound, Popo.

266
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,958
I'll be waiting.

267
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,416
Good luck!

268
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Thanks.

269
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,125
Almost deadline.

270
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,916
Yeah. Shirayuki should be
waiting at the lake by now.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,250
It's time, Kihal. Are you ready?

272
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,583
Yes.

273
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,500
[bell tolls]

274
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,333
[ZEN] 
Let the test begin, now!

275
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Make me proud, Popo.
Shirayuki's waiting, so fly!

276
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:59,583
[whistling]

277
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,916
Such a clear sound.

278
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,666
Shall we venture outside
to wait now, Miss?

279
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Sure!

280
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,041
Uh! Lord Brecker?

281
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,291
[BRECKER] 
Spectacular view.

282
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,291
I enjoy high places
that boast a vista.

283
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,000
There are some things
people far below

284
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,416
are simply incapable of seeing.

285
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,250
[BRECKER]
Young Shirayuki.

286
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,083
I'd like to strike a
deal with you, my dear.

287
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,500
What?

288
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,791
[BRECKER] I've heard a bit
about you here and there.

289
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,500
I understand you're an
apprentice at the castle?

290
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,125
Even though you're the prince's
friend, you're still a commoner,

291
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,750
so you'll never have
access to certain amenities.

292
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,833
For example, parties that
nobles attend are off limits,

293
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,500
because you'll never
be seen as elite.

294
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,375
Due to this, not even Prince Zen

295
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,500
can continue
fraternizing with you.

296
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,541
But I can offer you my support
while under deep cover,

297
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,958
of course.

298
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,208
In exchange, I want you to
make sure this test fails.

299
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,291
That's if the bird
actually makes it here.

300
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,500
He will make it!

301
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,208
[gasps] Are you spurning
my generous offer?!

302
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, you bet I am!

303
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,541
It's very important that
this test goes well!

304
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,791
[growls] Bad news,
it's not going to!

305
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,000
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

306
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
You hateful man!

307
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,333
The bell's gone!

308
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,541
[BRECKER] Stay in there
until time runs out!

309
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,791
[SHIRAYUKI groaning]

310
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,333
What are you doing?!
This is against the rules!

311
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,916
Stand down!

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,291
How dare a lowly soldier like
you question a Lord's choice?

313
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Lord Brecker!
Let me out, please!

314
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,291
[BRECKER] Listen, brat!
I stand to lose it all

315
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,625
if that sappy do-gooder
convinces the prince

316
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,291
that these birds have anything
more to offer than feathers!

317
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,791
I'm not blind. I see what
you're trying to do,

318
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,875
and I'm going to ensure you
don't get away with it!

319
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,250
I will not be made a fool of!

320
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,416
[SOLDIER C]
Huh?

321
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,875
[OBI] That's quite a
commotion up there.

322
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,541
I'll go check it out.

323
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,541
It doesn't take too much
to shut you down, I see.

324
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,916
And another thing, girl!

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,250
Don't bother whining to
the prince about this!

326
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,500
The truth is he can't afford to
take the word of a rube like you

327
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,125
over that of an esteemed subject

328
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,958
and risk causing
his kingdom strife.

329
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,000
Sadly, having no social
status usually comes

330
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,958
with painful realities.

331
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
I suppose you're right.

332
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,000
Zen will always be a prince,

333
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,583
and there will always be
rules he'll have to follow.

334
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,541
But that doesn't matter.

335
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,583
I still have to try to
do the right thing here,

336
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,375
no matter what it might cost me!

337
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,666
[BRECKER growls] Rubbish!
You have no power, girl!

338
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,291
[SHIRAYUKI] 
You're wrong.

339
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,708
True human value can't be
measured by social status,

340
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,791
it's measured by one's
depth of character.

341
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,291
Meanwhile, you've shown you
have no character at all!

342
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,458
[splash]

343
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,333
[gasps] No!

344
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,875
[gasps]

345
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,833
[OBI]
I'm coming, Miss!

346
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,375
You lunatic, what are
you trying to do?!

347
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,375
The bell got thrown
into the lake!

348
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,041
If we don't find it and ring
it, Popo won't land here.

349
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,458
[OBI] The viscount
did this, didn't he?

350
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,291
That girl jumped from
this height and survived?

351
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,916
[SHIKITO]
You're under arrest.

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Effective immediately,
Lord Brecker.

353
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,125
Then you're choosing to side
with that red-headed peasant.

354
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,083
What she says is indisputable.

355
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,333
Prince Zen won't be
convinced otherwise.

356
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,041
And, honestly, neither
will anyone else.

357
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's Popo!

358
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,500
Wait! It's flying away!

359
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,833
Hey, the bell! Where do
you think it landed?

360
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,291
Not too far away from
where I jumped in!

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,666
Only ten minutes left.

362
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,625
And there's no sign
of the bird anywhere.

363
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,750
[KIHAL]
Come on. Please, hurry.

364
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,500
[gasps]

365
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,500
[OBI gasps]

366
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,166
Any luck?

367
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,833
No, I can't find it!

368
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,625
[SOLDIER C]
Shirayuki, look!

369
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
There he is!

370
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,583
[OBI]
He came back around!

371
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,958
What is he trying to do?

372
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,416
[gasps]

373
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,166
[KIHAL]
The birds hear everything

374
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
from up in the sky
to under the sea,

375
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,416
and by listening to
the sound of the waves,

376
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,333
they can find the mineral
ores near the island.

377
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,083
Two more minutes
before time runs out, sir.

378
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,000
It's been almost 25 minutes.

379
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,958
This test might not
succeed after all.

380
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,791
[SOLDIER G] To make a bird
fly with just a sound...

381
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,875
Quiet, all of you.
I cannot hear the wings.

382
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,666
Uh.

383
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,125
[whistling]

384
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,416
[KIHAL]
Welcome back, Popo!

385
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,583
[ALL gasp]

386
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
[KIHAL]
Your highness.

387
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,833
[KIHAL]
The document and the bell!

388
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,041
[SOLDIERS cheer]

389
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,083
I have confirmed each of
the signatures as valid.

390
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,916
I can find no fault with it.

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,208
Then...

392
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,291
Clarines will now
use bird handlers

393
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,875
as a means of communication!

394
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,291
[gasps] Popo!

395
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,458
[POPO chirps]

396
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,916
Thank you so much, Shirayuki!

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,833
Your highness.

398
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,125
What is it?

399
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,333
There is a report
with the signatures.

400
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,875
[gasps]

401
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,125
[ZEN] Mitsuhide, Kiki!
Ready the horses!

402
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,166
[BOTH]
Uh!

403
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,416
[SHIKITO] "The viscount
tried to sabotage the test,

404
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,958
so I had to arrest him.

405
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,291
He is out of the picture.

406
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,000
Unfortunately, the
assistant was injured."

407
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,875
[galloping]

408
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,666
Your highness! If I may, sir.

409
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,458
I can tell you everything.

410
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,833
[HARUKA] When the viscount
asked to accompany the group

411
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,375
up to the watchtower,

412
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,041
I presumed Prince Zen would
outright refuse that request,

413
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,000
and yet he dared to allow it.

414
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,708
What do you mean, he dared?

415
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,416
Well, it seemed to
be fairly obvious.

416
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
The viscount was planning
to use Shirayuki

417
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,291
for his personal advancement
and financial gain.

418
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,875
He truly must have trusted
that girl and our soldiers

419
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,375
to have left it to them.
However, when the time comes,

420
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,416
how will he protect
what's important?

421
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,083
I doubt he's figured
that part out yet.

422
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,791
[ZEN]
I see. Thank you.

423
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,916
Please look after my
horse. I'll be back.

424
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,250
Master, Shirayuki is upstairs.

425
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,791
[SHIKITO] Then I heard
Shirayuki say:

426
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,000
There will always be rules
you have to follow,

427
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,958
whether you
like it or not.

428
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,833
She'd try to do
the right thing,

429
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,833
no matter what it cost her.

430
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

431
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,500
Zen!

432
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,583
[ZEN] 
Show me where you're hurt.

433
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,583
Zen, I, uh, sorry...

434
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,250
Wait. I'm not... I mean,

435
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,583
it's not like I was ever gonna
try to hide this from you.

436
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,916
I know how mad you'd be at me.

437
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,625
Idiot.

438
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,000
[ZEN gasps]

439
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,958
[MITSUHIDE]
To find out what happened

440
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,583
between you and Shirayuki.

441
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Be calm. No one's
gonna notice anything's weird.

442
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,500
[MITSUHIDE]
What's going on?

443
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
I should take some time

444
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,833
to really figure out
how I feel about Zen.

445
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,291
[OBI] Don't worry, Miss.
He's on his way.
