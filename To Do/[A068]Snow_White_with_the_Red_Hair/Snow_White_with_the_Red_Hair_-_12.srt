Shirayuki,

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,916
my title might not always
be able to protect you.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't care that it may
not be easy, though.

00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,875
Together, we can
weather the storms.

Later on, when Zen was leaving,

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,458
he said, "see ya later,"
like he usually does.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:43,000
And I knew, everything
would be all right.

Oh, so many people!

They look like
they're having fun.

12
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Open Castle Day? What's that?

13
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,833
Once every few years,

14
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,708
part of the castle is
open to the public,

15
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,291
and they make it
a festive event.

16
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Wow!

17
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,291
[RYU] They have all kinds of
activities for people, too.

18
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,708
[GARAK] Even so, it's business
as usual for us herbalists.

19
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,458
After you've reached
a good stopping point,

20
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
feel free to go look.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,833
Oh, Thanks!

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,833

[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

24
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,541
[ZEN] Shirayuki, that area's
open to the public,

25
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,083
so it's very crowded.

26
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:23,958
This way.

Sir!

00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,958
You can count on us!

Aw, C'mon! That's not fair.
You just stole my line!

[SHIRAYUKI panting]

37
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,000
[ZEN] Could you tell that
it was me behind you?

38
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,791
Well, your voice gave you away,

39
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,833
but why are you dressed
up as a guard?

40
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,708
I wasn't needed right away,
so I decided to go undercover.

41
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,458
I wanted to check on castle
staff, and see the citizens.

42
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,625
This lets me do both
at the same time.

43
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,583
That's very Zen of you,
but don't make anyone mad.

44
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,083
Not to mention that...

45
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,875
I wanted to spend time with you.

46
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,125
Just us two.

Uh... Uh! That's, uh.
That's nothing.

Don't worry about it.

Hey there, Shirayuki.

Zen, you can't wander off.

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,250
A reminder:

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,625
Even though the public areas of
the castle are limited today,

61
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,166
you still need to be careful
about where you go.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,708
Well, excuse me for
wanting to stroll solo.

63

Mitsuhide was getting
pretty worried about you.

that between us.

All right, it's settled then!

a small trip around the grounds.

We have all kinds of goodies!

the castle town just for today.

Well, it is almost lunchtime.

Hang on. This isn't
normal, is it?

83
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,625
Have you worn that hood before?

84
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. Though,
I don't wear it a lot,

85
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,041
I just like to avoid attention

86
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,708
when I'm in a big
crowd like this.

87
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,916

hair does kinda stand out.

Huh.

might be about to start.

problems with her hair

getting the
wrong attention?

Ah.

95
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,958
Then, I don't blame her

96
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,916
for keeping that bright
color under wraps.

97

[SHIRAYUKI]
Hm?

103
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,583
The other day, Zen
told us something.

104
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,708
Kiki, Obi, Mitsuhide.

105
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,208
From now on, I have
chosen one path.

106
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,875
The one that allows me
to be with Shirayuki.

107
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,583
And I've told her
that's what I want.

108
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,583
So, what did she say?

109
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,833
She said she'd take my hand.

110
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,500

That's so great!

111
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,833
Ah. Well done.

112
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,666
He said he wants
to be with you.

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,291
And that he'd do whatever
it took to make it happen.

114
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,083
Is that what you want,
as well, Shirayuki?

115
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,583
It absolutely is.

116
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,166
That's really great news.

117
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,125

that for you, too.

watch me win that match?

Look, I got a prize!

disappear like that!

I use a stage name so
I can feel famous.

You're a very strange man.

133
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
Couldn't care less
about the stage name.

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,708
What I wanna know is
how you acquired

skills, Obi!

time to get going.

139
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,666
Right. I'll see you later.

00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,250

I won it in the fight.
It's an imported hair ornament.

a whole a different person.

156
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,125
[IZANA] Zen, have you changed
your mind since we spoke?

157
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,083
About what?

158
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,000
[IZANA] I was wondering if you
have plans regarding the girl.

159

now's the time for this?

160

[IZANA]
Why not?

161
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,250
[ZEN] I've been thinking about
it a great deal, in fact.

162
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,958
About our future.

163
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,291
[SHIRAYUKI] Sometimes, when I
see Zen around the castle,

164
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,541
we get to have little moments
together like earlier.

165
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,333
And then when we part.

166
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,166
I still feel like he's
right there with me.

167
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
But the truth is,

168
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,125
in this castle, I'll always
be far away from him.

169
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,458
Even so, he's worth it.

170
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,458
[MITSUHIDE] Nicely done.
What's on the agenda now?

Look you, sir.

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,625
Are you trying to test me?
That would be unwise.

No, of course I'm
not, your highness!

you say such a thing?

This is a place of celebration.

It is highly inappropriate.

get to know you better...

I need something.

to go back on stage!

You heard me!
It hurts so bad.

Because it's broken.

This was my chance to shine,

going to fall in love with me!

so you can make yourself
some pretty new costumes!

204
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,625
Don't be stupid! I'm an
actress, so of course!

What?!

00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,125
I must determine whether
the prince is truly suitable

for my sweet princess.

225
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,333
A test, if you will.

226
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,833
However, the prince is always
careful, and he is never alone.

227

Are you ready to go on?

right now is playing the knight

who serves the princess.

237
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,916
The eve before the wedding,

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,125
he will test the prince's
worthiness of her.

00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
And they will have a duel to
see which one is stronger.

The princess will
make her appearance

before any of that happens, but
she only has one line to say.

You can just follow my
lead for where to stand.

Right. I think I can do it.

I need to keep my hair
covered up, though.

00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,875
Good point. Best not
to startle anyone.

I'm afraid I disagree.

almost up, princess.

hope it wasn't too severe.

must listen to me!

kissed on the back of her hand.

red there, master.

totally different lines.

kindly pray upon my sword?

of this entire performance

I'm so sorry, Miss!

It's all right.

00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,750
Good work out there.

319
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Why did Zen go on stage?

320
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,833
Ah.

321
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,333
Well, it is the
real prince's duty

322
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,416
to protect his princess, right?

323
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,208
[OBI] Your hair. The kiss on
your hand from someone else.

324
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,125
Our sweet prince was jealous.

325
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

326
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,916
Poor master. That look on his
face gave everything away.

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,958
I can read that
guy like a book.

328
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,125
He's a page turner.

329
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen has always
been honest with me.

330
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,541
About his feelings, and
especially his passion.

331
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I'll always know
how important they are.

332
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,958
After all, he inspires
them in me, too.

[AUDIENCE cheers]

334
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's so funny.

335
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,833
I never imagined we'd wind
up on a stage together!

336
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,416
[ZEN]
Seriously.

337
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,833
I'd like to watch the same play

as part of the
audience next time.

339
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Me, too.

340
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,833
[ZEN] It felt strange to play a
knight dueling with a prince.

341
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,958
I really enjoyed it, though.
I even got to keep this mask.

you wear it well.

for winning the match.

to irritate me...

00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

349
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,500
But I admit, it looks good.

350
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,041
Uh. Mm... Thank you.

351
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,875
I guess I won't
take it off, then.

352
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,583
[ZEN] Did you have to
keep your hair covered

353
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,250
when you were living
in Tanbarun?

354
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
[SHIRAYUKI] No, it was
always out in the open.

355
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,208
Even after I first moved to
Clarines, I let everyone see it.

356
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,208
[ZEN] That's true.
I saw it when we met.

357
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,541
If it's okay to ask you, there's
something I've been wondering.

358
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,708
Has it... ever caused
you problems?

359
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,708
Other than Raj, I mean.

360
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,000
At times, for sure.

361
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,000
But I figured out
how to deal with it.

362
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,375
My grandparents helped me
get through it all, too.

363
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,416
[ZEN]
Your grandparents?

364
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,666
Yes.

365
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,375
I learned so much about
how to live your life

366
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,958
from the two of them. They
were always planning ahead

367
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,375
to when I'd eventually
have to fend for myself.

368
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,208
They told me there'd be
times when it seemed

369
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,083
like I couldn't count on
anyone else in this world.

370
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,875
That's when I'd have
to take care of myself

371
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,583
and be my own strongest ally.

372
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,791
And... they were so right.

373
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,500
I understand.

374
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
Since the day I met
you, I noticed that.

375
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,000
How independent you are,

376
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,291
and how you don't like
asking people for help.

377
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,791
I guess they were the ones
who instilled that in you.

378
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,500
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

379
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,875
Though, as of late, I--

380
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,708
No. I rely on you, too.

381
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,208
[ZEN]
Uh?

382
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
I know I may not always show it,
but at this moment, I do.

383
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,625
I have for a while, now.

384
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,291
I think you bring out
the best in me!

385
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,875
[ZEN]
Really?

386
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. I'm glad I
trusted myself and stayed here.

387
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,625
Zen. Will give me
your hand, again?

388
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,250
[ZEN]
Mm?! Sure.

389
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:32,375
This is exactly where
I want to be. With you.

390
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um. Uh!

391
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,166
I'm not very good
at stuff like this.

392
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,750
Sorry if it got weird.

393
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,166
No, it's fine!

394
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,541
Yeah.

395
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,458
[CROWD cheers]

396
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,500
[SHIRAYUKI, ZEN]
Uh?

397
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
What are those?

398
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,041
[ZEN] 
It's how this day ends.

399
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,583
The Open Castle finale.

400
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,416
We wish on the lights, and
release them into the sky.

401
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,583
Would you like to go
take a closer look?

402
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm!

403
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,166
[ZEN]
Oh, Shirayuki!

404
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,333
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

405
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,791
[ZEN]
Just until we get outside.

406
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
[MITSUHIDE growls]
Zen.

407
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

408
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,416
I'm right here, calm yourself.

409
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Too late!

410
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,875
Did I or did I not warn
you to be careful

411
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,166
what you did in public?!

412
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,875
Apparently, Mitsuhide
saw the play.

413
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,833
Oh, I see.

414
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,208
[CROWD cheers]

415
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,416
Wow, so pretty!

416
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,041
[ZEN grunts]
Oh, shut up.

417
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,291
It's really kinda sweet.

418
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,541
You fuss over the Master

419
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,416
almost like you're
his father, Mitsuhide.

420
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
It's my job, and I'm
rather fond of him.

421
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,666
Remember that time
you two argued

422
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,125
and he wouldn't talk
to you for a while.

423
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
So you went on
that hunger strike

424
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,708
until he spoke to you again?

425
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,541
Come on, it was
only for one day!

426
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
It would've been two, but I
couldn't last any longer.

427
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,333
Two days?

428
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,583
Impressive, who knew
you were that immature?

429
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,875
[ZEN]
Ok, That's enough, you guys.

430
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,833
Listen. Shirayuki
already knows this,

431
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,416
but whatever the
future may hold.

432
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,208
I can't envision it without
each and every one of you.

433
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen, look, it's beautiful!

434
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,333
Is it just me, or has somethin'
changed with him recently?

435
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,625
He's just asserting himself.

436
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,958
[MITSUHIDE] You might have
to work harder. For once.

437
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,583
[SHIRAYUKI] We all chose
to travel the same path.

438
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,791
And while this moment
is truly wonderful,

439
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,375
there might be difficult
times ahead.

440
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm not too worried, though.

441
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,291
Because I know there
will be happiness.

442
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,041
[SHIRAYUKI] As long as
we continue forward,

443
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,250
joy is guaranteed.

444
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
We'll walk this path together.
