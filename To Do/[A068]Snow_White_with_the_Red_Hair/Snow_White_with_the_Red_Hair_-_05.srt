1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
It must be cold

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,166
because we're so close
to the mountains.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,125
[KIKI] Yes, this place is a
far cry from sunny Clarines.

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,208
[MITSUHIDE] I wish we
could take you all the way.

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,000
We do feel guilty about that,

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,125
but we need to get
to Laxdo quickly.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,250
There's no reason
to feel guilty.

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,833
I'm just happy you're
taking me as far as you can.

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,458
I can't believe they sent
you all the way to Laxdo.

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,041
Seems like being a court
herbalist is hard work.

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,833
I'm grateful for it, though.

12
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,875
Plus, I like that I get to
spend so much time outside.

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,625
By the way, we told Lord Haruka

14
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,208
that you'd been granted a
position inside the castle.

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,083
He said "congratulations",
right?

16
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,125
[MITSUHIDE] Yeah, but the
sarcasm was palpable.

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,333
[KIKI]
He's interesting.

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,625
He can't hide what
he's thinking,

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,041
so it's funny when he tries.

20
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Yeah, that's true.

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,916
Zen. Why the big hurry?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,875
Is there something wrong?

23
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,250
Well, it is a routine
fort inspection.

24
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,500
But we're a little worried

25
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,791
since we haven't heard
from them in a while.

26
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,250
I suppose this is where
we all part for now!

27
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,208
Are you sure you'll be
all right in this cold?

28
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah!

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,291
[ZEN]
See you soon.

30
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,958
[horse whinnies]

31
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,250
[ZEN] We can learn so
much from the outside.

32
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,291
Wait!

33
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,250
Take care of yourself!

34
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,625
[ZEN] Experiencing this
country in a new way.

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,708
Encounters with people
that make this land home.

36
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,291
Discovering feelings
we never knew existed.

37
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,250
It's strange that no one
seems to be on watch.

38
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,583
Hey! Is anyone there?

39
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,125
We're from the
royal guard. Hello?

40
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,916
Be right there!

41
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,750
[panting, yelps]

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,166
[MITSUHIDE]
Whoa, easy there.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,375
[SHUKA gasps]
You're all here.

44
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,750
Your Highness came, too?

45
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,875
We haven't been getting
routine reports.

46
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,666
I grew concerned.

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,500
You have to leave!

48
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,208
[OBI]
Master!

49
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,000
[ZEN, MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,666
[SHUKA yelps]

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,208
It looks like everyone
inside the fort is asleep.

52
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,125
Asleep?

53
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,500
Um, I've never seen you before.

54
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,625
I'm Obi, the prince's attendant!

55
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,791
Not quite. Your trial
period isn't over.

56
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,541
Come, on. How much longer

57
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,125
am I gonna have to keep
proving my loyalty to you?

58
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
[ZEN] For as long as
it takes. I'm going in.

59
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,625
[gasps] Wait! You can't!

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
The entire place
has been possessed

61
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,250
by some kind of evil spirit!

62
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,833
Evil spirit?

63
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
[SHUKA] It started
about three weeks ago.

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,125
One by one all the men
began feeling strange.

65
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,458
They said their limbs
felt weak and heavy

66
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,458
and that their
vision was blurry.

67
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,250
Everyone started getting
dizzy and losing their balance.

68
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,000
We called a doctor to help, but
he ended up falling sick, too.

69
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,666
We couldn't
pinpoint a cause,

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,208
so it's gotta be the work
of some evil spirit.

71
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,458
Are you ill?

72
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,583
I feel better than anyone
else around here.

73
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
But still,

74
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,958
I was in no shape to venture
out in search of more help.

75
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,375
[ZEN] I'd like to go in
and take a look around.

76
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,166
[OBI gasps]

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,208
No, you can't!

78
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,625
If it's contagious,
you'll get sick!

79
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,958
I've been exposed already,
but... I'll be careful.

80
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Get some rest, you've earned it.
We'll take over from here.

81
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,208
[whimpers] Yes, sir.

82
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,291
Zen. You should try to
get back out by sunset.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,333
[ZEN]
Right.

84
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,333
Mitsuhide, don't let
anyone else in.

85
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to keep
contact to a minimum.

86
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:54,750
Of course, sir.

87
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,166
[OBI]
Please, Master,

88
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,791
do you really think going
in there is the best idea?

89
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,458
There's just too much at risk!

90
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
I'm willing to take that
chance at this point.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,916
These soldiers need us
to find a solution.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,708
We can't stop him?
This is crazy!

93
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,875
He'd do anything
for his soldiers.

94
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,333
Hold on a second.

95
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,333
Why aren't you advising him?
That's your job, isn't it?

96
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,208
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes. That is my job.

97
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,000
[OBI]
Hm...

98
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,625
[ZEN] Nothing in here seems
out of the ordinary to me.

99
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,958
[OBI] What if the illness really
is the work of some evil spirit?

100
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
You believe in
that kind of thing?

101
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,750
I'd rather fight ghosts
than a disease.

102
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,958
[OBI]
Uh...

103
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,916
[KIKI]
This must be the armory.

104
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,458
I don't see why it would
be affec... ted...

105
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,541
Oh.

106
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,041
You mean it was empty?

107
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,708
[OBI] Yes, and I'm
pretty sure that boy

108
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,333
didn't know anything about it.

109
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,791
There were claw marks, too.

110
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,250
Someone used that illness as
a chance to rob the place.

111
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,666
Shall we shift our focus
to hunting bandits?

112
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,166
That's my specialty, you know.

113
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,375
[ZEN]
Put those away. Right now...

114
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,375
A specialty?

115
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,125
What if we brought Shirayuki?

116
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,375
She could have some insight

117
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,000
about what's causing the
soldiers to get sick.

118
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,500
Not to mention healing them.

119
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,666
Go get her.

120
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Right!

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
[KIKI] I hope he gets back
with her before night fall.

122
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,791
Hey, uh, Miss Kiki?

123
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,041
Is Mitsuhide afraid
of stating his opinion

124
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,625
around the prince
for some reason?

125
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,208
I've noticed that you
speak your mind

126
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,833
when you think it's important,

127
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,708
but Mitsuhide seems
go easy on him.

128
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,458
Huh. I wonder.

129
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
They're back.

130
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,375
[OBI]
Hm?

131
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,666
[SHIRAYUKI] Did you follow
the doctor's orders exactly?

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,583
[SHUKA]
Yes, as much as we could.

133
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,291
But there aren't enough
plants this time of year

134
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,375
to get everyone the
treatment they need.

135
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,208
[ZEN]
Wait, what do you mean?

136
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,333
Cold weather affects potency.

137
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,666
It weakens most herbs,

138
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,708
so you have to use more
to make them work.

139
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,208
Huh.

140
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,291
[SHIRAYUKI] There.
Anything else you remember?

141
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,833
No.

142
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,041
I was usually on watch outside,
so that's all I really know.

143
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,333
I hate that I can't
be more help.

144
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,583
Oh, no, please
don't feel bad!

145
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,791
I won't rest until
these men are well!

146
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,916
I'm Shuka. Just let me
know what I can do.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,875
You've done so
much already.

148
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,875
Right now, you need
to take it easy.

149
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,333
[SHUKA sighs]
Sure.

150
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,458
I think he's worse than
he was when we got here.

151
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
Zen, you have to get
some fresh air.

152
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,750
I'm worried about you.

153
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,083
I'll be all right.

154
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,750
Did you hear a word
that I just said?!

155
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,083
[ZEN] I don't like to
be outside in the cold!

156
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,625
Quit making excuses!

157
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,791
I can't leave you alone after
bringing you into this mess!

158
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
If you could help me
now, I'd let you stay.

159
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,416
You must know I want
you here with me.

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,250
But you can't get sick!

161
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,416
You should go.

162
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,583
I'll do everything I can
to help these men.

163
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,166
I won't get sick.

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,875
It's fine. I'll stay.

165
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,708
[MITSUHIDE]
Zen.

166
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,750
Uh?

167
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,750
You told Kiki you'd
be out by sunset.

168
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,583
As prince, it's your
duty to stay healthy.

169
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh!

170
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,916
[ZEN] I was being
selfish. Forgive me.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,791
Let me know if anything changes.

172
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
[footsteps]

173
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,541
[MITSUHIDE]
I was impressed back there.

174
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,458
You let logic win over
your stubbornness.

175
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,916
[ZEN]
You were right. Again.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,708
No need to sulk about it.

177
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,625
I understand that you're just
concerned about Shirayuki.

178
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,916
But you really should trust her.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,166
She knows what
she's doing in there.

180
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,583
[ZEN]
I know.

181
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,458
On an entirely
different note,

182
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,708
I didn't know you were so
sensitive to the cold!

183
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,416
Are you sure you should be
lying down in the snow?

184
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,666
[grunts]

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,583
[ZEN] Leave me alone!
That's not what I meant!

186
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,291
Did the prince actually
listen to him just now?

187
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,833
Why does that surprise you?

188
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,375
This is what usually happens.

189
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,583
He only ever listens
to Mitsuhide.

190
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,708
Which must be because
he keeps his mouth shut

191
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,500
unless it's important.

192
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,333
That way the Prince
will take him seriously.

193
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,000
[sighs]

194
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,500
[SHUKA] Hello, Shirayuki! I was
just coming to check on you.

195
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,583
Are you sure you've
gotten enough rest?

196
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,958
As much as I could under
the circumstances.

197
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,791
Good. I haven't determined
the source yet.

198
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,250
But it seems like the
symptoms are changing.

199
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,833
It isn't progressing the way
something like this should be.

200
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,666
What would cause that to happen?

201
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,750
[SHIRAYUKI] That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

202
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,125
In the meantime,

203
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,458
I finally found the medicine
the physician was using.

204
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,125
I plan to try mixing a few
other ingredients with it.

205
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
[gasps]

206
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:06,000
[SHUKA] Ah! Hey, Shirayuki!
Are you all right?

207
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, no. Why is it
coming on so quickly?

208
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Maybe it varies per person?

209
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,250
I wouldn't know.

210
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,750
[gasps] Wait a second.

211
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,625
Shuka, you said you spent a
lot of time outside on watch,

212
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,333
didn't you?

213
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
Um. Yes.

214
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Then that means the source

215
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,541
must be something in this room.

216
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
The closer they are to the fire,

217
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,250
the worse their symptoms are.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,666
It's really cold
out here tonight.

219
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,666
[ZEN]
Indeed.

220
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,458
[door opens]

221
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,500
[SHIRAYUKI panting]

222
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,791
[ZEN]
Shirayuki? What's wrong?

223
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, don't worry.

224
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,875
I've just been too
close to the fire.

225
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,250
That's the source.
It's coming from the wood.

226
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,625
[ZEN, MITSUHIDE gasp]

227
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Burning it
releases harmful particles.

228
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,291
Particles that are
toxic to breathe.

229
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,458
They cause the same
symptoms, too.

230
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,833
[ZEN] Where did
the logs come from?

231
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
From a band of travelers.

232
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
That's what Shuka said.

233
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,333
They left them here at no cost

234
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,291
because they were
too heavy to carry.

235
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,500
[SHUKA]
Your Highness, I'm so sorry!

236
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,083
Don't worry. Are you
feeling better, at least?

237
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,000
[SHUKA] Uh. Yes! The medicine
Shirayuki gave me did wonders!

238
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,666
Thank goodness.

239
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,833
I'm so relieved that it worked.

240
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,500
[ZEN gasps]

241
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,708
You should go.

242
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,916
I'll do everything I
can to help these men.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,541
[ZEN exhales]

244
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,250
[gasps]

245
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,458
[ZEN]
You win.

246
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,583
I guess it's official.

247
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,166
You're amazing.

248
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
What?

249
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,791
Would you mind staying
here for a few more days?

250
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
I'd like for you to nurse
the soldiers back to health.

251
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes!

252
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,708
[SOLDIERS chattering]

253
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,125
[KIKI] It's amazing
they're so much better

254
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,875
after just a few days.

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
I knew Shirayuki
could handle this.

256
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,208
Yeah.

257
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Zen.

258
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,875
[ZEN]
Bandits?

259
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,125
Apparently there's a group
of them in the area.

260
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,833
They're using Laxdo
as their base.

261
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,583
So did you find their hide out?

262
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,500
I need a bit more time, but I
have an idea where they are.

263
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,833
Why don't you three let
me find them for you?

264
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,041
It's like I told you before.
Hunting bandits is my specialty!

265
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,958
I swear he's part monkey.

266
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,416
He certainly smells like one.

267
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,916
[ZEN]
Kiki, Mitsuhide.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,166
I think the four of us

269
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
need to take care of
the bandits on our own.

270
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,000
We probably shouldn't
keep relying on Shirayuki

271
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,791
to save the day.

272
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,708
[grunting, sighs]

273
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,458
So, what are you making now?

274
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,875
[SHIRAYUKI] An infusion of
medicinal herbs, wanna try?

275
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,500
Medicine always
makes me throw up!

276
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,333
[laughs] It doesn't
taste bad at all.

277
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,500
No, thanks. Hey, Shirayuki?

278
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,083
I have something to tell you.

279
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

280
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,500
Thank you for always
being so nice to me.

281
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
And there's something else.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,458
Do you think Zen is
embarrassed of this outpost?

283
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,375
[SHIRAYUKI] What would
make you think that?

284
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,291
[SHUKA] I feel like we've
disappointed him.

285
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,708
I'm scared that he won't visit
us as often because of it.

286
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Does Zen come here a lot?

287
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,333
[SHUKA] Yes, and he spends
time with us on his visits.

288
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,541
He goes out on patrols, listens
to the old soldiers' stories.

289
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,791
He even talks to
apprentices like me

290
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,625
and actually seems to enjoy it.

291
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,083
We count the days till he comes.

292
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,250
I really hope he still wants
to see us after all this.

293
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,583
[SHIRAYUKI] I don't think you
should worry about it.

294
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,125
[SHUKA]
Uh?

295
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,083
Zen doesn't abandon people.
His visits mean that he cares.

296
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,750
You should know a little illness
would never change him.

297
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
He may even come more, now!

298
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right. Glad that's done!

299
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,666
Now, I just have to write
the report for my records,

300
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,625
check on the medicine,
prepare one more batch,

301
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,291
and then...

302
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,833
--[door opens]
--[ZEN] Shirayuki!

303
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,041
[gasps]

304
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, sorry. Were you asleep?

305
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Of course not!

306
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,083
All right. Thought you'd
like to see your handiwork.

307
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

308
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hey!

309
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,375
You sure you feel well
enough to be doing that?

310
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,250
Yeah! We're doin' great, now!

311
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
So much better.

312
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,208
Although, I think I still need
routine check-ups for a while!

313
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,875
[SOLDIER A] You just want
her to take your pulse!

314
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,083
Wonderful! Prove to her you're
well by going back to work!

315
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,583
[SOLDIER A]
Oh! Your Highness!

316
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,916
[SOLDIER B]
Please pardon us!

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,250
See that? They're looking
good, thanks to you.

318
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,291
If you can handle it,
I'll be back soon!

319
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,208
Right, then. I guess I
should start cooking lunch.

320
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,958
[groans]

321
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,833
So tired...
But I'll get rest soon.

322
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,041
[OBI]
Oh, it's Red.

323
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ouch!

324
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,375
That was graceful. I
wonder what's wrong.

325
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,791
I'd help, but the prince
said not to go near her

326
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,250
without his permission.

327
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

328
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,833
There goes my job.

329
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,791
Oh! Well, this is
quite a surprise.

330
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,125
What brings you here?

331
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,000
[OBI] I'm currently serving
as Zen's attendant.

332
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,791
Interesting.

333
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,375
I appreciate your help.

334
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,166
I hope that you're
not afraid of me.

335
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,541
[SHIRAYUKI] Why would I
be frightened of someone

336
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,500
who just saved me
from a nasty spill?

337
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,750
That's silly. Bye.

338
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,125
Wait a sec.

339
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,791
You don't seem like
you're feeling very well.

340
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Please don't say anything.

341
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,833
I should tell the prince,
but I won't.

342
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
Even though he's
my boss, not you.

343
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,833
Then I suppose I owe you one.

344
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,750
Really?

345
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,333
[OBI] Does this mean
she won't tell him

346
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,541
I'm the one who
shot the arrow?

347
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,958
It's a deal. But why do you
think you need to hide it?

348
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,750
[SOLDIERS laughing]

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,541
[OBI] The soldiers seem
to be doing better.

350
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

351
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,083
But they might start
feeling bad again

352
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,083
if they're worried about me.

353
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,583
Why do I want to follow her?

354
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,375
[ZEN] You didn't find
anything in the south?

355
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,333
No, but we still have
to survey the grounds

356
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,291
from the western tower.

357
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,625
[SOLDIER C]
Your Highness,

358
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,708
I've organized a patrol
party of able-bodied men.

359
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
We await your command.

360
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,541
[ZEN] And the soldiers
are well enough?

361
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,291
Yes, sir. We owe it to
Shirayuki, of course.

362
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,041
Your men are ready to
return to our posts.

363
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,375
We'll prove that we are
worthy of your confidence.

364
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,791
Good to hear.

365
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,333
Well, don't overdo it.

366
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,916
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,125
[SOLDIER D] Oh, Shuka, uh, was
there any medicine left over?

368
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,250
No. She only makes enough
for the men on each shift.

369
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,958
I think she's starting
the next batch now.

370
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,833
[ZEN, KIKI]
Uh.

371
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,958
[SOLDIER D]
Oh, all right.

372
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,541
Is everyone still
taking the medicine?

373
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,833
[SHUKA]
Yes, sir.

374
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,500
We're already back up
to three shifts per day.

375
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,750
Right.

376
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,500
And considering each one
is every eight hours...

377
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm so blind.

378
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,416
Uh. That's 24 hours.

379
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,666
If she's always working,

380
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,916
then when does Shirayuki
get a chance to sleep?

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,375
Uh!

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,333
[knocking]

383
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,375
Uh?!

384
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen!

385
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,625
[ZEN]
Have a seat over here.

386
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...? Sure.

387
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,666
I want you to close your
eyes and count to 60.

388
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,208
Huh? Is this a joke?

389
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,375
No, it's not. Close your
eyes and don't open them.

390
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,833
But, what for?

391
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,750
Now!

392
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,041
One!

393
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,916
Ah! Eyes are closed.

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,500
[ZEN]
Two... Three...

395
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,000
Your face looks so pale.

396
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,666
Why didn't you say something?

397
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,500
[ZEN]
Mm?

398
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,458
[panting] Hi, Master.
I've got some good news.

399
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,083
[ZEN gasps, grunts]

400
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,750
[BANDITS laughing]

401
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,375
[BANDIT A] Who woulda thought
they'd fall for the firewood?

402
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,750
[BANDIT B] Now, we gotta
find the right buyer.

403
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,500
We could make some good money!

404
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,291
[ZEN]
Thanks for your confession.

405
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,416
I'll consider that
when sentencing you.

406
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,916
[BANDIT J]
Who do you think you are?!

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,291
We are soldiers
representing the crown.

408
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,541
You've broken laws.

409
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,875
And unfortunately, we
can't just let that go.

410
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,875
[BANDITS laugh]

411
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,208
Let me get this straight.

412
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,833
We're supposed to believe
you four are soldiers?

413
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,916
[BANDIT D] They brought a
lady to the party for us.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,333
What a thoughtful gift!

415
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,166
Silence. I will not allow
you to insult anyone here.

416
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,125
[BANDITS laugh]

417
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Yeah, what are
you gonna do?!

418
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,000
[ZEN] You're asking the
wrong question, friend.

419
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,166
You should be asking why I'm
taking your theft personally.

420
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,500
Why am I so angry?

421
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,416
Ask me who we must be that
we have no fear of you.

422
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,458
Who I know that you've made
suffer. What am I going to do?

423
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,125
I'm going to be the kind of
person she can believe in.

424
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,333
The kind of person she would
never want to walk away from.

425
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,041
The hell are you
talking about?!

426
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,375
Don't worry about it.

427
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,208
Just needed to get
that off my chest.

428
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,041
You wouldn't understand anyway.

429
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,250
That's enough!

430
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,833
Too slow!

431
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,333
[MITSUHIDE]
Sorry! I was listening to you.

432
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,541
Great speech, huh?
If not a little intense.

433
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,333
A little?

434
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,625
[BANDIT A yells]

435
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,875
Lucky. Wish he'd say
that stuff about me, too!

436
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,333
[BANDIT H groans]

437
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,916
[BANDIT E groans]

438
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,208
[BANDITS groaning]

439
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,541
[door closes]

440
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,958
Did I wake you?

441
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, but it's fine.

442
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,166
[ZEN] I'm sorry I didn't notice
you weren't feeling well.

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,291
I should've seen it. I wasn't
paying close enough attention.

444
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

445
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,666
But next time, please,
say something to me.

446
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,625
We can always work
out a schedule for you

447
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,291
that accommodates
proper rest.

448
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,333
No one needs to handle this
kind of situation alone.

449
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,083
You can trust me, too.

450
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,416
Will you do that?

451
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,125
It's only fair.

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,666
Yes, of course I will.

453
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,791
[ZEN] Don't be hard
on yourself, either.

454
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,958
You may be exhausted now,
but that changes nothing.

455
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,958
Everyone here was
saved thanks to you.

456
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,791
I don't believe I've
thanked you, yet.

457
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,375
I'm so grateful you came
to help. Sincerely.

458
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, you came to heal soldiers,
but you also healed me.

459
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,208
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

460
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,291
You're an inspiration, and now
I feel like I can move forward.

461
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's how I feel about you.

462
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,208
You inspire me.

463
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,750
You make me want to be
better. To give more.

464
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,291
[ZEN] I'm counting on you
to be vigilant from now on.

465
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,541
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

466
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,666
Bye, Shirayuki!

467
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,583
I'll write to you every day!

468
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,625
I look forward to it!

469
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,625
[SOLDIERS shouting]

470
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,333
[ZEN] We can learn so
much from the outside.

471
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,208
Experiencing this
country in a new way.

472
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,083
Chance encounters with all the
people that make this land home.

473
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,833
Discovering feelings
we never knew existed.

474
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,125
These moments are the
lights that never fade.

475
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,541
Greetings, Prince Izana.
Welcome back home.

476
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,458
[IZANA]
Well, hello. Little Brother.

477
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
This makes me uncomfortable.

478
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,125
[RAJ]
I can assure you,

479
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,125
I will valiantly attempt
to make her happy.

480
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,333
[SHIRAYUKI] The only thing
I can do is be myself.

481
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,250
[IZANA] Which would make him
an awfully incompetent prince.
