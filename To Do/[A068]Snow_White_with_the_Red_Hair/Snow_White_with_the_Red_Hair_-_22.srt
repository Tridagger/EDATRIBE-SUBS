1
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,416
[IZANA]
All of these are requests

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,625
for marriage
interviews with Zen?

3
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,833
Yes. Here is list of candidates

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,333
brought up by the retainers,
as well, Your Highness.

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,083
I just can't believe
how many there are.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,916
Was he passing out bouquets
on his way back from Tanbarun,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,791
because this is ridiculous.

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,458
[HARUKA] Of course, half of the
reason is likely due to the fact

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,666
that you have not held any

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,000
marriage interviews
for him yet, Highness.

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,500
Zen is of age,

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,333
so his place in line for the
throne now holds more weight

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,750
to those clamoring
for a better position.

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,791
Power has a way of motivating.

15
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,166
It's unusual for you

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,458
to defend your brother from
his duty, Your Highness.

17
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,166
[IZANA]
That's not true.

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,083
I've always been this soft
on my brother, haven't I?

19
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,583
I've had fun talking
to him recently, too.

20
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,916
[HARUKA] If you would like,
I shall inform Prince Zen

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,708
that we need to hold a marriage
interview immediately.

22
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,083
[IZANA]
All right.

23
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,166
[bell tolls]

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,416
[SOLDIER A]
Prince Zen Wisteria

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,750
has finally returned
to the castle!

26
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,041
[IZANA grunting]

27
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,250
Good to see you, Lord Brother.
We've returned.

28
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,833
Welcome home, Zen.

29
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,583
I'm glad you're all safe.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,416
I wonder, what will you do now?

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,958
[gasps]

32
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hello, Chief Garak.

33
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,041
I've returned from Tanbarun.
I can work with you again.

34
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,666
Starting right now, in fact.

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,583
Long time no see, Shirayuki.

36
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,583
Welcome back.

37
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,375
[GARAK] Have you told
Prince Izana that you're here?

38
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
I have.

39
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,166
He said that I had
done "good work"

40
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,833
and that he would like to hear
more about it at a later date.

41
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,708
[GARAK]
Great.

42
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,916
Since you've had a long journey,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,666
you should have a
lighter workload.

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,708
At least, that's what
I'd like to say,

45
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,708
but we just don't
have that luxury.

46
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,625
It certainly looks that way.

47
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,750
[crash]

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,791
[GARAK]
Uh?

49
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu!

50
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,291
Oh, no!

51
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,791
No, she's not a ghost.
Our girl's come home.

52
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,041
Shirayuki.

53
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,833
Uh! Oh, sorry!

54
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's fine.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,500
I don't think I've
ever seen this.

56
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,041
Is it for a new medicine?

57
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,000
[RYU] Yes. I thought
of it the other day.

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh... So infuse the
tartsugi herb with it.

59
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,041
You don't mind if I try
that later on, do you?

60
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,750
[RYU] No. Let me know
when you do it, though.

61
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Definitely.

62
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,250
Uh. Oh yeah, how did
the painkiller turn out?

63
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,875
[RYU]
It worked well.

64
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,958
I'll teach you the trick,
if you wanna come help me.

65
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes! I would love to!

66
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,375
Of course they're talking
herbs immediately

67
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,208
after seeing each other,
they're nothing if not reliable.

68
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,750
She's done so well.

69
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,333
I'm not sure how much longer
this apprenticeship should last.

70
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,625
So do you think she's
ready for a final test?

71
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,083
I'll have to discuss
it with Ryu, first.

72
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,958
You did it.

73
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,291
The bitterness is reduced!

74
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,916
[RYU] I just had to adjust
the boiling temperature.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
I see.

76
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,958
Oh. Looking for koko herb?

77
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,458
[RYU]
Oh, yeah. Shirayuki?

78
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

79
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,833
[RYU]
Welcome back.

80
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,750
Ryu. It's great to be back.

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,375
Thank you!

82
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,958
[gassps] Hello there, Miss Kiki.
How are you today?

83
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,958
What are you doing
out here, Obi?

84
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,166
[OBI]
Heh. Truth be told,

85
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,041
a terrifying man came
to visit the master,

86
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,666
so I decided to run away.

87
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Lord Haruka is talking
to Zen right now?

88
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
You figured that out fast.

89
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,625
Hey, so, Miss Kiki, d'ya
wanna go for a walk with me?

90
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,083
I don't.

91
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,458
[OBI] Mm. Then how else are
you gonna keep me company?

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,375
[HARUKA] Prince Izana has
also looked this over.

93
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
He said we could invite
them to the castle

94
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,291
and take care of
this all at once.

95
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,791
Are you listening,
Your Highness?

96
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,250
[ZEN] Of course I am.
I just won't do it.

97
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
[HARUKA]
Highness, please!

98
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,000
[OBI] They want to have a ball
to find a wife for the master?

99
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,500
[KIKI] Zen's gone to one
before meant for Prince Izana

100
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,750
to meet potential brides, but
he's never had one for himself.

101
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,041
[OBI]
Ah...

102
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,791
Well, this is unexpected.

103
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
Just what are you two doing?

104
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,291
Working.

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,041
[OBI]
Not me. I'm eavesdropping.

106
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,750
Please think about this
carefully, Highness.

107
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,500
This country needs your support,
as does your brother,

108
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,583
our next king.

109
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,666
[ZEN] I understand
my responsibilities,

110
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,083
and I will do what
is truly necessary.

111
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,208
That being said...

112
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,583
I have no intention
of finding a wife.

113
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,791
[HARUKA grunts]
Prince Zen.

114
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,208
[door opens]

115
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,708
[MITSUHIDE]
Excuse me, Your Highness.

116
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,916
Oh, good day, Lord Haruka.

117
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:34,250
[sighs] In any case,

118
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,041
doing nothing is not
presently an option for you.

119
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,250
[ZEN] I will not have
a ball, regardless.

120
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,750
Why would I if I'm not
looking for a wife?

121
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,333
No one's going to force
you to hold a ball.

122
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,375
However, you must, at least,

123
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,416
meet with one of
these candidates.

124
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,958
You need to demonstrate

125
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,833
that you have not completely
abandoned the idea of marriage.

126
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,541
You understand, don't you?

127
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,250
A one on one marriage
interview is even worse.

128
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,250
Uh?!

129
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,958
Now, every girl whose name is
on this list is a candidate.

130
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,083
Is that correct?

131
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,458
Of course,

132
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,875
I wouldn't necessarily
consider them equal, though.

133
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,416
You said I just had to meet
with one of them, right?

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,250
[KAI] Have you heard,
Sir?! This is terrible!

135
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,041
Why, because you have to
pay a fine? You're late.

136
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,416
No, that's not it!

137
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,041
Prince Zen is having a
marriage interview today!

138
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,708
Uh! The prince is looking
for a wife? Who is it with?

139
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,833
[KAI]
That's being kept a secret.

140
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,291
I thought for sure the prince
would get engaged to Shirayuki.

141
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,083
[SHILA] Wow, you really do
like that girl, don't you?

142
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
[KAI]
Mm-hm. [cries]

143
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,833
[SHILA] Aw, stop crying! I won't
make you pay a fine, okay?

144
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,583
[KAI cries]
Thank you, Sir.

145
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,041
You what? Seriously? Oh, my.

146
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah.

147
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,458
I overheard some servants
gossiping about it earlier.

148
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,041
[GARAK] Goodness. Prince Zen's
having a marriage interview.

149
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,000
I wonder if Shirayuki
knows about this?

150
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,333
I don't know.

151
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Excuse me.

152
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,958
[GARAK gasping]

153
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,958
I finished inventory, and we
look good, just a bit short.

154
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,250
We need shiklas seeds
and koko herb.

155
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,458
But, other than those,
we're completely stocked up.

156
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,041
Um. Right, that's great to hear.

157
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think next

158
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,333
I'll go check the medicinal
shelves' inventory.

159
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,083
Sure. Sounds good.

160
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,125
Wait, isn't that what you
just finished doing, though?

161
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,750
Uh. Right, I guess
it is. I, um...

162
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,708
How about the deliveries?

163
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

164
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,333
Shirayuki, shall I go instead?

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
No, no. I can take care of it.

166
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,291
I'm fine.

167
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,458
Excuse me.

168
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,458
I dunno. She doesn't
seem that fine to me.

169
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,125
[RYU]
Mm.

170
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:51,458
[SHIRAYUKI inahles, exhales]

171
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,666
This way, if you please.

172
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,666
Of course, Your Highness.

173
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,041
[MITSUHIDE]
Even if it's under the pretense

174
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,166
of a marriage interview,

175
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,708
I never thought
I'd witness this.

176
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,208
So strange.

177
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,458
Master said he's never been
more scared of her reaction

178
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,916
than when he asked for this.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,875
Heh. That was hilarious.

180
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,333
Maybe for you,
but I was terrified.

181
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,208
So this is a farce?

182
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,125
It's not, mostly.

183
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,916
My brother has given
his permission,

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,708
so everyone else will think
the whole thing is legitimate.

185
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,166
Besides, if you play along,

186
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,125
you'll be helping me avoid
dealing with this situation

187
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,166
for a little while.

188
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,250
Oh, and in order to protect
your position as my attendant,

189
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,333
I have already received
a pledge to keep your name

190
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,208
from being made public.

191
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,208
I believe this is
our best option.

192
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,208
Unless you wanted me
to have a grand ball

193
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,875
that you'd have to attend?

194
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,666
[OBI laughing]

195
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,750
[OBI] I had no idea that
Miss Kiki's father was a count.

196
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,250
Talk about an
unexpected surprise.

197
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,250
"Daughter of a count" sounds
pretty good on her, doesn't it?

198
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,166
[MITSUHIDE]
I don't know.

199
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,875
Even though this
is just an act,

200
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,125
those two look good
together, don't they?

201
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,375
Indeed, they do.

202
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,250
[OBI]
Mitsuhide,

203
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,333
I know you're calm right now
because she's with the master.

204
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?!

205
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,083
But if it was another
man that close to her,

206
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,500
you wouldn't be back
here with me.

207
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
You'd be over there "defending
her honor" or something.

208
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,375
Don't assume you can get away
with teasing me like you do Zen.

209
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,125
See, your problem is
you have no imagination.

210
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,250
If Miss Kiki were to
speak of her intentions

211
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,708
with some man other than you,
that would mean they'd

212
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:59,333
be there for each other, and
she'd take his side over yours.

213
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,875
But, I am just teasing you.

214
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,250
I wonder...

215
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,916
[OBI] Oh, did the atmosphere
suddenly turn violent?

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,750
[MITSUHIDE sighs]
Listen, Obi.

217
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,875
Make sure you don't
joke around like this

218
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,666
about the marriage interview
with Shirayuki, all right?

219
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,208
[OBI]
Why not?

220
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,208
Wait, has no one let her know
what's really going on, yet?

221
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,208
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh!

222
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,750
Not as far as I
know, we haven't.

223
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,875
[OBI]
Then, I shall leave this to you.

224
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,625
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh! [gasping]

225
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,083
Yes, you're welcome.

226
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,333
[sighs]

227
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,583
One more down.

228
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,333
After this, I think I
only have a few more--

229
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,041
[OBI]
Hello, Miss!

230
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,958
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]
Obi!

231
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,791
Why are you dressed
up like that?

232
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,958
[OBI]
Well...

233
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, that's right,
the marriage interview

234
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,750
must have already started.

235
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,166
[OBI]
Uh...

236
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,791
[SHIRAYUKI] But, is it all
right for you to be here?

237
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,166
Yes, about that.

238
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,166
I'm not needed since things
are going so smoothly.

239
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
They're going smoothly?

240
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,125
Oh! No, wait.

241
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,375
By "smoothly" I mean it's
because the girl...

242
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,875
[ZEN]
I have already received a pledge

243
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,750
to keep your name
from being made public.

244
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,250
Uh-oh. I don't think I can say.

245
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hm?

246
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,416
She, uh...

247
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Hey, wanna hear a joke?

248
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,958
[SHIRAYUKI] Later. I have some
work I have to finish, first.

249
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,083
Uh...

250
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,458
Not your finest moment, Obi.

251
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,750
[ZEN grunts]

252
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,083
You seem uncomfortable.

253
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,125
Not me. What about you?

254
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,666
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,083
I know you don't like wearing
dresses, even in the castle.

256
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,875
No, I don't. My sword
is farther away.

257
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,041
Don't worry though.

258
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,791
I still have a dagger on me.

259
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,291
Definitely marriage material.

260
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,833
Speaking of which,

261
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,916
you were wearing a dress the
first time you met Mitsuhide.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you remember that night?

263
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,416
Oh, yes. I certainly do.

264
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,458
It's been five years
already, huh?

265
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,583
I guess it has.

266
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,416
[KIKI]
What if I had just stayed home?

267
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,000
[LADY A] Sir Louen isn't in
attendance tonight, either?

268
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,000
He was here until
just a moment ago.

269
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,791
[sighs] I tried, but I just
don't like these things.

270
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,250
Uh!

271
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,666
Excuse me, Miss.

272
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,208
I didn't realize somebody
was already out here.

273
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,625
[KIKI] Don't apologize.
Mitsuhide Louen,

274
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,041
attendant of Prince Zen.

275
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,458
[MITSUHIDE]
Mm! You mean, you know who I am?

276
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you mind if I
ask who you are?

277
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,416
Wait for the right moment.
Then, I'll tell you.

278
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,708
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

279
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,291
I don't like these things
as well, by the way.

280
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,458
Uh! You...

281
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,041
So you heard me?

282
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,500
Well, that's perfect.

283
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,500
Mitsuhide! Are you hiding
in a corner again?!

284
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen!

285
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,541
I see. I didn't realize
you two had met.

286
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,208
Uh?

287
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,583
If you'll excuse me.

288
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,500
D'you bring her out here?

289
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,541
[MITSUHIDE]
No!

290
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,416
It's dark...

291
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,208
[MITSUHIDE]
I said no!

292
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,375
Who was she, anyway?

293
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,708
[ZEN]
Didn't she tell you?

294
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,166
[MITSUHIDE] She said she
would at the right moment.

295
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,583
[ZEN]
Hm... It's a secret.

296
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,500
It is?! Why's is that?

297
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,500
Well, truth be told, I just
met her the other day.

298
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,250
I think you should
try talking to her

299
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,833
when that moment
is finally right.

300
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,041
What is it?

301
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,541
I don't know. Just seems
you really like her.

302
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,958
I do.

303
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:25,041
Then I'll be sure to ask
her for her name again.

304
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,250
Glad you're here.

305
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,208
And sorry I asked
for this match.

306
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,083
[KIKI]
It's fine.

307
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,416
By the way,

308
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
Mitsuhide said you wouldn't
tell him your name?

309
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,958
I wanted to meet him here,
with my sword in hand.

310
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,166
Makes sense to me.

311
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,083
--[door opens]
--[MITSUHIDE] Prince Zen!

312
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,875
[ZEN] Speak of the devil,
and he shall appear.

313
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,041
[MITSUHIDE] I thought you were
planning to rest this morning.

314
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,958
Oh, right. I changed my mind.

315
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,125
Why didn't you tell me?

316
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,875
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?

317
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,708
We were just having a
little practice match.

318
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,833
Excuse me, but have we
met somewhere before?

319
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,041
[KIKI]
Mm?

320
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:05,916
[ZEN]
Huh?

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,416
I feel like we have. Uh! Sorry.

322
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
I just didn't realize
there was a noble boy here

323
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,250
this close to your
age, Prince Zen.

324
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,791
Shame I missed the match.

325
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,958
I would have liked
to've seen it.

326
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,666
I can't believe...

327
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,833
You are such a huge idiot.

328
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,375
[MITSUHIDE]
Hm?

329
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,833
[KIKI] Let's just call this
our first time meeting, then.

330
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,041
My name is Kiki.

331
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,916
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

332
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,875
[ZEN laughs]

333
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,083
He thought you were a boy
for a while, didn't he?

334
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Indeed he did.

335
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,541
He kept calling me "noble boy"
and inviting me to the baths.

336
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,625
That guy. Look at him.

337
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,000
[MITSUHIDE]
Hm?

338
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,041
He's so dense I almost feel
guilty remembering that.

339
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,375
Though, I must say,

340
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,750
he hasn't really changed
much since then.

341
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,000
Still prioritizes
you over everyone.

342
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,583
Still wears his heart
on his sleeve,

343
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,541
and is still a bundle of nerves.

344
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,875
And yet, he sees things
that are simply beyond me.

345
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,708
Things I can't even imagine.

346
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,375
This is unusual.

347
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,708
You're not normally
so open with me.

348
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,291
Well, we have spent quite
a long time together

349
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,583
while keeping an eye
out for each other.

350
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,000
Got it.

351
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,916
For what it's worth, I'm glad
you two met each other.

352
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,791
[KIKI]
So, what's next?

353
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,583
Do you have any plans
for when the effect

354
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,458
of this marriage
interview wears off?

355
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,000
No, not yet,

356
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,208
but I couldn't've had a fake
interview with anyone better.

357
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,125
[ZEN]
The intent to take a wife?

358
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,958
Whoa. The marriage
interview is already over?

359
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,083
That was quicker
than I expected.

360
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,625
But it's done and I've
managed to stall some

361
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,791
before having to hold a
grand ball to find a wife.

362
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,416
I have another
concern, though.

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,541
How many times do I have
to tell you not to run off

364
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,583
while you're on duty?

365
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,708
Sounds like someone
else we know.

366
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,583
I told you, I made a
proper request this time.

367
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,875
Oh, no, what happened, Master?

368
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,875
I left and was gone from
the castle too long.

369
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,875
So, I can't leave for a while.

370
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:16,458
All I want to do is go talk
to Shirayuki. Especially, now.

371
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,625
I want to tell her the truth

372
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,166
about the marriage
interview in person.

373
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,375
Uh... About that, Master.

374
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,875
[ZEN]
Hm?

375
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,000
[crash]

376
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,083
You what...?

377
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,500
I need you to repeat that.

378
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,041
[OBI]
I just said,

379
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,083
Shirayuki actually already knows
about the marriage interview

380
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,625
thanks to all the gossipmongers
around the castle.

381
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,833
[ZEN]
After that!

382
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,208
You mean where I sort of
mentioned I didn't tell her

383
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,958
the girl was Miss Kiki.

384
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,041
That?

385
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,708
Yes, that.

386
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,666
If you were talking about
the marriage interview,

387
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,041
why did you leave out
the most important part?

388
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,041
Uh. Because we...

389
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,500
...were supposed to hide the
fact that it was Miss Kiki?

390
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,750
Yes, but not from Shirayuki!

391
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,500
So sorry.

392
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,375
Are you all right, Zen?

393
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,625
Listen. I have to go to her.

394
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,875
I'll pull an all-nighter
if you want me to.

395
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,541
Well, don't stay out too late!

396
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,583
What are the odds this guy's
gonna get punished later?

397
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,625
A sure thing.

398
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,166
[door opens]

399
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,041
[panting] Ryu, where is she?

400
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,208
[RYU] Shirayuki?
She's in the herb garden.

401
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,291
[ZEN]
Thank you!

402
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,791
[footsteps]

403
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
Finished.

404
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,750
All that's left is to plant
the rainbow leaf seedlings.

405
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,708
[ZEN]
Shirayuki!

406
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,125
Oh, Zen!

407
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,583
[panting]

408
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?!

409
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,125
You mean your marriage
interview was with Kiki?

410
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:48,916
[ZEN]
Yes.

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
I see.

412
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,375
[ZEN]
I just wanted you to know.

413
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,916
This was... was not... anything.

414
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,583
And I am so sorry.

415
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,666
I didn't plan on
keeping it from you.

416
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,250
No, it's all right.
It didn't bother me.

417
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
[ZEN]
Uh?

418
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,750
It didn't bother you for me
to have a marriage interview?

419
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,208
Uh? Uh...! Yes, no!

420
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,666
I didn't mean it like that!

421
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,416
It's not that I had
no feelings about it.

422
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,666
Like when I first heard, my
heart wouldn't stop pounding.

423
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,916
But I also figured
you'd come and tell me

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,166
what was going on, so...

425
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
[ZEN] You were waiting
for me to come to you?

426
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,041
Uh! No...

427
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:27,958
...maybe...

428
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,500
Not technically?

429
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,916
But, ah...

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,291
I suppose...

431
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:36,916
I wanted to go see you,
but I thought I should wait.

432
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,666
All right,
everything's all right.

433
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,000
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen, you know
I'm happy, don't you?

434
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,791
I'm really happy that
you're here right now,

435
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,750
and that you're with me.

436
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,250
[door opens]

437
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,541
[IZANA]
I'm coming in.

438
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,583
[ZEN]
Lord Brother.

439
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,666
[IZANA] I thought you'd
come to ask me for help,

440
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,125
but you managed that marriage
interview yourself.

441
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,541
Tell me,

442
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,833
are you going to have one
with Mitsuhide next time?

443
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
Well, I guess I'm the one

444
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,416
who didn't take Kiki's
name off the list.

445
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,708
I want a drink. Care to join me?

446
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,083
[IZANA]
I'm curious.

447
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,750
Were you studying that book you
had open at your desk earlier?

448
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,208
[ZEN gasps]
I was.

449
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,625
I wanted to learn a little
about the situation up north.

450
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,458
You mean the one that
is my responsibility?

451
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,208
Will you come save me
if I'm in trouble?

452
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,875
If the day you ask me
for help ever comes.

453
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,000
That would hardly be
my decision, though.

454
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,833
Saving me is up to you.

455
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,291
[gasps]

456
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,375
[IZANA] Zen, you need
to understand something.

457
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,416
I'm planning to take a wife
sooner than you may realize.

458
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,458
Once that happens,
you will be next.

459
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,833
You'll be given one marriage
proposal after another.

460
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,625
Every choice you make,

461
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,541
every position you'll
eventually have,

462
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,291
and of course, where I decide
you ultimately belong,

463
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,666
they are for our kingdom,

464
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,500
for our people who put
their faith in your future.

465
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,333
You are their Prince.

466
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,791
[ZEN] Someone who cannot
handle that responsibility

467
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,750
cannot be a prince, I assume.

468
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,416
But I still want her.

469
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,250
I want Shirayuki to be my wife.

470
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,541
I had a feeling it
would come to this.

471
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,666
You should know you're
wrong about her.

472
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,083
And having that girl in my life

473
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,583
is not going to divert
me from my path.

474
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,750
Then leave her behind.

475
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,000
[ZEN]
Lord Brother,

476
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,541
I have no intention of
leaving Shirayuki behind.

477
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,541
No matter what happens.

478
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,000
I understand.

479
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,083
[IZANA]
Lift up your face, Zen.

480
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,333
[IZANA]
If that's the case,

481
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,291
then you should make
me an ally on the path

482
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,833
you and Shirayuki have chosen.

483
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,208
[ZEN gasps]

484
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,416
[MITSUHIDE]
The path ahead.

485
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,125
It will be difficult, because of
the fact that Zen is a prince.

486
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,458
[KIKI]
Your highness.

487
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,166
You still have a lot
to learn, don't you?

488
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,958
[MITSUHIDE] Shirayuki, I want
you to be sure of your decision.

489
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,541
[ZEN] I need her by my side.

490
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,041
She's the only one
I want to be with.
