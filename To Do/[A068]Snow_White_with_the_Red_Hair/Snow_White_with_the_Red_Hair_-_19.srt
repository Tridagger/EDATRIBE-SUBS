01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,583
So then,

2
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:25,541
I can go home?

01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:39,333
[jingling]

4
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,166
[gasps] Is that...

5
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,250
walnut stone?

6
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,083
From the package Zen sent.

7
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,375
He asked me to include this for
you along with his message.

8
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,916
It's so beautiful.

9
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,958
[KIKI] Apparently, Obi wound up
carrying it around with him.

10
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:53,708
We can use this
as a signal now

11
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:56,333
to let Zen know where
they're headed with us.

12
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,291
Don't let him take
full credit, though.

13
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,375
It's a gift from Kihal.

14
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,500
That's so sweet.

15
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,583
So, you said you got them
to put you here on purpose,

16
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,208
which is great and everything...

17
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:10,000
but what are we supposed
to do out at sea?

18
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,000
To start, we simply
let them sail,

19
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:16,083
and take us directly
to their base.

24
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,250
Right now?

Why would that idiot prince

26
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,166
even come to the port town?

27
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,750
[CITIZEN B] I don't know. I'm
just tellin' you what I heard!

28
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,500
That brat is such a pain!

29
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,458
You know he's just gonna demand
a bunch of women and wine.

Attention! We're setting out
to pursue the Claw of the Sea!

What?! The Claw of the Sea?

34
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,750
They're violent,
no-good pirates.

35
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,916
They've had their way
with the sea too long.

36
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,375
Right, and from what I heard,

37
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,708
they also force merchant
vessels to pay tolls

38
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,500
if they plan to use
"their" waters.

39
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:42,916
[CITIZEN B]
That's ridiculous!

40
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,291
[CITIZEN A]
And that's not all.

41
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,500
They'll kidnap people, too,

42
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:47,541
if they think they'll
fetch a good price.

43
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,666

Are you serious?

44
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,708
All those who wish
to join can follow me!

That's a great story, and all...

But some of us got

That's right, we
have our own work!

[CITIZEN A] What the hell
is Prince Raj thinking?!

01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,958
He has to know he's
no match for a pirate!

No kidding!

just standing around?

It's him!

That's the prince!

we cannot allow the Claw

So please...

I ask you to lend
me your strength.

[MUKAZE] I wonder how Prince Raj
is holding up at the port.

82
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:44,083
Tanbarun is his kingdom,
and beyond that

we can only trust him and
make sure we do our part.

What? The Lions of the Mountain?

We can't tell who they are yet!

89
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,333
If it is the Lions,

90
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:21,125
then that precious little red
head might just come in handy.

91
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:24,500

by watching their response?

I hope the Lions stay quiet.

That'll make our work
a whole lot easier.

have dear Kazuki...

Yeah. Different from
the last time I saw him.

for damn sure.

01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,958
Did Umihebi do that to you?

177
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,666
She did. But I'll be fine.

178
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,291
[KAZUKI]
Those bastards!

179
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,791
[exhales]

180
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,041
[SHIRAYUKI] It's anyone's
guess what they'll do to us.

181
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:31,958
I can't let my guard down.

182
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,833
I heard her command them to
turn and escape to the west.

183
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:36,958
Ships were approaching
from the bow?

184
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

185
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:45,833
[PIRATE B] The royal vessels
are coming after us!

186
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,416
Quit your bellyachin',
and man up!

187
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,833
We're almost to the
Blue Vortex, boys...

188
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:54,333
They can't follow us there,
no matter how hard they try.

189
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,708
We just have to stay
on top of 'em, now.

190
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,458
But look at this...

191
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:01,583
Hey! What's that?!

192
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,416
A bad omen.

193
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,375
Uh! It's too late!

194
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,458
[CITIZEN A]
All hands on deck!

195
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,041
We're too close
to the maelstrom!

196
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,291
Will someone cut the rudder?

197
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:26,583
Now! As in right now!
We're getting sucked in!

198
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,791
It's no use, Your Highness!

199
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,291
We can't move in any closer!

200
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,458
We can't?! Tell me why!

201
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,000
It's the Blue Vortex!

202
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,208
Uh!

203
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:42,708
[SAKAKI]
A cluster of maelstroms

204
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:45,500
that randomly appears
in Tanbarun's seas.

205
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,708
Unless one knows the
currents inside and out,

206
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,750
it's impossible to traverse.

207
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,125
If we simply plunged in,

208
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,958
the ship would be
smashed to splinters!

209
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,666
[whimpering]

210
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:00,833
[SHIRAYUKI screams]

211
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,875
[KAZUKI groaning]

212
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:07,833
[UMIHEBI] I bet that landlubber
prince isn't much for swimming.

213
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,458
This'll shake him.

214
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,708
I think this ought
to be far enough.

215
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,250
It wasn't a part of my plan,

216
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,125
but at least we can
hide out for a while.

217
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,958
[CREW groaning]

218
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:48,166
So, uh, are we gonna make it?!

219
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,583
Because this ship sure
is rocking a lot!

220
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,750
Didn't I did say we
shouldn't just plunge in?

221
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,500
Oh, shut up! I know
you saw it, too!

222
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,333
That stupid pirate
lady sneered at me!

223
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,041
How can a person
look that arrogant

224
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,541
while they're retreating?

225
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,041
Are you even listening, Sakaki?

226
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,291
Sire, I just remembered.
The Blue Vortex will shift.

227
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,083
It changes direction
every ten seconds.

228
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,875
If we go with the current
instead of against it,

229
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,333
then maybe...

230
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:16,750
Every ten seconds?

231
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,666
[RAJ]
Hm...

232
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:24,916
So, any idea when we
should start counting

233
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,875
for the next shift change?

234
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,416
[SAKAKI]
No.

235
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,625
[RAJ whimpers]

236
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:37,375
Listen up, men! Move the
rudder left and right!

237
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:40,083
That should get us past
this vortex to calm waters!

238
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,166
[CREW]
Yes, sir!

239
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,708

240
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,458

Left!

241
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,166
[RAJ]
Right!

242
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,750
[CREW]
Right!

243
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,583
Yes.

244
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,500
You were just making
random things up,

245
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:54,625
weren't you, Prince?

246
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:58,166
At times like this,
it's sink or swim.

247
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,666
[retches]

248
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:06,958

Don't underestimate Tanbarun...

249
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,208
Where are we?

250
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:18,583
Pretty sure the Claw
of the Sea's base.

251
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,958
I don't know the exact
location, though.

252
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:24,166
We always came in
off the water.

253
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,875
[UMIHEBI] Aw... What a
shame, my darling Red!

254
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,875
No one will be coming to save
you as long as you're here.

[PIRATE C]
Heh.

258
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,958
Now then, it's time
to seriously consider

259
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,583
what lucky buyer gets
to purchase you from me.

260
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:40,833
[PIRATE C]
Hey, Boss!

261
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:41,875
[UMIHEBI]
Uh?

262
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:45,166
Sorry, but they
followed us somehow!

263
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,916
[UMIHEBI]
They what?

264
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:56,541
Oh, come on, you've
got to be kidding me!

265
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:08,083
We did it.

266
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,000
We caught up with
them, Highness.

267
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,833
Yes, we did.

268
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:13,500
Thank you for your hard work!

269
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:16,125
Without all of you, we
would have never survived!

270
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,458
[SAKAKI]
Being swallowed up was, in fact,

271
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:19,708
the correct course of action.

272
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:21,125
[RAJ]
Ah-hem. However.

273
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:25,250
I'm afraid I must ask
for your help again!

274
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,416
Forward ho, brave gentlemen!

275
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,000
Destroy the pirate ship and cut
off their escape route at once!

Of course I am. Just...

leave my partner alone.

you want to trifle with!

do if I don't let her go?

01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,041
[PIRATES groaning]

351
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,916
[UMIHEBI growls]

352
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,875
Why don't you just
surrender, Umihebi?

353
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,375
Listen, handsome,

354
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,166
I don't know if you're some
sort of royal guard or what,

355
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,708
but you sure as hell keep
getting in my damn way!

356
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,291
Now, back off!

357
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,083
[grunts]

358
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,625
[MUKAZE]
Apologies.

359
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,125
I have a tendency to let
you slip off the hook

360
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,583
at the very last minute.

361
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:48,833
Not this time,

362
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:51,958
the day has come to haul
this catch up on shore.

363
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:53,958
No.

364
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:58,708
Damn you!

365
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:11,583
I promise, you don't have
to worry about them.

366
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,791
[door opens]

367
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,208
[gasps]

368
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:18,708
I've got good news.

369
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,541
It's over.

370
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,875
I can't believe it.

371
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:27,750
Thank you. Thank
you all so much.

372
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,875
Mihaya, wait out front
for Raj's soldiers.

373
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,208
He should have ordered them
to meet up with us here.

374
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,541
[MIHAYA]
Right.

375
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,833
Zen.

376
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,125
Obi?

377
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,666
Where is he?

378
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,875
[ZEN]
Obi's still down there...

379
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:52,375
The Claw is in custody.

380
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,125
At this point, they'll
be escorted back.

381
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:58,916
I imagine Tanbarun will
take care of it from here.

382
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,500
[MUKAZE]
Hey, Kazuki!

383
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,583
Quit pushing! Stop that!

384
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:03,625
Are you even listening?

385
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:05,250
[ZEN]
What are you doing, old man?

386
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:08,125
[MUKAZE chuckles]
I... uh...

387
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,375
You're, uh...

388
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,250
More than welcome to
rest at our village

389
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:13,208
before heading all the
way back to the castle.

390
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:16,583
I... I'd like to make it
up to you for everything.

391
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,833
Heh.

392
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,166
[gasps] You!

393
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,125
[MUKAZE]
Mm?

394
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:23,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're my father!

395
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,291
[OBI] I'm sorry.
My job was to guard you.

396
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,291
I'm ashamed of
what I let happen.

397
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:13,333
[MITSUHIDE]
Got any idea where Obi went?

398
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,250
[KAZUKI]
I was wondering,

399
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:18,458
do you think maybe you would
want to live with us here?

400
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:20,666
[OBI]
Forgive me.
