1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,333
[KIKI]
We've come quite a long way.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,458
[MITSUHIDE]
Looks like we'll be able to

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,416
reach the village by sundown.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,583
[ZEN] Raj's party will
probably reach the castle

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,250
around the same time.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Right.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,750
Although, it might
take them a bit longer

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,833
since they've got the
Claw of the Sea members.

9
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,041
Shirayuki, how are you feeling?

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,916
Shirayuki?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. I'm sorry?

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,791
Do we need to stop
so you can rest?

13
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,708
No. I'm feeling great!

14
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,750
How're you?

15
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,875
Used to this, so I'm good.

16
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,125
All right.

17
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,541
I still can't believe
he's Shirayuki's father,

18
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,916
let alone that he's
the chief of the Lions.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,666
[ZEN]
I never even imagined.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
I didn't know it, myself.

21
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,958
But he really is my father.

22
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,958
You were just as
surprised, then?

23
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm. I had no idea who he was.

24
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,041
Hey, after we get over
the mountain pass ahead,

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,875
we'll be there.

26
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,458
You'll see our village soon!

27
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,791
[ZEN]
Got it! Sounds good!

28
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,500
Well... Shall we?

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
[MAN A]
The Claw of the Sea has fallen!

30
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,958
[MEN]
All right!

31
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,083
[MAN B] That's the real
strength of the Lions!

32
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,291
[CROWD]
Yeah!

33
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,791
Hey. Is it true you
worked with the prince?

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,041
Will you tell us more about it?

35
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,916
Sorry, gotta get ready
for the banquet.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,166
[BOYS]
Aw...

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,375
Now, then. Make sure you
bring your best wine!

38
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,916
Yes. I know.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,750
Goodness. He's as
excited as a child.

40
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,041
You all are surprising
the customers.

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,958
[MITSUHIDE laughs]

42
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,375
By the way. Where's the chief?

43
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,375
And you know, I don't
see Kazuki, either.

44
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,625
They're taking care
of a separate matter.

45
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,458
And don't need
interruptions right now.

46
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,875
[MUKAZE] I guess I should
introduce myself...

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm the chief of
the Lions. Mukaze.

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,041
I'm your father, Shirayuki.

49
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,208
Hard to believe.

50
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,625
It makes me happy that
you're doing well, Father.

51
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,625
[MUKAZE]
Mm...

52
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,625
Uh! Go on, say
something to her.

53
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,333
Oh. All right.

54
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,666
Well, I'm not dead.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,833
I know that's what
you'd been told.

56
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,916
At the time, I honestly thought
it was the best thing for you.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Oh. No, I knew
you were actually alive.

58
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,791
Grandma and Grandpa told
me that much, at least.

59
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,958
[MUKAZE] Ah. I didn't realize
you knew the truth.

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,458
How did you recognize
me, though?

61
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,458
I've seen you.

62
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, they told me who you were

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,083
when you showed up at the bar
a long time ago. So I peeked.

64
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,916
Uh? You're kidding? I was
trying to be incognito.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,291
Yeah, you're not
good at that.

66
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,833
Well, I should've known.

67
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,750
Your grandparents weren't
exactly the best

68
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,291
at keeping things secret.

69
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,583
Although, I'm surprised
you remembered.

70
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,791
That trip to the bar
was a long time ago.

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,625
Well, it's hard to forget.
I was just in awe.

72
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,875
That was the first time
I'd ever seen my father.

73
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,791
[gasps] I see.

74
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,791
What about you?

75
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,416
How did you know who I was?

76
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,541
Oh. My hair gave it away, I bet.

77
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,666
[MUKAZE]
No, it was more than that.

78
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,833
Huh?

79
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,083
So much more.

80
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,791
You look and sound exactly
like your mother.

81
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,083
[gasps]

82
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,166
[CROWD chattering]

83
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,583
[MITSUHIDE] They said
it was in the mountains,

84
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,375
so I wondered what we
were getting in to.

85
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
But, I have to admit
I'm pretty shocked;

86
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,916
this village looks
like it's thriving.

87
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,000
[KIKI]
Mitsuhide.

88
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,291
[MITSUHIDE]
Hm?

89
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
Thank you. For caring.

90
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,750
[MITSUHIDE gasps]

91
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,000
That's not fair!

92
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,541
[KIKI]
Hm.

93
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,458
You know you have to warn me
if you're about to be honest.

94
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,250
Otherwise, I get too anxious.

95
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,250
Well, if you'd rather, I can
just keep my thoughts to myself.

96
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,041
Uh! No, no. That's
not what I want!

97
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,125
[KIKI]
Oh?

98
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,166
[exhales] Speaking
of something else.

99
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,541
You got any idea where Obi went?

100
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,375
[KIKI] He said he'd take
a look at the surroundings

101
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,666
just in case.

102
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Understood.

103
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,208
How awful.

104
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,500
So, you were basically driven
out of your homeland?

105
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,625
Yes. It was hard.

106
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,458
I was a part of the
family of landowners

107
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,666
to the west of here...

108
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,083
My fiancée was, well,
she was your mother.

109
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,208
But anyway, she was about to
be married off to my uncle.

110
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,291
I stole her back, though,
and so they banished us.

111
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,791
I had no idea!

112
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Impressive! Truly.

113
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,000
[laughs] Thank you.
I did have help;

114
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,125
my beloved wife was
no laughing matter.

115
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,250
[ZEN]
What happened after that?

116
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,541
Travel.

117
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,958
Mainly because of my
uncle searching for us.

118
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,500
We didn't think we
could risk stopping

119
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,083
in one place for too long.

120
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,375
So we just kept
running until one day,

121
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,291
the Lions of the Mountain
from back then took us in.

122
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,875
We had you not long after that.

123
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,541
In this village.
I was born here?

124
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,791
That's right.

125
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
And that red hair of yours, wow.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,208
Everyone loved it.

127
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,291
I'd never seen your
mother so happy.

128
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,458
But then... we lost her.

129
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,791
I thought...

130
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,666
I thought maybe this
place wasn't the best

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,083
to raise a little girl.

132
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,875
I wanted to make sure
that you were safe.

133
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:52,666
I was terrified that I
would lose you, too.

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,083
That's why I took you
to your grandparents

135
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,000
in order to protect
you from this life.

136
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,875
Um. You know...

137
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,041
When Pops was informed that you
had moved out of the country,

138
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,708
he searched all over!
He looked for you!

139
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,625
He was terribly worried.

140
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,250
I thought we could be the
ones to protect you again.

141
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,541
I was hoping to move you
somewhere that the prince

142
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,583
couldn't get to, a place
where you'd finally be safe,

143
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,000
a place where you could
be with your father.

144
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,291
Kazuki.

145
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,208
Pops saved me, and I
genuinely owe him my life.

146
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,958
I just wanted to help.

147
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,041
But instead you were put in
more danger because of me.

148
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:27,666
I'm sorry!

149
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,916
Still. This village is good.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,250
And full of good people.

152
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,000
I was wondering...

153
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:39,250
...do you think maybe you'd
want to live with us here?

154
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
I don't think so.

155
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,125
[KAZUKI]
What?!

156
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,875
Thank you, though.

157
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sure you both must
understand how I feel.

158
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:50,125
Yes, this place is wonderful. It
will always be precious to me.

159
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,458
My home is precious,
too. I appreciate it.

160
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,916
But I belong in
Clarines right now.

161
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,500
[MUKAZE]
It'll be okay, kid!

162
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,000
[KAZUKI]
Ah!

163
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,666
I had a feeling
you'd say that...

164
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,291
I just... I hate nobles so much.

165
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,291
I wish they'd all go away!

166
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,750
I don't mean you,
though, Prince Zen.

167
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,875
I'm sorry I hated
you for a while.

168
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,125
I don't remember doing anything
special to make you like me.

169
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,708
I actually don't mind it.

170
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,708
Whatever, I never
said I liked you.

171
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,041
I tolerate you because
of Shirayuki.

172
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
[ZEN]
Well, that is unfortunate.

173
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,500
[KAZUKI] Great, now I'm
getting mad again.

174
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,500

You said we could go to

Sorry! I'm just excited
about finally telling you

a story I know you'll love!

218
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,208
It's basically the tale of
all of Pop's heroic deeds!

Huh?!

All right. Who's up
for a little game?

After that,

Pops chased the brute away
and looked at me and said.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
"Think of me as your big
brother." And so I did.

Oh, Shirayuki, I wish
you could've been there.

Still. That poor girl.

237
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
You must be a prince to speak
to an old man like that.

238
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,875
Impertinent, don't you think?

239
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,166
Maybe.

240
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,625
Well.

241
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,416
It's definitely not like a
prince to come pick a fight

242
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,958
in a neighboring
country for a girl,

that redhead might be.

00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
No. Go for it.

351
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,541
I'm glad you found a home.

352
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,750
And glad it makes you happy and
that you chose it for yourself.

353
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Oh, I'm just so proud of you!

354
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,208
And I won't cry... So I'm done.

355
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,250
[KAZUKI]
Bye, Shirayuki!

356
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,541
And goodbye to you, Prince Zen!

357
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,958
Goodbye, everyone!

358
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
Shirayuki's here?!

359
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,000
[RAJ]
Shirayuki!

360
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,541
Hello, Prince Raj!

361
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,250
[panting]

362
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
[MITSUHIDE] I realize this
was the original plan,

363
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,958
but I never imagined
they'd have another ball.

364
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,958
Neither did I, honestly.

365
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,875
I've been surprised at Raj's
behavior at every turn, though.

366
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,791
Don't sound so glad
about it there, Zen.

367
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,333
I get it.

368
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,666
You feel like he's stealing
Shirayuki's smile, don't you?

369
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,958
[ZEN gasps]

370
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,208
[KIKI] In all fairness,
she did look pretty happy.

371
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,625
True. I hate admitting that.

372
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,416
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

373
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,500
I'll accompany you,
Miss, if you'd like.

374
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,833
[OBI] The master said
he would hide his rank

375
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,875
so he could attend
the ball, as well.

376
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,000
[SHIRAYUKI] Wow, I can't
tell if that's reassuring

377
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,791
or if it makes me feel
even more nervous.

378
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,416
C'mon. Let's follow 'em!

379
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,041
Or we could not do that?

380
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,958
Eugena!

381
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,041
[RAJ]
What's this? You two.

382
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,541
It looks like you're
up to something again;

383
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,916
is that what's going on here?

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
No. We, uh...

385
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,125
Please don't start with us.

386
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,916
I know you feel the exact
same way that we do!

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
You think it'd be
great if Shirayuki

388
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,458
stayed at this castle
forever, too!

389
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,625
I do not.

390
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,958
[BOTH]
Uh?!

391
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,750
[RAJ] A Shirayuki who stayed
with me on purpose?

392
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,750
Heh.

393
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,583
Boring!

394
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,458
[BOTH]
Uh...

395
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:52,291
[music plays]

396
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
It's the song.

397
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,666
[RAJ]
Yes, it is.

398
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,083
I had them play it.

399
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,666
You should have the opportunity
to dance to the song you chose.

400
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
Well then, Prince Raj.

401
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,416
Would you like to have a go?

402
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,541
You might not want
to say it like that.

403
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,583
From you, it sounds
like you want to fight.

404
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,041
Does it really?

405
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,208
Oh, we can settle
something now.

406
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,541
What do you think: were we
finally able to become friends?

407
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,166
[gasps] I believe so.

408
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,625
And I'm clearly the one
who got the better deal.

409
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,833
[EUGENA]
They're so strange, aren't they?

410
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,416
I can't believe they think
being apart is better.

411
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
I agree. It's a mystery.

412
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,250
One of those too young
to understand things.

413
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,208
[ZEN]
That Raj...

414
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,625
Look at him, acting
like a prince.

415
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,166
Just awful.

416
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,083
A prince acting like a prince.

417
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,541
Shirayuki, when your hair
finally grows out?

418
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,416
Yes?

419
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,875
Come and show it to me?

420
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,291
But without cutting it.

421
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,250
[gasps] How 'bout this.

422
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,750
You come see me in Clarines,
and I'll visit you here.

423
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,583
Because we're friends!

424
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,541
[gasps]

425
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,541
That's a great plan.

426
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Let's see each other again soon.

427
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,333
Thank you, Prince Raj.

428
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,166
[bell tolls]

429
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,041
And just like that,
they're gone.

430
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,791
Yes.

431
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,041
[RAJ]
Sakaki, bow with me, already.

432
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,583
Now, why would I do
that; I bowed earlier.

433
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,625
[RAJ] Why can't you simply
do what I tell you?!

434
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,583
[OBI]
I heard Miss Kiki and Shirayuki

435
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,500
are in the bath next
door to us right now.

436
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI] We haven't
been like this for too long,

437
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,875
way too long! [laughs]

438
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,375
She's too bright!

439
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,750
[OBI] When I'm with you two,
it always ends up like this.
