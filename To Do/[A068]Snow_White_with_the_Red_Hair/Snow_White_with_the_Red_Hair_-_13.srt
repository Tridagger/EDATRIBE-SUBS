[footsteps]

00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,958
[MIHAYA]
I wonder...

4
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,833
how is Red getting along?

5
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,333
Can't wait to find out.

00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,083
[SHIRAYUKI yelping]

00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,166
[crash]

8
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,291
Oh, Shirayuki!
Did you hurt yourself?

9
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,041
No, I'm fine.

10
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,333
[YATSUFUSA] You're making
so much progress, Chief.

11
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,291
I think you should
keep it up here.

12
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,583
Shirayuki and I should be able

13
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,458
to take care of the medical
wing by ourselves.

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,958
Is that right?

15
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,333
Well then...

16
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,500
Take this.

17
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,916
Just a few things
to keep in mind

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,916
when you're organizing
the herb shelves.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,666
Don't let me down, Yatsufusa.

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,458
Wow, you certainly went into
a lot of detail with these.

21
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,541
I guess now it makes sense
why you seemed so happy

22
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,250
when I suggested we
could take it over.

23
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,541
"Regarding the
painkiller alisia.

24
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,958
Check condition and
move if necessary.

25
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,833
Split the fever-reducer
shimagaeshi

26
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,083
into raw and dried sections."

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,291
Well, I'm not gonna learn
unless I try this myself.

28
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,791
I'm off to organize those herbs!

29
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,000
[YATSUFUSA] I didn't realize
she knew where herb storage was.

30
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,041
Pretty impressive.

31
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,375
That's the first
thing she learned

32
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,250
when she started working here.

33
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,791
Nice. It's great to see her
so motivated to excel.

34
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
She's proving to be
an invaluable asset

35
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,208
around this place.

36
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,666
She's developed a good
master-apprentice relationship

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,041
with Ryu, too.
If you're not careful,

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,208
she'll wind up eclipsing
you, Yatsufusa.

39
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,500
I'd like to see her try.

40
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,041
That can't be right.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,291
The record says when the
herbalist prescribed this,

42
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:01,000
it had a pungent scent,
but it smells sweet, now.

43
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:06,166
Uh! Looks like bugs have
been eating at the stem.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,333
Hm?

45
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's blooming.

46
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,458
Uh!

47
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,958
[OBI]
Hm?

48
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,250
Hey, Half-Pint, whatcha doin'?

49
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
It's Obi.

50
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,833
[OBI]
Uh, oh. Probably want that, huh?

51
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,166
[RYU]
Mm-hm.

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,541
So uh, you gonna get it down?

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,958
I've never climbed
a tree before.

54
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,958
What?! Are you serious?!

55
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,208
[sighs] I can't
even imagine that.

56
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,416
Come on. You might as well try.

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,041
[OBI]
Already done?

58
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,041
[RYU grunting]

59
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,833
It's fine, don't be scared.

60
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,333
You're lucky I'm here
to lend a hand.

61
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,375
Upsy-daisy.

62
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,583
Can you reach it now?

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875
[OBI] How old are you
again, Half-Pint?

64
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,375
[RYU]
Um, I'm 12.

65
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,041
[OBI] You weigh next to nothing!
Right, got it, then?

66
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,125
[RYU]
Yes, thank you.

67
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,500
[OBI]
Good job!

68
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,541
Want me to carry you to
the medical wing like this?

69
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,208
Uh. But they're cleaning up,

70
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,625
and I don't want
to be in the way--

71
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,541
[OBI laughs]

72
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,000
Why is Zen working so hard?

73
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,958
He snuck over to see
Shirayuki earlier

74
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,166
and she was really busy.

75
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,083
I guess he decided to
double his efforts.

76
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,791
He can't let her
beat him. Right?

77
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,166
Shirayuki's the best motivator
Zen has had in years, isn't she?

78
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,041
Yes, she is. But he's
still working too hard.

79
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:10,916
[ZEN yelps]

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,958
[MITSUHIDE, KIKI]
Mm?

81
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,416
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a minor paper cut.

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Still...

83
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,625
You should go to the medical
wing and let them see.

84
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,250
Don't be ridiculous.

85
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,750
Believe what you want, Zen,
but just so you know,

86
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,875
people have died because of
minor paper cuts like this.

87
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,458
Do you think I'm stupid?

88
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,458
[MITSUHIDE] The tiny fibers
enter the bloodstream

89
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,958
and quickly multiply,

90
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,333
until the victims transform
into monstrous paper people!

91
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,375
[ZEN]
Fine, I'll go,

92
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,625
just spare me the horror drama.

93
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,125
I'm sure I'll be back shortly.

94
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,041
Mm?

95
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,583
I'll walk with you.

96
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,958
I'm helping the soldiers with
their training this morning.

97
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,000
They asked me not to go
easy on them this time.

98
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,791
They'll regret that.

99
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,041
Have fun torturing them.

100
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,833
[KIKI]
Heh. You know I will.

101
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,958
Now you can visit her without
feeling guilty about it.

102
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,541
I know,

103
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,750
but going for such a small cut
will probably get me laughed at.

104
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,041
[KIKI] Shirayuki would
never make fun of you.

105
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,500
Very true.

106
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,666
She always seems to take me
seriously, no matter what.

107
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,166
That's why I can't do
anything halfway anymore.

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,541
The last thing I want is to
give her reason to laugh at me.

109
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,791
[gasps]

110
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,458
[ZEN]
Lord Brother.

111
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,291
You think he realizes
where we're headed?

112
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm sure he does.

113
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,125
If that smirk is any clue,
he's the one laughing at me.

114
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,291
It's fine.

115
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,375
He won't have reason
to mock me for long.

116
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,166
I swear it.

117
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,583
Whoa, what's goin' on here?

118
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,083
[RYU] We're drying out all
the research instruments.

119
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,583
[OBI]
So that's why you were outside.

120
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,333
I get it now, Half-Pint.

121
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,500
Hey! I've never
seen that flower.

122
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,750
What does it treat?

123
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,083
Oh, that isn't a
medicinal plant.

124
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,791
Shirayuki put it there
for decoration.

125
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,875
[OBI]
Mm.

126
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,250
That's nice.

127
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,625
It's quite a lovely addition.

128
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,833
[RYU]
Uh.

129
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,541
[SHIRAYUKI groaning]
Come on, door!

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,708
Obi!

131
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,250
And Ryu!

132
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,250
[OBI] Should I just put this
anywhere I can find room for it?

133
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,833
Yeah. Thank you.

134
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,708
Your timing is perfect.

135
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,708
Ryu, here's the herb
inspection form.

136
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,375
[OBI] Are there more boxes?
I can help you.

137
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm fine!

138
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,500
And having a lot of fun learning
about all the instruments

139
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,333
in there I haven't seen before.

140
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,958
[RYU] Shirayuki, what's this
note about the enel herb?

141
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,333
The smell seems to have changed

142
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,958
from the last time
it was prescribed.

143
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,458
It was pungent,
but smells sweet now.

144
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,708
Any sign of bugs?

145
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Definitely.

146
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,541
Some mock enel must have
gotten mixed in, then.

147
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,416
I was sure I'd been
careful, though.

148
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Should we get rid of it?

149
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,333
[RYU]
Mm.

150
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
I can take care of that.

151
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,166
I'm pretty sure there's
some in storage

152
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,791
that was collected
the other day.

153
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,000
I should probably check
on that batch, too.

154
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,125
[RYU]
Yes.

155
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,333
All right. I'm gonna
get back to work!

156
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,166
Oh.

157
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,541
Looks like cleaning the lab

158
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,875
is going to take longer
than we originally thought.

159
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,208
[door closes]

160
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,000
[OBI]
What a strange girl.

161
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,500
She's the only person I know
who could learn by cleaning.

162
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,666
She is learning a lot that way.

163
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,541
Do you think that because
of what she told you

164
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,583
about the enel stuff?

165
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,708
[RYU]
Yes.

166
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,958
[OBI]
Mm...

167
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,125
Well, see ya.

168
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,375
Oh. Hold on a sec.

169
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:23,875
[RYU]
Oh!

170
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,708
[OBI chuckles]

171
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,750
[OBI]
Hm?

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,708
These are seeds of
the orbia flower.

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,083
From my personal supply.
They're for you.

174
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,250
Are you serious?

175
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,083
Yes, for helping me
get the paper.

176
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,541
[ZEN]
Excuse me, Chief.

177
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,666
Prince Zen.

178
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,083
How may I help you?
Are you all right?

179
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm fine. I've just got
a measly paper cut.

180
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,041
[HIGATA]
Uh!

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,666
You've caught us in the middle
of our semi-annual cleaning.

182
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
[ZEN]
I see.

183
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,750
If you're looking for Shirayuki,

184
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,166
she's in the storage area.

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
[ZEN grunts]

186
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,333
I can take a look at it, though.
Paper cuts are dangerous.

187
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,583
You wouldn't want to turn into
a paper person, would you?

188
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,375
Did Mitsuhide tell you
to say that?!

189
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
[GARAK]
Wouldn't you like to know?

190
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,541
Here, let's clean that up,

191
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,541
and then if you want you
can wait in the bunk room.

192
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,750
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

193
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,750
Next!

194
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,375
[YATSUFUSA] Chief Garak. We're
finally finished cleaning.

195
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, that's good
to hear. Nice job!

196
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,041
And thank you for
working so hard.

197
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,625
You're all done
for the day, guys.

198
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh! Shirayuki, there's a
visitor waiting for you

199
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:53,958
in the bunk room.

200
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,875
What? A visitor?

201
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,791
Um, Zen...?

202
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,500
Must be tired.

203
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,833
[ZEN] Together, we can
weather the storms.

204
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,333
You give me that faith.

205
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,666
I swear I will protect you and
what we have with my life.

206
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,708
[gasps] He's hurt?

207
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,708
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

208
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,166
Shirayuki.

209
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,125
[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

210
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,750
I've been wanting
to talk with you

211
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,583
about what the future
holds for us.

212
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh.

213
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,250
--[knocking]
--[gasps]

214
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki, it's me, Mitsuhide.

215
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,541
May I come in?

216
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, yes!

217
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,750
[yawns]

218
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,208
[MITSUHIDE]
I suppose I should have known

219
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,791
why you didn't return sooner.

220
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,375
[ZEN] Sorry, I didn't realize
how exhausted I was.

221
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,916
Don't worry about it.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,125
If you need to sleep a little
longer, I think you should.

223
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,833
[ZEN]
Right. Good idea.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,666
Did you forget something?

225
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,583
Just wanted to see
your face again.

226
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,583
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

227
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,333
[ZEN]
See ya.

228
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
My heart...

229
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,375
I feel like it could beat
right out of my chest.

230
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
What the future holds for us.

231
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:54,000
[bell tolls]

232
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,666
[OBI humming]

233
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,666
[ZEN gasps]

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,041
Obi!

235
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,625
You shouldn't lounge around
in someone else's room!

236
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,583
As I recall,

237
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,041
my position here is messenger

238
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,666
to the second prince
of Clarines.

239
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,625
If the prince doesn't
give me any work,

240
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,708
it means I can do
what I want, right?

241
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,875
[OBI]
Uh?

242
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
Pretty. Did you get
this from Shirayuki?

243
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,083
[OBI]
Uh. No, it was a gift from Ryu.

244
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,166
You don't have any trouble
making friends with people, huh?

245
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,333
Except Kiki.

246
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,458
[laughs]

247
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,791
Uh.

248
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,000
[ZEN] I heard Shirayuki's
trying to collect those

249
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,541
in all the different
flowering colors.

250
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,625
The seeds don't indicate the
color of the petals, though,

251
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,625
so it's hard.

252
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
She wants as many
as she can get.

253
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
[OBI]
Huh.

254
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,333
[AIDE A]
Excuse me.

255
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
[door opens]

256
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,166
[AIDE A] Prince Izana,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

257
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,875
but we've just received
correspondence from Tanbarun.

258
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,416
Oh? Interesting.

259
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,791
[OBI]
Half-Pint.

260
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,333
[RYU]
Mm?

261
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,041
These seeds. Take 'em back.

262
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,375
What for?

263
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
I've never grown flowers
from seed like this,

264
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,625
and I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be in the castle.

265
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,208
So I think you should take them
and grow them for yourself.

266
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,625
Well, I think all that means

267
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,583
it's better for you
to have them.

268
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,416
Uh. What do you mean?

269
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,541
Nothing.

270
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,208
The seeds are pretty
just as they are,

271
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,625
and when you plant them,
they grow without much effort.

272
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,041
So when you leave here and
get where you might stay,

273
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,750
you can just plant them there.

274
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu!

275
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,791
Oh, good, I was hoping that
I would find you here!

276
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,583
I didn't expect
to see you, Obi.

277
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,083
Surprise.

278
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,958
[SHIRAYUKI] Cleaning the lab
took longer than I thought,

279
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,708
and I couldn't find
you when I was done,

280
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,500
so I started to get worried.

281
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,833
But since you're with Obi,
there's no cause for concern.

282
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,958
[OBI gasps]
The flowers.

283
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,625
Did they all fall
off or something?

284
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,416
No. I finished collecting
all the seeds I needed,

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,125
so I pruned them.
That's removing the blooms.

286
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,666
It'll help the plant
live a lot longer.

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
I heard about your quest.

288
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,041
Have you found all the
different colors, yet?

289
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Almost. I'm just missing blue.

290
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,083
[OBI]
Uh.

291
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Oh, well.

292
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll just have to wait
until next year.

293
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,041
I'd like to see them
when you've got them all.

294
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

295
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,166
Uh.

296
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki!

297
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?! Mihaya?

298
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,333
[ZEN]
Yes. He wants to speak with us.

299
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,125
That is, you and
me, specifically.

300
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,166
But I'm sure you'd
rather not see him.

301
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
I can't disagree.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,750
Wait. Is that the
former noble guy

303
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,083
who kidnapped Shirayuki
a while back?

304
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,916
He's a good-for-nothing
scoundrel!

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
[OBI] I've never seen Zen
react like this before.

306
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,041
Mihaya is an enemy.

307
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,166
What could he possibly
want with us?

308
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,833
And I thought he was in jail.

309
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,166
[ZEN]
From what I know,

310
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,041
he wants to discuss something
that involves you.

311
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,916
Well, that's odd.

312
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,125
What do you say?

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
I'll see him.

314
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,833
Hello.

315
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,875
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Rosylocks?

316
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
[yelps]

317
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,291
Dispense with the small talk

318
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,708
and tell us why the
hell you're here!

319
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,625
Well, this might seem
a little strange, Red.

320
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,041
I mean, Shirayuki, so sorry.

321
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,708
Do you know of a very pretty
boy with light brown hair

322
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,958
who's about 13 or 14?

323
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,458
[gasps]

324
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,500
A "pretty" boy, he says, a
"very pretty" one, at that.

325
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,416
[MIHAYA] Does that
description ring a bell?

326
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,875
What about the name Kazuki?

327
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
Kazuki?

328
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,625
Why don't you drop the games and
tell us what you're getting at!

329
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,083
[MIHAYA]
Yes, Majesty.

330
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,833
After I was released from jail,
I didn't have any money,

331
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,791
so I thought I would go try
to find a way to earn some.

332
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,583
Well, I ended up on a ship...

333
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,750
[CAPTAIN A]
Red hair?

334
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,208
Yes, a teenage girl that has
bright red hair, like an apple.

335
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,875
Ain't seen no one like that.

336
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,375
So, kid, you got a thing
for red heads or what?

337
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,833
[KAZUKI] Don't be vulgar!
And I'm not a kid!

338
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
[MIHAYA]
Hey, kid, over here!

339
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,583
I'm no kid, and
my name's Kazuki!

340
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,791
All right, Kazuki.

341
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,833
I've seen that red-haired
girl of yours.

342
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,958
[gasps]

343
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,416
You gave him information
about Shirayuki?

344
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,416
Yes. I told him a while
back I met a girl

345
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,625
lost in the mountains,
and that when I took her in,

346
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,916
someone from Wistal castle
came to claim her.

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,291
[SHIRAYUKI, ZEN]
Huh.

348
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,458
[MIHAYA]
Come on,

349
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,791
he would have found
out sooner or later

350
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,291
that you were here in the
castle, so no harm done.

351
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,291
There it is.

352
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,791
Now.

353
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not exactly asking for
anything for telling you this,

354
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,166
but a lot of money would be
nice, or if you can't do that,

355
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,375
I'd accept a position
in the castle.

356
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

357
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,000
So, that's the real
reason you're here?!

358
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,333
[MITSUHIDE] Your highness!
Please, calm down!

359
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,625
Uh, if it helps at all,
I have information

360
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,291
I got from the kid to use
as a bargaining chip.

361
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,583
If you agree to my terms,

362
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,666
I promise to tell you
everything I know.

363
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,458
[ZEN growls]

364
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,541
Wait, hold on!

365
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,000
Uh...

366
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,625
Give it a moment.

367
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,125
[ZEN exhales]

368
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,791
I have no reason to trust you.
First, the information.

369
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,583
He explained why he was
looking for Shirayuki.

370
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,958
[KAZUKI]
What for? Heh.

371
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,333
There's a better place for
that girl than a castle.

372
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,875
She's a princess,

373
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,750
but not the kind that should be
kept hidden from the world.

374
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,166
What kind of place do ya mean?

375
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,458
It's been worth traveling
all the way to Clarines.

376
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,208
What does that mean?

377
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,083
[ZEN grunts]

378
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,750
Shirayuki,

379
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,666
did your red hair get you into
some kind of trouble again?

380
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Like before, with the
Prince of Tanbarun?

381
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,458
[knocking]

382
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,041
[AIDE A]
Excuse me, Your Highness.

383
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,708
What is it?

384
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,916
[IZANA] Sorry to bother you.
I know it's rather late.

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,375
[ZEN] What business do you
have with me, Lord Brother?

386
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,000
[IZANA] Actually, I don't
have any business with you,

387
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,625
but I knew you'd be upset
if she came here alone.

388
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,791
[gasps]

389
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,291
Shirayuki, I've not
seen you in a while.

390
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,708
Yes. That's true, my lord.

391
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,666
[IZANA] It would appear that you
have been invited to a ball

392
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,375
in our neighboring
land of Tanbarun.

393
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,958
[BOTH gasp]

394
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,333
[IZANA] You do recall that we
hosted their first prince, Raj,

395
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,666
at Wistal Castle
not long ago, yes?

396
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,541
Their invitation is a
way of thanking you

397
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,750
for caring for him
during that visit.

398
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,958
Oh, Prince Raj.

399
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,250
[IZANA] I've heard that since
his return to Tanbarun,

400
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,666
Prince Raj has begun to
take his role as ruler

401
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,416
a lot more seriously.

402
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,875
Shirayuki.

403
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm?

404
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,541
The advice you gave him must
have been good medicine.

405
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,208
Your words certainly seem to
have made quite the impact.

406
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,000
[gasps]

407
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,666
[IZANA] "If you want
me to respect you,

408
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,333
then rule my country like a
prince I can be proud of."

409
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,250
A request from someone
born in Tanbarun.

410
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,166
If my guess is right, Tanbarun
wants to have a look at the girl

411
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
who turned their prince around.

412
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,125
So that's your plan to
get rid of her, then?!

413
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,916
To give her over to Prince Raj?!

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,375
If he's made such
great progress,

416
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,500
that shouldn't be a
problem, should it?

417
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,958
He's the rightful heir to the
throne of one of our allies.

418
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,250
We don't want him
to be too shrewd,

419
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,583
but if he's incompetent,

420
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,500
that won't work in
Clarines' favor, either.

421
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,333
If you wouldn't mind, I'd
like for you to give Raj

422
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,125
another pep talk
to motivate him.

423
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,916
You will remain in Tanbarun
for seven days.

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,291
Before you go, I want you to
train in court appearance

425
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,333
so as to not make a fool out
of yourself or Clarines.

426
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,958
Shirayuki, you will go
to Tanbarun in 14 days,

427
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,166
and that is an order.

428
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,958
[ZEN gasping]

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,041
[IZANA] I'm curious
as to your silence.

430
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,333
This little adventure is a
significant opportunity for you.

431
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,375
I can't imagine you
don't realize that.

432
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
[gasps]

433
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
No, Prince Izana--

434
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
Lord Brother.

435
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,708
I have a request.

436
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,000
Will you permit me to add
one condition to this order?

437
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,500
Condition?

438
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,875
[ZEN] If this must
indeed come to pass,

439
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,333
I want someone to accompany
her to Tanbarun.

440
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,583
Someone I trust.

441
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,583
I refuse to concede this point.

442
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,625
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

443
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,666
[IZANA]
Very well.

444
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,375
Now, then, Shirayuki.
Will you go?

445
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes. As you wish, Your Highness.

446
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,208
[MITSUHIDE] Interesting.
Shirayuki is going to Tanbarun.

447
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,541
Odd timing.

448
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,625
This in the same night we
find out some pretty boy

449
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,583
is trying to come kidnap her.

450
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,875
Where's Mihaya?

451
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,875
We ordered him to
stay at the castle.

452
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,000
He's under guard since he's
the only one who knows

453
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,333
what Kazuki looks like.

454
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,083
[ZEN]
Mitsuhide.

455
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,458
I want you to accompany
Shirayuki to Tanbarun

456
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,083
and watch out for her.

457
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,916
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, sir.

458
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,791
[SERVANT A]
These will be your quarters

459
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,583
until you depart for Tanbarun.

460
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,708
I hope you will find
them to your liking.

461
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,416
Please make yourself
comfortable.

462
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes. Thank you.

463
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:12,291
[SHIRAYUKI sighs]
I'm going to train for court.

464
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,125
And I'm going back to Tanbarun.

465
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,041
Not to mention all the Mihaya
and Kazuki weirdness.

466
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,958
What a day...

467
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,750
[ZEN]
I refuse to concede this point.

468
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,041
Zen.

469
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I can only do
what I can do right now.

470
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,416
[OBI] You and the master, you're
both always so dependable.

471
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,833
[MITSUHIDE] But it's more likely
he just wants to protect her.

472
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,875
[SHIRAYUKI] I wish I could
explain how talking to you

473
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,541
makes me feel better,
but I can't.

474
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,000
[OBI] I think the two of
us should have a match.
