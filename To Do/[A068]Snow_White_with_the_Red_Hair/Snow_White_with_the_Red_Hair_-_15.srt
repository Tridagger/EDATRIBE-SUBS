1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,791
[LADY A] It appears
Prince Raj and Shirayuki

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,916
will be spending the
whole day together.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,208
And I heard it's to
deepen their friendship.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,791
[LADY B] Sakaki was happy
about it, to say the least.

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,416
According to him, Prince Raj's
change for the better

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,333
didn't happen until after he
became friends with Shirayuki.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,083
[LADY A] I caught a glimpse
of her when she arrived

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,041
at the castle earlier,
and what they say is true.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,500
Her hair really is
as red as an apple!

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,208
So, someone managed to
change our big brother.

11
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,000
And how nice that
it was a woman, too!

12
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:38,875
--[RONA laughs]
--[LADY A gasps]

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:39,833
[LADY A]
Your Highness, wait!

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,208
[RONA]
Eugena, let's go!

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,291
What?! Go where exactly, Rona?

16
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,500
Haven't you been listening?
We have to investigate her!

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,583
Then, we can see for ourselves
what that Shirayuki is like!

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,333
Come on, don't you
wanna check this out?

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,291
[knocking]

20
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

21
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,500
[OBI]
Miss!

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Come in!

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,750
[OBI]
Interesting. Connecting rooms.

24
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,708
Well, that's convenient.

25
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,958
Let me know if you need
anything. I'm right there.

26
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,208
And I'm here!

27
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,916
[laughs] Understood.
Now, just to be sure.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,958
You're not pushing yourself.
With Prince Raj, I mean.

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,208
Not at all.

30
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,208
Remember, I'm the one
who made this choice.

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,875
Great. Shall we go, then?

32
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,375
[SHIRAYUKI] Um, this tea
is extremely delicious.

34
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,375
Don't you agree?

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,125
[RAJ]
Yes. Of course it's good.

36
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,791
This particular blend is made
from the finest of tea leaves

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,958
to suit my elevated palate.

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh. How wonderful.

39
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,916
[RAJ]
Hm...

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,458
Don't you find the flowers
in here beautiful?

42
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,708
[RAJ] No, they're a
little plain today.

43
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:27,000
This grand room needs much more
extravagant bouquets, obviously.

44
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, of course, yes.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
[RAJ]
Mm...

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
So, I um, uh, Prince Raj?

47
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,541
[RAJ]
Yes, what is it?

48
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think I'm going

49
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,000
to head outside for
a bit to get some air.

50
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,791
[RAJ]
That's fine with me.

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
[door closes]

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,083
[RAJ sighs]

53
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you think it's
going? Good or no?

54
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,458
I don't know why
you're asking me.

55
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
Yes, I do think it's so.

56
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,958
We might as well try, right?

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,541
I'm confounded by this.

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,166
What can that girl gain
by spending time with me?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,708
What is she thinking?

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,291
If you asked me,

61
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,291
I'd say Shirayuki is trying to
meet you halfway, Your Highness.

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,416
In addition, perhaps you should
just focus on having fun.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I would if I knew
what to talk about!

64
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,375
What more can you
expect me to do?!

65
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,666
Just to figure it out for
yourself, Your Highness.

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,375
Ah...

67
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
It's a tough battle
in there, isn't it?

68
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,541
Very much so.

69
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
This view takes me back.

70
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,000
[OBI] I'd like to go
down there to the town.

71
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,875
Check out the bars and such.

72
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,083
[SHIRAYUKI] My home used to
be a bar. Did you know that?

73
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
[OBI]
Uh. For real?

74
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,875
[SHIRAYUKI] Yep, for real.
My late grandparents ran it.

75
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,958
I just thought they must have
been pharmacists or something.

76
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,458
I started raising medicinal
herbs while I lived there.

77
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
Speaking of your childhood.

78
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
Didn't you tell me you were
born in the mountains?

79
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,291
Yes. I lived there as a baby,

80
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,958
so I don't really remember
too much about it.

81
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,708
My grandparents took me
in fairly early on.

82
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,541
Oh, I didn't realize that.

83
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,541
I would like to see the
people who looked after me,

84
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,583
but I think I need to focus
on what I can accomplish here.

85
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,958
True. And great attitude.

86
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,291
This may seem a nuisance now,

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,250
but you never know if it will
lead to something good.

88
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,916
I actually learned
that from Zen.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,625
Well, the next time
you come to this kingdom,

90
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm pretty sure
you'll be able to go

91
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,458
wherever you want to go.

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah!

93
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,375
[RAJ]
Eh, Shirayuki.

94
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,541
[clear throat]

95
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,583
Since you traveled all this way,

96
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,500
I thought I could show
you around the castle

97
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,375
instead of just one room.

98
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,500
You'll escort me?

99
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,458
All right, thank you!

100
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,041
[KIKI] We've increased
the number of soldiers

101
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,875
and are continuing
the investigation.

102
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,500
However, we still haven't
received any helpful information

103
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,041
regarding Kazuki.

104
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,375
[ZEN]
I wish we could at least

105
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,166
figure out why this kid
is after Shirayuki.

106
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,041
What's the news with Mihaya?

107
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
He's in town at the moment.

108
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,291
I sent him to help the
soldiers investigate.

109
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,875
Meanwhile in Tanbarun,

110
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,583
Shirayuki's doing what
she can to help us out.

111
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,875
So let's do what we can
here to help her out.

112
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,958
[BOTH]
Mm.

113
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,875
[RAJ]
Inside Schenazade Castle,

114
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,250
we have many walls
decorated with amber,

115
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,208
many halls decorated
with wind chimes,

116
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,416
and a greenhouse featuring

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,625
some of the rarest
plants in the world.

118
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,833
What would you like to see?

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,166
I think the greenhouse
sounds nice.

120
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,875
The greenhouse?

121
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,916
Very well.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,125
[OBI]
Excuse me.

123
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,750
Going there should be fine,

124
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,458
but you may wanna know you're
being watched from the shadows.

125
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,041
I'm what?!

126
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,083
[SERVANTS gasp]

127
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,625
[GUARDS gasp]

128
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,000
Now that you mention it,

129
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,625
there do seem to be more
soldiers than usual.

130
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,958
This is not a play!

131
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,875
[growls]

132
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,333
[gasping]

133
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,166
If you'll follow me.

134
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,750
Uh? Yes, of course.

135
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
What is this?

136
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,958
[RAJ] The entrance to the
underground passages.

137
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,458
They're not used a lot,

138
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,416
but we can get to the greenhouse
without being watched this way.

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
I bet it's easy to
get lost in here.

140
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,000
[RAJ] They were made to be used
in case of an emergency.

141
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,833
It can certainly be
difficult for someone

142
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,583
who isn't familiar
with the passages.

143
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,166
[gasps] Do you think it will
be safe for us, Prince Raj?

144
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,750
How rude!

145
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,166
I've been here enough times to
know exactly where we're going!

146
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,958
I apologize. No offense
was intended.

147
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,500
[RAJ grunts]

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Is that the way?

149
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,000
No, it's still farther up ahead.

150
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,958
[RAJ]
Mm...

151
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,750
So, uh, how much longer do
you think this will take?

152
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,541
We'll be there soon!
Just be quiet and follow me!

153
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,958
All right, but didn't we
walk down this path earlier?

154
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,083
[RAJ gasps]

155
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
Your Highness, we're
not lost, are we?

156
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,000
We're not! I know where we are!

157
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,791
The exit is...

158
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,208
Right this way!

159
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,250
Why is this a dead end, now?!

160
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
Yes, why, indeed.

161
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,375
You know, we're kind of
wondering the same thing.

162
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, maybe it's not a dead end

163
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,291
and there's a way
to open the gate.

164
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,541
[RAJ]
Oh! Look up there!

165
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,583
If we pull those chains
at the same time,

166
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,875
we should be able to raise it.

167
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,375
[OBI]
If you say so.

168
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,250
I guess I'll take
the one on this side.

169
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
Ready when you are.

170
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,833
[OBI]
I'm ready.

171
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,750
[RAJ]
Three.

172
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,791
Two.

173
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,583
One!

174
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:52,833
[OBI gasps]

175
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,708
The wall!

176
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,583
[RAJ]
Huh?

177
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,875
[OBI]
Look out!

178
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
What? It's an arrow.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,666
Your Highness, are you hurt?

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,333
No, I don't think so.

181
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,958
[gasps] I just remembered!

182
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,833
There are traps all
over the place down here

183
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,083
in case we have
invaders or pursuers.

184
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,625
[SHIRAYUKI] Then, I think it
would be best to turn back.

185
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,458
[RAJ]
Oh, great. How inconvenient.

186
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,708
Huh?!

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,375
[gasping]

188
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,166
[RAJ whimpers]

189
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,125
[OBI] So, looks like we'll
just keep moving forward.

190
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,666
What in the world
is going on here?!

191
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,083
Again, we're kind of
wondering the same thing.

192
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,416
Well, this is hardly my fault.

193
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,083
I'm not the one who put
the traps everywhere.

194
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,958
[SHIRAYUKI] No one's
blaming you, Prince Raj.

195
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,625
Why don't we stay put and
wait for help? All right?

196
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,250
[OBI]
Hm...

197
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,333
[RAJ]
I should probably mention that

198
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,125
no one comes down here.

199
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,500
Not unless there's
some emergency

200
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,833
or during patrol in the morning.

201
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,083
We're on our own until tomorrow.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,041
[OBI]
We've walked a long way today.

203
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
True.

204
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,208
I hate it here. [groaning]

205
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,291
[SHIRAYUKI] Oh, are you
all right, Your Highness?

206
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,875
[RAJ] Without a carriage, I
cannot continue any farther!

207
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
Go on, don't worry about me!

208
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
We can't.

209
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,916
We'll be completely lost
without you, Prince Raj.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,291
[OBI] Our lives are also at
stake in case you forgot.

211
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,291
I just can't believe
this happened.

212
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,791
You know, it's starting to feel
like being together is bad luck.

213
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,375
I'm sure you agree, Shirayuki.

214
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,541
No, our relationship
is a different issue.

215
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,083
Prince Raj, let's go!
We can rely on your memory!

216
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,541
[gasps]

217
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,625
You... can rely?

218
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,583
Let's get out of here!

219
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,916
You don't have to tell me that!

220
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,708
[EUGENA]
I think we should go back.

221
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,375
[RONA] No, this is our chance
to see how things are going.

222
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,166
Besides, did you see how she
motivated our brother just now?

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,208
That was amazing.

224
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,208
What if all those rumors are
true, and she really is special?

225
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
Shirayuki.

226
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,708
Where's Zen?

227
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,041
Outside.

228
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,416
He had an appointment with
the bird handler squad.

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,041
He knows Shirayuki is working
hard, so he's working hard, too.

230
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,000
I see.

231
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
I came to get his signature,

232
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,916
but I might as well
see how it's going.

233
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,208
[ZEN]
Excellent, as usual.

234
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,791
It's been a while since I heard
the sound of that whistle.

235
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,333
Hello, Kihal.

236
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,791
[KIHAL] Hello. It's good to
see you again, Your Highness.

237
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,916
Um. Do you know if Shirayuki's
working, right now?

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,208
Yes, She's actually away
from the castle on business.

239
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,041
Uh? That's a surprise.

240
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,416
You had a souvenir
for her. Didn't you?

241
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,416
[ZEN]
Souvenir?

242
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,416
Yes. To thank her
for helping me.

243
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,958
I made her a bell accessory out
of walnut stone from the island.

244
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Walnut stone, huh? I can
give it to her for you.

245
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,250
Please! Thank you,
Prince Zen.

246
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,958
I'm sure she'll love it.

247
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,791
Regarding the bird
handler squad. Tell me,

248
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,875
would it be better to have
soldiers go to the island,

249
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,833
after all, to simplify things?

250
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,166
[KIHAL] Yes. I think
it'd be easier to start

251
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,375
with the same type of training
that we do on the island.

252
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,041
[gasps]

253
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,291
[ZEN] Very well. I will
make the arrangements.

254
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,916
[KIHAL]
And we will do everything we can

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,333
to prepare to receive them.

256
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,333
Thank you. I don't
doubt you will.

257
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Izana.

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm just seeing how
things are going.

259
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
Looks like he's doing
his job well.

260
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,416
He is.

261
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,500
What is it?

262
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,708
I wanted to ask you
something, Your Highness.

263
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,166
Are you testing them?

264
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Is this all just a test for
Prince Zen and Shirayuki?

265
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,833
[IZANA]
Hm.

266
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,541
It is.

267
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,833
[MITSUHIDE]
Mm!

268
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,333
Oh, come on, now, why do
you look so surprised?

269
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,958
[MITSUHIDE] I... didn't
expect you to answer me.

270
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,291
Why?

271
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
It's not something I have
need to hide from you.

272
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,916
If those kids give this up,

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,291
I suppose I will just file it
away as a rather boring story.

274
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,083
Prince Zen has become stronger.

275
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,500
That's Shirayuki's influence.

276
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:21,208
And I believe he's made
her stronger as well.

277
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,750
I do wonder what the
future holds for them.

278
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,666
For now, it will be interesting
to watch their next move.

279
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
[MITSUHIDE gasps]

280
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,750
Mitsuhide, come over here.

281
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,166
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, Your Highness.

282
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,791
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

283
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,666
Whoops, looks like they
found out about our rendezvous.

284
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,875
Prince Izana!

285
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,416
[IZANA]
Go to your master, Mitsuhide.

286
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,958
[MITSUHIDE sighs]

287
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,500
[MITSUHIDE] That side of
him is exactly like Zen.

288
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,416
Are you all right?

289
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
He's heavy.

290
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,875
Surely, there's something around
here that will make the water

291
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,541
recede or create some
sort of path for us.

292
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
No. It's probably best

293
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
if we get through without
touching anything.

294
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,916
[RAJ groans]

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,333
[SHIRAYUKI grunts]

296
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,875
[RAJ]
Good work there, Obi.

297
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
[OBI]
Yeah, thanks.

298
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi?

299
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,125
Sorry, Miss,

300
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,875
do you think you could
wait here for just a minute?

301
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,583
Wait, it's too dangerous!

302
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,458
Nah, I'll be right back.

303
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,625
What do you think he's
going back that way for?

304
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,791
Hope he'll be all right.

305
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,666
Uh?

306
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,333
[OBI]
There's a path now.

307
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,291
I must've scared them
away from crossing it.

308
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,625
[OBI grunts]

309
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,416
I think maybe that
was excessive.

310
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,041
Not even close, he's fine!

311
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,000
But, might as well
see for ourselves!

312
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,541
[EUGENA]
Uh! Rona, wait!

313
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,291
[RONA] He probably can't move
and is trying to keep quiet.

314
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,416
[OBI] What a surprise.
I didn't expect children.

315
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,166
[RAJ]
Did you just hear that?

316
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'll go take a look. Stay here.

317
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,208
[RAJ] Hold on! Can't you
just leave it to Obi?

318
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,583
What if something happened
to him, and he needs my help?

319
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,541
[RAJ]
And what if that happens to you?

320
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,250
This is about more
than just you!

321
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,625
What do you think Prince Zen
would say if you got hurt?!

322
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,291
[gasps]

323
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Prince Raj.

324
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,500
[RAJ]
Yes? What is it?

325
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,208
[SHIRAYUKI] If you believe
my words and actions

326
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,250
are some sort of threat,

327
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:54,000
then I will return to
Clarines immediately.

328
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,458
Your Highness,

329
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,750
it wouldn't benefit either
one of us if I were to stay.

330
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,000
All right, not what I meant,

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
but now I wonder why you came.

332
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,416
Was this all just
for appearances?

333
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,041
Get here, say you couldn't bear
it, and go back home to Zen?

334
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,541
Are you stupid?!

335
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,125
I'm here because I wanted to
try and be friends with you!

336
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,583
[RAJ gasps]

337
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,041
The truth is...

338
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,000
...whenever I meet people,

339
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,791
I try to form a connection with
them in whatever way I can.

340
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,500
And I always learn so much,
whether here or in Clarines.

341
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,791
I don't want to allow our
connection to go to waste,

342
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,583
Prince Raj.

343
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,333
No, we may not have met under
the best circumstances,

344
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,625
but I believe we can
change all that!

345
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,833
[RONA growls]
Let go!

346
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,583
[OBI] Well, I finally
caught the culprits.

347
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
Let go of me,
you insolent man!

348
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,583
What do you two think
you're doing?!

349
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,583
Lord Brother!

350
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,958
[gasps]

351
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,333
[EUGENA, RONA gasping]

352
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,500
Greetings. I'm Princess
Rona of Tanbarun.

353
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,708
This is my twin,
yet younger, brother.

354
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,625
I'm Second Prince, Eugena.

355
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, wow, a princess!

356
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,125
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintances.

357
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,625
My name is Shirayuki.

358
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,416
[RONA]
I know. I've heard about you.

359
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,041
Anyway, have you been
following us down here?

360
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,125
Princess Rona, Prince Eugena,

361
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,333
do either one of you know
the way to the exit?

362
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,458
We don't.

363
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,333
We lost our way as
we came in, as well.

364
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,416
I know how to get out.
Which exit would you prefer?

365
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,791
Why did you admit that?!

366
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,666
I wanted to watch them
a little longer!

367
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,375
But I want to
go outside, Rona!

368
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,500
Stop fighting!
Just show us the way!

369
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,875
[RONA, EUGENA]
Hmph!

370
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,625
[SHIRAYUKI laughs]

371
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

372
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,416
[RAJ sighs]

373
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,166
[RAJ] We took an unexpected
detour, didn't we?

374
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,583
Yes, but still, some
good came from it.

375
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,958
[RAJ]
Huh?

376
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,375
It was the first time you've
ever looked in my eyes

377
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,166
when you were speaking to me.

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,833
[gasps]

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
There are so many rare flowers!

380
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,583
And you have medicinal
herbs, too.

381
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,291
Go on, look around.
Take your time.

382
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
I will, thanks.

383
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,375
[RONA]
Hello, Brother.

384
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,791
[RAJ gasping]

385
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,583
We have been watching you
while you watch Shirayuki.

386
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,541
Tell the truth.
Are you in love with her?

387
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,458
[gasping] Why would
you even say that?!

388
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,750
Are you trying to scare me?!

389
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:49,416
Of course not. I heard
Sakaki talk about it.

390
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,541
[SAKAKI]
What's the matter, Prince Raj?

391
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,333
It's hardly like you
to think so much.

392
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,000
[RAJ] Right. I just cannot
find the answer.

393
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,125
[SAKAKI]
Answer?

394
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,166
[RAJ]
Yes. In the future.

395
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,833
As a prince, if there
is something I lack,

396
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,125
I'd like you to
inform me about it.

397
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,791
--[crash]
--[gasp]

398
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,666
[SERVANT A whimpers]

399
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,041
You dropped that.

400
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,000
All right, but after you
saw Shirayuki in Clarines,

401
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,625
it seems like you've been
trying to reexamine yourself

402
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,208
and all that.

403
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:21,916
[EUGENA]
Mm-mm!

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,583
Oh, you're exaggerating.

405
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,541
I'm not "reexamining."

406
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,916
I am only trying to make
myself even more perfect.

407
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Heh. Besides, I don't
know how long Shirayuki

408
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,958
is even going to
be at the castle.

409
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,583
She may get sick of me
and go home early.

410
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,625
Oh, Raj...

411
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,916
[footsteps]

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,833
[OBI]
Mm?

413
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,041
Obi, May I have a moment?

414
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,750
[OBI]
Your Highness?

415
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,916
I'm sorry there was trouble.

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,708
Can you convey that
to Shirayuki, as well?

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,958
Yes, Your Highness, of course.

418
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,291
What? Did you hear that?

419
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,666
He said that awfully
quiet, though.

420
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,583
[RONA] For our brother to
apologize for his own mistakes.

421
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,041
This is a huge step for him!

422
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you so much

423
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
for showing me the
greenhouse today.

424
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,708
[RAJ]
You're welcome.

425
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,250
And please, feel
free to go back

426
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,583
as much as you want when
you have the time.

427
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, Prince Raj?

428
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:35,083
I'll, um, I'll see you tomorrow!

429
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,250
Indeed.

[ZEN]
Mitsuhide.

431
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,291
Yes?

432
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,666
Earlier, why were you
with my brother?

433
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,958
[gasps] Oh, yeah, we were just
talking, that's all it was.

434
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,208
Ohh?

435
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,875
Uh... What are you oh-ing for?

436
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,125
I have no idea what my
brother might be thinking,

437
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,000
but we're not giving up.

438
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,416
Whatever he's doing
cannot get between us.

439
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,250
Yeah, that's what I told him.

440
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,333
[KIKI]
Zen.

441
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,916
[BOTH gasp]

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,250
We received a report that the
boy, Kazuki, has been sighted.

443
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,791
[ZEN gasps]
He has?

444
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,916
[KIKI]
Mm-hm. But, unfortunately,

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,666
Mihaya has disappeared from
the grounds of the castle.

446
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,125
[BOTH gasp]

447
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,666
[MIHAYA] I've been looking
for you, pretty boy.

448
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,958
[KAZUKI]
Oh, we've met before.

449
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,750
What is it? You have
business with me?

450
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,500
[MIHAYA] Well, I thought
I could make some cash

451
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:44,041
at the castle after meeting you,
but it wasn't going as expected.

452
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,500
So, I think I'll capture
the villain that's after Red

453
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,541
and just be rewarded for that!

454
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,750
To be honest,
it's a better plan!

455
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,875
Uh!

456
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,333
[MIHAYA yelps]

457
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,708
If you ask me, though.

458
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,666
You and I should work together.

459
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,750
Of course, I'll make sure that
you're paid very handsomely.

460
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,625
Who's paying? You?

461
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,000
The real "villain"
you mentioned.

462
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,875
My comrades will pay you.

463
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,708
[MIHAYA]
So what are you talkin' about?

464
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,666
Taking Red somewhere
more suitable

465
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,375
for her than the castle?

466
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,750
[KAZUKI]
Exactly.

467
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,875
[MIHAYA chuckles]
You're dreaming.

468
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,833
First of all, Red's
not even that cute.

469
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,375
Second, she has a terrifying
knight protecting her.

470
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,583
Isn't that standard
practice, though?

471
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,833
Kidnapping a princess
guarded by a knight?

472
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,916
[SAKAKI] There's a mysterious
charisma about that girl.

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,291
[RAJ]
I'm curious.

474
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,875
[SAKAKI]
Why don't you persuade Shirayuki

475
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,458
to stay in Tanbarun isntead?

476
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,500
[OBI]
I was thinking the same thing.

477
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,166
[RAJ] How would you classify
our relationship as it stands?
