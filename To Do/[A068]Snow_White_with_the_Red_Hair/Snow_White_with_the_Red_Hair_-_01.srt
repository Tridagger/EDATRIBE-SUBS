1
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Found it!

2
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,375
The spellami herb. It's
an ao shidare perennial.

3
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,125
If you steam and dry the
roots, it can lower fevers,

4
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,083
and alleviate pain, too.

5
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,666
[bell tolling]

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,375
Oh, my goodness.

7
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,916
Gotta open the shop!

8
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
This is it. My own path.

9
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,500
It's my story.

10
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
If I had my way,

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,833
I would keep charting
my own path like this.

12
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,416
No rules.

13
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,541
[chuckling]

14
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,875
[RAJ]
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

15
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,458
who's the fairest of them all?

16
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,041
Tell me true.

17
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,666
Your Highness.

18
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,458
What now, Sakaki?

19
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,000
[SAKAKI] This is in fact
an informant from town.

20
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,708
I'm afraid he is not a mirror.

21
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,500
[RAJ]
Ahem.

22
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,416
He's telling me what he sees,
that's basically the same thing.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,750
[SAKAKI sighs]

24
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,125
Still, please try to take
things more seriously.

25
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,708
Informant!

26
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,375
Don't just sit there.
Start talking!

27
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,000
[INFORMANT]
Uh, yes, Highness!

28
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,708
You wanna know who
the most beautiful girl

29
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,708
in the kingdom of
Tanbarun is, right?

30
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,458
Well, there is...
this girl I know of.

31
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,750
And who is this girl?

32
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,083
[INFORMANT]
Ah,

33
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,750
she is a maiden born with
exceptionally rare red hair,

34
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,625
as bright and rosy
as a ripe apple.

35
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,041
Her name is Shirayuki, Highness.

36
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,791
[CHILD]
Thank you, miss! Bye, bye!

37
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,041
Goodbye. Take your medicine now!

38
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,125
[YOSHI]
See ya soon, Miss Shirayuki.

39
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,208
Okay. Feel better, Yoshi.

40
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,583
Thanks for your patience.

41
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,166
You're still waiting for
your medicine, right, Kino?

42
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,125
Yes, but please,
take your time,

43
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,750
I just came to let my eyes
rest on your beautiful hair.

44
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,250
I've never seen anything
quite so extraordinary!

45
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,083
That's so sweet. Thank you.

46
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,500
But since I already
have you here,

47
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,458
I'll start preparing
another remedy.

48
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,791
I found some good
medicinal herbs,

49
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,541
so please take some with you.

50
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,333
[KINO crying]

51
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,541
You have turned into a
very fine young herbalist.

52
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,083
If only your late grandparents
could see this.

53
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,791
They would be
beaming with pride.

54
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,958
Oh, no. Kino, please don't--

55
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,958
Oh, my goodness! I believe I
left the stove on, I must go!

56
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

57
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,208
[KINO]
Oh dear, silly me.

58
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,250
[KINO chuckling]

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,833
I guess I can just
take it to her later.

60
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,291
Did you forget something?

61
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,666
You said Prince
Raj's... concubine?

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,708
Yes. In other words,
you would be his mistress.

63
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,333
Absurd!

64
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,666
I can't believe
he'd be interested

65
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,083
in a common girl like me

66
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,750
just because of the
color of my hair.

67
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,833
I'd be an embarrassment to him.

68
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,916
Still, Prince Raj has
taken a liking to you.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,416
Therefore, you are required
to formally appear

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,666
at the castle tomorrow morning.

71
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,208
I suggest you look presentable.

72
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,791
[SHIRAYUKI] For Kino,
something to ease her back pain

73
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
and her inflamed
respiratory tract.

74
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,541
At Yuri's place, both
the father and the baby

75
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,041
were starting to come
down with colds.

76
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, so who's next?

77
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,958
That takes care of everyone.

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,583
[SHIRAYUKI] Please know
this wasn't your fault.

79
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Goodbye, Tanbarun.

80
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,208
I'll miss you.

81
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,750
[knocking]

82
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Excuse me!

83
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,500
Excuse me!

84
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,416
Is anyone home?
May I come inside?

85
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,583
[SHIRAYUKI sighs]

86
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:38,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I can't just
go in without being invited.

87
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,458
But it's already getting dark.

88
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
And I'm starting to get hungry.

89
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,000
[MAN] Mitsuhide, Kiki!
I'm going on ahead!

90
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,291
[MITSUHIDE] Hey, careful,
braggart! You'll hurt yourself.

91
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,833
[gasps]

92
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,875
[thud]

93
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,583
I told you so, Zen!

94
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,083
Are you hurt? Did you
fall on your head?

95
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,416
Tell me, what's one plus one?

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,416
Purple.

97
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,083
Wait. Who're you again?

98
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,666
It's me, Mitsuhide!

99
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,666
Oh, I forgot.
Was that your name?

100
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,708
Kiki! Not helping
even a little bit!

101
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,000
[ZEN laughing]

102
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,041
[ZEN]
Hold.

103
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,666
[ZEN]
Mind telling me who you are?

104
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,541
And what you're doing
in the woods all alone.

105
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, I just, uh...

106
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,375
I just left my home,
and I was in a hurry

107
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,708
so I got rather lost and ended
up on a random road and...

108
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,041
...I'm here.

109
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,583
You have very unusual hair.

110
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah, I know.
I hear that frequently.

111
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, your arm. It's injured!

112
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,333
Eh, I've had worse.

113
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,500
You're in luck.
I'm an herbalist.

114
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,625
I have a healing poultice
you can use on it, that'll help.

115
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,000
[ZEN]
No, thanks.

116
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,625
It could be poison or something.

117
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,916
I'm not going to fall
for that little trick.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,666
I wasn't born yesterday, y'know.

119
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,125
Trust is something
earned, not given.

120
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,875
In other words, we're done here.

121
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,708
Oh.

122
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,458
So, off you go, then.

123
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,541
[SHIRAYUKI] Well, he does
have a valid point.

124
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,666
I guess I'll have to convince
him I'm not any kind of threat.

125
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
Hey. What the--?

126
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,291
No-- What're you--?

127
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,458
Sorry to disappoint, but
I don't usually carry poison.

128
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,666
[MITSUHIDE laughing]

129
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,291
She sure got you there, Zen.

130
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,000
[ZEN laughing]

131
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,083
[sighs]

132
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,833
I'm sorry about that.
My name's Zen.

133
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,708
And mine is Shirayuki.

134
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,750
It's lovely to
meet you, Shirayuki.

135
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,208
However, I think you're at
least partially responsible

136
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,250
for my less than
graceful landing.

137
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

138
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,625
[ZEN] No one lives in this
house, but we spend time here.

139
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,708
So, the one getting beaten at
chess over there is Mitsuhide,

140
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,666
The one doing the
beating is Kiki.

141
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,750
Zen, how do you know I'm losing

142
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,000
when you aren't even paying
attention to the game?

143
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,333
I can just tell.

144
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,583
I'm shellacking you.

145
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,625
[MITSUHIDE growls]

146
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,791
Okay, you're all fixed up now.

147
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,833
Wow, you've got impressive
skills, Shirayuki.

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
I've been at this a while.

149
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,750
I did tell you
I was an herbalist.

150
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,333
Yes, you did.

151
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,000
So, why would a talented
herbalist run away from home?

152
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,791
The reason's not important.

153
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,916
Excuse me, I need some air.

154
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,166
Hey, why did you come with me?

155
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,041
I couldn't let you go into these
woods all by your lonesome.

156
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,208
That would be quite
ungentlemanly.

157
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oddball.

158
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,666
I became very comfortable
in the mountains and forests

159
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,958
while studying
to be an herbalist.

160
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,750
[SHIRAYUKI sighs]

161
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
The time and air here
seem to flow differently

162
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,666
than they do in town.

163
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,333
I actually like it much better.

164
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,833
[ZEN]
I couldn't agree more.

165
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Look who isn't
all bluff and bluster.

166
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,958
Ow!

167
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,791
That really hurts.

168
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,041
Oh, looks like
your hair's caught.

169
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,333
You have a strand that's
longer than the others.

170
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh? Oh...

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,791
I must've missed
that piece earlier.

172
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,708
Uh, hey, Zen, will you
cut it off for me?

173
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,583
[ZEN]
Huh.

174
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,250
It doesn't have to be straight.

175
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,958
[ZEN]
Possibly.

176
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,875
But I'll only do it if you
answer a question for me.

177
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

178
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,666
[ZEN] Did cutting your hair
have something to do

179
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,833
with why you ran away from home?

180
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,708
If you tell me the reason,
maybe then I can help you.

181
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,791
You're a terrible person.

182
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,208
[ZEN chuckles]

183
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,000
[ZEN] You were ordered
to be a concubine?

184
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, by a very famous boy.

185
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
He was born with a silver
spoon in his mouth,

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
but he learned to speak
in the red-light district.

187
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,833
He thought my hair was unusual,

188
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,750
and wanted to keep it
for himself like a prize.

189
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,208
If I had obeyed his order,

190
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,208
it would've been just
like he was buying an apple

191
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,708
at the fruit seller.

192
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,583
Shirayuki--

193
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
So that's why,

194
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,125
I thought that I'd give him at
least part of what he wanted,

195
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,416
and I left my hair behind.

196
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,750
[ZEN laughing]

197
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,416
That was ingenious thinking!

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

199
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,166
Good job getting away
from that dunce.

200
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,208
It's your lucky red, after all.

201
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,833
What do you mean by that?

202
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,916
Well...

203
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,750
Color has meaning.

204
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,750
And red is supposed
to represent fate.

205
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,541
You may not like it much now,
but your red might lead

206
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,250
to something good when
you least expect it.

207
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,875
Wow, you have an
amazing outlook, Zen.

208
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh! Some respect!

209
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,041
[MITSUHIDE]
How 'bout that.

210
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,000
Not so suspicious anymore.

211
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,166
Yup, but it doesn't hurt

212
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,833
that Zen has taken
quite a shine to her.

213
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,083
[ZEN]
What's this?

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, no.

215
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,625
That's the ribbon
I had tied to my hair.

216
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,791
[ZEN]
So you're from Tanbarun, I see.

217
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,625
Meaning the person who
dropped off this basket

218
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,000
traveled all the way to
the border just to find you.

219
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,416
He is a determined fellow.
I'll give him that much.

220
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,791
[SHIRAYUKI chuckles]

221
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,416
Right?

222
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,916
This isn't a joke!

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,666
How bad was it that you were
forced to flee the kingdom?

224
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,958
I had to leave
because of who he is.

225
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,791
Someone powerful.
The first prince of Tanbarun.

226
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,666
[ZEN]
Raj?

227
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,958
That royal moron?

228
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Are you all right?

229
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,125
Yes, that's him.

230
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,625
He's so stupid that even all the
neighboring countries know it.

231
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,208
I don't blame you for running.

232
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
He doubtlessly had people
everywhere tearing apart

233
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,541
all the border crossing records.

234
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,875
Do you really believe
he would go that far?

235
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,166
If there's something
he wants bad enough,

236
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,291
he probably already assumes
it belongs to him.

237
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,833
Even if it means caging it.

238
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,041
He's awful.

239
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,208
[ZEN]
Hm?

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,666
It's starting to go bad.

241
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,625
This red is no good
to anyone now.

242
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm just kidding.

243
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,833
Zen.

244
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,458
How uncouth of you.

245
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,958
That's her apple, Zen.
Why don't you go get your own?

246
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:45,625
What're you--

247
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,166
[ZEN coughing]

248
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,125
[MITSUHIDE] You should either
talk or eat. Don't do both.

249
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,250
[ZEN]
Nobody asked you.

250
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,166
Stay out of it!

251
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,083
Well, now you're
just being rude.

252
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:53,791
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen!

253
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,750
What now?!

254
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,000
I was being foolish. I'm sorry.

255
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,916
Shirayuki, I would put that
apple down if I were you.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,125
Kiki, Mitsuhide. Don't get mad.

257
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,291
[BOTH]
Zen!

258
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,166
[MITSUHIDE]
What happened?

259
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
[KIKI]
Zen!

260
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's poisoned!

261
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,166
Can you help him?!

262
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
Give me a moment!

263
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,208
It's no good. I can't prepare
one with what I have.

264
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,041
If I don't hurry...

265
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,833
[MESSENGER]
My, my. It looks as though

266
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,958
someone else has tasted the
apple instead of Miss Shirayuki.

267
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,416
Who're you?

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,666
Oh, no.

269
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,416
[MESSENGER]
Hmm.

270
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,541
This changes things.

271
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,125
How could you do this?!

272
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,666
Calm yourself, miss. A certain
someone possesses the antidote.

273
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,125
I trust now you will
come with me quietly?

274
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,500
[RAJ]
Oh, so you made it!

275
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,791
I have to say,
it's quite a surprise.

276
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,000
I didn't believe that red hair
you left behind was real.

277
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,541
Uh, so what about the antidote?

278
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,083
[RAJ]
All in good time.

279
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,125
Just so you know,
Miss Shirayuki,

280
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,833
the world is very judgmental.

281
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,458
The fact that I graciously
courted you and you ran away

282
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,291
has since made me a
laughingstock all over Tanbarun

283
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,875
and in the royal palace.

284
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,375
Thanks to you, public opinion
of me has plummeted drastically.

285
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,625
However, despite my
shame, the unanimous opinion

286
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,500
is that it's nobody else's
fault but your own.

287
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,750
Understand.

288
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,458
We have to wipe the filth
from my good name.

289
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,041
And in order to do that, you'll
have to become my concubine.

290
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,708
I would never dream of causing
a woman embarrassment.

291
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,750
Not even a lowly commoner
such as yourself.

292
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,083
You can thank me for
my generosity, now.

293
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Are-- Are you kidding me?

294
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,458
And will you please focus?

295
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,125
What's more important
is the antidote!

296
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,750
My friend is very sick, and
he needs to have it right away!

297
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,458
Oh, that's right, of course!

298
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,916
If you agree to my proposal,

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I will have it delivered
here for him immediately.

300
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,375
Or, dearest...

301
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,583
...would you prefer I give
him another apple, instead.

302
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,666
[ZEN]
Color has meaning.

303
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,791
And red is supposed
to represent fate.

304
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,333
You may not like it much now,
but your red might lead

305
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,041
to something good when
you least expect it.

306
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Lead to something good?

307
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,083
The only thing I led
Zen to is poison.

308
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,250
[RAJ]
I have to say,

309
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,333
now that I can see how
truly beautiful you are,

310
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,416
I think I should keep
you very close to me.

311
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,166
Wha--? Why'd you--?

312
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, my apologies.

313
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,208
Fine, Prince Raj.

314
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,625
Take me if you wish.

315
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,875
But you should know
what you're getting.

316
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:48,833
[SOLDIER A]
Wait, stay back!

317
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,916
--[thud]
--[BOTH gasp]

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,416
[RAJ]
Huh?

319
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,041
I object!

320
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,125
Zen!

321
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,875
You wretch!

322
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,208
[ZEN] You will stop spewing
such disgusting filth

323
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,875
that sullies that poor girl's
ears, you boorish pig!

324
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,000
[RAJ whimpering]

325
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:12,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen!

326
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,833
Shirayuki, hey. Tie this for me?

327
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,000
Wait, before that,
what about your body?

328
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,416
Are you okay?

329
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,250
I've spent the last few years
building up an immunity

330
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,208
to different poisons.

331
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Yeah, but you--

332
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,708
[RAJ]
Aha!

333
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,875
So you were the one who took
a bite of the poisoned apple.

334
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,750
Well, that was
rather unfortunate.

335
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,000
I was planning on
immobilizing Miss Shirayuki

336
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,541
so I could take her
back home with me.

337
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,833
Why am I not surprised that
you were behind a bad apple?

338
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,750
Best mind your manners
around me, country boy!

339
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,041
Peasants like you should
show more respect to royalty.

340
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,333
[ZEN]
Oh, pardon me,

341
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,083
sensitive, delicate first
monarch of Tanbarun,

342
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,208
I mean, Prince Raj Schenazade.

343
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,583
[RAJ]
Heh?

344
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,708
[ZEN] I'm not one for
formal introductions, but...

345
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,750
I recognize that crest.

346
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,666
[ZEN]
As well you should, imbecile.

347
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,666
Meet the Second Prince
of Clarines kingdom,

348
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,166
I'm Zen Wisteria.

349
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,333
A... prince?

350
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,291
[gasps]

351
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,083
Did he say prince?

352
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,166
Zen, please calm down.
Get a hold of yourself!

353
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,541
Wait! Do you know who I am?
What's one plus one?

354
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
It's true, Shirayuki.

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,291
But I never actually thought
I'd be poisoned by anyone,

356
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,041
much less a half-wit prince
from a neighboring kingdom.

357
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,916
Could mean war.

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,916
No. Besides, you...

359
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,750
You have no proof whatsoever
that I poisoned the apple!

360
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,208
Oh, I think we have plenty.

361
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, we'll see what's what

362
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,500
when we make an
official inquiry, liar.

363
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,375
No! Please wait, I--

364
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,708
Well then, why don't we
make a trade, Prince Moron?

365
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,500
If you don't want your
deceptive actions

366
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,416
to be a matter of public record,

367
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,875
then swear you will never
come near Shirayuki again,

368
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,208
or even dare to say
her name out loud.

369
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,208
How do you know Shirayuki?

370
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,416
[RAJ yelping]

371
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay, okay! I promise!
Please! Cross my heart!

372
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,458
Shirayuki,

373
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,750
surely you have a few things
you'd like to say to him.

374
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,916
If you want to air
some grievances,

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,791
you should do it now.

376
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
Here, Prince Raj.

377
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,000
To get your strength back,

378
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,875
since you're so shocked,
you can't even move. Also...

379
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,791
[RAJ]
Yes?

380
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,500
Give Zen the antidote, now.

381
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,375
[RAJ]
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,000
[RAJ screaming]

383
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you.

384
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,583
For what, Shirayuki?

385
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,416
Because you saved me
from danger, Zen.

386
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,125
But I'm sorry.

387
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,708
It would seem that I'm
only poisonous to you.

388
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,833
Is that supposed to be a joke?

389
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,166
Because I was poisoned by an
apple, and you're as red as one,

390
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,750
is that what you mean?

391
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,083
No, not really.

392
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,458
[KIKI]
Don't worry.

393
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,458
It's not something for
which you need to apologize.

394
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,625
Zen made the choice to
eat the apple himself,

395
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,333
but we all should've been
a lot more careful about it.

396
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,416
That's all.

397
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,791
Although, Mitsuhide carried on

398
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,125
like the end of
the world was near

399
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,666
and started to weep
like a child.

400
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,083
Hey, shut up, Kiki!

401
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,083
[KIKI]
So tragic.

402
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,375
[ZEN]
Okay, okay.

403
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,625
Next time I get fruit,

404
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,291
I'll have Mitsuhide test
it out before I eat it.

405
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh, what's that, now?

406
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,166
[ZEN laughing]

407
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,666
[ZEN]
Shirayuki,

408
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,625
do you remember what I said
to you in the forest?

409
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,458
I meant every word.

410
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,416
And I truly hope our fate
brought us together

411
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
for something good.

412
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,041
We both happened to be
in the same place

413
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,166
for very different reasons,
and we saved each other.

414
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,375
Maybe poison isn't always bad.

415
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,708
Maybe our meeting
wasn't a fluke,

416
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,500
but instead the beginning
of a new chapter.

417
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,333
I guess it's up to you, now.

418
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,458
Is that true? I can
choose my fate for myself?

419
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,041
Of course.

420
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,291
That's exactly what I'm doing,
and nobody's going to stop me.

421
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,791
You can follow one path, or you
can go a different direction,

422
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,333
neither of which is wrong.

423
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,833
Zen, you--

424
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,083
I what?

425
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,958
You know, I really do
like the way you think.

426
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,375
But it's not how I think.

427
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,750
It's how I live.

428
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,125
So, what's your answer?

429
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:13,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, it's literally my story.

430
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,708
If I had my way,

431
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,291
on the path in front of
us after this encounter,

432
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,083
you could hear the sound of
pages turning in this story,

433
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:28,333
and they would echo like my
footsteps, moving towards...

434
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,916
Destiny.

435
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,583
[ZEN]
And now, I have.

436
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Clarines is a lovely place.

437
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,250
[MIHAYA]
What a valiant effort.

438
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,125
[ZEN]
What? Shirayuki's not here?

439
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, yes.

440
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,958
There's a reason I've decided
to stay in this country.

441
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,833
[MIHAYA] Are you finally
done running, Princess?
