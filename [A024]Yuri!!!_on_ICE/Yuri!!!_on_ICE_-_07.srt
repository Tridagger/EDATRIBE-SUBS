Well done, Yuri!

10
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:53,791
We were all very impressed.

That was seriously amazing!

No, no, no! I totally did!
A little, anyway.

Ahhh...

20
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,791
[VICTOR] Nap until the
event starts this evening.

21
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,333
It will be okay.

22
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,125
I slept until the last minute
before competitions too.

[YURI grunts]

27
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,958
Can't... open.

Huh?!

You didn't take
a nap, did you, Yuri?

Huh? I did, I did, I did!

00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,208
You're not allowed any
jumps during warm-up.

00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,291
Huh?

33
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,291
That's an official order
from your coach.

34
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,333
[MOROOKA] We've reached
the second half of the event,

35
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,666
and Group 2 is taking the ice.

36
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,958
[VICTOR] If he flubs
a jump during the warm-up,

37
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,916
it will only shake his
confidence even more

00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,166
He gets nervous too easily.

[MOROOKA] Let's hope skater
Katsuki is all right.

41
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,208
He doesn't look very
happy after his warm-up.

Oh, my poor Yuri.

00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,458
That look on his face.

I've seen that look
a lot, and it's never good.

land it in competition

China's young ace, age 17.

He's in sixth place
after the short program.

He will be skating to

from the movie <i>Shanghai Blade</i> .

60
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,875

["The Inferno" playing]

62
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,750
[GUANG-HONG]
I went with this music

63
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
because my coach
pushed it so hard,

64
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,875
but I don't see how skating as
an assassin can make me a hero.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,083
[MOROOKA]
Looks like he over-rotated,

66
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,541
but that's another quad toe loop

67
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,875
after the one in
his short program.

68
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,500
[GUANG-HONG]
I've been living

69

I'm starting a new life.

Yes!

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,333
It's going even better
than it did in warm-up.

75
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,500
[MOROOKA]
He landed all the jumps

76
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,416
in the first half
of his program.

[GUANG-HONG]
How does the story go from here?

88
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
The protagonist
infiltrates the enemy lair

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,666
and fights his way to the top,
where the enemy boss awaits.

90
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,458

He's surprised to run

91

into an old friend.

now that the
pressure to win is off.

[MOROOKA]
Here comes the step sequence!

95

Look at that speed--it's
like watching a car chase.

96
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,791
He's barreling
toward the finish!

00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,458
[GUANG-HONG] With his
friend guarding his back,

98

the protagonist takes on
the enemy organization's boss.

99
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,375
[MOROOKA] His last jump is a
double axel. Nice and clean!

He will be skating to
"Rapsodie Espagnole."

His technical score
in the short program

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,791
was below Guang-hong Ji's,

121
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,916
but his presentation
score was much higher,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,041
allowing him to place fifth,
above the skater from China.

quads for the first half

but he seems

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,666
even more focused
than in the short program.

00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,791
Did something happen
between him and Victor?

346
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
[VICTOR] "You don't
have to say anything."

347
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,208
[YURI] Just have more faith
that I'm going to win than I do.

348
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
[VICTOR] I should have
asked Yakov what to do

349
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
in situations like this.

350
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,750
[MOROOKA]
With a combined score of 252.44,


351
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,750
Georgi Popovich
is in third place.


352
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
There is some
room for improvement.


353
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,416
I must try to take this
program to the next level


354
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,791
before the Russian nationals.


355
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,250
I'd say there is <i>much</i>
room for improvement.


356
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,166
[MOROOKA] The last skater
is Yuri Katsuki, from Japan.

357
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,416
He finished the short
program in first place.

358
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
[YAKOV] If your student
is trying to console you,

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,625
you still have a long way
to go as a coach, Vitya.

360
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,208
[MOROOKA] He will be
skating to "Yuri on Ice."

361
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,583
["Yuri on Ice" plays]

362
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,416
[YURI] I feel a lot
better after crying.

363
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,458
And the look on Victor's face
when I started to tear up--

364
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,625
that was priceless.

365
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,833
[VICTOR]
Why is he smiling?

366
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,208
[YURI]
I've cried after a competition,

367
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,875
but that's the first time
I've cried before one.

368
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,625
Anyway, the first jump.

369
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,125
a quadruple toe loop,
double toe loop combination.

370
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,083
[ANNOUNCER B]
Quadruple, double.

371
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,958
[shrieks]

372
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,041
[YURI]
Better than I expected.

373
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,375
[MOROOKA]
His first quad was a success.

374
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,958
In this free skate program,

375
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,833
Yuri Katsuki plans to do three
quads of two different types.

376
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,041
He's unusually relaxed today.
I wonder why.

377
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,666
Don't fall, don't fall,
don't fall! Don't fall!

378
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,666
[YURI] Victor's too
inexperienced as a coach.

379
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,416
It's not like it's news that I
get nervous before competitions.

380
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,875
He should have been
prepared for that.

381
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,583
Stupid Victor.

382
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,541
A quadruple Salchow.

383
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,708
[YURI]
Huh. I made it.

384
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,833
That was beautiful!

385
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,666
[MOROOKA] His theme
for this season is "love."

386
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,041
Love changed me.
I'm stronger now.

387
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,166
And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final.

388
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,333
With a gold medal!

389
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,625
[MOROOKA] He made
a memorable declaration

390
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,041
at the press conference.

391
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,541
[ANNOUNCER B]
A triple loop.

392
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,708
[MOROOKA]
Beautiful.

393
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,750
[MOROOKA] One of his
favorites, the triple axel.

394
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,750
Oh, no. Looks like
he touched down.

395
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,916
[YURI] I could have
controlled the speed better.

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,916
Not bad, though, considering
I didn't do it during warm-up.

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,208
Next is a triple flip.

398
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,791
Hmm.

399
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,583
What if I made the last quad
a flip instead of a toe loop?

400
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,625
I wonder what Victor
would think about that.

401
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,541
[MOROOKA] Up next is
a triple axel, single loop,

402
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,958
triple Salchow combination.

403
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,791
[AUDIENCE cheers]

404
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,541
[MOROOKA]
He over-rotated on that one.

405
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,458
[YURI]
Could be worse,

406
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,458
given how little
sleep I've gotten.

407
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,708
[MOROOKA] Triple Lutz,
triple toe loop combination.

408
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,958
He's not showing any signs
of fatigue even this late

409
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,625
in the program as he moves
on to the step sequence.

410
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,875
[YURI]
I want to become stronger.

411
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,333
I will become stronger.

412
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,958
I can surpass Victor's
wildest imagination!

413
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,666
[MOROOKA]
For his final jump,

414
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,625
he's planned a
quadruple toe loop.

415
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,083
[MOROOKA]
No!

416
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,791
He changed it
to a quadruple flip!

417
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
He fell, but it looked like
there were enough rotations.

418
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,833
[MOROOKA] The quadruple
flip was a signature move

419
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,666
of Victor Nikiforov, his coach.

420
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,125
But not even Nikiforov ever
did a jump of that difficulty

421
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,291
at the end of a program,

422
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,583
when his fatigue
would be at its peak.

423
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,875
Here is one skater who
just keeps on surprising us.

424
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,291
Yuri Katsuki!

425
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,541
Huh? Huh?
Was that a quad flip?

426
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,583
[pants]

427
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:43,083
[YURI]
Is he crying? Is he mad?

428
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,250
I need to know!

429
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,458
[YURI]
Victor!

430
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,875
See that? I did great, right?

431
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,458
[VICTOR] I wanted
to surprise you more

432
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,625
than you've surprised me.

433
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,625
This was the only thing
I could think of.

434
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,416
Well, it worked.

435
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,208
[YURI]
At the Cup of China,

436
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,250
Phichit won his first gold.

437
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,791
And I kept Chris in
check by winning silver.

438
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
Yuri's already proven

439
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,541
he's the skater
to beat this year.

440
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,458
Now, with the quad
flip in his roster,

441
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,166
I'm sure he'll win
the Rostelecom Cup

442
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,250
and advance
to the Grand Prix final.

443
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,708
I look forward to returning
to Russia as his coach.

444
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,750
[MIRA]
Hear that, Yuri?

445
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,750
[PLISETSKY] In Moscow,
I'll make you into borscht.

446
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,875
Little piggy bastard.

447
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,708
[VICTOR] Say the name
of the airport we're landing

448
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,333
at ten times, Yuri.

449
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,000
[YURI] Sheremetyevo,
Sheremetyevo, Sheremetyevo...

450
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,125
[VICTOR] Next time, Eighth
Skate: "Yuri vs. Yuri.

451
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,041
The Horror!!

452
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,541
Rostelecom Cup,
Short Program."

453
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,375
[YURI] One step closer
to the Grand Prix Final!

454
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,291
[VICTOR]
From Russia with love.
