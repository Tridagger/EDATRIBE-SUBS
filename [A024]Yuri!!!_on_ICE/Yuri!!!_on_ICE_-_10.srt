1
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
[VICTOR]
Sometimes you need a vacation.

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,333
Time away from your
hectic everyday life

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,125
when you can relax
and be yourself.

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,958
On the rare occasions
when I take time

5
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,833
away from skating,
two "L-words" come into mind.

6
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,166
"Life" and "love."

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,541
I've spent the last 20 years
neglecting both of them.

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,166
[YURI]
"Gotta Supercharge It!

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,666
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!"

10
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,791
[VICTOR sneezes]

11
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,958
[VICTOR]
It's not Siberia,

12
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,000
but Barcelona's still
cold in December.

13
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,375
[CHRISTOPHE] I figured that
a Russian would be the only one

14
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,750
besides me stupid enough
to get into the pool

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
this time of year.

16
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,291
[VICTOR]
Hm?

17
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,541
[CHRISTOPHE]
I guess I was right.

18
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,291
[VICTOR]
Chris!

19
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,041
Hi. How's Coach Victor?

20
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,375
Here I was hoping I would
get to go skinny dipping.

21
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,791
[VICTOR]
Don't let me stop you.

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,666
I'll even take
pictures if you want.

23
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,000
[camera shutter clicks]

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,958
[VICTOR]
Hi! My name is Victor Nikiforov.

25
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,750
I was kidding about
being on vacation.

26
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,458
I just arrived
in Barcelona, Spain,

27
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,666
for the Grand Prix
Figure Skating Final.

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,125
That is Christophe Giacometti
from Switzerland.

29
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,666
[CHRISTOPHE] I'm one of
the oldest skaters left

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,208
now that you're gone.

31
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,750
[sighs]

32
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
I'm a relic at age 25!

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,375
[VICTOR] These days,
Chris practically oozes sex

34
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,750
whether he's on
the ice of off of it.

35
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,291
But when I first met him
at the European Championships,

36
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,750
he was like a pure little boy

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,916
running through
the Swiss meadows.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,250
I've shared the podium with him

39
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,125
at many Grand Prix Finals,
European Championships,

40
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,666
and World Championships
over the years.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,750
We've been skating against
each other for so long,

42
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,875
I can't imagine
a season without him,

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,583
and he worried he'd
lose all motivation

44
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,875
without me to compete
against this year.

45
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,541
As it turns out,
he was wrong about that.

46
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,666
He made it to the
Grand Prix Final.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,916
Yuri! Check yourself in now.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
You check in for me.

49
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,416
I don't feel like
dealing with it.

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,541
--[FANGIRLS squeal]
--[PLISETSKY gasps]

51
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,541
--Yurochka!
--Can I get an autograph?

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,291
How about a photo?

53
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:31,916
You <i>Vetm</i> --

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,791
Yuri Plisetsky!

55
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,833
We do not use such
unattractive words.

56
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,333
[growls]

57
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,166
[VICTOR] From Russia,
we have Yuri Plisetsky.

58
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,291
Only 15, he qualified
for the Final

59
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,583
in his first year
at the senior level.

60
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,125
He's a feisty tomcat studying
under my former coach, Yakov.

61
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,750
During a visit to Japan,
he earned the nickname "Yurio."

62
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,375
His rabid fans are
known as "Yuri's Angels"

63
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,416
and show up in droves to support
him at every competition.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,583
[PLISETSKY groaning]

65
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,041
[ISABELLA]
Wow, he's a popular one, huh?

66
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,583
Yuri's Angels are famous.

67
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,750
They're quite enthusiastic.

68
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh?

69
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,916
[ISABELLA]
JJ Girls are enthusiastic

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,791
but we show more restraint.
Not to mention, we're cuter.

71
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,916
[growls]

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,333
Who the hell do
you think you are,

73
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,333
talking about my fans
like that? <i>Vedma</i> !

74
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,041
He's a scary little boy.
Protect me, JJ.

75
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,750
[JEAN-JACQUES] Don't pay
attention to him, darling.

76
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,708
He's just jealous because
my fiancée is so beautiful.

77
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,583
[VICTOR] And that one is
Jean-Jacques Leroy, from Canada.

78
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,375
He's a strong contender
for the gold,

79
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,708
but there's something about him

80
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,583
that keeps the other
competitors at arm's length.

81
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,666
Any guy who wears
sunglasses on his head

82
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,291
like that is a douche.

83
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,125
You can do better
than him, bitch.

84
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,375
--Hey now, easy.
--[ISABELLA] Scary!

85
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,625
We're all friends
here, aren't we?

86
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,750
Otabek! Going out?

87
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,333
Just getting some food.

88
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,791
[VICTOR] Otabek Altin
from Kazakhstan, age 18.

89
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,958
He was one of the first
to qualify for the GP Final.

90
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,541
He shared the podium with me
at World's last season,

91
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,833
and he had a certain
presence about him.

92
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,833
People don't know much about
his personal life, though.

93
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,625
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Going out to eat alone?

94
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,833
Still as odd
as ever, aren't you?

95
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,083
You can join us
for dinner if you want.

96
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
Thanks, I'll pass.

97
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,291
[VICTOR]
He doesn't seem interested

98
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
in socializing with
other skaters.

99
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,791
[OTABEK grunts]

100
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,166
Huh? Hey, why are you
staring at me, asshole?

101
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,541
--Uh...
--[phone chimes]

102
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,250
[PHICHIT] Yuri's not answering.
There's too much to do!

103
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,750
I can't stand around
here all night.

104
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,875
Going to Sagrada Familia!

105
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,541
All right, see you later.

106
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,458
[PHICHIT grunts]

107
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,750
Okay!

108
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,958
[VICTOR]
Phichit Chulanont from Thailand.

109
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
He won the Cup of China,
becoming the first skater

110
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,208
from Southeast Asia to qualify
for the Grand Prix Final.

111
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,166
He's a talented skater, but he's
also a gifted taker of selfies.

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,833
He was Yuri's rink
mate back in Detroit.

113
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
And Yuri says he's
the only foreign skater

114
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,708
that he considers a friend.

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,291
The last of the six skaters
to make it to the Final

116
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,083
qualified by a hair's breadth
after placing fourth

117
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
at the Rostelecom Cup.

118
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,625
That would be this
jet-lagged sleeping beauty.

119
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,291
Yuri Katsuki of Japan.

120
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,958
He's the reason I'm here.

121
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
I've been Yuri's
coach this season.

122
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,416
After the Rostelecom Cup,

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
Yuri spent the remaining
days until the Final

124
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,958
getting in as much
practice time as he could.

125
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,041
Hard to believe it's
already been eight months

126
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,583
since I came to Hasetsu.
I can't remember when I last

127
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,833
spent this much time
with Makkachin.

128
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,916
Every day, I get to
soak in a bath

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
bigger than any tub.

130
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,833
And I get to eat as many pork
cutlet bowls as I could want.

131
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,791
This is heaven on earth.

132
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,208
I've learned a lot over
the past eight months.

133
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,125
Yuri's life and love
have opened up

134
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,000
a brand new world for me,
one I never new existed.

135
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,041
Huh? Victor isn't here?

136
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,958
[YURI] Mm? I guess he's
at the pool with Chris.

137
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,875
Looks like Phichit's here.

138
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,583
[YURI]
And JJ.

139
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,208
[YURI]
And Yurio.

140
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,708

and I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final

with a gold medal!"

[CHISTOPHE laughing]

150
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,416
Yuri, I'm freezing!

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,916
Will you draw me a hot bath?
I can't feel my toes.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,041
[CHRISTOPHE]
Oh, and while you're at it,

153
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,041
how about some coffee?

154
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,458
[VICTOR]
You were still asleep?

155
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,666

00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,875
[YURI]
Jeez! You're like human icicles!

158
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,541
Get off me, both of you!
I'm not your heating pad!

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,458
[VICTOR] Yuri's planned an
aggressive jump composition,

160
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,500
including a quadruple flip,
which he's yet to land,

161
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,500
for his final free skate jump.

162
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,791
Even if he skates
a flawless program,

163
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,458
if he sticks with his old jumps,
JJ has a higher base score.

164
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,416
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Enough practice for today.

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,958
I'm off, everybody.

166
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,166
[growls]

167
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,958
Right. Let's go over it
one more time, Yuri.

168
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,125
What should we do
with the rest of the day?

169
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,666
You should probably
take it easy.

170
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,375
Get a good night's sleep before
the short program tomorrow.

171
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,333
Don't you go turning into
a model coach on me now.

172
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,333
This is my first time
in to Barcelona.

173
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,166
Take me sightseeing!

174
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,458
Your wish is my command.

175
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,791
[BOTH]
Yay!

176
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,000
Salud!

177
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,000
Perfecto!

[VICTOR]
Ah! I haven't shopped in ages.

179
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
This is fun!

180
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,625
I think I need a break.

181
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,875
I only wish we could've come
when the Euro was weaker.

182
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,125
You're having fun, da?

183
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,833
Oh. Mm-hm!

184
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,583
[VICTOR] Every competitor
has a different way

185
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,916
of winding down.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Yuri doesn't normally
suggest we go sightseeing.

187
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,541
Maybe that's an indicator

188
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,000
of just how nervous
he is this time.

189
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,083
[VICTOR]
All right, then.

190
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,375
[VICTOR]
Come on!

191
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,833
I'm going to buy you
a suit for your birthday.

192
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,375
And then we can burn
the suit and tie

193
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,083
you wore at that
press conference.

194
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,166
Huh?

195
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,708
Hold on a sec, you don't
have to do that!

196
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,291
And besides, I kind of
like that suit.

197
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,458
Victor!

Yurochka, where are you?

200
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,500
[PLISETSKY FANGIRL 10A] I wanted
him to come to the fan meeting!

201
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,291
[gasps] I have his scent!

202
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,250
It leads that way!

203
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,500
Ah! A piece of his hair!

204
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,458
He's nearby.

205
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,583
[PLISETSKY]
Crap! How can I escape them?

[motorcycle revs]

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,583
Yuri, get on.

208
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,500
What? Why would you...?

209
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,083
Hey, it's Yurochka!

210
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,791
Look!

211
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,000
He's with Otabek Altin!

212
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,958
Huh? Huh?

213
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,208
What'll it be? Coming or not?

[PLISETSKY gasps]

215
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,291
[VICTOR] Athletes aren't
the only ones sensitive

216
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,750
to the unexpected
tailwinds of life.

217
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,708
Catch the right breeze,
and it can take you

218
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,416
to worlds unknown.

219
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,833
News that the hero of
Kazakhstan had kidnapped

220
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,583
the fairy of Russia spread
across the world like wildfire.

221
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,041
[VICTOR]
However, the brooding hero

222
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,333
wasn't acting on a simple whim.

223
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,083
Yurio didn't think that he and
Otabek had any prior connection.

224
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,333
What he didn't remember
was that five years before,

225
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,875
they had trained together
at Yakov's summer camp.

226
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:37,958
[PLISETSKY]
Really?

227
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, yeah.

228
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,666
[PLISETSKY]
I don't remember that.

229
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,000
It was actually my first year
in the junior division.

230
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,708
But I wasn't skating at the same
level as the Russian juniors.

231
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,125
So I was placed
in the novice class,

232
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,333
which is where I met you.

233
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,041
Yuri Plisetsky.

234
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
It was your eyes
that I noticed first.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,958
The strong, piercing
eyes of a soldier.

236
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:02,291
Me, really? A soldier?

237
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,166
I had moved my home rink
from Moscow to St. Petersburg.

238
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,083
I was desperate to
make a name for myself.

239
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:13,291
I swore I would do whatever
I had to to make that happen.

240
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,458
After that camp,
I moved around to train,

241
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,458
from Russia to the US
and then to Canada.

242
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,375
I only managed to return to my
home rink in Almaty last year.

243
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,708
Now, more than ever,

244
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,125
I want to win the
championship for Kazakhstan.

00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,541
[PLISETSKY]
Otabek.

246
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,708
I don't get why you would
talk to me. We're rivals.

247
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,041
Since I met you at that camp,

248
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,375
I've always thought
we were alike.

249
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,250
That's all there is to it.

250
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:42,458
Not so complicated,
really. So, friends?

251
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,625
[VICTOR]
Nobody had ever asked Yurio

252
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,416
if he wanted to be friends
with them before.

253
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,791
[VICTOR]
Now, back to the main story,

254
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,583
where I'm shopping with Yuri.

255
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:56,208
Here, things had taken
a turn for the worse.

256
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,000
[YURI]
No luck. It's not here, either.

257
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,833
Okay, just calm down
and try to remember.

258
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,083
It's a bag of nuts.
Brown paper with green print.

259
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,000
Where did we last see it?

260
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,041
[YURI sighs] Sorry. I don't
know where else to look.

261
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,333
This was my best guess.

262
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,375
I'll go back to the shop
and get another bag!

263
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,833
[VICTOR]
Don't worry about it, Yuri.

264
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,625
I'm sure the shop is
probably closed by now.

265
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,500
Let's go. You're tired, right?

266
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,500
[gasps]

267
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,625
Why are you just
assuming that I'm tired?

268
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,333
Fine, then, I'm tired.

269
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,375

walking through the nearby

00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,958
Christmas market in silence,

271
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,541
looking around at
the stalls and people.

Your birthday's comin' up.

00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,208
It's on Christmas Day, isn't it?

00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,333
[VICTOR]
Mm.

275
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,916
I'll get you a gift
while we're here.

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,583
[VICTOR] Mm. In Russia, we don't
celebrate before the actual day.

277
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,250
And we don't really
celebrate Christmas,

278
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,500
not like other countries.

279
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,541
Oh, okay.

280
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,333
[VICTOR] Would you like
to try my hot wine?

281
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,583
[YURI]
No.

282
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,708
I don't like to drink
before a competition.

283
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh, right. I forgot.

284
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,250
[VICTOR] It's always
like this when Yuri's

285
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,875
searching for an answer.

286
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,166
He gets quiet and
his eyes sparkle.

287
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,791
He's looking for
something right now

288
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,458
and won't rest
until he finds it.

289
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,083
I don't have to say anything,
just watch over him.

290
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416

This is it! Let's go in here.

00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,166
Can I take a look at...

296
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,875
[YURI] I've always wanted
to have a lucky charm.

297
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,958
Yeah, that's what it is.

298
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,416
A lucky charm to help me
do well in the Final.

299
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,583
And a gift for Victor,
to thank him for all his help.

I-I wanted to get you something,

307
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,875
and this was the best
thing I could think of.

308
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,833
Anyway. I, uh--

309
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,666
I'll do my best
from tomorrow on.

310
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,458

[VICTOR]
Okay.

313
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
I'll tell you something

314
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,666
that you won't even
have to think about.

to a gold medal that I know.

And that's it.

Why do we all
have to eat together?

It is kinda weird, huh?

out together like this

before the competition.

340
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,541
It's a lot different
from last year.

341
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,458
I was always on my own then,
at the banquet, too.

342
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,875
I didn't even have the
courage to talk to Victor.

343
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,125
Are you seriously telling
me you don't remember?

344
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,333
Huh?

00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,000
At the banquet you got
wasted on champagne

346
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,833
and started dancing.
Everyone was watching.

347
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,166
Huh?

348
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,375
It was the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen.

349
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,166
I got dragged into a dance-off.
It was humiliating.

350
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,666
A dance-off? You're kidding.

351
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,916
Say you're kidding.

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,541
It's true. I danced with
a pole and got naked.

353
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,291
Well, mostly.

354
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,541
[screams]

355
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,416
[YURI]
Something happens when I drink.

356
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,083
I go off the rails,
just like my dad does,

357
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,541
and things can get crazy.

358
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,958
So I try not to have too much.

359
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,083
[VICTOR] The banquet is
a party held every season

360
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,916
after the competition is over.

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,333
It's a time for skaters
to relax and socialize

362
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,791
after a hard-fought match.

363
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,000
Last year,

364
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,375
Yuri suffered a crushing
defeat at the final.

365
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,500
It looked like his coach
had dragged him to the banquet.

366
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,958
At first, anyway.

367
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,750
Since he couldn't
bring himself to mingle,

368
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,875
he just kept drinking,
and drinking...

369
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,625
I still have videos
if you want to see.

00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,541
Me, too, but they're not
for the faint of heart.

372
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,166
Are you serious?
Yuri, that's so dirty!

373
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,708
[MINAKO, MARI] Yeah,
we're gonna have to see that.

374
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, no! Don't look,
I'm begging you!

375
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,000
Please! Leave me my dignity!

376
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,333
Nice moves, huh?

377
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,208
So, what's with the rings
you boys are wearing?

378
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,125
[PHICHIT, MINAKO, MARI]
Huh?

379
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,000
What rings?

380
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,583
Since when do you wear jewelry?

381
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,291
Um. I don't know what
you're talking about...?

382
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,000
And look, they match!

My good friend here just
got married! Woo-hoo!

No! Stop! Really!

390
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,083
It's a good luck charm--
and a thank-you--and, you know,

391
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,916
there are layers--yeah, layers!

392
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,041
[VICTOR]
Yes, you've got it wrong.

393
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,458
This is actually
an engagement ring.

394
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,458
We'll get married when
he wins the gold medal.

395
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
Right, Yuri?

396
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,125
Um, what did you just say?

Ah...

Right. Guys, well. I, uh--

403
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,500
You're kidding me, right?

404
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,041
I'll be the one winning gold
and getting married.

405
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,000
I hate to break it to you guys.

406

That's right.

407
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
JJ's obviously going to win.

Sorry we can't congratulate you.

Well. We should go.
Early day tomorrow.

You're all leaving?

[PLISETSKY] I don't get
what makes you so happy

419
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,708
about babysitting
that stupid pig.

420
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,625
Did you want to
compete against me?

421
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,416
So arrogant.

422

You may not realize it, Victor,

423
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,000
but not all skaters
look up to you.

424
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,541
Just give it up
already, old man.

425
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,958
The pig will fail,
and you'll see that the ring

426
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
you got from him is garbage.

427
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,583
I'm going to win this.

428
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,625

how incompetent he is.

if I'd stayed in Russia

as a competitor,
so much would be different.

434
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,416
Yurio wouldn't be this
motivated to fight.

435
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,375
And neither would I.

This place reminds me
of Hasetsu. You know?

Yuri, you may not realize it,

439

but many people have
learned something

about the "L words" from you.
