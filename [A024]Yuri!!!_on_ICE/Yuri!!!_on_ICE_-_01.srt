00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:19,958
[YURI] Over the years, he has
never ceased to surprise me.

00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,541
From the first time
I saw him skate,

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,500
till now, it's been one
surprise after another.

00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,875
[AUDIENCE cheering]

5
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,083
[MOROOKA]
Sure enough,

6
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,041
he's crushed the
free skating event, as well.

7
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,833
This marks the fifth consecutive
Grand Prix Final win

8
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,541
for Russian legend
Victor Nikiforov.

9
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,166
[MOROOKA]
Nikiforov is now 27 years old.

10
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,583
Some speculate that he
might retire this season,

11
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,125
but his masterful
performance here

12
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,041
may lay such rumors to rest.

13
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,125
Now let's talk
about Yuri Katsuki,

14
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,166
who was here competing in his
very first Grand Prix Final.

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,291
What are your thoughts, Honda?

16
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,625
[HONDA]
I hate to say it,

17
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,541
but he didn't perform
like his usual self today.

18
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,000
[CELESTINO]
Put that down!

19
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,833
Looking at the news
won't do you any good.

"Katsuki tumbles to last place.

21
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,333
Will this season be his
last one? Possibly."

[CELESTINO]

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,750
Huh?

25
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,875
[YURI]
My name is Yuri Katsuki.

26
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,583
At 23, I'm one of the
dime-a-dozen figure skaters

27
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,750
certified by the JSF.

28
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,166
I had high hopes,

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,833
but I came in last at
my first Grand Prix Final.

30
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,291
I'm still having a
hard time accepting that.

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,666
I moved to Detroit to
train at a top-notch facility

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,458
and worked hard to qualify.

33
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,416
But before the match,
the pressure got to me,

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,666
and I started binge-eating.

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,208
Then the family dog died.

36
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,833
I was a complete wreck.

37
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,750
So my big day
became a big failure.

38
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,166
Man. Talk about self-sabotage.

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,000
Huh? Hello?
Hey, Mom.

40
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,750
Were you sleeping? Sorry.

41
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,333
Yeah. I figured
you'd seen it on TV.

42
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,208
What? You had a viewing party?

43
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,750
You've gotta be kidding,
Mom! I'm gonna die!

55

They call him
the "Russian Punk."

56
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,375
Why does he look like he's
trying to decide whether

57
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,666
or not to punch me?

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,000
[PLISETSKY]
Hey.

59
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll be competing in the
senior division next year.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,583
Maybe it's time
for you to retire.

61
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,583
I don't think we need two
Yuris in the same bracket.

talented young skaters

Don't give up yet, kid,
you hear me?

You're too young to retire.

71
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,708
It's a little early for that.

72

I haven't even
made a decision yet.

could use a bit more finesse.

to talk to him--someday.

who cheered me on

just because I'm from Hasetsu!

to say this out loud,

but here's how the
last year's gone for me.

130
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,125
The figure skating competition
season generally starts

131
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,458
in the fall, but I lost big

132
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,916
in the comprehensive
Grand Prix Finals early on.

and lost again in the Nationals.

so the season's over for me!

I managed to graduate college,

00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,125
There you are, Minako!

177
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,291
Thank you for going
to get him at the station!

178
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,416
Yuri! Welcome home!

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,208
Yeah, thanks, Mom.

180
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,333
It's been a long time.

181
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
I should've come
to visit sooner, sorry.

182
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,083
None of that, now!

183
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,750
I only wish I could have
made it to your graduation!

184
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,208
Want a pork cutlet bowl?

185
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,541
You know, you look
like you've lost weight.

186
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,375
[HIROKO]
You're so sweet to an old lady!

187
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,958
What about you?

188
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,791
No matter how much you drink,
you don't seem to gain a pound!

189
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,625
As for you. What kind of gut
are you hiding underneath

190
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,208
that bulky coat of yours?

191
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,083
[YURI]
Ah!

192
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,583
All right, off with the clothes!

193
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,500
[shrieks]
No! Don't! Please stop!

194
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,541
Aaaah!

195
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,916
[YURI chuckles nervously]

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,333
Wow, you look just
like your mom, Yuri!

197
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,375
[YURI]
Dad.

198
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,333
This is no laughing
matter, Toshiya.

199
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,583
A figure skater has to
maintain a certain physique,

200
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,041
and that isn't it!

201
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,291
You've gained weight easily
ever since you were a boy.

202
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,833
But what can you do?

203
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,750
Now, how many pork cutlet bowls
should we put you down for?

204
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,208
Well, before I eat...

205
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,791
Of course, dear.
We understand.

206
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,916
Go pay your respects.

207
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,083
[YURI]
I'm sorry, boy.

208
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,666
I wish I could have
seen you one last time.

209
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,125
[door sliding open]

210
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,208
So you decided to
come home after all.

211
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,000
[YURI]
Mari. Hi.

212
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,458
[MARI]
Hmph.

213
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,125
You guys seem busy. I hope
I'm not getting in the way.

214
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,083
Nah, don't worry.
How long you staying, anyway?

215
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
You gonna help out
with the hot spring?

216
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,708
Well, I don't know.

217
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
You got your degree, even
though it took an extra year.

218
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,333
So what're you gonna do with it?

219
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,583
I mean, if you want to keep
skating I'll support you, but--

220
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,083
I guess. I kinda need
more time to think it over.

221
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,125
Sure. Okay.

222
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,166
Well, go soak in the hot spring.

223
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,958
You kinda look
like you could use it.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,166
[YURI] I was born and raised
here in Hasetsu, Kyushu.

225
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,333
A castle town by the sea.

226
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,041
The "castle" isn't so much
a castle as a façade

227
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,333
with a ninja house inside.

228
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,541
The town used to have a
number of hot spring inns,

229
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,916
but most have gone under.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,416
My family's Yu-topia
Akatsuki is the last one.

231
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,125
Ahh... This is exactly
what I needed.

232
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,791
[MOROOKA] Group Two has
now finished skating...

233
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,666
[MINAKO] Man, I really wanted
to go to the championships.

234
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,541
If only you'd qualified, Yuri,

235
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,166
you could've gotten me
the skaters' room numbers.

236
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,458
[YURI]
So that's it.

237
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,583
You support me in hopes
that I'll make it easier

238
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
for you to stalk hot skaters.

239
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,916
[MINAKO] Hey! That's only one
of the reasons I support you!

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,625
[MOROOKA]
He will be skating last.


241
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,166
Well, Honda, what do you think
we can expect from him tonight?


242
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
[HONDA] If anyone
can clench this fifth title...

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,333
There's a soccer match.
Sagan Tosu. Let's switch.

244
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,750
You can change the channel
when I'm done watching skating.

245
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,041
Sagan Tosu?

246
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,041
Better keep working
or you'll get in trouble.

247
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,833
Hey, you just got here,
and you're leaving already?

248
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,958
[YURI] Sorry. I wanted
to get some practice in.

249
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,958
[HIROKO]
All right, dear, take care.

250
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,500
[YURI]
Excuse me.

251
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,208
[YUKO]
Sorry, we're closed.

252
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,083
You can come back tomorrow.

253
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,125
[YURI] Hey, Yuko.
Long time no see, huh?

254
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,250
[YUKO]
That you, Yuri?

255
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,041
Well, quit standing
there like some stranger

256
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,291
and tell me how you've been!

257
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,458
Fine, I guess.

258
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,583
Well, I bet you
came to skate, huh?

259
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,500
Go right ahead.

260
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,083
[YURI]
Really? You don't mind?

261
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,875
[YUKO] Nah. I'm guessing
you don't want an audience?

262
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,666
I'll make sure
you're not interrupted.

263
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,916
Great, thanks a lot.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
[YUKO]
Hmm!

265
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,416
[YURI]
Yuko's two years older than me.

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,791
She was my rink mate.

267
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,375
She was a really great
skater when we were little.

268
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,000
I grew up idolizing her.

269
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,833
The Madonna of
Ice Castle Hasetsu.

270
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,791
She's still as pretty as ever.

271
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,208
Yay!

272
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,083
Wow! Great job!

273
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:20,708
[laughs]

274
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,916
[NISHIGORI grunts]

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,708
Move it you're in my way, fatso!

276
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,291
Stop!

277
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,958
Picking on the new kid doesn't
make you look tough, you know!

278
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,708
Fatso! Fatso!

279
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,666
Hey!

280
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,458
[YUKO]
Russia's Victor Nikiforov!


281
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,250
He won the gold
in the Junior Worlds

282
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,458
with the highest
score in history!

283
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,375
He's amazing!

284
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,166
Aaahh...!

285
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,958
[YUKO]
This is how Victor would do it!

286
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,458
According to this,
Victor has a poodle.

287
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,916
You see? Right there.

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,208
--[YUKO] Isn't he adorable?
--[YURI] What a cute dog!

290
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,333
Aw! Is this sweet
little ball of fluff yours?

291
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,583
Yeah, and I named him Victor.

292
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,416
[laughs] You really are Victor's
number one fan, aren't you?

293
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,250
I hope that you get to compete
against him someday.

294
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,291
I'd really like to see it.

295
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,125
[YURI]
Um...

296
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,916
There's something
I really want you to see.

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,375
I've been practicing this ever
since the competitions ended.

298
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,416
Will you watch?

299
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,750
[AUDIENCE cheering]

300
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,708
[MOROOKA] Last up:
Victor Nikiforov from Russia.

[MINAKO] All right, Victor!
Give 'em hell!

00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,000
Where's Yuri, anyway?

304
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,666
His darling Victor's up!

305
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,083
I don't think he's back yet.

306
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,291
Wait. That opening.

307
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:49,041
["Stay Close to Me" plays]

308
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,458
[MOROOKA]
He has an ambitious program,

309
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,500
with four quads planned.

310
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,916
Here comes his first.

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,791
Let's see if he lands it.

312
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,291
[MOROOKA] A quadruple Lutz!
Nice, very clean!

313
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,458
The next quad is his signature
move, a real crowd favorite.

314
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,708
Here we go!

315
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,000
A quadruple flip,
and he nails it!

316
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,583
[MOROOKA]
Flying sit spin.

317
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
[MOROOKA] The song he's
chosen is "Stay Close to Me."

318
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,416
I wonder how many women are
watching this now and drooling.

319
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,208
About a million? I mean,
he is one fine specimen.

320
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,625
[HIROKO] I think you've had
enough to drink, Minako.

321
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,875
[MOROOKA]
Flawless Quad Sal!

322
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
[MINAKO] I don't know
if this is the best music

323
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,291
for a worldly man
like him, though.

324
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,041
It would work better for
a dewy-eyed youngster.

325
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,125
Ya know?

326
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,125
[MOROOKA]
A triple Lutz.

327
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,583
[MOROOKA]
A triple flip!

328
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,875
[gasps]

329
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,875
[MOROOKA]
Now, the last quad is coming up.

330
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,333
A quadruple toe loop,
followed by a triple toe loop!

331
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,708
That's it! He did it.
He landed all his quads!

332
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,958
[MOROOKA] Now all that's
left is a combination spin.

00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,916

You're freaking amazing!

337
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,291
That was a
perfect copy of Victor!

338
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:35,333
[chuckles] Honestly,
I thought you'd be depressed.

00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,916
[YURI]
I was,

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,791
but it turns out being depressed
gets pretty old after a while.

341
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,458
I lost my love for skating,
and I wanted it back.

342
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,083
I thought if I copied Victor
like we did in the old days,

343
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
it would help.

344
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,208

00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,875
in the World Figure

347
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,833
Victor Nikiforov has made
history here tonight!

348
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,333
[FEMALE INTERVIEWER A] What
do you think the next season

349
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,458
will hold for you?

350
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,583
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

351
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,625
[YURI]
The thing is--

352
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,500
[TRIPLETS]
Stare.

353
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,916
My girls, Axel, Lutz, and Loop.

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They're a lot bigger than the
last time you saw them,

355
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:08,708
aren't they?

356
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,125
[YURI]
Uh, Yeah...

357
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,958
Wow, you really
did get fat, Yuri!

358
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,041
So you're retiring?

359
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,375
You've never had a girlfriend?

360
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,791
Hey! Ignore them!
The girls are groupies, sorry!

361
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,875
Ha! I'm telling ya, those three
are some of your biggest fans.

362
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,625
Hey!

363
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,500
Nishigori!

364
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,208
[TRIPLETS]
Daddy!

365
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:23,916
You're fatter than me!

366
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,250
Stop, This isn't funny!

367
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,583
[NISHIGORI]
Come by to practice any time.

368
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,125
The Nishigori family's always
got your back, you know that

369
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,458
[LOOP]
You can do it, Yuri!

370
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,166
[AXEL]
Work hard!

371
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
[LUTZ]
Lose weight!

372
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,583
[YURI]
A lot happened while I was away.

373
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,791
For the most part, I ignored it.

374
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,083
I focused on skating
and nothing else.

375
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,541
[grunts]

376
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,750
[YURI]
I wish I knew what to do now.

377
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,458
I want to keep skating.

378
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,833
But can I do it on my own?

379
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,333
[MOROOKA]
Here in St. Petersburg, Russia,

380
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,208
rising star Yuri
Plisetsky is gearing up

381
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,208
in earnest to join
the senior competition.

382
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,958
Whoa! Did you see that jump?

383
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,500
No, make that two jumps.

384
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,625
[MOROOKA] ...the 15-year-old
phenom may soon join the ranks

385
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,833
of Victor Nikiforov as one of

386
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,833
the world's preeminent
male figure skaters.

387
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,333
Maybe it's time
for you to retire.

388
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,708
Oh...

389
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
[YURI]
I'm going to do it.

390
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,875
I'm not sure how,
but I'm going to skate

391
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,375
on the same ice as
Victor again someday.

392
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,458
[phone dings]

393
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,833
[YURI]
Huh? Nishigori?

394
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,916
What?!!

395
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,958
[NISHIGORI]
Look, Yuri. I'm really sorry.

396
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,958
The girls uploaded it,
and it's gone viral.

397
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,875
You know you're not supposed to
use my account without asking!

398
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,791
But Mommy, it'll make
the skater otaku so happy!

399
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,666
[YUKO]
Just delete it, okay?

400
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,041
Goodnight.

401
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,208
You thought you could become
an internet sensation

402
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,666
without telling me?

403
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,250
Katsuki?! Are you kidding me
with this video, or what?

404
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
[PHICHIT laughs]
Yuri!

405
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,666
What a clown.
Why doesn't he retire already?

406
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,833
[WEATHER LADY A] A sudden
cold front blew into Kyushu,

407
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,333
turning what should have been
beautiful cherry blossom viewing

408
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,916
weather into a
snowy tundra overnight.

409
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
[HIROKO] You can't just
hole up in your room forever.

410
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,333
Come out and
help shovel the snow!

411
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,041
[YURI]
Snow?

412
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,541
Whoa! She wasn't kidding!
This late in the year?

413
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,208
No weather alert?

414
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,250
Right. I turned it off,
so I wouldn't get any calls.

415
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:37,000
[dog barking]

416
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,416
Huh? Victor?

417
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,416
Whoa! Aah!

418
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Ahh...

419
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,833
You're too big!
You couldn't be Victor.

420
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,875
Huh?

421
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,750
Hold on...

422
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,916
This dog looks exactly like--No.

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,916
There's no way.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,208
[TOSHIO]
Morning!

425
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,208
Looks just like our Victor, eh?

426
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,458
His owner's a new guest,

427
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,125
some good-looking young
fellow with an accent.

428
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,125
He's in the spring right now.

429
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,625
You okay?

430
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,708
Hey! Where are you going?

431
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,250
[STRANGER sighs]

432
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,083
Vi... Victor...

433
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,041
[VICTOR]
Hmm...

434
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,083
Why are you here?

435
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,916
Hello, Yuri. Starting today,
I'm going to be your new coach.

436
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,250
You're going to get
to the Grand Prix Final.

437
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,333
And you're going to win.

438
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:40,333
Huh? Whaaaat?!!

439
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,791
[YURI]
Not once over the years

440
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,250
has he ever ceased
to surprise me.

441
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,625
[PLISETSKY] Hey, Victor!
We're going back to Russia!

442
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,833
[VICTOR]
Hasetsu's great. I mean it!

443
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,333
You really should visit.

444
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,375
[TRIPLETS]
Rub Yuri's belly!

445
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,791
[VICTOR] Seriously,
nice weather...

446
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,583
[YURI]
No, no, no, no, no!

447
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,000
[YURI, PLISETSKY]
Next time, Second Skate.

448
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,958
"Two Yuris? Drama at Yu-topia."
