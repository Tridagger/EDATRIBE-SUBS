21

to determine the
world's best figure skaters.

22
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,791
The race to the podium
has officially begun.

23
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,791
At Skate America, Leo de la
Iglesia won his first gold


24
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,041

Guang-Hong Ji placed third.


25

in the Cup of China.

took home the gold.


29
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,958
Fifteen-year-old
Yuri Plisetsky took silver


30
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,416
with an impressive performance.


31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,000
And now tomorrow, we move on to
the third event in the series,

35
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,791
for his second consecutive
finals qualification.

36
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,250
[YURI] I struggled to
find a theme for this...

37
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,041
[NAOHIKO] When asked for
the theme of his program,

38
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,750
he declared it to be "love."

39
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,666
[YURI] And I'll prove it
at the Grand Prix Final.

40
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,416
[NAOHIKO] Will the power
of love keep his hopes alive?

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,083
Well, the power of love
is really powerful--

42
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm hungry and this is boring.
Can we go get hot pot now?

00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm kinda in the middle
of an interview, here.

A quad toe loop.

[MOROOKA]
Ah, he fell!

00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,125

But He got enough rotations in.

[YURI]
You did it, Phichit.

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,750
You made the music your own.

An impressive performance

186
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,458
by Phichit Chulanont

[MOROOKA] His short
program score is 86.75.

That's a personal best for him
by a considerable margin.

who distinguished himself
at Skate America,

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,041
finishing third in the
first event of the series.

00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,000
Guang-Hong Ji of China, age 17,
competing on his home turf.

194

He is skating to

Phichit was great.

["Le Parfum des Fleurs" plays]

198
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,291
[MOROOKA] His first planned
jump is a quadruple toe loop,

199
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,750
which he added to his
roster this year.

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,166
All right! He landed
his quadruple toe loop!

[YURI]
Watching Phichit perform

202
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,541
helped me realize some things.

203
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,166
The people who want
to see Victor skate

204
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,208
aren't going to be
satisfied with my skating.

Hmm?

00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,000
[YURI] If they're all
going to hate me as the man

who took Victor from
the world of skating, fine.

I can see from here.

220
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,291
[MOROOKA]
The last skater in Group One

221
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,041
is Yuri Katsuki from Japan.

At this point you can do
it just by being yourself.

You've figured that out
by now, haven't you?

Right. Yuri Katsuki from Japan

232
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,708
is skating his first program
of the Grand Prix series.

233
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,500
The music is "On Love: Eros."

234

He has said that the theme

235
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,875
for his programs
this year is "love."

00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,375
[MALE ANNOUNCER] Well, he's
certainly a different skater

237
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,041
than we've seen in
previous seasons.

238
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,041
Maybe living with his
coach, Victor Nikiforov,

239
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,708
has helped to bolster
his confidence,

240
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,875
something he's
always struggled with.

241
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,166

He sure seems to be delivering

242
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,291
on the "eros" part
of the program.

243
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,291

They can laugh all they want.

244
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,208
They can doubt and
whisper behind their hands.

245
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,333
But I'm going to
show them the new me,

246
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,791

won't be laughing anymore.

on a place in the final,

jumps for the second half

253
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,750
of the program to up the
difficulty and boost the score.

254

but not an easy one.

Here we go.

256
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,708
His first planned jump
is a triple axel.

00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,125

spread eagle into a triple axel!

to complete a short program

and the applause in
the rink is deafening?

286

He used last season's
disappointment

287
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,625
as a springboard for an
outstand transformation.

a better student.

00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,500
"Please forgive me, Georgi!
I was wrong!"

347
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,541
"Not a chance in hell,
you traitor!"

348
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,500
"No? Oh!"

349
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,000
[MALE ANNOUNCER] A triple
Lutz, triple loop combination.

350
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,458
Am I the only one who can

351
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,416
almost hear her
screams of terror?

352
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,083
<i>Da</i> . He's way too into
this performance.

353
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,708
[MOROOKA]
An intense step sequence.

354
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,750
He executed it well, though.

355
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,833
[GEORGI] She will get
the punishment she deserves.

356
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,583
Fool, daring to
cross an evil witch!

357
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,958
I will curse her.

358
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,208
She will sleep for all eternity.

359
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,166
[AUDIENCE cheering]

360
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,458
[YAKOV]
Well done.

361
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,916
Finally, a performance
worthy of you.

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,750
[MOROOKA] Georgi Popovich's
short program score is 98.17.


363
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,416
He is currently in second place.


364
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,541
[MIRA]
I forgot.

365
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,041
His ex must be there.

366
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,083
She's competing in
the Cup of China, too.

367
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,750
[PLISETSKY]
Really?

368
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,291
That's got to suck.

369
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,875
[MOROOKA] Leo de la Iglesia,
age 19, from the United States.

370
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,041
[PHICHIT]
This should be good.

371
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,208
He was polished even
at the first event.

372
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,333
["Still Alive" plays]

373
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,125
[MOROOKA] The music is
"Still Alive" and the program

374
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,916
was choreographed
by the skater himself.

375
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,875
[LEO] This is one
of my favorite songs.

376
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,625
I just have to skate
the way the music feels.

377
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,208
It's not complicated.

378
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,458
[ANNOUNCER]
A triple axel.

379
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,041
[LEO] If I do it right,
the audience will fall in love

380
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,125
with the song, too.

381
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,333
Wow. Leo's just
so cool, you know?

382
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,625
It looks like he's
switched things up

383
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,958
a little bit
since Skate America.

384
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,291
[MOROOKA]
After winning Skate America,

385
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,083
he's the closest among
those competing here

386
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,416
to qualifying for
the Grand Prix Final.

387
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,416
There are no quads
in his program,

388
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,958
but he's earned high marks for

389
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,500
the five performance components,
especially interpretation.

390
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,708
[MALE ANNOUNCER] A triple
flip, triple loop combination.

391
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,583
[MOROOKA]
If he keeps this up,

392
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,583
he'll be looking
at a high score.

393
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,416
[sighs]

394
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,416
[LEO] I don't know where
I would be without music.

395
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,041
It's what drives me
and gives me the courage

396
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,458
to keep fighting
when I'm ready to give up.

397
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,208
It's everything to me.

398
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,791
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A triple Lutz.

399
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,583
[MOROOKA] He nailed that
last jump with a flourish.

400
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,791
He choreographed this perfectly.

401
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,291
It really maximizes
his strengths.

402
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,416
[MOROOKA]
A solid short program

403
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,291
from Leo de la Iglesia
of the United States.

404
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,083
You can tell the
crowd thinks so, too.

405
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,791
[MOROOKA]
This was a good follow-up

406
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,041
to his performance
at Skate America.


407
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,791
The short program score
for Leo de la Iglesia is 87.98.


408
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,958
That means he's currently...


409
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,083
That was great.

410
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,166
Aw. He barely beat
me by a full point.

411
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,541
I was so close!

412
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,541
[MOROOKA] All right,
we're down to our final skater.

413
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,708
Christophe Giacometti,
age 25, of Switzerland.

414
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,041
He took silver at last
year's Grand Prix Finals,

415
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,625
so all eyes are on him.

416
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,916
This guy practically
oozes sex appeal.

417
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
[moans]

418
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,000
[CHRISTOPHE]
I thought it was going to be

419
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,500
a boring season without
Victor to compete against.

420
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,041
But Yuri could turn out
to be a worthy opponent.

421
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,458
Too bad for him--eros
is my specialty.

422
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,875
["Intoxicated" playing]

423
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:01,416
[MOROOKA] The music for
his program is "Intoxicated."

424
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,875
[MOROOKA]
Into his first jump he's planned

425
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,333
a quadruple Lutz
right off the bat.

426
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,166
[MOROOKA]
Oops. Turned into a triple.

427
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,500
[CHRISTOPHE]
It's all right.

428
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,583
I want to take it slow,

429
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,333
so I can peak at
the Grand Prix Final.

430
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,583
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A combination spin.

431
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,208
He's got beautiful
position and speed.

432
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,000
[VICTOR]
Chris said he was having

433
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,833
a hard time getting motivated.

434
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,000
He's a solid skater, though, and
never goes into a major slump.

435
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,666
He doesn't like to
peak at the first event,

436
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,166
so he starts slowly.

437
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,125
But, I will say, he doesn't seem
to be holding anything back

438
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,916
when it comes to sex appeal.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
[CHRISTOPHE] Yuri, your innocent
sexuality is powerful.

440
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,666
But if there's one
person in the world

441
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,833
who can rival that, it's me.

442
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A triple axel.

443
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,583
[CHRISTOPHE]
By the time I'm done today,

444
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:15,291
you'll realize how much
you still have left to learn.

445
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,000
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
A triple flip followed by

446
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,166
a triple toe loop.

447
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,541

The audience is fired up,

448
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,083
cheering and clapping
as he begins his last spin!

449
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,833
[CHRISTOPHE]
I think I'm going to come.

450
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,333
[MOROOKA] Christophe
Giacometti has delivered

451
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,166
a riveting short program.

452
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,375
He had the audience
on the edge of their seats!

Awww... I can't breathe.

00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,875
He's amazing.

455
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,500
A weapon of mass destruction.

456
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,833
Well, I guess Chris wins
in the eros department today.

457
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,166
Um, is it just me, or does
the ice look soaking wet?

458
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,750
[MOROOKA]
The short program score


459
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,708
for Christophe
Giacometti is 85.60.


460
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,416
That puts him in fifth place.


461
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,875
Huh? So does that mean I'm--

462
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,166
I can do it! I think
I've still got a chance.

463
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,166
I'm confident
in my free program.

464
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,000
Plus, I'm good at
coming from behind.

465
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,666
I'm going to do
my best to pass you

466
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,625
in the free program.

00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,833
Look out!

This competition
will be my ticket

469
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,750
to the Grand Prix Final.

470
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,500
For the short program,
second is acceptable.

471
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
I won't lose to
a third-rate coach.

472
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,125
[MOROOKA] At the end
of the short program here

That was lovely.

But our boy isn't used
to being in first place.

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,375
I hope he'll be okay.

479
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,666
I-I'll win with my coach Victor.
