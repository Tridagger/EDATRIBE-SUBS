After the Final, let's end this.

00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,958
What?

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,750
You've already done
more than enough for me,

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,708
more than I could've dreamed of.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,166
My final season was
my best one yet.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,666
That's because of you.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,208
Thank you for
everything, so much.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,375
Thank you for being my coach.

[VICTOR]
Damn it.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,291
That's disappointing.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,750
I didn't expect this
from you of all people.

14
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,625
Something so selfish.

15
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:51,541
[YURI] Selfish or not,
it's my decision. I'm retiring.

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,291
Yes, Yuri? What are
you looking at?

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,041
[YURI] Um, I'm just
surprised to see you cry.

18
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,750
I'm mad, okay? What should I do?

19
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,916
You're the one who said

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,125
it was only until
the Grand Prix Final!

21
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,791
[VICTOR] I thought you'd
eventually decide

22
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,125
you wanted my help
for longer than that.

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,125
It's okay.

24
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,416
You don't need
to worry about me.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,666
This way you can
make your comeback--

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,333
Stop! I don't want to hear it!

27
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,125
How can you tell me
to return to the ice

28
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,500
when you're retiring?

29
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,875
[YURI]
We decided that we would each

30
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,083
make our own decision after
the free skate was over.

[NAOHIKO] Welcome to the Grand
Prix of Figure Skating Final.

33
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,458
Tonight, we'll
have our champion.

34
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,708
In first is Russia's
Yuri Plisetsky,

35
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,125
with the highest ever
short program score.

36
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,250
Otabek Altin,
hero of Kazakhstan,

37
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,833
is ranked second in his
first Grand Prix Final.

38

Christophe Giacometti
of Switzerland

39
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,583
is in third after a very
distinct performance.

40

Yuri Katsuki hopes
to turn fourth place

41
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,750
into a spot on the podium.

42
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,708
Phichit Chulanont,
the first Thai skater

43
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,000
to qualify for the
Final, is in fifth.

44
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,166
And, shockingly,
Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,833
enters the free skate in sixth.

46
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,291
Will he make a comeback?

47
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,166

the Grand Prix Final

Japan's Yuri Katsuki has
not practiced publicly

53
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,291
since the day after
the short program.

54
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,333
His supporters have been
concerned by his sudden

55
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,916
and unexplained disappearance.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,333
But he did return to the ice for
this morning's public practice.

It's been a while.
Good to see you again.

We hope Yuri's supporters will
cheer loudly for him today.

I'm sure they will.

with us. <i>Bon Chance</i> .

I have to say, neither Yuri
Katsuki nor his coach Victor

64
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,875
seem to have the energy we've
come to expect from them.

full of mistakes, too.

out of it, but overall,

it during practice.

going to retire?

342
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,291
Well, that is
entirely up to him.

343
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,416
He said he was going to make
his decision after the Final.

Now is the time to take off.

347
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,000
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A triple axel.

348
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,125
[OTABEK]
Fulfill your dream.

349
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,791
Only you can make it a reality.

350
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,916
Live your life as it
was meant to be lived.

351

[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple Salchow.

357

[MOROOKA]
That was his last quad.

358
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
He landed them all!

359
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,416
[ANNOUNCER 8A] Triple flip,
single loop, triple Salchow.

360
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,750
Amazing.

361
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,875
Talent and originality
aren't only about

362
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,208
what you're born with.

363
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,166
Some things you get by fighting.

364
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,541
At 19, he's about to prove that.

365
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,041
[OTABEK]
Work to the fullest.

366
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,833

Discover all you can.

367
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,041
Follow your own path until
it ends, and then keep going.

368

Now is the beginning.

by a sliver and is
currently in third!

380
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,291
Katsuki remains in first place.

381
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,916
The final skater to take the ice

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,791
is 15-year-old Yuri
Plisetsky of Russia.

383
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,416

Yuri, <i>davai</i> !

"Allegro Appassionato
in B Minor."

391
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,000
Young as he is, Yuri Plisetsky
set a new world record

392
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,458
with his short program.

393
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,291
If he wins the Grand Prix
Final in his senior debut,

394
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,125
it will make men's
singles history.

395
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,291
First up is a quad.

396
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,666
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple Salchow.

397
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,125

He nailed it!

398
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,250
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A spiral into...

399
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,083
...a triple axel.

400
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,458
[MOROOKA]
Another success!

401
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,000
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
That was a difficult entry,

402
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,666
he used a raised arm
during the jump,

403
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,291
earning higher marks
for greater difficulty.

404
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,000
[PLISETSKY]
Yuri Katsuki.

405
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,166
He screws up his jumps, but his
step sequence is impressive.

406
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,333
I want to see him skate
with no mistakes.

407
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,833
What kind of guy is he?

408
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,708
He's crying? What a loser.

409
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,791
We don't need two Yuris
in the same bracket.

410
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,916
Time for you to retire.

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,916
Loser!

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,250
[PLISETSKY] What, you're going
to retire once you win gold?

413
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,583
You don't care anymore
now that you've

414
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,125
beat Victor's high
score? That's bull!

415
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,500
Don't disappoint me!

Hang in there, Yurio.

419
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,291
Here come the second-half jumps.

420
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,291
[PLISETSKY]
I'm going to win!

421
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,333
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
A quadruple toe loop.

422
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,166

424
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,500

425
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,875
into a beautiful
spiral position.

00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,625

you've become so strong.

a prima ballerina.

something new and beautiful

Both arms raised again.

Well, Yuri Katsuki,

435
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,500

00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,833
You set a new record, but I'm
going to beat it someday.

this point in the program?

00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,625
higher than Yuri Katsuki's.

a magnificent result.

Well, it's not
a gold medal, but...

That's nice, but I'm not
going to kiss your medal

Aw, I was really looking forward
to kissing that gold medal!

00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,625
How can I ever recover
from my failure as a coach?

461
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,916
You wouldn't have any
suggestions, would you, Yuri?

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,875
Something that might excite me?
