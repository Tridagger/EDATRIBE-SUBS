1
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,567
It's been a while, Rhantolk.

2
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:11,866
I'm glad you're all right.

3
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,795
Thanks, the feeling is mutual.

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:15,123
I have to ask, though.

5
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,207
What's with your hair?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,843
Uh, well...

7
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,046
And you. Who are you?

8
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,415
The name's Willem Kmetsch, the
new fairy warehouse caretaker.

9
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,827
It's nice to meet you.

10
00:00:25,394 --> 00:00:27,394
I see that you're a disfeatured, too.

11
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:29,207
You aren't, by chance, a troll, are you?

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,025
You mean Nygglatho has a husband?!

13
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,192
No, she does not!

14
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:33,165
I'm human.

15
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:34,076
Huh?

16
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,822
An emnetwiht?

17
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,824
If that's a joke, it isn't funny.

18
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:39,373
Well, never mind me.

19
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,536
There's something I wanna know about you.

20
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,661
Stop it! That tickles so bad!

21
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:24,576
I knew it. She's showing
symptoms of venenum poisoning.

22
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,980
Just try to suck it up.

23
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,248
What do you think you're doing to her?

24
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:31,707
Relax, it'll be fine.

25
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,489
How is that "fine"?

26
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:36,723
Ah! My gosh--! Please!

27
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,431
I can't handle this anymore.

28
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,287
Stop! You unhand Nopht immediately, or else!

29
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,951
Ah!

30
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,332
Ah!

31
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,072
I sense dirty thoughts.

32
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,498
Feel better now?

33
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,957
My body feels so light it's almost creepy.

34
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:16,159
I happen to find it unsettling to have
my fatigue disappear so suddenly like that.

35
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,803
I said you'd be fine. But how fine was she?!

36
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,887
How fine, what?

37
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,532
Let me guess, you're finding it hard to trust me, right?

38
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,847
Of course.

39
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,356
You are an emnetwiht.

40
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:33,821
Others might be able to have faith in one of
the sinners who destroyed the world, but I cannot.

41
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,707
Well, I've been surrounded by
those "others" for a while, now.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,498
I must be a very lucky man.

43
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,165
I find your nonchalance suspicious, as well.

44
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,942
Masking your evil intentions and
tricking people must be a habit for you.

45
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:49,665
Yes, I'm grateful you helped Chtholly survive
a battle in which she was supposed to die.

46
00:03:49,874 --> 00:03:53,040
However, your being an emnetwiht raises a flag.

47
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,543
We have no guarantee you are not dangerous.

48
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,051
Need I remind you that it was
your people who were responsible

49
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:01,490
for spreading the seventeen beasts across the world?

50
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:02,250
Hm?

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,112
A few days after the beasts appeared,
two islands vanished from the map.

52
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,846
By the following week, five countries,
four islands, and two oceans were gone.

53
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,933
The week after that, the world map had lost all meaning.

54
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:19,416
And then, before long, all humanity was wiped out.

55
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:25,541
How did the beasts increase so rapidly in number?

56
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:30,515
I don't know for sure, but I've heard they
were originally some kind of biological weapon.

57
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,568
Biological weapon?

58
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:36,878
Meaning, they must have used some organism as a base.

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
What creature, exactly, did the
humans use to construct the beasts?

60
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,780
Dunno.

61
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:44,833
Biological weapons.

62
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,364
That's why they were made.

63
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,683
Their only purpose was to fight.

64
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,482
Like us. We just fight on the other side.

65
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,601
You don't have to know everything about them.

66
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,127
They're archenemies who make you suffer, that's all.

67
00:04:58,522 --> 00:04:59,426
Isn't that right?

68
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:02,870
I suppose so, but I also wish to learn the whole truth.

69
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:07,940
For what it's worth, I don't mind people
like you, but I gotta walk away with her so, bye.

70
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm sorry about that.

71
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,165
She's usually such a nice girl.

72
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,566
I get her point.

73
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,387
I'm gonna check on things out there.

74
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,207
Stay on the ship for me, okay?

75
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:23,915
What? But, I...

76
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,665
Didn't I say not to push yourself?

77
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,329
Please just stay put.

78
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,873
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

79
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,748
I'll be keeping an eye on him for you.

80
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,695
Why would you keep an eye on me?

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,260
Obviously, because you had dirty thoughts about Rhan.

82
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:36,545
Oh, don't start!

83
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,170
Rude.

84
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:40,879
Always treating me like a kid.

85
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,739
Who cares if Rhan has a more mature aura.

86
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,507
All right! Last one!

87
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,823
Which way will it go?

88
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:47,915
Now, which one is it?

89
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:54,807
Gotcha!

90
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:56,873
Oh, come on! Not again!

91
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,123
Ribbit all to hell!

92
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,707
Quit croakin'. What are you, a baby?

93
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,082
A tadpole? You ain't got legs down there?

94
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,684
Get out of the doorway.

95
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,623
Oh, right, sorry about that.

96
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,559
If it isn't Madam Secretary.

97
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,207
What brings you in here, sweetheart?

98
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,790
Wanna join us for a drink?

99
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,832
Who knew she'd just be a disfeatured kid?

100
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,499
Kid or not, she's an esteemed secretary.

101
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:17,790
She sure is.

102
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,373
She helps out our honorable technical officer, in...

103
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:21,329
...more ways than one.

104
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,265
Hey, would you help us out in more ways than one, too?

105
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:26,498
Just ribbing!

106
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,884
You most likely do not need to
worry much about Nopht and Rantolk.

107
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:35,382
Neither of them have ever been
the kind to seriously hate someone.

108
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,313
Yeah. I get it.

109
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:38,760
Thank you, though.

110
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,847
You've always got my back.

111
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,852
I really do appreciate it.

112
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,463
I do so because you might break otherwise.

113
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,829
Do I really seem that fragile?

114
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,369
Well, thanks anyway.

115
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,105
And keep looking out for Chtholly, too, would you?

116
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,872
Mm.

117
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,123
You moron!

118
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,071
Do you even know what you've done?!

119
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:09,915
I know that I'm a first-grade technical officer.

120
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:13,002
Not to mention also being the
highest-ranking officer here.

121
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,011
I don't care!

122
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,873
Who died and made you the boss?!

123
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,999
Well, look who's as loud as ever.

124
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,099
Hm?

125
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,636
Willem!

126
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,969
Oh, good.

127
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:24,044
Do you know this man, Second-Grade Officer?

128
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,062
Yes.

129
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,683
Okay?

130
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,253
This idiot sent an additional
excavations squad underground.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,620
We have to grab as many relics
as possible before we leave.

132
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,165
I don't believe you realize how crucial this operation is.

133
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:44,102
Sending too many men underground
at once is considered a bad idea.

134
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,428
Huh. That's probably just a silly myth.

135
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,163
It's real! From what I've been told,

136
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:52,628
no group of more than seven
salvagers has ever returned alive!

137
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,707
There's a reason why we work in small groups.

138
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,797
You must respect the surface!

139
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:59,748
They've already left, so no point in complaining now.

140
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,165
All we can do here is prepare for the worst.

141
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,838
Isn't that right, sir wise First-Grade Technical Officer?

142
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:08,804
Yes, you're right that you're right.

143
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:11,415
You see how bighearted a first-grade technical officer

144
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,090
I am? Take care of those things for me.

145
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,047
I will. Thank you, sir.

146
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,557
I wasn't expecting you of all people to show up.

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,135
Well, I wasn't expecting to see you here. Huh, Grick?

148
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:32,224
Huh? Wow, another cutie pie.

149
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,957
Met Nopht and Rhantolk, yet?

150
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,289
You could say that.

151
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,400
You didn't lie, these fairies really are nice girls.

152
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,669
I'm kinda still in shock.

153
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,262
I won't walk one down the aisle.

154
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,034
Back up, you weirdo.

155
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:48,967
Whatever. So, is the plan to load
the entire haul onto the <i>Plantajinesta</i> ?

156
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:52,540
Yep, including everything on the <i>Saxifraga</i> .

157
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:53,593
Why?

158
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,108
I'm looking for something.

159
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:58,165
Adviser, we need your help here, please.

160
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,707
'Kay! I'll see ya later.

161
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,228
You, too, Missy.

162
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:34,936
Meow.

163
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,730
Done!

164
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,116
Ribbit?

165
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,415
Finished.

166
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,246
I'm all done on my end, boss.

167
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:03,218
Thank you!

168
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,367
Well, I did tell her not to push herself.

169
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:12,963
My, if it isn't the technical officer.

170
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,789
What brings you all the way down here?

171
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:16,885
What, indeed?

172
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:19,269
Shouldn't you be with your esteemed secretary?

173
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,682
My esteemed secretary is busy.

174
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:25,498
Hey, where did you store the dug weapon that you found?

175
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:26,707
No idea.

176
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,981
We followed our orders, which
were simply to carry it back here.

177
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:32,707
A lot of men were lost in the attack, you know.

178
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,647
There's just no way we can keep track of everything.

179
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,913
'Course not.

180
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,782
So, I'm looking for a needle in a haystack?

181
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,248
Earthquake?

182
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:49,560
Careful, boys!

183
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,922
It's a big one today.

184
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,966
There have been a lot of tremors lately.

185
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,120
Lil...

186
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,611
Lillia...

187
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:24,873
Uh.

188
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:53,332
Who are you?

189
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:55,563
What do you want from me?

190
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,024
Lillia... Asplee...

191
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:08,428
I'm the brave who is going to kill you and save the world!

192
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,457
That sounds like it must be a pain.

193
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,498
You have no idea!

194
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,697
And why would you want to save the world?

195
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,274
I'm doing this for one reason.

196
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:26,415
It's for my love.

197
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,994
Time to say goodbye.

198
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,106
Rest in peace!

199
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,486
My name is Chtholly.

200
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,505
I guess I'm still fine.

201
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,207
And here you are.

202
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,297
I can't remember the last time I had soup this delicious.

203
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,960
Seconds please, oh, dear Madam Secretary!

204
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,772
Sure! Comin' right up!

205
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:09,373
This is yummy!

206
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,832
I mean, wow!

207
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,165
The kick of the pepper's a nice touch,

208
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:16,064
and the richness of the texture is next to perfect.

209
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,498
Impressive.

210
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,889
How did Chtholly become such a good cook?

211
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,762
It's the power of love.

212
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,907
Hey, you seem awful mad.

213
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:30,623
What are ya, scared someone's gonna
take your Chtholly away from you?

214
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,165
Oh. Hi there, Officer Casanova.

215
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,348
Better make that secretary of yours happy, you got it?

216
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,565
That girl is gonna make a perfect wife.

217
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,241
But if you go and break her heart,

218
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,287
don't make me spell it meowt.

219
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:47,227
Screw them!

220
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,742
Perfect wife, my foot!

221
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,015
Make her happy, my ass!

222
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,915
They don't have to tell me, because I already know.

223
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,564
I already know what?

224
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,862
Don't start cryin' if you trip.

225
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,296
But since you're reading, what's that part say?

226
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,655
"Carried the corpse of a god to the city," I believe.

227
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:17,832
The text is blurry after that, so I cannot read it.

228
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:20,748
Sure hope that god has mercy on their souls.

229
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,892
I love it. I just love it.

230
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:27,957
Thank mew!

231
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,471
You're very welcome.

232
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,142
Who's up next?

233
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,254
Hm?

234
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,775
Nice work. You're really good at that, too, Chtholly.

235
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,510
Thanks! I've been working on a bunch of my skills.

236
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:44,290
Chtholly, may I ask you something?

237
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:45,465
Of course.

238
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,630
Why'd you come to the surface?

239
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,723
Was it perhaps for that Willem person?

240
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,456
And if so, is that because he saved your life?

241
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,540
I dunno.

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,441
He's rather calm for someone who's walking a tight rope.

243
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:01,009
He's certainly awkward, and he over thinks everything.

244
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:03,082
The point is, I guess I just...

245
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,748
She just wants to be with him.

246
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,204
Ren, c'mon!

247
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,768
Damn him. Damn that man!

248
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,216
She's way too good for that stupid jerk!

249
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,207
Don't mind them. I'm rootin' for you two!

250
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,790
Oh, really? So that's how it is, then?

251
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:17,756
Don't you start with me, too!

252
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,207
Oh, my!

253
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,938
Hm?

254
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,325
Did you sort all of this out yourself?

255
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,203
What are you two doing here?

256
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:33,684
We've decided to come help.

257
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,441
Looking for that dug weapon, right?

258
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:36,443
Really?

259
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,255
What brought this kindness on?

260
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:40,581
We've been hearin' a bunch of stuff about you.

261
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,840
Like that you're taking good care of the little ones.

262
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,593
Oh, no.

263
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,373
You haven't been told anything too weird, have you?

264
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,862
Hm... uh... You mean like how you
and Chtholly are close to couple-hood?

265
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,639
Or like how Ithea thinks you're into young girls?

266
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,876
Never mind! I got it.

267
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:02,101
Don't think we're doing this for you. It's for Chtholly.

268
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,496
Well, that's nice.

269
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,129
And thanks, but I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

270
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,847
This is my job.

271
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,506
I kinda want to find it myself.

272
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,515
Oh, right.

273
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,353
Bring me your swords, girls.

274
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,832
I'll tune them while I'm at it.

275
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,146
What the heck?

276
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:30,562
What is this? It wasn't on the list.

277
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,082
Hm?

278
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:57,343
Hey, there you are.

279
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,457
Oh, Chtholly.

280
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:00,373
What's up?

281
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,917
I'm giving out lunch boxes to those
who can't make it to the mess hall.

282
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,527
I brought this one for you.

283
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:10,207
Thank you, but the secretary thing is just an excuse.

284
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,248
You didn't have to.

285
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:13,207
If I just sat around doing nothing,

286
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:17,445
then it would appear that you really had brought
along your lover instead of someone with a purpose.

287
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,207
So what? Who cares though?

288
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,263
I happen to care, thank you.

289
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,944
Is that so?

290
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,623
Is that one Nopht's sword?

291
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:29,290
Yep, and I found the other one, too.

292
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:30,517
The "other one"?

293
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:36,893
That's Lapidemsibilus.

294
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:40,897
I'll have to take a closer
look at it once we get back home.

295
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:44,185
You did it.

296
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,264
You really found it for me.

297
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,998
Do you still remember that night when I tuned Seniorious?

298
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,415
Or have you forgotten?

299
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,593
I remember.

300
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,373
I also remember who Nephren and Nopht are, and Rhantolk.

301
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,978
I know her. And I remember Ithea, too.

302
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,338
I remember them.

303
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:16,344
Although I'm not sure if I still remember everything.

304
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,757
I see.

305
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,316
Well, now that we have the sword,
we don't have to worry about it.

306
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,113
Uh?

307
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,860
What's the matter?

308
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,260
There isn't anything wrong with it.

309
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:30,873
Of course there isn't.

310
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:34,061
If there were, we'd have known
because Nopht would've been struggling.

311
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,422
No. This sword is known as the Kinslayer.

312
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,693
And what does the "Kinslayer" mean?

313
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,343
It specializes in killing one's kin,

314
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:43,838
one's own kind.

315
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:49,463
You see, this is a sword that can only
be used by humans to kill other humans.

316
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:54,113
How can that be when Nopht's fighting beasts with it?

317
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,511
That's exactly why I thought
there must be something wrong.

318
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,873
This sword can only kill humans.

319
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,582
How does she kill beasts with it?

320
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,540
Uh. Willem?

321
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,815
It can kill... only humans.

322
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:16,332
Meaning, they must have
used some organism as a base.

323
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:20,515
What creature, exactly, did the
humans use to construct the beasts?

324
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,707
Oh, God.

325
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,976
A few days after the beasts appeared,

326
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,222
two islands vanished from the map.

327
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:32,315
By the following week, five countries,
four islands, and two oceans were gone.

328
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:35,387
The week after that, the world map had lost all meaning.

329
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:39,104
And then, before long, all humanity was wiped out.

330
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:44,393
How did the beasts increase so rapidly in number?

331
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,833
It can't be...

332
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,530
You don't have to know everything about them.

333
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:51,873
They're archenemies who make you suffer, that's all.

334
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:55,645
I suppose so, but I also wish to learn the whole truth.

335
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:59,198
That would mean the ones making the fairies...

336
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,510
The ones making Chtholly suffer are...

337
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:03,594
Correct.

338
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,111
And they're not wrong.

339
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,249
Humans did destroy the surface.

340
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:21,702
What's wrong?

341
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,570
Willem? Seriously, what's the matter?

342
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,043
Talk to me!

343
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:44,756
You're not freaking out?

344
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,626
For what it's worth, my heart is about to explode.

345
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,498
But while I don't know what happened,

346
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,748
you're showing me your vulnerable side,

347
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:56,905
which is rare, since you usually act so tough.

348
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,047
It's not that complicated.

349
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,995
It's my joy plus my desire for you to be happy.

350
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:04,781
I feel really lucky.

351
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:06,601
You...

352
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:11,281
Besides that, you look like you
might vanish if I left you alone.

353
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,602
Sure, this is embarrassing, but
I'm not going to push you away.

354
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:19,401
You are amazing.

355
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,832
Sorry. I couldn't hear what you just said.

356
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:22,935
What was that?

357
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,582
Never mind.

358
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:25,859
Hey, come on!

359
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,332
Please don't be like that!

360
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,540
Say it again.

361
00:21:28,724 --> 00:21:30,695
Just one more time, please.

362
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:31,790
Marry me.

363
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,370
Thank you.

364
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,774
Uh! Wha--?

365
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:43,991
You are what I needed.

366
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,868
You gave me something that I want to protect.

367
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,629
You gave me a home I could return to.

368
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:50,832
You gave me hope.

369
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:52,915
You gave me a reason to live.

370
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,659
You helped me realize that
it's all right for me to live on.

371
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,075
So, I promise you this...

372
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,338
I swear.

373
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:04,207
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

374
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,142
I want to stay by your side, too.

375
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,953
Now, we can be together forever.

376
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,604
No! N-No, please!

377
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:10,693
Next Episode: evidence of existence.
