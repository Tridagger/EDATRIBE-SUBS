1
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:07,076
We've received a message for you.

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:12,598
You've officially been ordered to report to
the base on Island Forty-Nine at noon tomorrow.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,526
About the surface thing?

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:18,616
Makes me wonder if they plan on using one
of our girls to help with the rescue effort.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,900
Not exactly excited.

6
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:26,164
Oh, no, forgot the pepper.

7
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:33,689
Okay. Which is pepper?

8
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:08,767
Get a move on!

9
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,419
Need medicine here!

10
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:13,288
We've sent word to the Guardian Wings Military.

11
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:17,158
Just gotta take it easy. Help should arrive fairly soon.

12
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:19,691
Yeah, that's a lot easier said than done.

13
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,225
It'll be fine.

14
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,158
Legitimitates, or the Fourths.

15
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,044
Won't run into them for a while.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,384
Here!

17
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:29,809
And why do you think that?

18
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:34,142
I think that because I know they tend
to avoid living close to their own kind.

19
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,343
There shouldn't be any of 'em around here now.

20
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,416
Huh, had no clue.

21
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,562
Rhan, did you know about that?

22
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,949
Humans unleash the beasts,

23
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:48,709
and fill the world with...

24
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,109
They fill it with ashen truth.

25
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,720
Seriously, Rhan!

26
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,517
Your bad habit is showing!

27
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,559
What does Nygglatho always tell you?

28
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,186
When it comes time to eat, you need to focus on food!

29
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,475
Eat up already! Open your mouth wider!

30
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,645
They really are just a couple of children, aren't they?

31
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,938
Willem was right on the money.

32
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,142
We want to send a rescue squad to the surface.

33
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,464
But the Plantaginesta, the Moby-class transport airship

34
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,963
we would use, is currently being remodeled.

35
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:24,622
It won't be ready for 15 days.

36
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,583
What the heck do you need to
have such a big ship for, anyway?

37
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,643
What?

38
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,958
Watch your mouth, Second-Grade Technical Officer!

39
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,945
I'm a First-Grade Technical Officer, you know!

40
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,431
I'm your superior!

41
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,627
Pardon me, First-Grade Technical Officer, sir!

42
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,593
Please excuse this country boy's lack of manners.

43
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,392
Forgiven. I may be a first-grade technical officer,

44
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,391
but I still have some compassion.

45
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,225
Now, let's get back on topic.

46
00:03:56,309 --> 00:04:01,850
The survey team on the <i>Saxifraga</i> was commissioned
to excavate specific ruins of the emnetwihts.

47
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:07,439
They were rather successful and retrieved numerous
relics, so we need a big ship to bring everything back.

48
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,661
Understand, Second-Grade Technical Officer?

49
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,048
Yeah-huh.

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,351
Understood, First-Grade Technical Officer, sir!

51
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:23,196
But the longer the rescue op is delayed,
the more danger the survey team faces.

52
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:28,850
We know, that's why we sent two swords with them
in the first place. And I hope they do their jobs,

53
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,638
even if they must sacrifice their own lives.

54
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,100
Huh?

55
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,734
Is there anything wrong?

56
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:42,366
No, not at all. You're absolutely correct,
oh wise First-Grade Technical Officer, sir.

57
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,892
I can't read a disfeatured's facial expressions.

58
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:47,950
Here.

59
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,850
I want you to go through this.

60
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:54,827
"Ground Level K96-MAL Ruins.

61
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,794
The second Survey Report."

62
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:03,144
Once you read it, you'll be able to
appreciate the importance of this survey.

63
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:05,947
Hang on.

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,767
Streets with thick stone paving.

65
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,350
Jerry-built housing blocks...

66
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:18,608
No doubt about it, this is
Gomag City, in Imperial territory.

67
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,356
It's... It's my hometown.

68
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,767
On the next page,
you'll find a list of their findings.

69
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,923
You know, talismans
and the like.

70
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,627
Those objects are precious and informative.

71
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,564
They're awaiting our rescue.

72
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,147
"Dug weapon Lapidemsibilus"?

73
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:39,878
This is it!

74
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,833
This sword can...

75
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,326
Sir kind First-Grade Technical Officer, sir?

76
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:48,004
What is it, Second-Grade Technical Officer?

77
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:50,741
A favor. I would like to ask one.

78
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,154
Well, that took forever.

79
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,517
Sorry. It's kind of a long story.

80
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,184
Give me a second. I just need to finish this.

81
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,886
There's no need to rush.

82
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:15,018
That was delicious.

83
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:16,347
You ready?

84
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:19,725
Why did you come with me again?

85
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,850
I wanted to buy myself something, silly.

86
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,549
I also have a huge list of things from the girls.

87
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,725
Well, you seem to be enjoying yourself.

88
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,516
It isn't often you and I can take
a leisurely stroll all by ourselves.

89
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,588
In fact, I don't think that's ever happened.

90
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,643
What about when we first met?

91
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,507
We ran all over the place that day.

92
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:40,966
Uh?

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,225
Um, that's true, but it didn't like, you know...

94
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:47,542
It didn't have the same feel back then.

95
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,100
Ready to go?

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,128
Chtholly...?

97
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,534
Oh! Is that a cute missus I see?

98
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:23,642
A "missus"?

99
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,450
Newlyweds, huh? I'll give you a discount.

100
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,025
No, you've got this all wrong...

101
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,198
Yes! We are, thank you very much!

102
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:30,965
Huh?!

103
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:39,184
Are you finished shopping now, "missus"?

104
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,717
Yep, and thank you for all your help.

105
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,357
Newlyweds, huh?

106
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,540
So we look like a couple.

107
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,588
Are you really happy right here?

108
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:53,682
You're finally free to roam outside
the island practically anywhere you want,

109
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,051
so why come with me just to shop?

110
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,579
Oh, come on.

111
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,059
Quit playing dumb when I know you know the answer.

112
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:00,669
Mm?

113
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,380
You see, I don't care where we are.

114
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,001
I just want...

115
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,225
I mean, all I want is to be with you.

116
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,726
I honestly have no clue what you see in me.

117
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:23,020
I was ordered to send a fairy soldier to the surface.

118
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,026
Yeah?

119
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,286
I picked Nephren.

120
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,610
And I'll be going with her.

121
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:29,701
Right.

122
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,566
I don't think I can sit around and
wait for someone to return anymore.

123
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,809
Also, I'm interested in a sword they found on the surface.

124
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,980
A sword?

125
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,024
It's called Lapidemsibilus.

126
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:47,640
I believe it has a special ability to
keep its wielder in optimum mental condition.

127
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:48,819
Mm.

128
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:54,144
So listen. I know you're putting on a brave face.

129
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,548
The disintegration might worsen at any moment.

130
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,350
My hope is that this sword could help.

131
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:02,197
If it ever came down to it.

132
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,559
You're worried about me, then?

133
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,663
Did you really think I would not be?

134
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,279
I don't think there's any reason to worry.

135
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,311
Nothing has happened since that one time.

136
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:18,957
I even sparred for a while with Tiat
the other day, and I was fine afterward.

137
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:20,888
I feel great, so don't worry so much.

138
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,467
You realize you're not a leprechaun anymore?

139
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,121
So there's no telling what's
happening inside your body right now.

140
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,335
I'm begging you, please don't push yourself.

141
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,843
So then, when are you supposed to be leaving?

142
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,839
Oh, not for a while yet.

143
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,923
You'll look after the girls?

144
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:48,284
I'm going, too.

145
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:48,984
Huh?

146
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,017
I said I'm going with you.

147
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,911
Did I not just literally beg you not to push yourself?

148
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:55,017
Yes, you did!

149
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,401
But I won't sit around waiting for you to return.

150
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:58,425
I don't think I could bear it.

151
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,358
Absolutely not.

152
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,404
That excuse isn't gonna fly with me.

153
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:04,517
You are not a fairy anymore, and there's no sightseeing.

154
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,615
You think I'd want to go with you
just to do some sightseeing?!

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,630
Wait. No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
What I mean is, it's not a place to go for fun.

156
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,725
You think this is all about fun?

157
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,501
Now, you've made me mad!

158
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,833
Now, I'm going with you, no matter what!

159
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,809
Calm down.

160
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:20,704
You know that's not gonna happen!

161
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,809
Looks like it's gonna happen, after all!

162
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:29,294
Yay for permission!

163
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,116
Yeah, if you say so.

164
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:33,426
Hold on, are you mad at me?

165
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:36,514
Don't you realize why you got permission to go?

166
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:40,664
Let's see, isn't it because you vouched for me?

167
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,908
Sort of, I guess?

168
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,100
To be blunt, he thought you were my lover.

169
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,467
Your lover...?

170
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:56,795
Apparently, officers often take
lovers on trips as their secretaries.

171
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,745
That is what he thinks I'm doing.

172
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:00,729
Ha!

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,679
Your lover.

174
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,567
I'm okay with that!

175
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:07,345
Well, that's great, but I'm not.

176
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:08,392
All right.

177
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,149
Then we can go back to "missus."

178
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,721
Oh, for pity's sake.

179
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:16,191
Look, truth be told, I would rather
not be separated from you, either, okay?

180
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,534
Wait a second!

181
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,034
I'm happy, but also sad because
it wasn't a proposal, was it?

182
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,767
Of course not.

183
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,664
"I would rather not be separated from you, either."

184
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,217
Oh, no, I totally forgot the pepper!

185
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,781
It's second from the right, window side.

186
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,617
Pepper!

187
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,694
T.O.

188
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,113
Hey, T.O.

189
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,725
Is that Ithea?

190
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:04,761
You betcha.

191
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,301
Your beloved Ithea Myse Valgulious.

192
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,541
If you want anything for breakfast,
best to hit the mess hall soon.

193
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:14,381
Yeah, okay. I'm up. I'm up.

194
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:20,352
Owie.

195
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,140
You were being my blanket, Ren?

196
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,739
That's why I felt so warm. Thanks.

197
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:24,684
You're welcome.

198
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:28,130
It gets chilly this time of year,
and I didn't want you to catch a cold.

199
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,017
When you think about it, shouldn't
this scenario be ridiculously scandalous?

200
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,228
Why doesn't it seem that way, though?

201
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:38,475
That's because your mind hasn't been corrupted
by what they call "the gutter" as of yet.

202
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,472
Not to mention Nephren basically has pet status.

203
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,845
Are you okay with that?

204
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,965
Providing emotional support is crucial.

205
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:46,425
It's a worthwhile role.

206
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:47,917
Is that so?

207
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,821
Anyway, what were you researching all night?

208
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,975
It was a dug weapon, Lapidemsibilus.

209
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,884
That sword could stop Chtholly's mental disintegration.

210
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,126
Jeez, what now?

211
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:04,188
Nothing, just wondering if she has a real chance with you.

212
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,181
Does she?

213
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,929
Don't be ludicrous, she had a chance this entire time.

214
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:14,361
Some may hold out longer, but no man can
remain unfazed forever when a cute girl likes him.

215
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:19,237
But I still can't give in, which is why
I'm trying to keep her at arm's length.

216
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:21,581
Wow.

217
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:23,520
You tell her, I'll end you.

218
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,905
You slept with Nephren?!

219
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:29,705
Why does everyone have to make it a big deal?

220
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,142
You know Nephren is just like a daughter to me.

221
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,017
Why are you being so weird about it?

222
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,309
Spare me. You're not that much older than she is!

223
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,825
Yeah, well, people tend to assume I'm young,

224
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:41,684
but I'm actually over 500 years old.

225
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:46,493
True, and I imagine Nephren must have
snuggled up in there with you herself.

226
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,617
No need to imagine.

227
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,725
But I still have a hard time accepting this!

228
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:52,131
I know you can sense people sneaking up on you!

229
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,558
I can only sense the hostile people, though.

230
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,318
I don't notice the mostly harmless ones.

231
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:58,742
Then let me ask you this.

232
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:01,299
What if the person crawling in your bed was Nygglatho?

233
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,597
Defenestrated in two seconds flat.

234
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:06,142
That's not how it went with Nephren.

235
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,559
Nygglatho might not technically be hostile,

236
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:12,624
but she is what I consider a
dangerous woman, a very dangerous woman.

237
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,166
M'kay.

238
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,017
What if it were me?

239
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:19,148
Uh. I don't know, let me think.

240
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:23,628
I'd have to throw you out, obviously.

241
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:29,389
Please be more careful in the future.

242
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,346
You don't want the little ones
to start jumping in your bed.

243
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,205
At least I assume you don't.

244
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,491
Right. No.

245
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,399
I give up.

246
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:46,600
I have no idea why Chtholly isn't a leprechaun now,

247
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,012
or why her hair changed color.

248
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,447
What about you?

249
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:55,026
Will the dug weapon on the surface really come in handy?

250
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,932
Willem?

251
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:58,414
Oh, sorry.

252
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:00,662
It's just... Chtholly was acting...

253
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,702
I dunno, kinda weird this morning.

254
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:03,600
Huh?

255
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,928
So I said I'd throw her out, obviously.

256
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,683
I thought she'd be mad over why
it's okay with Ren and not her,

257
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:18,599
but she just walked away. You think she's sick again?

258
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,003
You know, for such a perceptive
guy, you can be unbelievably obtuse.

259
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,534
What's that supposed to mean?

260
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:32,499
She's not sick, she's just elated that you
put her in the same category as you put me.

261
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,987
And that would make her elated because why?

262
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:38,562
Because I'm the rival in
love she's most worried about.

263
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:44,623
And if you treat both of us the same, that would
mean you also see her as more than just a little girl.

264
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,892
Hold on. Her rival in love?

265
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,008
Yes.

266
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:52,829
Are you saying she believes you and I
could get together, like in a relationship?

267
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,728
That is the implication.

268
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:55,813
She's so young.

269
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:00,718
I suppose at that age you have the tendency to
get the wrong idea about these kinds of things.

270
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:03,921
I wouldn't say it's the "wrong idea," exactly.

271
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:09,431
You may find this rather difficult to accept,
but I actually do rate you quite highly as a man.

272
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:16,386
Honestly, I wouldn't mind being with a man like you.

273
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,963
After all, our races aren't too terribly different.

274
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:25,297
And because of that, I might even be able to
provide you with children of your own someday.

275
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:29,784
If I could be a part of your
happiness in five or ten years' time,

276
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:32,593
well, there is nothing I would love more.

277
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:39,306
Now, that being said, Chtholly's
happiness is a priority for me.

278
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:42,907
So, don't worry. I'm not about to
go all out for the kill just yet.

279
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:47,392
Nevertheless, she simply can't
help but consider me a genuine threat.

280
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,856
Oh, I hope that makes sense.

281
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm gonna make a really despicable request.

282
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,643
What might that be?

283
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:02,120
Can I pretend that, like, I didn't hear any of that?

284
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:06,373
You're right, that is despicable.

285
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:10,889
However, it's fine. I completely understand.

286
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:14,534
--Hurry! --Yeah!

287
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,462
Last one there's a loser!

288
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,600
Wait for me!

289
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,017
Hey girls, be careful. Don't run!

290
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,945
Do not run in the halls!

291
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:23,709
What do you think's gotten into them, now?

292
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:27,350
Shooting stars.

293
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,248
So pretty!

294
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,517
Look over there!

295
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,659
And over there, too!

296
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,985
Oh, yes, spectacular.

297
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,491
Oh, wow. There are so many tonight.

298
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,267
Did you see that?

299
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,123
Here comes a whole bunch!

300
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:37,517
Hold it right there!

301
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,275
But we're gonna miss all the shooting stars!

302
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,701
Your hair's still wet!

303
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,136
You're supposed to dry it right after a bath!

304
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,559
Do you wanna catch a cold?

305
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,093
Tiat's got that down.

306
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,100
She's playing "big sis" to perfection.

307
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:52,934
It's hard to believe not too long ago

308
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,255
I was the one running after her.
In fact, she's probably imitating me.

309
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:59,941
Ah, yeah. I can totally see that.

310
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,142
Thank you.

311
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:03,980
Hm?

312
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:08,450
For looking out for me. You know,
taking me to the surface and all that.

313
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:11,798
Nah, I'm just doing it for my own peace of mind.

314
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,333
Don't worry about it.

315
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,434
I don't care.

316
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,775
Thanks, anyway.

317
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,787
Look!

318
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,517
What are you doing, Almita?!

319
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,300
Almita!

320
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:33,587
Make it!

321
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:53,184
Chtholly!

322
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:54,332
Chtholly?

323
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:55,665
Chtholly!

324
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:57,746
Goodness.

325
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,074
Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?

326
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:02,908
It's embarrassing.

327
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,201
Some grown-up you are.

328
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:08,498
You okay, sweetie?

329
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,168
It seems like she's all right, too.

330
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,017
Chtholly!

331
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,392
What are you doing?

332
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:17,017
Not that I mind.

333
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:19,306
But let's try this again, from the top!

334
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,392
You're not a leprechaun right now.

335
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,892
You can't generate venenum like
that anymore, don't you get it?

336
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,630
What if things were to go wrong?

337
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,303
What--! What if you...

338
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:31,423
I thought I was...

339
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,449
I thought I was gonna lose
you, even though I was right here!

340
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,184
Well, you're one to talk, aren't you?

341
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,201
I mean, with your wreck of a body.

342
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm perfectly fine.

343
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:53,281
I am a bit numb perhaps, but it
will go back to normal in no time.

344
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:55,893
You're not pretending, are you?

345
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,219
No faith in me at all, huh?

346
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,850
You're all banned from the roof!

347
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,222
Get everyone downstairs immediately!

348
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:05,725
All right, got it!

349
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:08,142
What's going on? What happened out here?

350
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,678
Nothing too bad.

351
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,031
I'll take her up to get a bath, now.

352
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,392
Think you can handle the rest with Nygglatho?

353
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,174
Oh, yeah.

354
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,350
You ready to go?

355
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:18,521
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:26,649
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:29,355
Tiat is the one you should apologize to.

358
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:32,420
If you'd listened to her, you
wouldn't have put yourself in danger.

359
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:34,606
Right. I know.

360
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,406
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,894
Cover those ears.

362
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:44,892
Ready to switch?

363
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:45,752
Yep!

364
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:08,434
Chtholly?

365
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:09,558
What's wrong?

366
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:35,864
Elq.

367
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:10,473
Next Episode: moonlit sorcery.
