1
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,994
This place is a disaster.

2
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,710
It's ridiculous...

3
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,425
I doubt this room's ever been cleaned up.

4
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,804
Maybe no one uses it?

5
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,826
Or maybe they do.

6
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,650
What are you up to, Nephren?

7
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,035
It's Ren.

8
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,785
You can just call me Ren.

9
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:15,035
Well, thanks for the coffee, Ren.

10
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,243
May I ask you what you're doing here so late?

11
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,951
I've been looking for your sortie records, actually.

12
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,826
Those are in the junk room?

13
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:27,493
Need some help?

14
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,160
Sure, if you don't mind.

15
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:31,951
After that, I want to find the files on timeres.

16
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,500
I need to know sortie frequency and timing,

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,420
any strength differentials, overall losses, that
sort of thing. The more I can learn, the better.

18
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:42,093
Roger. You're asking a lot, but I'll do it.

19
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:44,414
Great. Think we can get it done by morning?

20
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,167
Mm.

21
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,730
If I were gonna die in five days, like hypothetically,

22
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:01,397
do you think you'd be a little nicer to me?

23
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,285
A kiss?

24
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,392
What if I asked to kiss you?

25
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,745
Just once.

26
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,557
That was a dream.

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,332
There's no way I could've said that to him!

28
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,160
What have I done? What have I done?

29
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,118
What have I done? What have I done?

30
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,885
You all right in here, Chtholly?

31
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:33,826
I'm fine!

32
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,868
Good. You sound fine.

33
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,368
I bet that's a relief.

34
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:39,547
Usually after a battle, you seem to be in a lot of pain.

35
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,822
Well, that's because...

36
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,072
Wait, I don't feel as bad today.

37
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,279
Of course not!

38
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,770
You've got heart and spirit!

39
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,947
Wait, last night.

40
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,258
That's what he was doing.

41
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,227
Girls, um, do you know where he is?

42
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,700
Y'mean do we know where Officer Willem is?

43
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,947
Uh, let's see.

44
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,939
He's sleeping with Nephren!

45
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,588
Such a savage fairy weapon.

46
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,461
Chtholly. Good morning.

47
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,284
Yes, good morning.

48
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,082
So, you spent the whole night together.

49
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,595
And what were you doing?

50
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,872
Nothing important.

51
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,429
Trying to find a way for you
to avoid opening the Fairy Gate.

52
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,470
We just didn't want you to die, that's all.

53
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,783
You don't understand, do you?

54
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,290
We have to be the ones to fight because
it's the only way to take them out.

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,387
Are you positive about that?

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,996
Huh?

57
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,512
I'm positive we don't have a choice!

58
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,324
And we certainly don't need your pity!

59
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,095
It's good to see you're feeling better.

60
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,102
Wait, what?

61
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,819
Come with me, and get a dose of morning exercise.

62
00:04:58,637 --> 00:04:59,925
Chtholly.

63
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:05,054
Do you think you're ready to give up your life in
order to secure a future for the rest of these kids?

64
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,425
What are you asking me that for?

65
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:13,512
Think you're any good?

66
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,746
I'm just curious.

67
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,869
The leprechauns are the only creatures
that can wield dug weapons. Put that down!

68
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,229
Don't be so sure.

69
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,119
There's a decent chance I can wield one better than you.

70
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,414
Really...?

71
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:33,512
Challenge accepted.

72
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:35,384
I hope you don't regret this.

73
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:37,137
But you will!

74
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,690
Hold on, what just happened?

75
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,298
Wow, is that all you've got?

76
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:49,804
You?!

77
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:50,428
Yeah?

78
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,845
How dare you?!

79
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,498
What's going on?! How'd you do that?

80
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:05,637
Listen to me. These carillons,

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,304
that is to say dug weapons,

82
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:12,012
they're powerful swords, yes, but they do not
gain potency from the wielder's output of venenum.

83
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:13,720
What? You're not serious.

84
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:14,797
Oh, but I am.

85
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:19,029
These weapons use the enemy's own force
against them as soon as contact is made.

86
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:22,195
The stronger the opponent, the more lethal the sword.

87
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,745
Think about it!

88
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:28,644
There has to be a better way to battle these
beasts than what you've been doing, hasn't there?

89
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:34,969
A way with less sacrifice, with
less self-destruction nonsense.

90
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,396
How dare you?

91
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,680
What could you possibly understand about us?

92
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,813
You fight without knowing the basics, which
means you can only swing your sword with brute force.

93
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,320
It seems you're the one who doesn't understand.

94
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:52,808
What's your problem?!

95
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,682
Who do you think you are, showing up out of
nowhere and acting as if you have all the answers?!

96
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,534
I'm the man who knows your fighting
style is nowhere near good enough to win.

97
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:07,979
I won't accept this!

98
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,595
I can't accept it!

99
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,375
Everything we've done has not been a mistake!

100
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,185
Will you, listen to me?!

101
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:17,219
No!

102
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:22,432
I can explain to you how the dug
weapons are actually meant to work!

103
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,061
He's wrong!

104
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:28,170
I want you to learn the proper way
to fight, and to wield Seniorious!

105
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,262
He's lying!

106
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:36,671
You don't have to die.

107
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,648
None of you have to die.

108
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,094
But, we do...

109
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,955
Your movements are sharp.

110
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,652
I like your instincts, too.

111
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,267
And your venenum flow is pretty special.

112
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,554
This is a relief.

113
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,730
You're plenty strong.

114
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,171
What's more, you will be able to get stronger.

115
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,295
That being said...

116
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:05,095
Come back alive or else I'll, I dunno, something...

117
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:05,973
Uh?

118
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,766
What's wrong with him?

119
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:17,039
Just to confirm.

120
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,520
In three days at exactly eight o'clock,

121
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,641
we will dispatch three of our wielders,

122
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,832
along with their individual dug weapons,
from the port at Island Sixty-Eight.

123
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:30,266
The fairy that wields Seniorious will be
in attendance with the understanding that...

124
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,547
That during this operation,

125
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,929
it will be her responsibility to open the Fairy Gate.

126
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,477
Yes, we are confirmed.

127
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:47,679
Why must it always be one of
our girls to make the sacrifice?

128
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:52,339
They die before ever getting the chance
to experience what life truly has to offer.

129
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,475
I hate this! I hate it!

130
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,180
Why does it have to be this way?!

131
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,014
Sorry to be a bother.

132
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:11,409
You should be. Why didn't you knock?

133
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,642
It's an emergency.

134
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:16,119
A bad one. Willem's going to die!

135
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,009
You managed to defeat me?

136
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,317
Your strength is impressive, even for a human.

137
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:40,379
However, you must know all those spells
you cast will return to torment you as curses.

138
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,668
I shall now slumber for a century.

139
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:51,442
Sadly, I've not been blessed with
enough time to watch you expire.

140
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:52,877
Go, then, demon.

141
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,295
Enjoy your sleep.

142
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,018
Let me die in peace.

143
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,442
As you wish, human brave.

144
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,780
Farewell.

145
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,589
I've always known I would be fated to this end.

146
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,682
May it not be in vain.

147
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,639
Lillia, I'm sorry.

148
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,961
Souwong, please forgive me.

149
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,962
I leave the rest to you, now.

150
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:34,687
Almaria, I truly am sorry.

151
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,589
A dream.

152
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,469
Yes, and a nightmare by the looks of it.

153
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,179
What happened to you?

154
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:53,675
Your bones are all broken,

155
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,741
and your organs are barely functional.

156
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:59,795
In fact, your muscles are so frail,
I could have easily bitten them off.

157
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,262
Not as satisfying as you'd hoped?

158
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,747
This isn't a joke, I'm seriously worried!

159
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:08,166
I don't know what happened, but
how can you live in this state?

160
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,565
I call them my battle scars.

161
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,587
From before we ever met?

162
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:15,800
Yes. It wasn't very easy being me.

163
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,220
Try to get some rest.

164
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:23,017
And no getting out of bed, mister.

165
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,397
Now this story happened a long time ago.

166
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,100
In those days, I was on the surface helping
a group of salvagers find anything to sell.

167
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,319
While exploring one day, we came across
what appeared to be a frozen underground lake.

168
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,328
That's where we found him, frozen in ice.

169
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,847
Our investigation revealed that he'd
been placed under a petrification curse.

170
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,247
We decided it would be best to take
him back to the sky islands with us.

171
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:05,129
When he woke up, he was in a panic.

172
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,970
It didn't help that we couldn't
communicate with each other.

173
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:11,211
But, thankfully, he was wearing a babel talisman.

174
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:14,252
That's what eventually solved our communication dilemma.

175
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:18,238
Without it, we may never have learned who he really was.

176
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:23,452
The human race had alienated all the
other races and were forced to fight alone.

177
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,625
They had been wiped out, along
with the rest of surface life.

178
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
But as luck would have it,

179
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:31,345
the wretched race we call emnetwihts had one survivor.

180
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,012
Willem Kmetsch.

181
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,116
I know how this must make you feel.

182
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,845
I just don't want it to make you fear him.

183
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,846
I don't want you to hate him, either.

184
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,262
Girls, please, y--

185
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:50,060
Wait for me!

186
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:51,752
Huh?

187
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,820
Ooh Ooh! Willem!

188
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,387
What's this I hear about you being wiped out?

189
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,887
This is fascinating, emnetwihts
aren't really all that different from us.

190
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,257
Very intriguing.

191
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:03,137
Tell me all about your people, and leave nothing out!

192
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Willem, I...

193
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,762
Well, don't take this the wrong way.

194
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:06,970
But, you should cheer up!

195
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,428
Already cheer.

196
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:11,970
I'm so hungry.

197
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,753
Please, wait!

198
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,304
What am I gonna do with them? Silly girls.

199
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,512
Ah! Well, that sure made things quieter.

200
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,887
And you better keep it down,
too. I wasn't kidding. I am hungry.

201
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,887
Oh, no, don't you worry.

202
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,739
All I wanted is to ask that half-dead man who's
apparently the last living emnetwiht a question.

203
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,220
Go ahead. What is it?

204
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, I'm wondering why a great emnetwiht,

205
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,451
why you would go so far for us.

206
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:46,250
You risked your life for basically no reason.

207
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,063
I mean...

208
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,671
That's totally disgusting.

209
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,997
Right. I guess so?

210
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,304
Isn't it only natural to wanna
be nice to cute kids, though?

211
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:57,115
Especially if they're girls?

212
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:02,362
Cute is relative, and we're all girls here, gender
should have nothing to do with whether or not you're kind.

213
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,513
I didn't mean to offend, it's my opinion.

214
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:06,148
I just think girls are cuter.

215
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,312
It reflects the way they want to be loved.

216
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,195
They adorably wish to be adored.

217
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,460
Boys are cute too, just in a smellier way.

218
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,742
And adorable applies to us?

219
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,974
Come on, as a race, you're
generally all born in this form, right?

220
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,679
Can't be this cute for nothing.

221
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:22,937
So you're telling me everyone in my
race is really desperate for attention?

222
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:27,544
How funny, this coming from someone
who's practically obsessed with little girls.

223
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,529
Oh! Of course! I get it!

224
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,720
No, I don't think you do!

225
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,679
You walked right into that one!

226
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,280
Chtholly...?

227
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,937
There's just no way.

228
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,376
I refuse to believe he's right.

229
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,590
It seems you're the one who doesn't understand.

230
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:56,593
I'm the man who knows your fighting
style is nowhere near good enough to win.

231
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:01,816
It's all yours, now.

232
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,512
All right. I'm off!

233
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,401
I was so scared.

234
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,685
Terrified.

235
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,890
It took what seemed like an
eternity to resign myself to my fate.

236
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:44,207
I don't want to go back.

237
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,543
I'm sorry to arrive without notice.

238
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:55,158
It's nothing.

239
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,492
Proud warriors will always have a safe place
here with us, should they need to escape their winds.

240
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:03,961
That's good to know.

241
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,778
Thank you, Officer Limeskin.

242
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,260
Bitter...

243
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,568
Do you want to talk about it?

244
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:20,638
I don't think so.

245
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,365
Besides, it's probably too late to
say I'm afraid of dying, isn't it?

246
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,281
Technical Officer Willem showed me a new fighting
style, different from anything I've ever seen.

247
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,093
And I can't...

248
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,929
I can't accept what he says!

249
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,573
Because that would mean that
the older fairies all died in vain!

250
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:41,768
I can't...

251
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,596
It struck fear in you?

252
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,043
Seems so...

253
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,877
I see! Of course.

254
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:55,281
Don't be concerned, that man is simply
trying to fight the wind that blows within you.

255
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:57,350
The wind?

256
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,637
I've heard some warriors refer
to their wind as their resolve.

257
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,043
But I suppose resignation is
an acceptable equivalent, too.

258
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,304
Do you think my doubts mean I lack a warrior's resolve?

259
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,240
I don't.

260
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:11,577
Resignation does not have to
mean you lack anything, Chtholly.

261
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:16,781
No matter the word, you've cast aside what
others consider precious in order to achieve a goal.

262
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,595
You're a warrior, and all
warriors have wind in their hearts.

263
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:24,584
On their aimless path, it gives them some direction.

264
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:30,689
Once the battle ends, their souls remain pure
and are able to find the rest they so deserve.

265
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,207
Thanks, Officer.

266
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,278
But, I um...

267
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,304
I didn't understand any of that.

268
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:38,477
Is that so?

269
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:39,577
Can I...

270
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:42,701
I'd like to make a confession,
even if it gets me in trouble.

271
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,340
The thing is...

272
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:48,259
Well, I've never actually wanted to be a warrior.

273
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,959
You're looking good, Seniorious.

274
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,301
Way to hang in there.

275
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:11,435
Ooh. The runaway girl hath returned.

276
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,854
I just went out for a stroll.

277
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,240
What are you doing?

278
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,140
A little maintenance on your partner.

279
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:21,378
Did it cross your mind to ask
the wielder for permission first?

280
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:38,362
A beautiful performance.

281
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,815
Heh. Performance, huh?

282
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,341
I've never seen these lights. What are they?

283
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,345
These are shining talismans.

284
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,977
It's how carillons are made.

285
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:55,595
Various shining talismans join
together and form the shape of a sword.

286
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,740
Huh.

287
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,983
Then all these lights, they're from
wishes people have made, aren't they?

288
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,445
The talisman that you flicked just then?

289
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,804
It was created to help you avoid
burning your tongue on a hot beverage.

290
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:12,444
Uh?

291
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,742
The one next to it let's you know which way is north,
even if you're in a place that you've never been before.

292
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:21,304
And the lights there directly above it
can prevent nightmares when you have a cold.

293
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,654
One can help you imitate cat meows--

294
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,485
This is Seniorious. It's a legendary weapon, right?

295
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,425
Apparently, when you connect
different talismans using magic,

296
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:33,165
it causes a complex reaction that gives them
entirely new and captivating effects like this.

297
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:39,762
I guess I thought since it's a legendary holy
sword that it would have a more extraordinary origin.

298
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,289
Sorry to disappoint.

299
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:47,121
So, I spoke with First-Grade Officer Limeskin.

300
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,554
He said he would leave it up to me,

301
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,188
that I can make my own decision.

302
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:54,021
I don't have to open the Fairy Gate if I don't want to.

303
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,012
He'd stake the island's fate on it.

304
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,544
He trusts my potential as well as resolve.

305
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,763
That's wonderful.

306
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,812
So I can grow stronger, and you really believe that?

307
00:20:09,304 --> 00:20:11,265
I don't just believe it. I can make it happen.

308
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,720
All right, I'll take you up on it, but first...

309
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:17,545
Yes, what?

310
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,091
You might wanna know,

311
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:21,904
I actually don't want to be strong!

312
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,795
No, that's not how it should go. You're supposed to
notice my affection and accept my offer while crying.

313
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:30,221
Heh! Sorry, but I'm being
as accepting as I can.

314
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,662
Because you can't take a hint.

315
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:33,574
Stupid.

316
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,137
Fine then, if you manage to come back alive.

317
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,099
I'll grant you one wish, anything you want.

318
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,626
Wait, you can't ask me to marry you or that kind of crap.

319
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,262
But you said anything!

320
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,038
You have to pick something that's grounded in reality.

321
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:53,470
Sweets.

322
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,200
Uh?

323
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,157
The other day you made sweets
for the little ones, remember?

324
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:58,911
 That's what I want.

325
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,762
Can you make butter cake, maybe?

326
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,345
I'll feed you so much of that cake,

327
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,368
you're bound to get heartburn.

328
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:10,216
A girl I used to know, an older fairy,

329
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,223
whenever she returned from a battle she'd devour
butter cake like her life genuinely depended on it.

330
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,822
But they don't offer it on the
menu in the mess hall anymore.

331
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,017
I've never been able to imitate her.

332
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,072
That's what I want.

333
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:25,178
Please.

334
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,385
Of all the bizarre things...

335
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,358
Willem?

336
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,051
Don't worry. I'm fine.

337
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,366
And you're on.

338
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:40,606
I'll feed you enough to give you heartburn.

339
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,579
It's a deal.

340
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,351
Now, you just have to come back alive.

341
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,306
You got it.

342
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:58,455
What's goin' on?

343
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,712
You didn't want to meet me all
the way here for lunch for no reason.

344
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,409
I tuned their swords as much as I could,

345
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:07,090
and I taught them everything
I know. They should be ready.

346
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:09,470
Well, then, why aren't you out there seeing them off?

347
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:13,173
I don't know why, but it's not like it's
going to improve their chances of victory.

348
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:14,887
Hey, You never know.
