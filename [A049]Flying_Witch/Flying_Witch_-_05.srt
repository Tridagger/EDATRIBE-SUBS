365
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,826
Oh!

366
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:19,526
Now this looks like it could
be quite interesting!

367
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:23,826
(Mwor...)

368
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:24,993
[BOTH]
Hmm...

369
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,593
(Gasp)

370
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,259
[NAO]
Is this... a time capsule?

371
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,293
Huh?!

372
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:31,559
(Mwooor...)

373
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,493
Chito, don't go messing
around with this!

374
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:36,193
This must be very
important to someone.

375
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,093
(Disgruntled meow)
I wonder who...

376
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,426
[MAKOTO]
Hey, everyone!

377
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,459
Welcome home.

378
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,059
Looks like you managed
to make it back.

379
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,959
Yeah, somehow.

380
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,259
(Tired sigh)

381
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,626
[KEI]
You seem tired.

382
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:55,726
Yeah, it was a
really long day.

383
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,393
Seems Chinatsu's tired, too.

384
00:20:58,493 --> 00:20:59,793
She's still napping.

385
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,159
(Light snoring)

386
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,459
[MAKOTO]
She just twitched.

387
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,293
Maybe she dreamt she
fell down the stairs.

388
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:09,426
Maybe she fell in
a pitfall instead.

389
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:12,393
(Snoring and grunting)

390
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:15,726
Akane's been sleeping
too much, don't you agree?

391
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:16,859
Yeah.

392
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:20,926
(Light snoring)

393
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,893
(Meowing yawn)

394
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:33,959
