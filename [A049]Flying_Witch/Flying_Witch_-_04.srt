anyone else here.

Seeing this before the upcoming

Yay, us!

Oh, yeah!

13
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:39,894
I can eat candy apples,

chocolate‐covered bananas,
and takoyaki!

15
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:45,099

So you would rather
hustle to get at the food

16
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,333
than the flowers?

17
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,202
Hmm? I need to do
the Hustle there?

Uh... "Hustle" like "hurry,"
not like the dance.

would rather eat food

Oh... If only
flowers were delicious.

there is one more thing I'd
like you to write for me.

177
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,097
O‐okay...

178
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,800
For the time being,
I need you to write down
your phone number,

179
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,935
postal code, address,
family structure,
blood relatives,

180
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,404
and anything else about
yourself you can think of!

181
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,542
(Heavy breathing)
Uh... I think that's maybe
asking a bit too much.

182
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,276
This is some crazy stuff.

183
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,311
Is this legit?

184
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,614
Oh! Ah, yeah, you're right.

185
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,315
I guess you don't REALLY

186
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,018
want to give out all your
personal info to a stranger...

187
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,521
But please, tell
me just one thing.

188
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,457
Are you Akane Kowata's
younger sister?

189
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,060
Whoa, amazing.
She's right!

190
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,797
Incredible! You are right...
My sister's name IS Akane.

191
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:56,267
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! YES!

192
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,502
AWESOME!

193
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,671
So, uh...
what about my fortune?

194
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,472
I couldn't care
less about that!

195
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,707
What?!

196
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,309
I was never telling
your fortune anyway!

197
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,377
Why?

198
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:07,979
You're a witch,
aren't you?

199
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,814
[KEI] Whoa...
Uh! Uh... why do you...?

200
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,249
That's crazy! I'm not a...

201
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,718
You don't have to hide
it. I'm a witch, too.

202
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,920
Huh?! You are?!

203
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,757
Yes. I came up to this
area five years ago.

204
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:21,660
Oh, that makes you
Makoto's senior.

205
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,963
Ah! This is great!

206
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,699
I never thought I would ever
meet a fellow witch here.

207
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,400
I sure hope we
can get along!

208
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,002
HMPH!

209
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,939
Don't act all
friendly with me!

210
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,708
Uh...

211
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,810
Makoto Kowata...

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,646
let me tell you what
happened a year ago.

213
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,715
Last year? Tell me.

214
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,719
It happened at last year's
Cherry Blossom Festival...

215
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,756
(Hysterical laughter)

216
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,926
Inukai, you're doing fortune
telling now? That's cool!

217
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,828
Well, it's just on
the street.

218
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,030
But, yeah, I do
it now and again.

219
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,000
I've actually become
quite popular with a
lot of my predictions.

220
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,468
You should come around sometime
so I can read your fortune.

221
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,204
(Gulping)
Ahh!

222
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,539
Oh, really?

223
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,140
Are you sure you're
TELLING fortunes

224
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,009
and not just trying
to MAKE a fortune?

225
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,944
(Laughs)
What are you talking about?

226
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:16,648
Anyway, what's the occasion
for you coming up here and
visiting this old town?

227
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,249
Hmm... Well, you see,

228
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,885
my lovely little sister is on
the road to becoming a witch,

229
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,286
and might move up here,

230
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:24,488
so I wanted to check
the place out first.

231
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,390
[INUKAI]
Your younger sister, huh?

232
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,728
If you happen to ever cross
paths, be nice to her, okay?

233
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,095
Of course I will!

234
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,831
Alright! Huh?
Just leave it to me, Akane!

235
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,266
Aha! Great!
Cheers to that!

236
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,200
(Inukai laughs)

237
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,069
You sure you haven't
had too much?

238
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,204
Oh, I know! As a way
of saying thanks,

239
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,007
I'll show you some magic
I've been working on recently.

240
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,209
It's pretty awesome.
I promise!

241
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,678
You sure about that?

242
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,781
(Hysterical laugh)
Yep. And cheers to that!

243
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,816
(Tink)
(Laughs)

244
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,655
Basically, you had a good
time drinking, right?

245
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,023
Wrong!

246
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,961
One of Akane's momentary
whims resulted in me
transforming into this

247
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,531
maddening and hideous form
taunting me forever!

248
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,299
(Amazed gasp)

249
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,670
How am I supposed to live
with this body of mine?!

250
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:18,743
(Heavy breathing)

251
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,211
She's so cute!

252
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,179
AH!

253
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
[MAKOTO]
Uhh...

254
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:30,776
[INUKAI]
Chocolate?

255
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,145
You'd think so, right?

256
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,247
But they're actually
infused with magic.

257
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,282
Someone I know wanted
me to make some,

258
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:38,317
so I thought I'd make
a trial batch.

259
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,519
Oh? So what kind of
effect do they have?

260
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,255
They can turn people
into animals.

261
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:46,292
Huh?! That's pretty advanced
magic you're working with!

262
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,961
That's what I've been told.

263
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,996
But I wanted to give
it a shot anyway.

264
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,497
(Laughs)

265
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,566
You really are a mad genius!

266
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,103
A witch your age who can do
that kind of magic is
practically unheard of!

267
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,605
Hehe! That's simply not true.

268
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:03,576
Anyway, they've never
been tested so I don't
know if they work.

269
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:06,279
Why don't you try
one out for me?

270
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,514
No way! Are you crazy?!

271
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:10,283
I don't wanna be
your guinea pig!

272
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:12,785
(Birds chirping)

273
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:17,756
(Light snoring)

274
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,699
(Groans)

275
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,269
What happened? What the...?

276
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,072
I can't remember anything
from last night. Ugh.

277
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,042
Except that my head
is really killing me.

278
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,777
Alcohol is bad news,
that's for sure.

279
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,346
Hm?

280
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,749
(Confused groan)

281
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:58,031
WHAT?! WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I?!

282
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,601
Hey, Akane!
Akane! AKANE!

283
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,803
That's what happened
last year.

284
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:08,207
So my sister's magic has
made you turn into that?

285
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,009
Well, we were both pretty
drunk at the time,

286
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:13,312
so she probably just got carried
away and fed it to me.

287
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,548
Fortunately, the
magic was imperfect,

288
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,284
so I return to my human form
when the sun goes down.

289
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,154
But it's really been a huge
hindrance to my private life.

290
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,388
Ooh...
Stop doing that.

291
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,991
How exactly do you
know my sister?

292
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,792
We're just very
old friends.

293
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,628
But since
she's been wandering around
the world for such a long time,

294
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:32,431
I can never seem to pin
down her whereabouts.

295
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,300
I thought that maybe
she'd come back here,

296
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,603
so I've been fortune telling
on the side of the street.

297
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:40,673
And then you just showed up
today right out of the blue.

298
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,108
Hm...

299
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,577
I'm sorry about yelling
at you earlier.

300
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:47,146
I was just so surprised
that I just kind of lost it.

301
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:50,183
Oh, that's okay.
Please don't worry about it.

302
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,817
Ah... I'm glad we met.

303
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,087
Now the magic can
finally be undone!

304
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:57,790
You're her little sister, so
you probably know how to get
in touch with her, right?

305
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:00,994
Would you mind giving
her my cell number,
so I can call her?

306
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,229
I don't think she carries
a cell phone with her.

307
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,766
Uh?
And no one in our family
ever knows her whereabouts.

308
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,402
Oh...

309
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,274
[CHINATSU]
I'm home!

310
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,576
Hm? Hmm.

311
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,578
Hi, Momma!

312
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,048
Well, you're back
earlier than I expected.

313
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:23,782
[CHINATSU]
This is my mom.

314
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,485
Oh my, what a cute guest you
have brought here.

315
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,720
Is this a friend of yours?

316
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,655
[CHINATSU]
Yeah! Her name's Inukai!

317
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:30,556
(Squeak)

318
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,491
I'm Chinatsu's mother.

319
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,961
Thank you for looking
after my kid.

320
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,229
(Sad squeak)
Y‐your welcome...

321
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,796
[NANA]
Looks like teatime!

322
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:40,633
Makoto said for you
to wait here.

323
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,002
Your mother didn't
seem surprised at all.

324
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:46,039
I hear when people get old,
they aren't easily surprised.

325
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,707
Where... is...?

326
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,409
Ah, here it is.

327
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,545
Thank you for
the tea, Ma'am.

328
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,048
[MAKOTO]
Hey, I found it!
Oh?

329
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,683
[MAKOTO]
We should be able to fix
your problem using this.

330
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,218
Hm...

331
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:02,355
The complete book of magic for
changing animals into people...

332
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:04,190
[INUKAI]
You using this on me?

333
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,093
Yes, I plan to reverse
my sister's magic.

334
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,461
You don't have to do that.

335
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,663
Just let Akane
know to contact me...

336
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:12,431
This is my sister we're
talking about,

337
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,567
so who knows when she'll
be back!

338
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,336
I consider my sister's
blunder to also be my own,

339
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,506
(Intrigued squeak)
so please let me take
responsibility for it.

340
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,108
[INUKAI]
Uh...

341
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,044
But this magic looks pretty
difficult to master correctly...

342
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:26,479
(Chinatsu gasps)
It'll be fine!

343
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,147
It's not like I'm lightheartedly
jumping into this.

344
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:31,250
Or that I'm using
this as another excuse
to practice magic.

345
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,522
I'm going into this with

Will this cure me?

361
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:26,772
No, it's not supposed
to cure you completely.

362
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:30,276
But this medicine
should temporarily change
you back into a person

363
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,311
for the rest of
the day at least.

364
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:36,449
It would allow you to
remain in your human form
even when the sun is out.

You just had the one candy,

so you'll most likely
turn back soon!

my sister comes back here,

Well, she dropped by
here not too long ago,

390
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:39,812

when we will see her
back down here again.

wait patiently.

I'm sorry.

did anything wrong,

Long time no see,
my friend!

406

Oh! What in the world are you
even doing here anyway, Inukai?

407
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,361
Did you forget?!
Last year, you told me to
come get my fortune read!

408
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,164
UHH!
I went all the way to
the festival grounds

409
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,166
and couldn't
find you anywhere.

410
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,533
I was forced to enjoy
it all by myself!

411
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,170
Uh!
Anyway, you want some
of this takoyaki?

412
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,806
Did you really have to get so
angry right after seeing me?!

413
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,942
You're the one who made me
look like one of your sick
little jokes!

suffered through all of this?!

Huh? What are
you talking about?

yourself, you know?

fun that I always lose track
and go way overboard.

chewing on there?

more snacks!

More snacks? So sorry,
but I'm all outta money.

429
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,252

using magic, with
leaves or something!

chocolate, right?

let you eat that.

you were trying to get me
to test it out for you.

into some sort of animal!

It's fine.

442

The first kanji in my name
means "dog,"

443
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,116
so I've been thinking maybe
I should be more like a dog!

crazy person talk.

Yeah...

450
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:07,766
Then when morning came and
you saw your new appearance...

451
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:11,002
I have a feeling I was actually
really happy with it, wasn't I?

452
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:14,673

Yup. And then you
went back to sleep and I
couldn't get you to wake up

453
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,607
no matter how hard I tried.

454

You think... I'll get cured?

455
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,411
Not anytime soon.

456
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,780
But the effect will
eventually wear off,

in the meantime.

for a way to reverse
the magic, Inukai.

what I find.
