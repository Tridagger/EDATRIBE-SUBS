182
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,443
Yeah?

183
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,643
Will the Harbinger
come next year, too?

184
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:33,355
(Seagulls squawking)

185
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:40,455
(Light breeze)

186
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,267
[NAO]
Makoto?
Huh?

187
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,233
How's it goin'?

188
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,300
Hey, Nao!

189
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,467
How are you?

190
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,367
What are you doing down
here in Yokohama?

191
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,600
Whoa!

192
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,800
You're soaking wet!
What happened?

193
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Oh, well, you know...

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I just swam here
from Aomori.

195
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,533
Huh?! All the
way from Aomori?

196
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,667
Yep, I mostly did
breaststroke.

197
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,100
Uh, that's pretty
amazing of you.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,267
Yeah, I'm pretty good
at swimming distances.

199
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,500
(Amazed gasp)

200
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,700
Actually, there's something
I've been really meaning

201
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
to show you lately.

202
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,033
Will you take a look
at this for me?

203
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,567
You see it? What is it?

204
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,067
Oh?

205
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,667
It likes like you
have a red mole.

206
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,500
Look at it closer.

207
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,967
Hmm...

208
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,767
Ah! Ahh...

209
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:49,400
[TEACHER]
'Kay, now I want to see
you attempt to complete
this math problem

210
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,767
within one minute.

211
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,467
You may begin.

212
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,267
(Soft groan)

213
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,667
[CLASSMATE]
It's from Kowata.

214
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,067
Oh, okay. Thanks a lot.

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,433
Uh... Huh?

216
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,567
[NAO]
A dream?

217
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:22,767
So, how does hearing about
your dream have anything
to do with my problem?

218
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,500
Well...

219
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,333
it's not merely just a
regular dream, you see?

220
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,467
Are you followin'?

221
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,300
Nuh‐uh. What
do you mean?

222
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
For years, witches' dreams
have been long said to be
prophetic visions!

223
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,100
Witches can almost discern
anything about the future

224
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,533
from what their
dreams reveal to them.

225
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:39,700
What? Really?!

226
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
So, then does that mean...

227
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to be super lucky
for the rest of today?

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
Even though it's
already late...

229
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,367
Um, please don't put too much
faith in all this hocus‐pocus.

230
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,967
Honestly it's just
kind of a superstition
between all the witches...

231
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,133
I can't say whether it
will come true or not.

232
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,433
But it's a premonition coming
from a real‐life witch.

233
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,900
It's gotta come true!

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,067
Ohh!
Huh?

235
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,167
Kei, what are you doing?

236
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,267
[KEI]
Makoto, come here for a second.

237
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay...

238
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,633
[KEI]
Do you know about bakke?
Bakke?

239
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:17,400
[NAO]
Around here, we call giant
butterbur sprouts "bakke."

240
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,733
Huh?

241
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,733
Hey! Do this many
usually grow

242
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,300
by the roadside
like this?

243
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,833
Well, they grow
all around this area.

244
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,867
Hmm...

245
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,967
Wow!

246
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,267
Yeah, spring is really here.

247
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,000
It sure is.

248
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,133
Hey, Makoto, have
you ever eaten bakke?

249
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,267
No, I've never tried it.

250
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,167
[KEI]
Well then,
let's pick some.

251
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:43,333
They're super tasty when you
fry them up as a tempura.

252
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,900
[NAO]
You sound like an old man
or something...

253
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,433
[NAO]
Are they in season now?

254
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, they are,

255
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,167
but you can also
eat them after the
flowers are past bloom.

256
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,033
They go well
with miso then.

257
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,367
The bitter taste they release
is good in its own way.

258
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,300
You ARE an
old man...

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,100
I take it that your father
likes to eat them a lot?

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,600
[NAO]
Uh? Now that you mention it,
he hasn't for a long time.

261
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,367
Then you should
pick some, too.

262
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,600
Uh... Gathering plants on
the way home from school

263
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,100
sounds like something
bumpkins would do.

264
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,100
Well, we are country folk.

265
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,367
Hm?

266
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,467
[KEI]
Hey, Makoto!

267
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,867
Yeah?

268
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,533
Don't pick the ones
near telephone poles.

269
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:29,033
Why's that? These are so big...
They look delicious.

270
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,733
Because they get covered
in dog pee and other things.

271
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,433
AHH!

272
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,667
[KEI]
Yeah... We got a
whole bunch of 'em.

273
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,933
Huh?!
What is it?

274
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,667
How come you aren't
carrying any school supplies

275
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,400
in your book
bag at all?!

276
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,433
Oh...

277
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,800
She's right about that.

278
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,100
Huh? Yeah... I leave
them all in my desk.

279
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,467
[MAKOTO]
Nao, are you going to
come over and eat with us?

280
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,767
Nah, I'll pass!

281
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,500
I've got a super
lucky day ahead of me!

282
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,267
See you later!

283
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,367
[KEI]
I'm home.

284
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,567
Hey, you two!

285
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,033
I'm back!

286
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,200
It seems you made
it back safely again.

287
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Yeah, thankfully, I had
Kei with me today.

288
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,267
Kei's finally managed
to make himself useful, huh?

289
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,900
What's that
supposed to mean?

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,667
Whatever, take
a look at this.

291
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,200
Hm? What have you got?

292
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,433
Well, I'll be...
Those are bakke!

293
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,433
Makoto said she's never had
any before, so we picked some.

294
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,333
[NANA]
I see! This will
be your first time?

295
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,367
Yes!

296
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,333
I'm gonna use the
kitchen, if it's okay.

297
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,700
If you cook with the frying oil,
be careful, alright?

298
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,100
[KEI]
Okay.

299
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,667
Well, I'm going off to do
some grocery shopping.

300
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,467
[MAKOTO]
Take care.

301
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,100
[MAKOTO]
How is bakke normally
prepared, Kei?

302
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,833
Your mom mentioned
frying oil without
you saying anything.

303
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,367
(Kei and Makoto discuss bakke)
[NANA]
Huh?

304
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,667
What a second here.

305
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,300
He didn't have anything inside
his bag other than bakke?!

306
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,333
Ah!

307
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,567
(Water running)

308
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,700
Is one egg
gonna be enough?

309
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,633
Hmm... for this many,
I'd say two.

310
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,667
Okay.

311
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,433
I'll put them
over here.

312
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,433
Thank you.

313
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,633
Hey. I'm home!

314
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,300
Hi there, Chinatsu.

315
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,033
Oh, welcome home!

316
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,267
What are you guys
making? Is it sweets?

317
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,700
Chinatsu, take a
look at these things!

318
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,033
Cute!

319
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,700
We're going to fry up
giant butterbur sprouts.

320
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,467
Ugghhh...
You can have some if...

321
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,900
Hmph!

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,167
You okay?

323
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,833
Chinatsu really isn't
a big fan of bakke.

324
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,433
Oh, I see now.
I'm so sorry.

325
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,233
(Sigh)

326
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
So...

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,167
it's already that
season... Great.

328
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:57,067
Bakke has a taste
only grown‐ups like.

329
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,733
That taste is
no good for us kids.

330
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,300
Oh...

331
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,833
(Light sizzling)

332
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,518
When lots of bubbles
start coming up,

333
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,585
you know it's hot enough.

334
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:14,951
Oh...

335
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,318
[MAKOTO]
Did you just put ice
in the bowl?

336
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:21,785
Yeah. Putting some in
the batter really helps
the bakke fry up crispy.

337
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:22,985
(Amazed gasp)

338
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,685
(Sizzling)

339
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,718
Alright, lookin' good.

340
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:30,985
Hey there, Kei, you seem
like a pretty good cook.

341
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:35,085
Hmm. I wouldn't go as
far as saying I'm good,
but I do cook quite a bit.

342
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:38,085
Ah‐ha! I knew you were
holding something out on me.

343
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:42,451
[MAKOTO]
With skills like yours,
I was thinking you'd
make a great girl.

344
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:45,785
[KEI]
You for real? I bet
I'd be pretty popular.

345
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:51,551
[KEI]
Do you cook?

346
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,185
[MAKOTO]
Well, I only tend
to make sweets.

347
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:56,518
Really? Next time, you'll
have to show me how to do it.

348
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,785
Are you trying to boost your
girly charms even more?

349
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,551
[KEI]
Okay, they're ready.

350
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,051
They look delicious!

351
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,518
Well, 'cause they are.

352
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,151
How'd it go?
Hm?

353
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,218
Did you happen to mess up
and burn it all to pieces?

354
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:20,285
Th‐they came
out fine, Chinatsu.

355
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,185
[KEI]
Makoto, you wanna try some?

356
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,218
[MAKOTO]
What? You don't mind
if I have the first one?

357
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:27,285
[KEI]
They're even better if you
put a little salt on them.

358
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:28,918
[MAKOTO]
Heehh...

359
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,085
(Groan)

360
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,285
Here we go, I'm just
gonna dig in...

361
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:36,285
Ohh...

362
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,518
Ugghh...

363
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:42,985
Don't worry, you'll be fine...
they don't taste bad.

364
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:44,518
OOOHHHHH!

365
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,618
Alright! Here I go.

366
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,985
(Crunch)

367
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:51,185
Mm... Mm!

368
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:54,151
Mmm! Mmm!

369
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,818
(Happy laugh)

370
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:59,285
Ah! Delicious!

371
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:00,785
Glad to hear it.

372
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:02,285
Ugghhh...

373
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,285
They have a nice,
firm texture to them

374
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:08,385
and the aroma of the fresh
leaves goes well with
just a touch of salt.

375
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,451
And that slightly bitter
aftertaste they have

376
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,251
is actually quite
surprisingly pleasant.

377
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:14,985
Hahaha! Nice speech.

378
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:17,218
I really mean
what I just said.

379
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:19,585
I'm sure. You sound
like a real gourmet.

380
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,385
A gourmet? Me?
I guess Makoto is
a grown‐up, too.

381
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:25,785
Anyway, I can't believe
that something this delicious

382
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:28,651
is just growing
on the side of the road.

383
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:29,718
Omm.

384
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,718
Mmm!

385
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,585
(Happy sigh)

386
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,418
Can I have another one?

387
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,885
Of course. Go ahead and eat up.

388
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:42,718
Well then, there might
not be enough left after.

389
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,151
Ugghhh...

390
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:48,318
[KEI]
As it continues to get warmer,

391
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,418
other edible wild
plants will come out,

392
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,885
so let's pick
and eat those, too.

393
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,951
Do you really
mean that?!

394
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,618
Mm.

395
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,118
Ahhhh!

396
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,351
(Gleeful chewing)

397
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:06,751
Ah, I'm so happy right now.

398
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,418
