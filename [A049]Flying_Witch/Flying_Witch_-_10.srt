Alright. Please be very careful

[KEI] Let's do it.

Let's first decide who will

Sounds good.

Uh, I'm... really bad at cooking
and might blow something up.

Or at the very least burn
into an unrecognizable crisp.

Don't worry about it.
You'll be fine.

You mean I don't just mix up the
ground meat,

Seriously? You've never cooked
a Hamburg steak at home?

55
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,804
Well, you see. When I was
little I helped to deep fry
some croquettes and messed up.

frying oil and caused a
disaster. It's been a source of
trauma ever since

[KEI]
How you do even mix
these two up?

Since then I stay out of
the kitchen to make sure

it very close together.

really well, Nao.

Okay next...Add the milk‐soaked
panko‐breadcrumbs...?

00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,370
Is this really gonna end
up a Hamburg steak?

120

It will turn out just fine.
Huh?

121
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,770
Also you should probably try
to squeeze out some of the
milk first.

"Divide into four parts

and squeeze out the air"?

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,470
Pretend the meat's a ball and
you're playing catch with it.
Just like so...

same mistake!

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,337
I can't believe
you did that.

146
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,937
Go away...is this
one a tablespoon?

147
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,237
Yep. Now hand over
the teaspoon, please.

148
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,570
What the..?! You're putting
honey in the curry?!

149
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,370
It helps mellow out the flavor.

150
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,470
But I do need to cook it
longer or the curry won't
be thick enough.

151
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,470
Why do you even know stuff
like that? You're such a girl.

Well, well, this whole Hamburg
steak thing seems pretty easy.

155
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,537
Oh, it's really
coming along nicely!

156
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:44,870
(slight laugh)
I know, right?

157
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,537

I'm gonna go ahead
and wash these.

158
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,604
[NAO]
Huh? Makoto, are you already
finish baking the cookies?

159
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,937
No, I'm just wanting the
dough to rest a bit longer.

160
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:55,670
Then, after that all I
need to do is cut out
the shapes and bake 'em.

161
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,604
Wow, you work fast.

162
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,937
I bet they're made from
magic, and that they're
insanely delicious

163
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,437
Good point.

164
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,470
Wait guys...

165
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,504
please don't set such
high expectations.

166
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:06,904
Hey Makoto.

167
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,804
Do witches have a kind
of traditional cookie‐

168
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,170
that they always bake?

169
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,437
Hmm...

170
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,437
I wouldn't say it's
traditional per se,

171
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,737
but we witches do have a
pretty interesting cookie.

172
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,070
[NAO]
What's it like?

173
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,704
[MAKOTO]
It's a called a
"Witch's Pinkie."

174
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,170
[NAO]
"Witch's Pinkie?"

175
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,670
Very true to its namesake,

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,904
it's supposed to look just
like a witch's pinkie finger.

177
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:27,937
Among us fellow witches...it's
a good luck charm for romantic
relations.

178
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,070
Oh, for real?
That's pretty cute.

179
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,904
Since I'm making cookies...
let's add them in too!

180
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,937
I've got all the
ingredients I need already.

181
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,637
[NAO]
Oh, sounds good.
I want to try one.

182
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,104
[KEI]
Nao, those are burning.

183
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,204
Uh! Oh shoot! Ugh!

184
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:49,504
(STUDENTS chattering)

185
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,437
(concentrating)

186
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:54,504
(sniffing)

187
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:55,804
(content sigh)

188
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:57,570
That should do it.

189
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,804
[NAO]
It's done! Ahh...

190
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:08,770
Oh?

191
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,037
You did an
excellent job.

192
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,437
One more left.

193
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,570
[MAKOTO]
That looks great!

194
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,637
[KEI]
Tasty.

195
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,070
I can't believe I made these.

196
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,304
They turned out great for
your first time. Wow!

197
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,737
You know...you've really
have a talent for cooking.

198
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,670
(laugh) Really?
Thank you.

199
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,137
(stomach growling)
[MAKOTO] Huh?

200
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,537
[NAO]
That was me. Ugh...

201
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:29,837
I'm like super hungry now that
I'm not so nervous anymore.

202
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,604
Wah! Ah! What's that you're
holding, Makoto?!

203
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,004
[MAKOTO] Hmh?
[NAO] THAT!

204
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,670
[NAO]
A finger?!

205
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,804
Oh, you mean this?

206
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,304
[NAO]
Wah! Gross!

207
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,170
[NAO]
What's with that thing?!

208
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,504
My cookie? It's a Witch's
Pinkie I was talking about
earlier.

209
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,237
[NAO]
Huh? That's a cookie?!

210
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,704
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, that's all it is.

211
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,504
The nail's made from an almond.

212
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:52,337
And the trick is trying to make
them look as real as possible.

213
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:53,937
[MAKOTO]
Like this.

214
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,237
Ugh, that's
too realistic.

215
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:59,637
It will look more
real once I bake it.

216
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,204
[NAO]
This helps with relationships?

217
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,604
I envisioned something adorable.

218
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,037
[STUDENT] Hm? Uh!
[MAKOTO] (smile)

219
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:10,204
Hey! Once your group finishes,
feel free to eat, okay?

220
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,737
[KEI]
Curry's ready.

221
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,337
[KEI]
Let's show the teacher.

222
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:20,004
Way to go. Can we just eat
already? I'm dying over here.

223
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,604
It all looks good.

224
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,370
[NAO]
All I want to do is have a big
huge helping of delicious rice.

225
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,104
[MAKOTO]
Nothing wrong with that.
You worked up an appetite.

226
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:33,104
[NAO]
You're right. I've earned
myself a reward today.

227
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,137
[NAO]
Uh... Who was in charge
of cooking the rice?

228
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,904
[KEI]
We never did decide...

229
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,387
(AKANE sleeping)

230
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,854
[MAKOTO]
Kei, what should I take with me?

231
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:59,887
[KEI] Let me think... At least
take some work gloves.
(AKANE snoring)

232
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,821
(waking up)

233
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,587
(stretching, groan)

234
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,054
[MAKOTO]
Will these clothes be okay or
should I wear something else?

235
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,987
[KEI] They're fine if you're
okay with them getting dirty.
(AKANE sleepy shuffle)

236
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,554
[MAKOTO]
Ah, Akane.

237
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,654
[AKANE]
Huh? Where are you going
so early in the morning?

238
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:18,121
[CHINATSU]
We're going to go thin
out the apple trees.

239
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,954
Thin out? (big yawn)
What's that?

240
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:25,354
[MAKOTO]
It's the job of picking
the apple blossoms.

241
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,254
I think you slightly
misunderstood.

242
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,321
[MAKOTO]
Huh? That's not right?

243
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,254
[KEI]
Well, you'll see
when we get there.

244
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,221
Akane, you should
come and join us.

245
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:36,787
Hmm, let's see... I don't
have any other plans.

246
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:40,121
Yippee! I get to hang
out with Akane!

247
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,821
Kids! Time to get a move on.

248
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:45,087
[MAKOTO AKANE CHINATSU] Okay!
[KEI] Alright.

249
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:52,354
[AKANE]
Hmm...What a nice breeze.

250
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,021
[MAKOTO]
(inhale) It smells
so nice out here.

251
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,454
[MAKOTO]
Hey, how far along
are the blossoms?

252
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:00,821
They're in half‐bloom.

253
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,754
You know you are pretty
amazing, Chinatsu.

254
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:04,254
You sure know a lot.

255
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:07,521
[CHINATSU]
(giggling) Makoto,
you're even more amazing.

256
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,521
You can fly all around!

257
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,854
Yahooo!

258
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,154
That's dangerous!

259
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,121
I'm fine, really!

260
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,154
They're here.

261
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,521
(AKANE getting up &amp; stretching)

262
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,154
Mmph!

263
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,354
(car door opening and closing)

264
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,054
[LADY A]
Good morning.

265
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,121
[NANA]
Good morning.

266
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,787
Good morning to
you, Ma'am.

267
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,087
[LADY A]
Good morning.

268
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:54,121
[LADY B]
Good morning.

269
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,587
And who's this
young lady?

270
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,554
She's a relative of mine.
She's here to help us out.

271
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,221
[MAKOTO]
I look forward to
working alongside you.

272
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,754
[LADY A]
My...what sweet manners
you have there girl.

273
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:06,554
[CHINATSU] She says
you're sweet.
[MAKOTO] You're too kind.

274
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,587
[LADY A] Oh my, there's
also a foreigner here.
[CHINATSU] Oh?!

275
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:13,954
(laughing) Despite my exotic
looks, I'm actually Japanese.

276
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,921
(bees buzzing)

277
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,021
[LADY C]
Cats?

278
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,854
[KEIJI]
Sooo...

279
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:24,587
I betcha we can finish up the
thinning out there before the
day's over.

280
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,087
Let's get'er done, okay?

281
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:28,921
Well then, I'll see
ya'll in them fields.

282
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,321
[ALL]
Okay.

283
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,021
This is for you two.

284
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:45,587
[MAKOTO]
Wow...it's so beautiful
here, isn't it?

285
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,154
It is... really something.

286
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,587
[AKANE]
I always imagined apple
trees being taller.

287
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:54,554
[KEI]
We prune the branches, to
make sure they will all grow
out to the side.

288
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:59,221
[AKANE]
Ah, I see now! So if
they're left alone they
end up growing taller?

289
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:03,187
[KEI]
Right. And it's a lot easier to
tend them when their branches
are closer to the ground.

290
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:07,687
When you're walking around the
farm grounds, be sure to watch
where you're going or you might
bump your head.

291
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,354
[AKANE] Got it.
(THUMP) [MAKOTO] Ow!
(whimpering sounds)

292
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,921
[CHINATSU] Ouch.
[AKANE KEI] Huh?

293
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,387
[AKANE]
(slight laugh) What happened?

294
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,987
Don't tell me you
bumped your head.

295
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,387
I was looking at the blossoms...
(AKANE laughing)

296
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,421
Come on, Kei was just telling
us to watch were we're going.

297
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,821
I swear you can be such
a klutz at times.

298
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,087
(MAKOTO whimpering)

299
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:26,654
You've gotta watch
where you're going. Ah!

300
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,287
(AKANE fighting off the pain)

301
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:34,521
[KEI]
Hey dad?

302
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,587
Hmm?

303
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,087
[KEI]
Where should we start?

304
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,487
Well, why don't you guys
start with that there tree.

305
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,087
[KEI]
Okay.

306
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,521
[KEIJI] MAKOTO...Akane.
[MAKOTO] Huh?
[AKANE] Hmm?

307
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,321
[KEIJI]
This here is how you thin out a
tree.

308
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,521
See these bunches of flowers
clustered on this here branch?

309
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,754
[KEIJI]
Each one of these here
will grow into an apple.

310
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,787
But let 'em all grow and
trouble brews. You ain't
gettin' a single keeper.

311
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:03,687
So ya gotta do some clippin'
to make sure them nutrients
all get in there.

312
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,087
[KEIJI]
Just like this...

313
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:10,221
Ya'll leave the big guy in the
middle and snip off them other
ones real good!

314
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,221
[KEIJI] Yer aimin' for this.

315
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:13,554
Got it?

316
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:14,621
[AKANE MAKOTO] Oh..?

317
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,887
[BOTH]
Um..? Huh?

318
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:21,087
[MAKOTO]
Sorry. You lost me after the
first part about thinning out
the trees...

319
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:23,654
[MAKOTO]
I still have trouble
with long sentences.

320
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:24,821
Hmph!

321
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:25,987
(AKANE laughing)

322
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,054
Uncle, try explaining
it in English!

323
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,154
You can't just start
speaking French.

324
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,221
That wer' English!

325
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,687
Guess ya ain't ready. Kei!

326
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,921
Huh?

327
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:37,954
[KEI]
Each one of these will
become an apple.

328
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,254
[MAKOTO AKANE]
Yeah?

329
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:40,721
But if you let them
all bear fruit,

330
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,887
then the quality
won't be as good.

331
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:47,654
So we need to thin out the
flowers to make sure nutrients
flow to a single flower.
