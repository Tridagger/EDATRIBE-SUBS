I‐it'll be okay!

355
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,120
It's not like there's
a punishment or anything
for knowing about us!

356
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,853
(Kei snoring)
[MAKOTO]
We're just supposed
to try our best

357
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,820
to keep it a secret is all...
I think...

358
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,486
(Schoolbell rings)

359
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,186
(Chatter)

360
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,386
What? But, Kei, y‐you're
not heading home now?

361
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:06,053
I already have plans to
go hang out with some of my
buddies from middle school.

362
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,153
I'm sorry, but you go on
and head back with Nao.

363
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:10,353
Oh...

364
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:13,153
I already asked her to
take you back to the house.

365
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:16,586
Hey! Make sure you take
good care of Makoto, okay?

366
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,586
Yeah, sure.

367
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:18,820
Cool, I'm outta here.

368
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,520
Huh? But, what
am I suppose...

369
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,820
Tell Mom I'll be home
for dinner, alright?

370
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,686
(Sigh)

371
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:27,386
'Kay, shall we get going?

372
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,020
Uh, sure...

373
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,553
[MAKOTO]
I'm sorry for the trouble.

374
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,086
What do you mean?

375
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,986
Having to take me all
the way to Kei's house.

376
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,686
Well, I mean, he sure
didn't waste any time

377
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,553
heading out with his friends.

378
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,786
He does whatever
he feels like.

379
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,720
I guess that's true.

380
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,520
He hasn't changed a bit
from all those years ago.

381
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,686
(Nao laughs)

382
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,520
[NAO]
Is that so?
Where is...

383
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,720
that smell coming from?
I guess we can't really
expect him to grow up.

384
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:58,553
Huh? Ah!

385
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:00,520
(Rustling)

386
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,253
Wait! What are you doing?!

387
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:05,953
Come on! Your sense of direction
can't be THAT bad, can it?

388
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:06,786
Huh?

389
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,886
No, it's not like that at all!

390
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,353
There's something I want
to give you as a present.

391
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:13,553
What sort of present?

392
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,753
I want to apologize for
surprising you yesterday

393
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,786
and give you a token
for our new friendship.

394
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:20,186
No, really, I'm fine
with all of this.

395
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,653
You don't need to make a big
deal out of it, I mean it.

396
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,853
I do! I want to
say thank you.

397
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,986
You're going out of your way
to take me all the way home

398
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,786
and making sure
I don't get lost.

399
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,653
Really...
Okay, hold on a second.

400
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,220
Like I said...
I'm gonna go find it.

401
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,786
I'll be right back!

402
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:35,553
Uhh...
It's quite a rare plant,

403
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:38,386
so I'm sure you'll be
surprised when you see it!

404
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,420
She does whatever she
likes even more than Kei.

405
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,120
(Rustling)

406
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,686
[MAKOTO]
I would think I must be
pretty close by now,

407
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:52,186
judging by the strong
smell of ammonia in the air.

408
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,020
Oh!

409
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,953
I knew it was here!

410
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,458
[NAO]
Hey, Kitty!

411
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,158
Lookie!

412
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:07,291
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Nao!
Huh?

413
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,258
I'm going to pull it
out of the ground now,

414
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,491
so please cover
your ears!

415
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,858
What? My ears?

416
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,825
Just what is she doing?

417
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,291
(Sigh)

418
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,325
Right!

419
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,525
Ooo‐kay!

420
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:38,625
(Straining groans)

421
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:44,491
The wild ones always have strong
roots fixed to the ground!

422
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:54,891
(Loud crack)

423
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:56,991
Yes! Got it!

424
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,725
(Eerie breathing)

425
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,325
(Ear‐splitting scream)

426
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:04,891
AAHHH!

427
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:05,858
(Birds screech)

428
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:11,258
(Scream continues)

429
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:12,458
Huh?

430
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,091
(Meow?)

431
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,558
Oh?

432
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:17,758
Hm?

433
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:21,791
(Scream continues)

434
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:24,291
(Inaudible partying)

435
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,825
(Scream dissipates)

436
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,258
Huh? What was that noise?

437
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,291
[MAKOTO]
Nao!

438
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:39,291
Thank you for
waiting on me!

439
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:43,025
(Creepy groans)

440
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,891
I finally got it.
Whadya think?

441
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,691
Uh...
(Groans continue)

442
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:53,791
What is that...?

443
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,258
You don't know
what it is?

444
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,125
This cute, little guy
is called a mandrake.

445
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,591
It's an extremely rare plant
to come across out in the wild.

446
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,891
Finding it in a place like
this was really lucky for us!

447
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:06,391
If people hear the shriek
it makes when it's pulled
out of the ground,

448
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,391
it might cause them to die
from the shock of the noise.

449
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,025
Oh, thank you.

450
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,791
(Groaning continues)

451
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,158
Die from shock?

452
00:22:14,258 --> 00:22:16,258
It's a highly
toxic plant,

453
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,025
but if you extract
all the poison,

454
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,325
it becomes a very
useful cure‐all.

455
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,825
Uhh...

456
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,658
Here you are,
my friend!

457
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:24,725
Ah!

458
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:27,025
Uhh...
Like I said earlier,

459
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,091
I wanted to give you a
present to show my gratitude

460
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:30,825
for all that you've done!

461
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:32,558
I... uh...

462
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:35,458
This mandrake is the
perfect present for you.

463
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,658
It's a symbol of our
newfound friendship
and what that represents.

464
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:53,091
(Writhing groans)

465
00:22:58,791 --> 00:22:59,958
No thanks.

466
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,491
