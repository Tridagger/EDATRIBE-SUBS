00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,959
(concentrating)

173
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,159
[MAKOTO]
Oh!

174
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,059
[CHINATSU] Ah!
[MAKOTO] Hmmm...

175
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,726
Odd or even, guys?!

176
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,292
How do you even
know that?

177
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,826
I saw it on TV
the other night.

178
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,626
The guy was like, "You lousy
cheat. You'll pay for this!"

179
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:52,392
[KEI] Uh...
[MAKOTO] So what's
it say, Inukai?

180
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,026
Hmm...

181
00:08:55,126 --> 00:09:00,426
[INUKAI]
The stones are indicating: trip,
element of surprise, unneeded,

182
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,526
creativity, problem,
reunion, and gift...

183
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:11,292
Umm... I dare say that when
you head out tomorrow you'll
be met with an unexpected
ordeal that arises.

184
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,026
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Hmmm...

185
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:16,492
But when you overcome it,
you'll be awarded with a
fantastic result

186
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,859
that will help you
grow... So I think.

187
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,026
Ah...I wonder if something's
going to happen at school
tomorrow.

188
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,459
[KEI]
Yeah, maybe.

189
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,359
Alright then, Chinatsu,
you're next.

190
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,092
(excited) Yay!

191
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,926
(excited)

192
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,659
(concentrating)

193
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,726
Ha!

194
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,592
[MAKOTO] Hmh.
[CHINATSU] Hm?

195
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,559
Hmm...Now let's see...

196
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,959
[INUKAI]
Two‐facedness, trip,
tradition, the dark unknown,

197
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,559
folly, meaningless, and
treasure. I see, I see...

198
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,792
There will be an incident that
allows you to uncover a new side
of yourself.

199
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:02,226
[INUKAI]
In the end, I see that it will
become something you honor and
treasure with respect.

200
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,559
Wow.

201
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,626
That's a really good
reading, Chinatsu.

202
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,659
Thank you! Not that
I know what it means!

203
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,326
Well, it's time
for Kei.

204
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,659
[INUKAI] Ah... if you study
hard, it looks like you'll
score well.
[KEI] (pleased)

205
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,859
Hmh! Ah! Inukai is back
to her beautiful self.

206
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,559
Uh? Oh...

207
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,926
[MAKOTO] Ah, our
beautiful Inukai.
[INUKAI] Wha..?

208
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,692
You're right. Beautiful
Inukai is back.

209
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,759
(nervous intake) What's with you
guys? You're freaking me out.

210
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:31,459
Well... it's starting to get
pretty late, so I think I'll
get going now.

211
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,826
(soft mew)
(terrified squees)

212
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,359
See ya later!

213
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,859
Thanks again, guys.
Say "hi" to Akane.

214
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,326
[CHINATSU]
I'm heading out.

215
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,292
I hope our fortunes
come true.

216
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,392
I've got butterflies
in my stomach.

217
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,426
What does a new side
of myself mean anyway?

218
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,426
Maybe I should have
changed my hairstyle.

219
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:05,959
An unexpected ordeal...

220
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,392
[MAKOTO]
Whatever happens, I've
got to overcome it!

221
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,059
[KEI]
(nervous) U‐uh...

222
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:16,192
(courtyard chatter)

223
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,726
A bit small, don't you think?

224
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,159
[NAO] (angry huff)
[MAKOTO] Oh!

225
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,926
No no, I didn't
mean those.

226
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:25,559
[MAKOTO]
I was just thinking that your
bento is kind of small today.

227
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,026
Yeah... yeah, I know.

228
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,292
Cause you see, I've put
on weight recently.

229
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:35,292
Huh? You look the same as
you always do. Maybe you're
getting a bit taller.

230
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,992
Yeah, well I'm not
so sure about that.

231
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,559
In any case I'd like
to get a bit slimmer,
so I'm on a diet.

232
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,026
It's not good for your
body if you don't eat.

233
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:47,292
My grandmother always told me,
a healthy body makes girls more
attractive to look at.

234
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,692
She would actually tell you
that kind of stuff? Your own
grandmother?

235
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:55,026
She also told me that having a
bit of meat on your bones makes
you more popular with the boys.

236
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,459
[NAO]
For real?!

237
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,792
I guess I better eat up.

238
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,626
Do you want some
of my omelet?

239
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,892
Sure, that'd be great.

240
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,159
[MAKOTO]
That was a nice meal.

241
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,892
(GIRLS chattering)

242
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,059
[MAKOTO]
Are you free later today?

243
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,259
[NAO]
Yeah.

244
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,092
[MAKOTO]
Wanna come over to my place?

245
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,726
[NAO]
Oh, sounds good.

246
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,159
Excellent. I've been raising a
bunch of vegetables at home.

247
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,926
Oh yeah? That's
pretty cool.

248
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,059
Right now, I have flowers
blooming from my edamame plants.

249
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,292
[MAKOTO]
Have you seen Edamame
flowers before?

250
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,092
Uh...No, I haven't.

251
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:30,692
They're just the most
adorable little flower.

252
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,459
I would love for you
to come see them.

253
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,992
You know, sometimes
I have to wonder,

254
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,459
if you really are just
a girl in high school?

255
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,559
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

256
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,959
[NAO]
It's like I'm talking
to my grandma.

257
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:44,959
[MAKOTO] Huh?

258
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,908
(AKANE sleeping/snoring)

259
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,674
Hm?

260
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,974

Oh, my big sister's back home.

Wha...? I didn't know
you had a sister.

263
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,041
Is she also a witch?

264
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,874
Yes, she is.

266
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,541

Amazing! This looks
so professional.

My uncle teaches me
all about gardening.

270

[MAKOTO]
Look here.

271
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,808
These are the edamame
flowers I was talking about.

272

[NAO]
(giggle) You weren't kidding.

273
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,474
They're cuter than I expected.

[MAKOTO]
Right?

275
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,008
I'll give you some edamame
when they're ready, kay?

276
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,774
You mean it?
Thank you so much.

277
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,541
What else do you
plant in here?

278
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,108
Ummm oh! I planted crops
that are supposed to be
good for beginners,

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,341
such as tomatoes,
bell peppers and corn.

280
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,841
[NAO]
Awesome. I just
love tomatoes.

281
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:55,074
[MAKOTO]
Ah, that's not all. Over
there is that mandrake I
pulled up before.

[NAO] (Nervous)

283
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,174
[NAO]
That... really loud one?

284
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,374
[MAKOTO] That would be the one.
I read in one of my witch books

285
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:09,341
that if you plant the part with
the leaves a new mandrake will
grow in its place.

286
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,141
I'm testing it out right now.

287
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,208
You're trying to
make more of them?!

288
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:17,108
[MAKOTO] Yeah, they are very
valuable after all.
(soft MANDRAKE gurgle)

289
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,274

It's now putting out a scent and
has gotten much bigger.

290
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,108
Which reminds me, would you
like to take it home with you?

291
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,541

Like I said before:
No thanks.

292
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:30,674

You sure? I recently learned
how to use one to brew tea that
isn't bitter at all.

293
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:34,408
[NAO] It's not really the taste
that I'm concerned about‐ Wah!
[MAKOTO] Shall we take a look?

294
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,474
...No, I'd rather
you not do that...

295
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,374
Huh?

297

Just hangin' out.

I saw the garden. It's
pretty awesome, huh?

be lots of fun.

[KEI]
Pretty soon it'll be time to
plant the eggplant seeds,

312
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,008

Did you grow them in planters?

366
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,974
We did. We planted
a lot of them,

367

bunch home with you.

I guess I got a little
carried away with planting.

on only eatting radishes?

eat all these?

some away and pickling
some of the others.

eating radishes can
help reduce swelling,

while also boosting your
metabolism for weight loss.
