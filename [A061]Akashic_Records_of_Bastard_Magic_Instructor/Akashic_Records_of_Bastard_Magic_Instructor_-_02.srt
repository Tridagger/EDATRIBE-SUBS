00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:14,125
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,291
[KASH]
Nah.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,125
You mixed it up;
it's the other way around.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,333
[GLENN]
Okay.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,625
Class today is pretty much
just reading this again.

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,000
So you guys can
take it from here.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,791
[SISTINE]
What is wrong with this guy?

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,666
Is he doing this every class?

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,208
Nothing's changed!

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,666
I can't believe he's just
blatantly ignoring an agreement

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,833
between mages!

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,916
[LYNN]
Excuse me. Sir?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,041
Yeah, what is it?

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,250
I still don't understand
how to translate

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,666
these runic spells.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,166
[SISTINE]
Don't waste your time.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,333
But Sisti--

18
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,791
There's no point in
asking him anything.

19
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,041
He won't help you.

20
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,666
Even if he could
answer the question,

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,875
he won't make the effort.

22
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,208
He doesn't care about magic
or respect it.

23
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,333
[LYNN]
Yeah, but...

24
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,375
[SISTINE]
It's all right.

25
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,291
I'll teach you.

26
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,416
We'll take care of ourselves!

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,833
[GLENN]
Why should I care about magic?

28
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,208
Why's it so great?

29
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,791
Figures you'd respond
with ignorance.

30
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,833
Magic is the study of
the world's principles.

31
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,833
What could matter more?

32
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,000
Huh?

33
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,291
The origin and structure
of reality itself.

34
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,833
The natural laws that
govern the entire world.

35
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,333
Magic reveals all that,

36
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,625
helping us understand
forces seen and unseen

37
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,458
and answering the
eternal questions of why

38
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,916
we and this world exist
and what our role can be.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,708
It's humanity's lantern
in the dark,

40
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,291
showing the path to a
greater plane of existence.

41
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,708
That's why magic is great.

42
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,916
Because it empowers us
with understanding.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,666
[GLENN]
But what's its real use?

44
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,958
We can talk all day about
"why this" and "why that"

45
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,000
but what does that
actually accomplish for us?

46
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:39,875
[SISTINE]
What?

47
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,333
What kind of question is that?

48
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,125
Like I said, it reveals a
higher plane of existence--

49
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,041
[GLENN] And what exactly
is on that higher plane?

50
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,875
What, like gods?

51
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, it's just...

52
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,125
[GLENN] I'm asking you
what tangible benefit

53
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,166
humanity gets from magic.

54
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,500
Look at the field of medicine.

55
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,166
It saves people
when they're sick.

56
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,791
Real, practical use
on a massive scale.

57
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,333
That's true for agriculture,
and architecture.

58
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,041
But what about magic?

59
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,375
Is it just me, or does magic
not do crap for people?

60
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,666
That's unfair.

61
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,958
Magic may not feed or house us.

62
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,875
But it provides something
greater than our basic needs.

63
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
It's about searching for
the truth behind this world

64
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,083
--and life itself!
--[GLENN] Sorry, my bad.

65
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,708
I've been lying.

66
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,583
The truth is magic's incredibly
useful for one thing.

67
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,833
For killing people!

68
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,666
[SISTINE gasps]

69
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,250
[STUDENTS gasp]

70
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,791
[GLENN]
Think about it.

71
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,583
In the same time it takes to
kill one person with a sword,

72
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,916
the right spell could
kill ten or more!

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,833
When it comes to mass murder,
magic is in a class of its own!

74
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,166
[SISTINE]
That's not funny!

75
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,166
[GLENN]
I agree.

76
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
Now in the past,
magic and death

77
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,166
have gone hand in hand.

78
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,666
No!

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,541
[GLENN] The field of magic
doesn't give us anything good.

80
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,291
It's built on bloodshed.

81
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,375
[SISTINE]
That's not what magic is about!

82
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,666
[GLENN]
What are you kids thinking?

83
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,833
Open your eyes!

84
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,333
You come here every day
to study an art

85
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,750
that's only useful for
causing death and suffering!

86
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,208
Instead of devoting your
life to something so wretched,

87
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,708
why don't you
do something good--

88
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,875

I hate you!

92

94
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,250
[GLENN]
Magic is great?

95
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,958
What kind of crap is that?

96
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,041
Little brat.

97
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,083
No...

98
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,125
I think the brat
award goes to me.

99
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,791
Okay, I'm done with this job.

100
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,166
I better practice
groveling when I get home.

101
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,250
If I kowtow hard enough,
Celica just might forgive me.

102
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,208
[GLENN]
Hey, what's going on in there?

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,416
A magic circle? Huh.

104
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,000
[RUMIA]
That's weird.

105
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,458
[gasps]

106
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,500
Personal use of this lab's
against the rules, you know.

107
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh, hi, Professor.

108
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,708
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,833
I was just trying to
get some more practice

110
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
creating a magic circle.

111
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,083
I'll clean up now.

112
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:15,958
[GLENN]
It's fine.

113
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,708
Might as well finish.

114
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,041
Thank you, but I
can't get it to work.

115
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,458
[GLENN]
Sure you can, dummy.

116
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,458
Just need more mercury.

117
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,833
You kids are too much.

118
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,875
You're all so hung up
on the forces you can't see

119
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,250
that you don't pay
enough attention

120
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,750
to the stuff in plain sight,
right in front of you.

121
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,541
[GLENN] That shows you
think magic's more sacred

122
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,375
than it really is.

123
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,166
Now, try activating it again.

124
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,291
Use all five phrases,
like in the textbook.

125
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,875
No shortcuts.

126
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,791
[RUMIA]
Okay.

127
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,416
Cycle. Cycle.

128
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,916
Oh, origin of life.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Manifest your path within.

130
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,500
Truth encircled.

131
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,458
You're amazing, Professor.

132
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,125
I've never seen
one so beautiful!

133
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,208
Oh, don't be silly.

134
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,416
It's a glorified parlor trick.

135
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,875
And most of the magic
was your doing, anyway.

136
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
[CELICA]
See? Incredible, right?

137
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,333
[RUMIA] Professor Radars,
I think the truth is

138
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,416
you love magic.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
[GLENN]
What makes you say that?

140
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,625
It looked like you were
really having fun back there.

141
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,541
You're confused, little lady.

142
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,583
I hate magic with a passion.

143
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,750
[RUMIA laughs]
Is that right?

144
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,791
May I ask what you were
doing before you became

145
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
a substitute teacher?

146
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,333
I'm proud to say I was
a freeloading shut-in!

147
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,083
What? A shut-in, sir?

148
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,583
Are you serious?

149
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,875
[GLENN]
You know Celica?

150
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,583
That high and mighty
professor at the academy?

151
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,708
I've been sponging off
her for the past year.

152
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
For a year?

153
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,541
What about before that?

154
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[GLENN]
Okay, enough questions.

155
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,083
What, are you launching
an investigation?

156
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,333
It's my turn now.

157
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,666
Why is everyone in
your class so high-strung

158
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,416
when it comes to learning magic?

159
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,250
You take spell-casting
way too seriously.

160
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,375
I don't know.

161
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
Guess I can only
speak for myself.

162
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,541
I understand your point
about magic causing damage.

163
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083
And I want to change that.

164
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,166
And make it truly
helpful to people.

165
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,541
I owe someone a debt
I'd like to repay.

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,791
[GLENN]
What do you mean?

167
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,833
[RUMIA]
Three years ago,

168
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,416
when I was banished
from my home...

169
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,458
Right around the time
I started living with Sisti

170
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,208
and her family.

171
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,500
I was captured by a group of
evil mages, and nearly killed.

172
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,708
That's when he came.

173
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,375
A true mage of justice.

174
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,291
He swooped in and saved my life.

175
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,833
[VILLAINS yelling]

176
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,291
[RUMIA]
I sat there, stunned,

177
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,833
as he defeated one
bad mage after another.

178
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,541
It was terrifying.

179
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,791
But that day,
when I saw magic used

180
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,333
for evil and good,

181
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,500
I realized I wanted to
help lead the human race

182
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,000
down the right path.

183
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
To use magic as we should.

184
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,541
But to do that,
I need to understand

185
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,958
magic better myself.

186
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,416
I hope if I stay on that road,
it will lead me back to him.

187
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,958
So one day,

188
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,500
I can thank him for saving me
and prove I was worth it.

189
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,375
To repay the man
who gave me light

190
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,375
when I was alone,
crying in the darkness.

191
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,666
That's my reason.

192
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,916
Hold on...

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,208
Yes, what is it?

194
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,208
Nah, just forget it.

195
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,958
[RUMIA]
Can I ask you one more thing

196
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,833
before you go, Professor?

197
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,291
Would you mind
apologizing to Sisti?

198
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,625
Magic means a lot to her,
for lots of reasons.

199
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,000
Most of all, I think it
makes her feel connected

200
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,916
to her grandfather,
who passed away.

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,666
[GRANDFATHER FIBEL]
One step.

202
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,125
That's all I wished for.

203
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,000
Just one step into
Melgalius's Sky Castle

204
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,125
before I breathed
my last breath.

205
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,833
That was the sole
reason I became a mage.

206
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,000
But it never came to pass.

207
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,708
[SISTINE]
I'll do it!

208
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,291
I promise!

209
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,416
I won't stop until I've become
an even greater mage than you.

210
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,250
And I'll unravel the
mysteries of the sky castle!

[STUDENTS whispering]

212
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,583
[GLENN]
I'm sorry about yesterday.

213
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,750
Look, you know how
much I hate magic.

214
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,000
I've made that perfectly clear,

pretend otherwise for you

So I'm sorry.

219
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,083
Anyway, on with stupid class.

220
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,375
[GLENN] Actually, first,
I need to say one more thing.

Every one of you guys....

00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,708
I realized that from the way
you approach these classes.

225

None of you
understands a single thing

226
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,625
about how magic really works.

[GIBUL] This coming from
a disaster of a mage

228

who can't even one-line
a chant as simple

as Shock Bolt.

230

Okay, you've got my ears burning
with that comment, buddy.

231
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,500
It's true; I don't really get
into mana manipulation

233

But come on.

234
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,125
You really think
Shock Bolt is simple?

235
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,791
See? I told you you were stupid.

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,375
[GLENN]
But that's okay.

238
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,125
Today, I'm gonna teach you
the truth about Shock Bolt.

239
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,041
We all know the standard chant.

240
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,583
"Thunder sprites, pay heed,

241
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,458
and strike with
your electric shock."

242
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,583
The real shock is he
needs the whole chant.

243
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,375
This was like the
first spell we mastered!

244
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,541
Why's he wasting our time?

245
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,791
And as we all know,

246
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
mages with a real talent
for mana manipulation

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,916
can shorten it to
"Thunder sprites, shock"

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,208
for a quicker attack.

249
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,208
Here's my question for you.

250
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,625
"Thunder sprites, pay heed,

251
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,250
and strike with
your electric shock."

252
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,416
What happens if you split
this three-line chant

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,541
into four?

254
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,458
[GIBUL] If you don't pause
in the right places,

255
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,041
the chant will fail.

256
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,291
And the spell won't
function properly.

257
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,833
You want a prize for
being obvious, dumbass?

258
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,750
Of course the spell
won't work as intended.

259
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,625
I'm asking what'll
happen instead.

260
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,291
You'll get a random misfire.
Everyone knows that!

261
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,791
Random, really?

262
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
I thought you said
you mastered this spell.

263
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,958
Anyone else want to try?

264
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,833
No?

265
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,583
Fine, then I'll tell you.

And strike with your....

270
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,833
...electric shock.

00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,250
--[GIBUL] No way!
--[WENDY] That's impossible!

272
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,583
That's just one choice.

273
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,083
Make it five lines, like this...

274
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
And you shorten the range.

275
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,166
Or drop this part
and the output plummets.

276
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,083
If you're claiming
you've mastered this spell,

277
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,833
you should know all this, right?

278
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,583
Look. In short, magic is
just an advanced form

279
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,791
of autosuggestion.

280
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
Self-hypnosis.

281
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,000
We use the runic
language for spells

282
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,416
'cause it's the
most efficient way

283
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,666
to achieve that reshaping
of the human subconscious.

284
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,666
Then it's our minds,
not the spells,

285
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,416
that manipulate the principles
governing reality.

286
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,083
You may think magic's
all about studying

287
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,416
the laws of the world
outside of us.

288
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,958
But you're wrong.

00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,250
More than anything,

290
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,083
magic is about probing
the heart of mankind.

291
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,291
You're skeptical.

292
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,708
You think spells are
more than just words,

293
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,375
'cause words can't have
so much power, right?

I affected her mind and
got a physical reaction.

mind to influence the world.

00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,375

Anyway, let's move on.

312
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,750
Since it is about the language,
the grammar and syntax matter.

313
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,125
By making subtle changes,

314
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,208
you can reshape your
subconscious any way you want.

00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,083

the next part?

Well...

321
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,000
You get the gist.
You can substitute words too.

322
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,250
That's crazy!

323
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,375

from the original spell!

that have been embedded

00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,416
deep in your own subconscious.

326
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,458
That's all spells are.

327
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,500
It's an association game.

328
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,875

classmate a nickname.

--[WENDY] A cat.
--[TERESA] Yeah, a cat.

[GLENN]
Chants work the same way.

332
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,416
Make an association,

333
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,208
and your mind can recall
the power however you want.

334
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,583
It's easy.

335
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,166
So sure, you can translate
and memorize chants

336
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,625
exactly how this
lame textbook says.

337
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,750
But if you don't
understand why it works,

338
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,333
then you'll just be
continuing the same

spells you've been told.

344
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,458
But if you want to
become true mages,

345
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,583
you've got some
serious gaps to fill.

346
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,875
Now. We're going back to basics
so you can learn 'em right.

He went here!

356
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,958
[HALLEY]
Damn you, Glenn Radars!

357
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,708
I'll get you out
of this academy.

358
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,166
You'll see!

359
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
The first thing you need
to learn about original magic.

360
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,250
It's not any more
special or sacred

361
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
than the standard stuff
in your books.

362
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,375
You seem to have this idea
that inventing unique spells

363
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
is this huge thing,
like you're not worthy to try.

364
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,333
But trust me,
trying's not a big deal.

365
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,583
The real challenge is
making something better

366
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,791
than existing spells,

367
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,125
which were
painstakingly developed

368
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,291
by countless mages
over the years.

369
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,875
'Cause if it's not better,
what's the point, right?

370
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,583
[GLENN]
Who woulda' thought?

371
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,833
[GLENN]
This really isn't so bad.

372
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,291
[CELICA]
Aw, look at you.

373
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,916
Getting all pensive
in the twilight.

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
I'm glad you're
enjoying your youth.

375
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,708
What do you want now?

376
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,208
Oh, nothing at all.

377
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,791
I just came to say well done.

378
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,916
You've perked up a bit.

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,875
Up until recently,
you looked like a caught fish

380
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,208
who'd been dead
for a month or two.

381
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,541
But I've noticed a change.

382
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,666
Now it looks like you've
only been dead for a day.

383
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,708
[GLENN]
Hey!

384
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,000
I know you were worried.

385
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,708
I'm sorry for that.

386
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,291
All righty.

387
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,333
Tomorrow, I leave for
a magic conference.

388
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,833
Normally, you could come, too,

389
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,375
but after Professor Huey's
departure, your class is behind.

390
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,958
You'll have to stay here.

391
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,166
Don't play any weird
pranks on the girls

392
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,458
just because the rest
of the professors are away.

393
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,916
Oh, please!

394
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,125
As if I could be interested
in typical schoolgirls

395
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,750
after living with
a woman like you.

396
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,083
Oh, really?

397
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,791
I had no idea you've been
looking at me like that,

398
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,458
dirty boy!

399
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,625
I'm the dirty one?!

400
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,708
You've got your
boobs all over me!

401
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,875
Come on, Glenny-baby,
you're no fun.

402
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,458
[RUMIA]
There you are!

403
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,208
Oh, Professor Arfonia!

404
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,041
[CELICA]
What's wrong?

405
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,375
You need your teacher?

406
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,500
[RUMIA]
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
There's something
I wanted to ask him.

408
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,875
Really?

409
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,375
You need some help, huh?

410
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,000
Well I guess the great Glenn
Radars has a responsibility

411
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,958
to use his teaching
powers for good.

412
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,333
[SISTINE] I didn't want her
to ask, and this is why!

413
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,916
[RUMIA]
I thought his answer was great.

414
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,041
He's so easy to understand.

415
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,583
[SISTINE] When he tries, he's
an incredible magic teacher.

416
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,875
But he's still an idiot.

417
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,500
[RUMIA]
Hey, Sisti.

418
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,000
Remember when I first came here

419
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,250
and started living
with your family?

420
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,416
Why are you bringing that up?

421
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
It took us a while to get to
know each other, didn't it?

422
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,875
At first we didn't get along.

423
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,250
Yeah, that's true.

424
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,458
But now I can honestly say
you're my closest friend.

425
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,750
Maybe you and Professor Radars
will become close too.

426
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,250
[SISTINE]
That is so not happening!

427
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,541
[RUMIA laughs]
Are you blushing?

428
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,541
[EVIL MAGE 2A]
Is the plan proceeding smoothly?

429
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,958
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Yes.

430
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,458
But there's the man Celica
Arfonia brought on board.

431
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,000
Goes by Glenn.

432
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,958
[EVIL MAGE 2A] He's some low
rent mage and no threat to us.

433
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,875
Proceed as planned when the
magic conference commences.

434
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,541
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Understood.

435
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,458
I shall pray for
the plan's success.

436
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,375
All glory to the Divine Wisdom.

437
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,166
[GLENN yelling]

438
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,208
I'm late again!

439
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,125
[GLENN]
I know you're there.

440
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,625
Might as well come out.

441
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,250
[CARREL] It was quick little
barrier to ward people off.

442
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,666
Still...

443
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,500
I have to say you've
got pretty sharp eyes

444
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,500
for an amateur mage.

445
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,833
I don't know who you are,

446
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,125
but in case you didn't
hear my yelling, I'm late.

447
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,708
Lucky for you,
your itinerary's changed.

448
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,541
Your new destination
is the afterlife!

449
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,916
Corruption.

450
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,041
Fester!

451
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,791
[STUDENTS chattering]

452
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,958
You'd think he was
some kind of celebrity.

453
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,916
[RUMIA giggles]

454
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,250
Say it.

455
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,541
Are you worried you won't
get as much attention

456
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,916
now that he's popular?

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,833
What's that supposed to mean?!
Why would I care?!

458
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,916
[door slams]

459
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,875
Good morning, students.

460
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,250
Sorry we're late.

461
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,583
What is this? Who are you?

462
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,000
You're not with the school!

463
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,541
I'm afraid your teacher
has another engagement.

464
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,541
We're filling in.

465
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,833
[SISTINE]
You think we're stupid?

466
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,166
Outsiders are not allowed
inside the academy!

467
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,375
You need to leave right
now or I'll call security!

468
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,416
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Bang.

469
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,166
[STUDENTS gasp]

470
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,666
That's military-grade magic!

471
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,250
Mouth off to us again,
everyone dies.

472
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,833
[STUDENTS gasp]

473
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,166
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
We're looking for someone.

474
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,750
Rumia is what she's
been calling herself.

475
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,500
If that's you,
then raise your hand.

476
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,583
Nobody?

477
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,291
That's strange, she's supposed
to be in this class.

478
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,791
Maybe you're Rumia?

479
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,041
No. It's not me.

480
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,541
Then do you know
this Rumia girl?

481
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,958
No, sir, I don't.

482
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,041
Are you sure?

483
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,958
There's nothing
I hate more than a liar.

484
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,583
[SISTINE]
What's this about?

485
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,625
What are you planning
to do with Rumia?

486
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,250
You're asking that
like you know her.

487
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,333
Why don't you just
answer my question?

488
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,125
I warned you once.

489
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,458
--Bye--
--[RUMIA] I'm Rumia.

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,125
Oh?

491
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,041
So you were right
here all along?

492
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,166
Yeah. We knew, of course.

493
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,833
I was just playing
a fun little game

494
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
where we'd kill all your
classmates until you fessed up.

495
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,500
Okay, that's enough
messing around.

496
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,833
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Yeah, yeah, fine.

497
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,416
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Let's go.

498
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,583
No, Rumia, don't!

499
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,916
It's all right.

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,791
I'm sure Professor Radars
will come to the rescue

501
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,958
soon enough.

502
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,041
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
You mean your substitute?

503
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,708
We already killed that twerp.

504
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,541
--Liar!
--That can't be...

505
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
[EVIL MAGE 2B]
Now come.

506
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,250
[RUMIA]
What are you after?

507
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,833
Why are you taking me?

508
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,583
[EVIL MAGE 2B] You should know
perfectly well, Rumia Tingel.

509
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,458
Or should I say
Princess Ermiana?

510
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,708
You're supposed to be long gone,
and yet here you are.

511
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,958
A royal girl everyone
thinks is dead.

512
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,916
That makes you a rather
valuable card for us to play.

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
[SISTINE yells]

514
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,833
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Ya know, you're a pretty girl.

515
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,458
Be a waste not to enjoy you.

516
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,958
[SISTINE] I'm the daughter
of the proud house of Fibel!

517
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,791
That supposed to impress me?

518
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,375
I have a real eye for this,

519
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,458
and to be honest, having my way
with girls like Rumia isn't fun.

520
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,958
She may look weak,
but she's the type whose spirit

521
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,000
won't break no matter what.

522
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,583
You, on the other hand...
You're the opposite.

523
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,541
You act tough,
but you're just a child

524
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,500
hiding your weakness
behind a mask.

525
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,166
I enjoy breaking girls
like you most of all--

526
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,833
feeling you melt all around me.

527
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:38,125
Screw yourself!
I'll never submit to you!

528
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,958
[gasps]

529
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,333
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

530
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,500
[snickers]

531
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,833
What pretty skin you have.

532
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,000
[SISTINE]
Please. Stop.

533
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,208
What's that?

534
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,750
Just please, don't hurt me.

535
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,583
Please don't.

536
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,125
[EVIL MAGE 2C laughs]

537
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,083
You're breaking down already?

538
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,583
This is gonna be a blast!

539
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,833
[SISTINE]
No... Someone, save me!

540
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,166
Let's get this party started!

541
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,291
Hm?

542
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,708
Huh?

543
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,541
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Who the hell are you?

544
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,791
Sorry. I can leave.

545
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,500
[SISTINE]
Help, you idiot!

546
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,625
[GLENN sighs] Look, sock hat.

547
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,833
I get it, girls think
you're disgusting.

548
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,583
But this aint gonna change that.

549
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,250
Oh, no. Professor, get out!

550
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,583
First you tell me to help,
now you're tellin' me to leave.

551
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,166
Which is it?

552
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,541
[SISTINE] He's about to fire!
I'm saying get out of the way!

553
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,041
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Too late.

554
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
[SISTINE gasps]

555
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,416
Bang.

556
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,125
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

557
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,541
Bang! Bang!

558
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,916
[GLENN]
Your magic won't work anymore.

559
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,250
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
The Fool arcana?

560
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,125
[GLENN] By using the magic spell
that I've tied to this card,

561
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,916
I can completely seal off
the activation of all magic

562
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,791
within a set range, centered
around yours truly.

563
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,708
[GLENN]
That's my original spell.

564
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
It's called The Fool's World.

565
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,083
Your own original spell?

566
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,875
You're telling me a mage
like you is on that level?

567
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,958
[SISTINE] Sealing his enemy's
magic would make him invincible.

568
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,458
Heh. Of course, my spells
won't work either.

569
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,958
[SISTINE, EVIL MAGE 2C]
Uh?

570
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,750
[GLENN] I mean, obviously.
I'm in the effective range, too.

571
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,208
[EVIL MAGE 2C laughs]

572
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,125
How exactly is a mage
supposed to fight

573
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,666
if he seals his own magic?

574
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,708
You idiot!

575
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,083
[SISTINE]
We're done for!

576
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,083
[chuckles]

577
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,500
Get out before--

578
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,625
You! You're dead!

579
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,250
[EVIL MAGE 2C yells]

580
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,541
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
Huh?

581
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,875
That's the Imperial Army's
hand-to-hand combat style.

582
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,000
Just who the hell are you?

583
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,500
I'm Glenn Radars.
Substitute teacher.

584
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,083
But if you're still alive,
that means you defeated Carrel!

585
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,333
That's impossible.

586
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,333
Some mage who challenges
people to fist-fights

587
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,583
could never beat him.

588
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,875
[GLENN]
Good grief.

589
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,416
If you're that freaked
out by the whole

590
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,458
non-magic combat thing, I can
try to make you feel better.

591
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,833
I'll finish you with the
legendary super magical

592
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,666
iron fist Magical Punch!

593
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,833
Here goes!

594
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:33,000
Magical...

595
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,583
...Punch!

596
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,583
[chuckles]

597
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,000
[EVIL MAGE 2C]
That was a kick.

598
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,125
Well yeah, that's the part
that makes it magical.
