1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,916
That was a close one.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,083
Are you okay?

3
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,250
Yes, thank you, Professor.

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,083
But...

5
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,750
Hey! I know.

6
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,666
You don't have to tell me.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,458
Teaching's the last
thing a guy like me

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,875
should be doing.

9
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,125
These hands are
just too damn dirty!

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,875
[SISTINE] Professor Radars,
that's not what I mean.

11
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:35,916
Um...

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,916
Your pants fell down!

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,708
[GLENN gasps]
How did that happen?!

14
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,791
[GLENN] So the other
mage kidnapped Rumia?

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,041
--[SISTINE] Yeah.
--[GLENN] Why target her?

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,791
[SISTINE]
Um, no idea.

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,000
Looks like we'll have to
get it out of this one.

18
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,958
[beeping noise]

19
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,208
What the hell, Celica?

20
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,541
Don't you answer your calls?

21
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,916
I've been trying to reach
you for the last hour!

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,958
[CELICA]
Sorry.

23
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,791
I was in the middle
of a big speech.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,958
Is something up?

25
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,375
Don't mess with me, Glenn.

26
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,250
I wouldn't joke about
this kinda thing!

27
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,208
Some seriously nasty
mages have come in here

28
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,541
and completely sealed
off the Academy!

29
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,833
They've taken most
of the students hostage.

30
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,000
[CELICA] Do you know
what group they're with?

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,916
[GLENN]
Yeah.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
Researchers of Divine Wisdom.

33
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,083
[CELICA gasps]

34
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,333
I see. The top of the
evil mage food chain.

35
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,750
Why are the worst terrorists
in the Empire's history

36
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,583
interested in our school?

37
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,875
All I know right now
is they shouldn't have

38
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,958
broken through the magic
security as easily as they did.

39
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,333
That means...

40
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,166
[CELICA] They must have
an inside man at the school.

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,333
Bingo.

42
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,666
Can you dig around on your end

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,000
and see if you turn up
any suspicious professors?

44
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:49,875
And while you're at it,

45
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,166
ask the Court Mage Corps for--

46
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,458
Glenn, that won't be easy.

47
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,666
Make it easy!

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,750
There are students'
lives at stake here!

49
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,125
Calm down.

50
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,583
[CELICA] Right now,
I'm just a professor, like you.

51
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,125
I lack the authority.

52
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,041
Fine! Then you get
back here and help!

53
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,458
You can use the
teleportation circle!

54
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,000
Waste of time.

55
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,125
If these Divine Wisdom guys
were able to seize our barrier,

56
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,166
I'm assuming they also destroyed
the teleportation circle.

57
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,208
Good point.

58
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,666
I'm shooting from the hip here.

59
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,583
[CELICA]
But don't worry.

60
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,083
I'll do what I can to get there.

61
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,458
[GLENN]
Please do.

62
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,625
Hey, Glenn?

63
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,208
[GLENN]
What?

64
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,875
Stay alive.

65
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,125
Thanks!
What a great idea, Doctor!

66
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,166
What's wrong?

67
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,583
[SISTINE]
We're not getting help, are we?

68
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,333
[GLENN]
Probably not, punchy.

69
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,708
What are you doing?

70
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,291
I'm going to get Rumia!

71
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,166
Oh, please.

72
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,291
They'll destroy you!

73
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,416
[SISTINE]
Shut up!

74
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,291
I don't know how to help.

75
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,291
Hey. Stop.

76
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,625
Don't cry here.

77
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,333
You were right 
before, Professor.

78
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,625
Magic isn't good for anything!

79
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,208
It's 'cause of magic
that Rumia...

80
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,291
That she...

81
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,666
[GLENN]
Don't cry, white cat.

82
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
Thank you.

83
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,750
Rumia told me her life's goal
is to understand magic better.

84
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,458
Make it more useful
for normal folks.

85
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,875
It's a nice thought.

86
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,291
Seriously?

87
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,208
She told you that?

88
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,791
She's not gonna die.

89
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,208
I'll save her.

90
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,083
I'll find the other
two evil mages.

91
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,291
And kill them.

92
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,833
[JIN laughing]

93
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,875
Kill them, huh?

94
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,250
Well, that's weird.

95
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,416
You're a hell of a lot more
like us than I expected.

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,333
No! Professor Radars is
nothing like you people!

97
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, no, no.
I read him like a book.

98
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,666
Your prof's got "bastard"
written all over him.

99
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,666
Go on!

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,916
Admit you're no
different from us!

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Um... What now?

102
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,291
[SISTINE gasps]

103
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,208
Professor?

104
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,750
[GLENN]
Bone golems!

105
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,250
[JIN]
Reinforcements!

106
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,291
Our boss's summoning magic!

107
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,625
Thank you, leader!

108
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,250
[BONE GOLEMS growling]

109
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,750
No, wait...

110
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,083
They're the enemy.

111
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,708
Get them.

112
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,000
Somebody help me!

113
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,208
[SISTINE screams]

114
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,750
Stay behind me!

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,833
[yelling]

116
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,416
[GLENN gasps]

117
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,750
Aww, cripes!

118
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,125
And they say I'm the one
who's hard headed around here!

119
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,333
Upon thy sword, light!

120
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,833
Nice one. Eat this, bonehead!

121
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,041
[yelling]

122
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,666
--Let's go!
--Uh, right!

123
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,958
I'll hold 'em back!

124
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,333
While I do that, can you
alter your Gale Blow spell

125
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,833
so it reaches maximum
range and duration?

126
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,583
Uh, no?
That's really advanced!

127
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,166
[GLENN] Please.
I know you can do this.

128
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,375
It's not that hard.

129
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,375
Don't be so... stubborn.

130
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,541
I'm not stubborn, I'm honest!

131
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,458
[GLENN] I guarantee if
you've listened to even half

132
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,208
of what I've been teaching,
you can do this,

133
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,458
no problem.

134
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,625
And if you can't,
I'll dock your grade.

135
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,083
You son of a bitch!

136
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,166
All right, then.

137
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,875
Here goes nothing.

138
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,458
Don't let me down, white cat.

139
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,583
[GLENN]
C'mon, you calcified corpses!

140
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,041
[BONE GOLEMS growl]

141
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:58,000
[SISTINE] Wind, be still,
but then, the force.

142
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,916
Tempest, run rampant,

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,250
but so that you
may last longer.

144
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,875
How do I do this?

145
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,916
This spell needs the
same strength Rumia showed

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,125
in the classroom.

147
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,333
[SISTINE] And the strength
of the professor,

148
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,291
who's risking his life while
he trusts me to get this done!

149
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,125
It's my turn to save him!

150
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,250
It's ready! I got it!

151
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,958
Nice work.
Now let 'em have it!

152
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,416
Keep them all at bay.

153
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,041
Wall of tempest.

154
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,875
Grant peace to them below!

155
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,541
Oh, no!

156
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,750
I can't stop them completely!

157
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,416
Sorry, Professor!

158
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,750
[GLENN]
Don't be sorry.

159
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,250
You did great.

160
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,416
Keep it up.

161
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,125
I'm he who slays
and captures gods!

162
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,666
I am the one who knows the end
and the founder of genesis!

163
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,500
Now return thyself to
the cycle of providence.

164
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,125
The five elements to elements,

165
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,708
and sever the link woven
between images and the truth!

166
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,958
I declare that all creation
shall perish here--

167
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,625
at the distant ends of the void!

168
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,458
Prepare to be blasted, rabble!

169
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,833
Black magic!

170
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,166
Extinction Ray!

171
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,916
[BONE GOLEMS growling]

172
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,583
Oh, wow.

173
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,541
I've never seen such
a high level spell.

174
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,875
[GLENN groans]

175
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,541
[SISTINE]
Professor!

176
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,666
You're freezing!

177
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,458
Your mana must be low.

178
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,250
That's what happens
when you force yourself

179
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,166
to do a spell beyond your means.

180
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,708
We've gotta get
out of here, right now!

181
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,916
Doesn't matter where.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
[footsteps]

183
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,041
Too late.

184
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,000
They're not about to back down.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,125
[REIK]
I'm impressed that you know how

186
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,666
to use an Extinction Ray.

187
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,083
I heard you were nothing more
but a low-rent mage.

188
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,583
I underestimated you.

189
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,708
[GLENN]
Wow, really?

190
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,583
I think somebody might
be overcompensating

191
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,125
with his flying swords.

192
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,791
I didn't think you'd beat
both Jin and Carrell.

193
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,833
Screw you.

194
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,000
Your Bone Golems
killed one of them.

195
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,625
Don't blame me for that.

196
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,208
Hey, white cat.

197
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,625
Do you think you
have enough power left

198
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,333
to clear out those swords
with a Dispel Force?

199
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,291
Sorry, but I don't think even
using all my remaining power

200
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
will be enough.

201
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,625
Besides, there's
no opening for it.

202
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,708
Okay.

203
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,041
Well, then.

204
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,083
Bye.

205
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,250
[SISTINE]
What?

206
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,875
Uh...

207
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,500
Hey!

208
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,666
[crash]

209
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,250
Here we go.

210
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,083
[REIK]
I would run if I were you.

211
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,083
I know your "Fool's World."

212
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,833
How you can use it
to prevent spells

213
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,083
from going into effect.

214
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,750
Too bad it can't stop spells
that are already active.

215
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,375
[GLENN yells]

216
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,500
Stupid magic swords!

217
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,500
[GLENN] But no matter
how dangerous he is,

218
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,750
his mana fluctuates before
and after using magic.

219
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,875
Maybe I can time it
for just that moment.

220
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,666
Crimson Lion!

221
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,958
Pay heed and roar with--

222
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,166
Dispel Force.

223
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,458
You're far too slow, Professor.

224
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,833
Allow me to teach you.

225
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,000
Flame Lion.

226
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:39,916
[GLENN]
Got you!

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,250
Thunder emperor!

228
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,458
[REIK]
What?

229
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,625
[GLENN] Pierce with
your brilliant lance...

230
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,833
...of light!

231
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,250
[GLENN] Damn, I thought
for sure I'd connect

232
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,666
with at least one.

233
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,916
[REIK] It seems you're
trying to force me

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,250
to choose between
two deaths, Professor.

235
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,583
Had I continued with Flame Lion,

236
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
you would have sealed it
and then attacked me

237
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,791
in hand-to-hand combat.

238
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,541
If I chose to use the swords,

239
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,708
you would have capitalized
on my fluctuation in mana

240
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,708
to hit me with
a Lightning Pierce.

241
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,000
Tell me.

242
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,666
Just who are you?

243
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,791
I'm just a magic teacher.

244
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,500
Well, a substitute.

245
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,916
That's a lie.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,083
But I will show
you some respect.

247
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,541
Now die!

248
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,875
Creation, pay heed...

249
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,166
[REIK]
Dispel Force?

250
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,708
[GLENN grunts]

251
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,291
...maintain the balance
of the scales.

252
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,750
Too late for that.

253
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,291
Re... turn!

254
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,125
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
You don't have the power.

256
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,125
You're done!

257
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,125
[SISTINE]
Return them to nothing!

258
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,166
What?

259
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,458
Professor!

260
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,375
[GLENN yelling]

261
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,291
[REIK]
Awaken Blade--

262
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,541
Too slow!

263
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,375
I... I remember.

264
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,541
Till recently, there was a
deadly mage killer in the--

265
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,833
in the Imperial Court Mages.

266
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,416
His codename was...

267
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,666
[GLENN] Wish it didn't
have to be so gruesome.

268
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,625
You hurt?

269
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,625
No, I'm good.

270
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm just...

271
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,375
I'm surprised you got my intent.

272
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,375
Huh?

273
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,000
Hey!

274
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,333
He's trying to get rid of me?

275
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,333
That jerk!

276
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,375
[crash]

277
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,041
Maybe I am useless
in this fight.

278
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,041
Do you think you
have enough power left

279
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,250
to clear out those swords
with a Dispel Force?

280
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,500
If you were really
trying to get rid of me,

281
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,125
you wouldn't have asked
about my power levels first.

282
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,583
[chuckles]

283
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,750
I thought there was a 70%
chance you wouldn't get it.

284
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,166
Well... Let's roll.

285
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,458
Wait...

286
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,833
You better not fight
anymore in that condition.

287
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
It's not like I have
a choice, Sistine!

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,625
[grunting]

289
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,666
[SISTINE]
Professor!

290
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,875
[GLENN]
Damn, it hurts.

291
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,458
Merciful angels, pay heed,

292
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,291
and grant him your peace.

293
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,750
Your saving grace.

294
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,208
I guess... it's not my fate.

295
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,250
[SISTINE]
What?

296
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,375
I had always wanted
to be a Mage of Justice.

297
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,291
[beeping noise]

298
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,250
[beeping noise]

299
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,333
[beeping noise]

300
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,875
[CELICA]
Glenn! You're alive!

301
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,958
[GLENN]
Yeah, somehow. How are you?

302
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,541
[CELICA]
Eh.

303
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,250
Just like I thought, they shut
down the teleportation circles.

304
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,750
No luck finding the
collaborator, either.

305
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,666
But Glenn, those aren't
the biggest problems.

306
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,083
[GLENN]
Huh?

307
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,166
[CELICA] It looks like the
barrier around the Academy

308
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,375
has been set to keep people in.

309
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,333
So they're criminals
who don't plan

310
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,000
on getting away with it?

311
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,250
[GLENN] I'm guessing
they haven't attacked

312
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,458
since I killed Reik.

313
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,541
But with the barrier,
they're still here.

314
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,916
What the hell are they doing?

315
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,583
Celica.

316
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,166
Tell me where the
transportation circle is.

317
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,666
[CELICA] At the very top
room of the tallest tower.

318
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,875
But what's the point?

319
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,291
The teleportation
circle isn't shut down.

320
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,833
They're rewriting
its destination

321
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,416
so they can make their escape.

322
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,416
[CELICA]
That's nuts.

323
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,750
It'd take half a day to do that!

324
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
That's right.

325
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,125
Which means they should
be just about done with it.

326
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,250
[GLENN]
Ow! Dammit.

327
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,333
[sighs]
Still in one piece, though.

328
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,750
I owe you big, Sistine.

329
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,291
I was lucky to have you
in my corner today.

330
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,041
And with that,
I'm off to save Rumia!

331
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
[RUMIA]
Why are you doing this?

332
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,083
You were an educator,
not a terrorist!

333
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,333
[GLENN yelling]

334
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,291
You're here!

335
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,833
[GLENN]
Rumia!

336
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,583
Um, are you all right?

337
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,625
Well I look worse than I feel,
and I still feel pretty bad.

338
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,916
[footsteps]

339
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,833
So you're the big boss, huh?

340
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,458
[HUEY]
Indeed, I am, professor.

341
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,291
Good gravy, who invited
Mr. Pretty Pants?

342
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,666
Aren't you late for
a hair appointment?

343
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,291
Anyway, I've had a long day,
so I've got no patience left

344
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,541
no matter how shiny
your face might be!

345
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,458
First strike wins.

346
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,875
Got that?

347
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,416
You should, 'cause I nailed it.

348
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,333
So why don't you give--

349
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,500
No, I win.

350
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,625
What does that mean?!

351
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,666
[HUEY] In ten minutes,
we'll have finished rewriting

352
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,166
the circle's
destination coordinates.

353
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,333
Rumia will be transported
directly to our base.

354
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,500
Then, the white magic
ritual I just finished

355
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,791
will activate.

356
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,500
This Sacrifice spell
will devour my soul,

357
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,875
releasing an incredible
amount of mana.

358
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,750
Enough energy, in fact,
to blow up the school.

359
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,416
[GLENN gasps]

360
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,250
[RUMIA]
No!

361
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,416
Don't do it, Professor Huey!

362
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,750
Huey?

363
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,875
So this is the professor
who left that I replaced?

364
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,958
You're the inside man!

365
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,583
I prefer to see myself
as a human bomb,

366
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:44,750
ticking down for years,
and finally ready to explode.

367
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,458
Well, thanks for reminding me.

368
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,750
You Researchers of Divine
Wisdom aren't just evil,

369
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,375
you're total nut jobs.

370
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,125
You can still win this game.

371
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,458
[GLENN]
Huh?

372
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,083
[HUEY] If you can counter
the Teleportation Circle

373
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,708
binding Rumia,
then Sacrifice won't activate.

374
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,625
But if you simply wait for
the Fool's World to run out,

375
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,750
you won't be able to dispel
it with the time lost.

376
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,708
So, Glenn,
will you play the game?

377
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,875
[RUMIA]
Don't worry about me, Professor!

378
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,750
Get out of here
and save yourself!

379
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,833
I'm afraid it's no use
attacking me with magic

380
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,541
or your fists.

381
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,958
If I die, then all of this
activates automatically.

382
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,500
[GLENN]
Power of creation, pay heed,

383
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,166
and pass through my
blood to form your path!

384
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,625
Using your own
blood as a catalyst.

385
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,166
That's impressive.

386
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,625
[GLENN]
Let the divine cycle end.

387
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,500
Let the foundation of calm,
the yoke of principles,

388
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,375
be unleashed in this spot!

389
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,750
Well done.

390
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,166
However...

391
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,166
That was only the first of
five layers you must undo.

392
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Dammit!

393
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,083
Professor Radars,
don't worry about me.

394
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,000
Just go!

395
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,208
[GLENN]
Shut up! I'm working!

396
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,541
Professor, please stop
doing these spells!

397
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,458
They're going to kill you!

398
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,916
Oh, yeah.

399
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,208
I bet the white cat would
get a real kick out of that!

400
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,250
[RUMIA]
Please stop.

401
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,208
You don't have to
do this for me.

402
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,375
I don't want you
risking your life!

403
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,625
[GLENN]
Y'know...

404
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,083
I always wanted to be
a mage of justice.

405
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,125
But it was just my luck
that the world of magic

406
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,291
is actually a filthy,
blood-stained place.

407
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,416
Bummer.

408
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,250
I've nearly wasted
my whole damn life.

409
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,375
And yet, I'm not about
to give up on it, either!

410
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,083
[GLENN] If I'm someone
who runs away from trouble,

411
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,625
then what was the
purpose of any of this?

412
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,500
Those years I spent trying
to be a mage of justice.

413
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,458
I know they were a failure.

414
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,333
But...

415
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,750
I won't let them be worthless!

416
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,916
You got a problem
with that, buddy?

417
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,250
Do you see that?

418
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,541
One more to go.

419
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,791
[retching]

420
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,833
[coughs]

421
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,166
No, don't!

422
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,750
Almost... there.

423
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,208
I got the worst luck.

424
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,625
Can't believe I ran out of mana.

425
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,666
Damn.

426
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,708
I tried.

427
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,958
Professor!

428
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,291
I made it!

429
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,000
Since you didn't give up,
I won't, either!

430
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,125
You hear me?

431
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,416
Here.

432
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,958
This is for you, Professor.

433
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,125
[GLENN]
What is this power?

434
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,791
[GLENN]
I've heard of this before.

435
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083
People with the ability
to dramatically increase

436
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,458
the power of those they touch.

437
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,541
They're called amplifiers.

438
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,125
[yelling]

439
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,375
Let the divine cycle end!

440
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,041
Foundation of calm.

441
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,833
Yoke of principles,
be unleashed!

442
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,458
It appears that I lost.

443
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, well.

444
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,458
Should I have died following
the Researchers' orders?

445
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,666
Or should I have died
ignoring them?

446
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,541
Since you won the day,
maybe you have the answer.

447
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,583
[GLENN]
Yeah, I don't care.

448
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,208
Look, I'm sorry
it's over for you,

449
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,875
but it's your own fault for
not choosing a better path.

450
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,500
And now I'm gonna do something
about that shiny face.

451
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,875
[GLENN] Show me them
pearly whites, Pretty Pants.

452
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,500
[SISTINE panting]

453
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,750
Is he--?

454
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,791
[RUMIA]
Shh!

455
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,833
[RUMIA]
Thank you, Professor.

456
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,958
So Rumia used to be
Princess Ermiana.

457
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,458
Then three years back,
she fakes her own death.

458
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,458
Yeah, because society
persecutes those with powers.

459
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,958
People would revolt if
they knew a royal had 'em.

460
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,250
Only two people
at the Academy know.

461
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,583
Me and the Headmaster.

462
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,041
Well... I don't really care.

463
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,458
Is that so?

464
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,041
Then what made you decide
to keep teaching here?

465
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,875
[SISTINE]
Hey, there he is!

466
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,833
[RUMIA]
Professor Radars!

467
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,958
I have serious questions
for you after that last lecture.

468
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,500
I decided to stay
here because, well,

469
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,541
I want to see what they're
capable of achieving.

470
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,416
And it's a good place to nap.
