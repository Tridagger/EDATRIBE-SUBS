Incredible!

Class two comes from behind
in yet another event!

00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,750
Who'dve imagined
these stunning results

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,666
at this year's
magic competition?

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,333
Professor Radar's class two has
cemented their dark horse status

00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,333
as they continue
to climb up the board!

00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,125
[ALBERT] So it's true.
That's our Glenn.

00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,875
[RE=L]
No doubt about it.

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,125
He disappeared from our
ranks without saying a word.

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,166
And now we find him
playing teacher.

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,375
What is it, Albert?

13
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,416
Do you mind?

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,541
What do you plan to do, Re=L?

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,625
[RE=L] Settle the score
with him, of course.

16
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,041
Hey. What's your problem?
Don't you wanna confront him?

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,041
Naturally, there's a lot
I'd like to say to Glenn.

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,166
Still... Our mission
has to come first.

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,916
[RE=L]
Mission?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,875
[ALBERT] We must oversee
the Imperial Guard

21
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,083
charged with protecting
Her Majesty, the queen.

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,833
[RE=L]
They're our allies.

23
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,375
Why are you concerned?

24
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,500
[ALBERT] We've received
word of suspicious activity

25
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,916
within the Guard.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,875
There's a chance some
of them may try something

27
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,291
against Her Majesty.

28
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,166
That's what our
leadership tells me.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,708
I see.

30
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,458
So I should take care of
this Glenn matter alone?

31
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,666
Is that what you mean?

Man. They're rubbing
my face in it!

I'm so hungry I'm
about to eat this grass

Excuse me, Professor?

00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,208
Huh?

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,208
[GLENN]
I'll try to help.

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,791
As long as it doesn't
involve money,

41
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,750
'cause I'm all out of that.

42
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,500
Well, sir...

43
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,291
It's about my next event.

44
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,333
Could I switch
with somebody else?

45
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,458
Let's see.

46
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,125
You're doing
transmutation, right?

47
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,416
[LYNN]
Yes.

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,625
I've been practicing
hard for it.

49
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,125
But I can't get the
Self Illusion spell down.

50
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,208
It just isn't working
for me, sir.

51
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,958
So you think someone
else could do better.

52
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,041
But that's not what you want.

53
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,291
I mean, you would rather
participate, right?

54
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,666
Don't you love transmutation?

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,625
Well, yes, sir.

56
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,708
I sure do. It's my favorite.

57
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,833
You get to become someone else!

58
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,916
So do it.

59

You'll be just fine.

worried about?

enjoying yourselves,

But Professor...

70
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,416
Okay, how's this?

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,708
We'll have a little
tutoring session.

72
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,791
To start, let's review
Self Illusion.

73
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,583
How would you
describe the spell?

74
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,166
It's black magic that cloaks
you in an illusion, sir.

75
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,333
[GLENN]
Exactly.

76
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
It's not some huge
spell that physically

77
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,000
reshapes your body--
it's just a trick.

78
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,250
Now behold.

79
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,791
Phantasmagoria.

80
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,541
Enacted by myself, I shall not
sing with another's voice.

81
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,041
There, you see?

82
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,500
It's really just a shell.

83
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,583
Then you can mold it
into whatever you want.

84
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,791
Amazing!

85
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
My guess?

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,333
The spell isn't working 'cause
you're thinking too vaguely.

87
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,666
You need to imagine
every detail.

88
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,083
Who are you trying to mimic?

89
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,666

La Tilika.

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,750
Nice.

91
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,791
Then find an illustrated
book on icons.

92
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,958
If you can visualize clearly
it should be a cinch.

93
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,916
You're more talented
than you think.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,833
And even if you can't
pull it off today,

00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,000
anyone who tries to blame
you for hurting our team

Thanks. I'll do my best.

It's okay, I won't eat it all.

what's wrong with me.

on the human decency scale.

I figured you must be starving
to try a stunt like that.

150
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,875
So dig in.

151
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,458
Oh, thank you,
you sweet, freaking angel!

00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,541
These tears are pure
liquid happiness!

Ah, I love the
tomato sweetness!

154
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,916
With the salty, savory ham!

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,541
And the earthy, nutty richness
of the thinly-sliced cheese.

156
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,708
It's like a perfect
harmony of flavors!

00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,583
Awesome!

158
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,791
Did you make this yourself?

159
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,250
Me? Oh, no.

160
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,958
Truth is, in the kitchen,
I'm pretty much all thumbs.

161
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,000
Then who's the chef?

162
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,541
Sorry, but I can't tell you.

163
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,750
I've been sworn
to secrecy on that.

164
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,166
I'll just say...

165
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,000
This person woke up early
to make something special

166
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,375
for the class,
and for a certain man.

167
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,166
They got into a fight,
so she couldn't.

168
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,541
She was so mad she was
about to throw it away.

169
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,416
But I didn't want it
to go to waste.

170
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,291
Hmm. Nice.

171
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,166
So I'm better than a trash can.

172
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
I kinda feel bad
for the girl, though.

Sounds like the
guy's a major jerk.

have a fight with someone

super-delicious sandwich?

00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,166
Thanks for that.

180
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,458
It's a meal for the ages.

181
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,500
You're welcome.

182
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,208
The chef will be
happy you liked it.

183
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,083
We should probably
get back to the stadium.

184
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,833
[ALICIA] Actually, may we
speak for a moment?

185
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,375
You're Glenn.
Glenn Radars, correct?

186
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,791
That's me, but sorry,
I'm all out of moments.

187
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,708
Now that my belly's
not eating itself,

188
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,416
I have to--[gasps]

189
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
Holy crap! The queen!

190
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,375
[ZELOS]
Where has Her Majesty gone?

191
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,875
[SOLDIER 5A] I only took my eyes
off her for a minute, Commander.

192
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,000
You fool!

193
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,750
Just find her or else, soldier!

194
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,833
[SOLDIER 5A]
Yes, sir!

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
See that, Headmaster?

196
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,500
That guard's so freaked out I
think his brain might explode.

197
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,250
I can't believe you
had the gall to hide her

198
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,500
with your magic.

199
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,916
You're as terrifying a
woman as ever, Celica.

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
[CELICA chuckles]

201
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,083
Um, m'lady...

202
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,375
What's up, Eleanor?

203
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,375
There's something
I'd like to tell you.

204
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,291
It's sensitive, I'm afraid.

205
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,875
[CELICA gasps]

206
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,083
[ALICIA]
It's been a year now.

207
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,916
Have you been well?

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,916
Uh, peachy, Your Majesty.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,291
Please raise
your head, good sir.

210
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,583
Ever since that day,

211
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,708
I've wished I could
apologize to you.

212
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,250
You bravely devoted yourself
to protecting this empire.

213
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,833
And so it shames me
you were expelled

214
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,583
from the Court Mage Corps
in such a disgraceful fashion.

215
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,083
[GLENN]
No, no! No shame!

216
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,375
I-I just quit 'cause I got
sick of the work, that's all!

217
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,833
You can't be lowering
your queenly head

218
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,041
to a world-class failure
like me, Your Majesty!

219
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,125
Now, Glenn...

220
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,791
Uh, but more importantly,

221
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,500
why are you here without
your guards, Your Grace?

222
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,083
[ALICIA] It's been such
a long time, Ermiana.

223
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,458
How are you, my dear?

224
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,708
I can't believe how
tall you've gotten.

225
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,833
How are the Fibels?

226
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,666
Do you like living
with their family?

227
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,583
[chuckles] It's surreal...
being able to see you again.

228
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,208
[ALICIA]
Ermiana.

229
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,791
Your Grace.
I beg your pardon.

230
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,375
I don't mean to be rude,
but there's been a mistake.

231
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,291
My name's Rumia.

232
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
Rumia Tingel, Your Grace.

233
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,541
I have no right to
contradict you, Majesty.

234
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,458
But it seems to me
that you may have somehow

235
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,250
confused me with the
late Princess Ermiana.

236
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,250
[ALICIA]
Yes.

237
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,000
Of course.

238
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,583
Ermiana's gone.

239
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,041
She died three years ago
from an epidemic.

240
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,875
I'm confused by grief.

241
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,416
My apologies for
putting you through

242
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,041
such unpleasantness, Rumia.

243
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,083
[RUMIA]
No apology needed, Your Grace.

244
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,958
Now if you'll excuse me.

245
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,625
[ALICIA] I figured she
wouldn't accept me.

246
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,083
Why would she view me
as her mother now?

247
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,500
[ALICIA]
I'll be going back now, Glenn.

248
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,333
[GLENN]
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

249
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,750
[ALICIA] Promise me
you'll take care of her.

250
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,833
I will.

251
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,541
[ZELOS]
My queen.

252
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,250
Hello, Commander Zelos.

253
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,833
I hope I didn't worry you.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,125
[ZELOS]
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

255
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,208
But I'm afraid I must insist
that you come with us.

256
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,041
[ALBERT]
I can't believe it.

257
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,416
The Imperial Guard is
treating their own queen

258
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,208
like a prisoner.

259
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,500
I didn't think they would dare.

260
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,458
Zelos, the Imperial Guard's
General Commander.

261
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,958
They say he fought
on par with the legendary

262
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,208
swordsman Johannes
in the Divine War

263
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,791
forty years ago.

264
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,250
Hardly the type
I'd expect to be rash.

265
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,208
Where are you going?

266
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,208
To dispose of our enemies.

267
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
The soldiers who make up
the Imperial Guard

268
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,750
are hand-selected for
their loyalty to the crown.

269
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,875
I find it hard to believe
they would harm the queen.

270
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,958
No, they must be plotting
something different.

271
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,791
[RE=L]
How's this for a strategy?

272
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,458
I'll charge in with
a full frontal assault.

273
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,875
Then you follow me after
with a full frontal assault.

Oh, calm down!

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,083
I won't.

283
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
It's about Rumia--
she hasn't come back.

284
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,083
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

285
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,625
Okay, lean in, kitty.

286
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,125
What? Be serious!

287
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,916
[GLENN] Anybody would
want some alone time

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,833
after a suck-fest like that.

289
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,250
Guess I should
go look for her.

290
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,166
I hate the idea of
expending all that energy,

291
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,708
but she'll feel better
if she's with her friends.

292
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,666
Can you handle things
here while I'm gone?

293
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,666
Yeah, sure.

Please find her. I'm worried.

Hey, relax.

I could search for her all day.

Angel of Hunger Rumia

Well, congratulations.

You're a human dumpster.

You can't shame me.
They were delicious!

310
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,083
They weren't some
gastronomic miracle,

311
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,958
but they were tasty as hell!

312
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,500
And shame on you,
with your "dumpster" comment.

313
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,666
Some girl spent a
lot of time on those.

314
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,000
I thought you were
only mean to me,

315
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,000
but to imply her
sandwiches were trash?

316
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,666
I... That's not what I meant!

317
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,625
Just go and find Rumia, okay?

318
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,208

This locket...

321
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
There's nothing inside.

322
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,916
But I feel like
there used to be.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,791
Maybe a portrait
of someone special.

324
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,083
Someone precious.

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,875
Does that make me weird?

326
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,708
Wearing this every day
because of a picture

327
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
I just imagine is there?

328
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,541
Not really.

329
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,041
Like with spells,
it's about what the words

330
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,541
and tokens mean to you.

331
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,083
I'd say.

332
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,041
Professor, you know
the truth, don't you?

333
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,875
That Her Majesty and I...

334
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,416
Yeah.

335
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,125
Do you think I was wrong?

336
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,875
The way I handled
that situation?

337
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,291
The truth is I understand
why she did it.

338
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,125
She had to.

339
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,583
I'm one of the gifted,
to put it kindly.

340
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,625
Others would say
I'm the devil incarnate.

341
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
Or even cursed.

342
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,333
Because of this ability
I was born with,

343
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,416
I could become
a dangerous liability,

344
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,458
and rip the royal family apart.

345
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,041
So of course.
I know it was necessary.

346
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,625
The queen had to erase me.

347
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,875
She couldn't put
the empire at risk.

348
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,958
But even though it makes sense,

349
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,250
part of me can't
forgive what she did.

350
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,250
Part of me feels
so mad I could scream.

351
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,541
[GLENN] Can't apply logic
to matters of the heart.

352
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
[RUMIA] But another
part of me just wants

353
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,458
to call her "Mother"
one more time.

354
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,916
Wants to hug her,
and be hugged so tight.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,333
But then...

356
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,208
I think about Sisti's parents,
how they've taken me in

357
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,083
with no questions
asked and treated me

358
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,375
like their own.

359
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,958
And that makes me feel
like I'm betraying them.

360
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,708
I'm lost.
How do I reconcile all that?

361
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,166
Here's my philosophy.

362
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,250
Human beings are regretful
by nature. Always.

363
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,083
Any choice we make comes
with pain no matter what.

364
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
[GLENN] It's easy to
say "pick carefully,"

365
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,250
so you won't have regrets.

366
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,125
That's a load of bull.

367
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,083
You agonize over
the path you choose,

368
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,291
but you'll always find
time to think of the turns

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
you didn't take.

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,333
It's the pain and the joy
of the human experience.

371
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,125
My advice?

372
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,000
Just make sure you're
being honest with yourself.

373
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Honest?

374
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,458
Yeah.

375
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,333
'Cause the closer you can
get to your true feelings,

376
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,958
the less those regrets down
the line are gonna hurt.

377
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,750
Rumia.

378
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
What do you want most of all?

379
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,333
That's just it.

380
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,625
Right now I'm not sure
what I'm feeling.

381
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,166
A long time ago,

382
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,625
I served in the
Imperial Army as a mage.

383
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,166
Due to the nature
of my assignments,

384
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,625
I visited the court
pretty often.

385
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,083
Every time I went, I would
see the most powerful person

386
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
in the kingdom wearing a locket

387
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,291
just like the one you're
holding in your hand.

388
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,000
She may have erased
you from the books,

389
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
but not from her heart.

390
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,208
So does that locket
have meaning?

391
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,708
Hell yeah, it does.

392
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,125
Even if it's just to
unload your resentment.

393
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
Start by confronting her.

394
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,083
Tell the queen all those
feelings you told me about

395
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,750
instead of running away from it.

396
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,750
You think so?

397
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,333
'Course.

398
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,291
I'm hardly the person to talk
after all the running I've done.

399
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,041
But... I'm scared.

400
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,458
Her eyes can turn so cold,

401
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,666
and I'm not sure
I could handle that.

402
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,583
Do you think you could...

403
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you think you could go
with me, Professor Radars?

404
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,416
Damn it.

405
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,291
All right.

406
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,333
I'm such a softy.

407
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,166
Great! I can't thank you enough!

408
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,000
[GLENN]
Speaking of the Guard.

409
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,125
[SOLDIER 5A]
Are you Rumia Tingel?

410
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,541
Yes, that's right

411
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,750
I hereby declare...

412
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,041
You are accused of
conspiracy to assassinate

413
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,416
Queen Alicia the Seventh!

414
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,791
And found guilty!

415
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,250
You will be executed immediately

416
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,750
for this heinous treason
against the Crown!

417
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,125
[RUMIA]
What? Me?

418
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,000
Assassinate the Queen?

419
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,791
Is this some
crappy performance art?

420
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,875
Where's your proof?

421
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,041
It's not your
business, outsider.

422
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,666
You're going to execute
her with no warrant

423
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,708
and no trial?

424
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,583
[SOLDIER 5A]
Yes.

425
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,166
By direct order of Her Majesty.

426
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,333
Cut the crap!

427
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,708
Step away from her, fool!

428
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,250
If you continue to defend her,

429
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,750
then you'll be executed
for treason, as well.

430
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,041
[RUMIA]
I surrender.

431
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Are you nuts?

432
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,541
I'm the queen's subject.

433
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
If Her Majesty accuses
me of betraying her,

434
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,625
then it's my duty to pay
for that sin with my life.

435
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
But please.
Don't hurt my professor.

436
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,125
Shut up! What are you do--

437
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,708
Professor!

438
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,833
[SOLDIER 5A]
Let's go.

439
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,875
Close your eyes and don't move,
for your own sake.

440
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,291
If I miss your heart, it will
only prolong your suffering.

441
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,416
Yes.

442
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,500
[RUMIA] I always thought
this would happen.

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,083
That one day she'd
decide to finish the job,

444
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,583
and take my life.

445
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,333
[RUMIA]
Of course.

446
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,583
That's why she came to see me.

447
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,000
To say goodbye.

448
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,041
I was supposed to die that day,

449
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,333
but I was given
three more years,

450
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,000
and created so many
wonderful memories.

451
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,458
[RUMIA]
Don't be sad. Be grateful.

452
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,083
[GLENN]
Keep those eyes shut, okay?

453
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,250
[SOLDIERS grunt]

454
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,458
[SOLDIER 5C]
I'm blind!

455
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,583
[GLENN] Aw, jeez, sword
hilts are a bitch.

456
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,375
[RUMIA]
Professor!

457
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,500
What have you done?

458
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
What? It's just a
Flash a Light spell.

459
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,083
They're blind, not dead.

460
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,500
But why?!
Why did you rescue me?

461
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,958
Well, if I hadn't, white cat
would've yelled my ears off.

462
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,250
[RUMIA]
This isn't funny!

463
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,125
Now they're gonna
convict you, too!

464
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,375
I had to. I promised.

465
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,250
Well, relax we'll
straighten this out.

466
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,125
The queen would never have
ordered your execution,

467
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,833
let alone without a trial!

468
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
There's no way that makes sense.

469
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,708
I don't know what's going on,

470
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,833
but there's a bigger
knot to untie.

471
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,625
We just need to figure
out how to talk to her.

472
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,875
[SOLDIER 5D]
Over there!

473
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,833
You're going to be
sorry, traitors!

474
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,458
Professor, what are
we going to do now?

475
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,500
Now we freaking run!

476
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,250
Great rule of time.
Balance of the scales.

477
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,750
Let the plate of
order tip portside.

478
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,375
[SOLDIER 5D]
Don't let those rebels escape!

479
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,583
[GLENN] Why do I keep
getting crap thrown at me?

480
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,791
People love to make fun
of the unemployed shut-ins,

481
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,208
but dudes don't run
after them with swords!

482
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
--[RUMIA] What's your plan?
--[GLENN] Excellent question!

483
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,791
How can we slip
past the Imperial Guard,

484
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,208
but still get face time
with the Queen?

485
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,416
Wait...

486
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,416
It doesn't have to be
our faces, does it?

487
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,083
I think it's time to grow
this supposed conspiracy.

488
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,291
[CELICA]
Glenn?

489
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,458
Yeah, hey, Celica.

490
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,500
You're sitting with
Her Majesty, right?

491
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,708
I need help, okay?

492
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,875
[CELICA]
I can't help you.

493
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,000
Excuse me? I haven't asked yet!

494
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,541
You don't have to.

495
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,750
Now listen to me carefully.

496
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,250
I can't help you.

497
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,750
And I can't say anything more,
do you understand?

498
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,083
Don't suppose I'm lucky
and you're joking?

499
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,125
[CELICA]
No.

500
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,500
[GLENN]
And our situation?

501
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,250
[CELICA]
I have a rough idea.

502
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,250
So is this some kind of
mutiny by the Imperial Guard?

503
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,125
Or does Her Majesty
actually want Rumia dead?

504
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,791
Let me guess, you can't say.

505
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,791
[CELICA]
No. You're on your own.

506
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,166
[GLENN]
What?

507
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,708
Whatever happens next
is up to you and you alone.

508
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,416
Please, take those
words to heart.

509
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,208
Find some way
to do what's right,

510
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,666
and present yourself
to the queen.

511
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,916
Hey, wait!

512
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,916
Damn it.

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,125
Professor?

514
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,500
[GLENN] What was that,
some kind of riddle?

515
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,208
Present myself to the queen?

516
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,458
She's surrounded by
highly-trained soldiers.

517
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,541
Not to mention Commander Zelos.

518
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,750
Gimme a break.

519
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,458
This is obviously way
above my pay grade.

520
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,000
How do I do this?

521
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,833
It's you?!
