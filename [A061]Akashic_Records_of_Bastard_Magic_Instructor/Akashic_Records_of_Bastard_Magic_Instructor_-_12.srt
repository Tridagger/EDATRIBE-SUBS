00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,958
[SISTINE]
Please don't tell me

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,166
you're with the Researchers
of Divine Wisdom!

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,500
How dare you!

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,791
You worthless little bitch!

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,583
Don't try to lump me
in with that pathetic

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,625
little club of low-life garbage!

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,000
[LEOS]
Anyway.

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,375
I think you're clever
enough to understand.

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,375
You don't have the
right to turn me down.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,125
[SISTINE]
Professor, I...

11
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,166
[KASH]
Hey, did you hear?

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,333
About Sistine?

13
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,541
Accepting Professor
Kleitos's proposal?

14
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,541
Yeah, the ceremony's next week.

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,291
That's awfully soon, isn't it?

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,750
[GIBUL] I thought that
they were already engaged.

17
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,916
So why is everybody
making a fuss now?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,375
Honestly...

19
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm more interested in finding
out why Professor Radars

20
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,416
never showed up for that duel.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,750
[WENDY]
Sistine! Is it true?

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,250
Are you seriously
getting married?

23
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,750
Yes.

24
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,083
What happened to becoming a
magic archaeologist, though?

25
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,750
Isn't that what you wanted?

26
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,750
Oh, that.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,666
That was just a dream.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,416
I have to face reality now.

29
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,125
[WENDY] Are you really just
gonna let your best friend

30
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,833
throw away her future like this?

31
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,458
I don't think...

32
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,291
[LEOS]
Hey, sweetie.

33
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,875
We have wedding
plans to discuss.

34
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,583
Care to come with me?

35
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,666
[SISTINE]
Uh, sure. Let's go.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,791
[LEOS chuckles]
Please excuse us.

37
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,708
[RE=L]
Rumia, can I cut him down?

38
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,250
I don't know how,
but I know he's bad!

39
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,708
[RUMIA]
No!

40
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,791
Rumia?

41
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,416
[RUMIA]
You can't do that.

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,541
Yeah, but...

43
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,125
[RUMIA]
Please, be patient.

44
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,208
I'm sure Professor Radars
will think of something.

45
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,791
But Glenn is gone.

46
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,708
Who knows where he is...
or if he'll be back.

47
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,750
[RUMIA]
I tried to ask Sisti about it

48
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,958
when she came home that night,

49
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,166
but all she would say is
that she's marrying Leos.

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,375
[SISTINE]
Just leave me alone, okay?

51
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,625
Sisti...

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,083
What the hell do you want?

53
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,666
Rumia?

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,333
Professor, if we don't
do something, Sisti will...

55
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,583
[RUMIA] I told Professor
Radars everything I knew--

56
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
everything that had happened.

57
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,583
And then...

58
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,291
I've got this.

59
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,458
[RUMIA] Right after that,
he went to Re=L

60
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,208
and told her that
she should stay with me.

61
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,416
Then he just disappeared.

62
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,125
[RUMIA]
It'll be all right.

63
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,208
He assured me that
he had it all covered,

64
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
so have faith and
just wait for him.

65
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,125
[bells ringing]

66
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,791
[door opens]

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,375
Rumia.

68
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,458
Re=L.

69
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,541
[RUMIA]
Sisti, you look so beautiful!

70
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,833
Pretty.

71
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,666
That frilly outfit,
it'd be hard to fight in,

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,916
but I want it.

73
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,416
[SISTINE]
Don't worry.

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
I'm sure someday
you'll get to wear one

75
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,041
of your own.

76
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,625
Hey, Sisti...

77
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,708
The ceremony's about to start,
so you should go find a seat.

78
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,041
[RUMIA]
Sisti.

79
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,208
[SISTINE crying]

80
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,583
[PRIEST 12A]
Do you, Leos Kleitos,

81
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,666
take this woman to be your wife,

82
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,750
to have and to hold,
from this day forward,

83
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,250
for better or for worse...

84
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,000
[WENDY] There's not a single
person on the groom's side.

85
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
That's not weird to anyone?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,750
[PRIEST 12A]
...to love and to cherish,

87
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,625
until death do you part?

88
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,875
I do.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,125
[LEOS] Now let's talk about
your friend Rumia Tingel's

90
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,666
real name and power.

91
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,083
And that science experiment,
Re=L Rayford.

92
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,625
Do you care enough
to do what it takes

93
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,750
to save them?

94
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,000
I do.

95
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,000
[PRIEST 12A]
You may now kiss the bride.

96
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,333
[GLENN] Get your filthy
peter clamps away from her!

97
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,458
I object to this marriage!

98
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,916
Was waiting for you
to get to that part,

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,916
but you skipped right over it!

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I sure as hell
ain't gonna hold my peace!

101
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,375
Suck smoke!

102
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,583
--Nice!
--Awesome!

103
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,125
[WENDY]
I knew he'd come!

104
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
Re=L, protect Rumia!

105
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,958
I'm on it.

106
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,541
Oh, wow!

107
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,833
[GLENN]
You may now kiss my ass!

108
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:27,333
[GROUP cheering]

109
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
[SISTINE]
Let go of me this instant!

110
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,791
I mean it!
Put me down, right now!

111
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,458
This is no picnic
for me, either.

112
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,791
Y'know, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

113
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,875
There.

114
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,375
[SISTINE]
You've ruined everything!

115
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,916
Take me back,
I have to marry Leos!

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,333
If I don't, then...

117
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,583
Lemme guess.

118
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,791
He was using Rumia
to threaten you?

119
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,541
Yeah, I figured it had
to be something like that.

120
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,916
Then you just left me.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
Where have you been
all this time?

122
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,791
I thought...

123
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,333
I thought you'd...

124
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,333
Sorry.

125
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,625
Got held up.

126
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,166
[GLENN] After Rumia
told me what was going on,

127
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,750
I tried thinking of ways
I could bring you back.

128
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,791
Only thing I knew for sure was
I'd be the one on the losing end

129
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,875
if I didn't take
the fight seriously.

130
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,083
That was it.

131
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
[GLENN] Feels like I'm
back in the old days.

132
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,041
Wonder how well this
little toy of mine'll

133
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,208
work on him.

134
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,875
Well, regardless,

135
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,541
I just need to lure
Leos out to where I have

136
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,083
the upper hand,
and then kick his ass.

137
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,291
[GLENN] So, what do you
think Leos's end game is?

138
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,166
I've been wracking my brain
trying to figure it out,

139
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
but nothing really jumps at me.

140
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,625
Best I could come up with
is that he loves you so much,

141
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,416
he'd do anything,
no matter how bonkers,

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,875
just to make you his.

143
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,375
No, that's not it.

144
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,250
I realized it that night.

145
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,500
That man doesn't love me at all.

146
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,166
He was cold.
A completely different person.

147
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,166
It was scary.

148
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,708

00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,916
I can't deal with these
burnouts and babysit you

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,833
at the same time!

182
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,583
Oh, don't you worry about me!

183
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,208
I can take care of myself,
thank you very much!

184
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,083
Pay heed, great wind... 

185
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,916
[GLENN]
Rush forth, wind!

186
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,416
[GLENN]
Rush and blow through...

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,666
[ADDICT 12B yelling]

188
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,083
[GLENN]
...piercing them!

189
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,333
[GLENN]
White cat!

190
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,833
Don't just stand
there lookin' pretty!

191
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,708
Let's go!

192
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,333
[ADDICTS growling]

193
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,291
[GLENN]
Thunder sprites...

194
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,041
[ADDICT 12A yelps]

195
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,583
[SISTINE gasps]

196
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,625
[GLENN] ...pay heed and strike
with your... electric shock!

197
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,958
[ADDICT 12G choking]

198
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,000
No!

199
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,750
[GLENN]
Hey, get a grip!

200
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,625
This way!

201
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,083
[ADDICTS groaning]

202
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,541
[GLENN]
Damn it!

203
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,750
I can't help but think we're
just being herded by Leos.

204
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,458
Is he trying to
ensnare white cat?

205
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,041
Like they did with her?

206
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,625
[GLENN]
Sara!

207
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,750
[GLENN]
You bastards!

208
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,125
[GLENN]
That's it!

209
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,458
That's what this is about!

210
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,125
That son of a bitch!

211
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,666
I can't let him do it!

212
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,500
If I half-ass it this time,
I'll lose her again.

213
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,750
Remember, you were an
Imperial Court Mage, damn it!

214
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,583
[ADDICTS yelling]

215
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,666
[SISTINE]
I'm.. so scared...

216
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,583
White cat! Behind you!

217
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,708
Son of a... !

218
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,250
[SISTINE gasps]

219
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,875
[GLENN]
White cat, are you all right?

220
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,541
Get away from me!

221
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,000
[GLENN] You're afraid
of me now, aren't you?

222
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,791
[GLENN]
Sorry.

223
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,458
[SISTINE]
Just... give me a minute.

224
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,083
[clapping]

225
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,958
[LEOS]
Bravo. [laughs]

226
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,916
Jolly good show, Glenn.

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,916
Bastard!

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,916
You can drop the Leos disguise!

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
Well done.

230
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,916
I thought you might figure
out my true identity

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,708
sooner or later.

232
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,500
That man isn't Leos.

233
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,416
He's former Imperial
Court Mage Corps

234
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,125
Executioner Number Eleven,
Justice, Jatice Lowfan.

235
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,666
You look surprised.

236
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,000
Didn't think I was
still alive, did ya?

237
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,375
Wait. Where is Leos?

238
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,375
Tell me!

239
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,416
Oh, that pompous little turd?

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
I gave him my drug so
he would do my bidding,

241
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,458
but the weakling had
to go and die on me.

242
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,375
What a drag.

243
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,541
If I'm being honest,

244
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,250
he was pretty much
a dead man already

245
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,000
once I gave him
the Angel's Dust.

246
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,625
That was right after the
Mage Corps Battle ended,

247
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,875
if I'm not mistaken.

248
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,166
[SISTINE]
No...

249
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Glenn?

250
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,791
You have no idea
how long I've waited,

251
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,416
eagerly wanting to
spar with you again.

252
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,791
White cat, get away from here.

253
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,041
Huh?

254
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,500
This isn't a world you
should be any part of.

255
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,625
I agree, now go and
make yourself scarce.

256
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,291
Your role in this
production has reached

257
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,541
its conclusion.

258
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,375
If you attempt to
interfere in my battle

259
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,041
with Glenn... I'll kill you.

260
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:48,958
[SISTINE gasps]

261
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,083
[GLENN]
You heard him.

262
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,166
Go!

263
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,500
Take care now.

264
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,250
[JATICE]
You know, she really does bear

265
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,833
an uncanny resemblance to Sara.

266
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,083
[GLENN]
Shut the hell up!

267
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,958
So you established
contact with Leos,

268
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,208
arranged our duel,

269
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,791
and even planned a damn
wedding, all for what?

270
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,458
To orchestrate this battle
between me and you?

271
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,416
[JATICE chuckles]

272
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,750
That's right.

273
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,333
[GLENN] Well, guess I fell
for your original magic,

274
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,458
with its ability to predict
how events will play out.

275
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,375
So, what's your goal here?

276
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,250
Precisely the same
as it was a year ago.

277
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,166
To exact justice.

278
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
You just use
justice as an excuse,

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,750
so you can go around murdering

280
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,500
all the powerful mages
of the army,

281
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,958
not to mention important
figures in the empire!

282
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,541
[JATICE]
That about sums it up.

283
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,000
Though you left out
the part where you

284
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,250
interrupted me midway through.

285
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,916
But this time, all will
go according to plan

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,666
once I obtain the
Akashic Records!

287
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,583
Akashic Records?

288
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,583
[JATICE]
Yes.

289
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,833
Containing the power
to rule over

290
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,166
the very principles
of this world!

291
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,583
And I will have
it all to myself!

292
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,583
But its power can
only be held by one

293
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
who is absolutely just.

294
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,666
And therefore,
I shall have no right

295
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,208
to posses it until
I've defeated you,

296
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,250
who thwarted my justice.

297
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,208
Even if it were allowed somehow,

298
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,625
I would never abide
such a thing!

299
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,750
This is not my
revenge against you!

300
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,041
No, it is my challenge to you!

301
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,375
I will be a mage of justice,

302
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,791
and as such,
render judgment upon

303
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,916
all the evil in this world!

304
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,916
[GLENN] As if that kinda
justice actually exists!

305
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,000
I should've known it was you
as soon as you pulled out

306
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,833
those tulpas the other night!

307
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,333
[SISTINE] All this time,
I thought that Professor Radars

308
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,500
didn't belong in our world.

309
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,833
So I rejected him.

310
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,041
But, over and over again,

311
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,041
the professor has risked
his life to protect ours.

312
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,583
I've been a fool.

313
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,291
I've pushed him away.

314
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,583
[crying]

315
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
At this point, he's probably
going to leave us

316
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,375
and go somewhere far away,

317
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,958
but what can I do about
it in my condition?

318
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,291
What should I do?

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
[JATICE]
No use hiding from me, Glenn.

320
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,333
I'm just getting
started here!

321
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,791
[GLENN] Great rule of time,
balance of the scales.

322
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,041
Let the plate of
order tip portside.

323
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Silver ice wolf,
race forth, clad in blizzard!

324
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,625
How you like this?

325
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,333
[JATICE laughs]
You're as resourceful as ever.

326
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,583
[JATICE laughs]

327
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,458
Yes, now that's
what I want to see!

328
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,583
Shut up!

329
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,708
I can barely hear
myself killing you!

330
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
[GLENN grunts]

331
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
[JATICE]
Ah, it seems I've won,

332
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
but don't worry, Glenn,

333
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,208
as a sign of merciful
respect I promise

334
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,416
to make your death as quick
and painless as possible.

335
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
Please do give
my regards to Sara

336
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,250
in the other world.

337
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,416
[SISTINE]
I made it in time.

338
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,083
[GLENN]
White cat! You...

339
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,125
You moron!

340
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,500
Why'd you come back?

341
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,041
I told you, you don't
belong in this world!

342
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,208
[SISTINE] That's right, and
you don't belong in it either.

343
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,250
I came for a reason.

344
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,875
To bring you back!

345
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,750
Remember you told me

346
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,583
if I want to protect her

347
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,416
that I'd have to be stronger.

348
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,166
Well, Rumia is
irreplaceable to me,

349
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
but now, so are you!

350
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,583
[SISTINE] When you're scary
and when you're being a loser.

351
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,666
They're both part
of who you are,

352
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,041
and nobody could
ever replace you!

353
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,125
So stay!

354
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,500
Stay by our sides
and keep fighting!

355
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,375
Don't you dare leave us!

356
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,541
[JATICE]
My goodness.

357
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,083
You certainly caught
me off guard there.

358
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:36,541
[SISTINE] Listen, just leave
Professor Radars alone!

359
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,916
[JATICE]
My, you're a pest.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,166
Even your personality
resembles that brat Sara's.

361
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,458
Ain't that a bitch.
I must be losing my edge.

362
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't need this
straightjacket anymore.

363
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Hey, white cat, two-man cell.

364
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,166
I'll be in front,
you take the rear.

365
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Got it?

366
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,583
[GLENN]
Here's the deal.

367
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,750
I will destroy this jerk, even
if it means going down with him,

368
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,166
but no matter what,
I'll make sure you get

369
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,291
outta this in one piece.
So just... 

370
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,916
[SISTINE] Sorry, but I
don't accept those terms.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,083
Now, if you agree that we'll
both make it home safely,

372
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,250
then you've got yourself a deal,
all right, Professor?

373
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,916
I guess I can do that.
Thanks, Sistine.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,166
Well, I'm shocked.

375
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
So you do know my
real name after all.

376
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,125
Today's full of surprises.

377
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Go time!

378
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,625
[JATICE] What a nuisance
you are... Sistine Fibel!

379
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,833
Enough of your meddling!

380
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,583
[SISTINE]
Gather round, storm,

381
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,250
become scattered shells,
and fire through!

382
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,125
I warned you not
to interfere in my fight

383
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,500
with Glenn!

384
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,833
[SISTINE] Wall of great
wind, form twofold,

385
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,166
and protect us!

386
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,833
An immediate alteration?

387
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,416
Wind wolf blowing
down the mountains,

388
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,458
race forth quick and violent,
with us at your... back!

389
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,333
[GLENN yelling]

390
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,791
[JATICE growls]
Curse her!

391
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
I didn't expect the
girl to be so skilled.

392
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,208
A grave miscalculation
on my part.

393
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
O, come!

394
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,291
The manifestation of justice,
sleeping in my depths!

395
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,166
The god who belongs to me!

396
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,791
The god of justice!

397
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,250
Eliminate those villains
who bare their fangs

398
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,541
against my justice!

399
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,583
Lady Justice, Justia!

400
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:38,750
[laughing]

401
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,541
[SISTINE]
Pay heed, great breath!

402
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,291
[JATICE]
What... have you done?!

403
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,500
[JATICE]
Call! Call! Call!

404
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,208
You're done, goocher!

405
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,375
[GLENN yelling]

406
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,125
Let's finish this.

407
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,916
[JATICE laughing]

408
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,625
Don't get cocky, Glenn.

409
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,625
It was two against one,
you needed her.

410
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,750
But what a pity,
she can't help you now.

411
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,416
Mana deficiency.

412
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,333
Guess she's reached her limit.

413
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,208
[JATICE]
Still, in honor of her efforts,

414
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:51,000
I can be a good sport
and admit defeat for today.

415
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,583
[GLENN]
You all right?

416
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,000
[JATICE] You may not
realize it yet, Glenn...

417
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,833
...but this empire
needs to be destroyed.

418
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
Because the awful truth is

419
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
this entire nation was
founded with the evilest

420
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,166
of intentions.

421
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,416
May we meet again soon, Glenn.

422
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,000
Next time, my justice will
surely triumph over you.

423
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,125
[GLENN]
Oh stuff it!

424
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,750
And never show your face
here again, you creep!

425
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,208
[GLENN]
Can you stand?

426
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,958
I don't think
I can move at all.

427
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,166
[GLENN grunts]

428
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,291
[RUMIA]
Sisti!

429
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,166
Thank goodness!

430
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,541
Glenn, you're alive!

431
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,125
We were worried about you!

432
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,416
Professor!

433
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,666
Are you guys hurt?

434
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,666
Do you need help?

435
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,291
You guys look great!

436
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,375
[GROUP chattering]

437
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,791
Hey, you sure you're comfortable
having a degenerate

438
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,500
like me as your teacher?

439
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,250
Don't be stupid.

440
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,875
The fact that I'm
still here by your side

441
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,416
right now should be all
the answer that you need.

442
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,333
Don't you think, Professor?

443
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,250
[GLENN] Sorry I let Jatice
just slip away like that.

444
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,916
No need to apologize.

445
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Especially since I didn't
ask you to help us with that.

446
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,083
That psycho.

447
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,750
Still spewing
all kinds of crazy,

448
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,666
messed-up nonsense...

449
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,000
But there was one thing
that perked my ears.

450
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,041
[JATICE] The Akashic
Records contain the power

451
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,708
to rule over the very
principles of this world!

452
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,833
And I will soon have
it all to myself!

453
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
[GLENN] Seemed like
he was pretty desperate

454
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,291
to get his hands on that.

455
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,541
[ALBERT]
The Akashic Records, huh?

456
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,875
Interesting.

457
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,625
[ELEANOR]
So deep in here.

458
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
Is the door to be opened?

459
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,750
[laughing]

460
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,291
Morning, starshine!

461
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,041
Nice weather we're havin',
eh, Professor Halloween?

462
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,291
It's pronounced "Halley"!

463
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,791
You're doing that on
purpose now, aren't you?

464
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,875
Later, Professor Halitosis.

465
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,041
Halley! Halley Astry!

466
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,208
I'll have you know, sir,

467
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,125
halitosis is a serious
medical condition

468
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,708
with a painful stigma... 

469
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,291
Celica! You're back!

470
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, you're looking
more like a real teacher

471
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,250
these days.

472
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,625
Told ya, didn't I?

473
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,750
Would be a breeze
if I just tried a little.

474
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,958
[CELICA]
Good.

475
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,916
Then I don't have to
worry about you anymore.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,958
I'm thinking of heading
out on an exploration

477
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,791
of the underground labyrinth.

478
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,458
I haven't been able
to shake the feeling

479
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,708
that there's some important work

480
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,083
that I need to be
doing down there.

481
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,291
[GLENN]
I see.

482
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,833
[SISTINE]
Professor!

483
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,791
[SISTINE]
Hurry up, you're gonna be late!

484
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,875
I'm counting on you, Professor!

485
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,750
[GLENN]
You're a real pain in the ass.

486
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,166
[GLENN (CHILD)]
"And the Demon Lord asked,

487
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,791
'What are you?

488
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,083
What drives you to such lengths?

489
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,250
How are you capable of all this?

490
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,458
I can't fathom why you'd risk,

491
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,375
and endure, so much.'

492
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,041
Without hesitation
the mage answered,

493
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,833
[GLENN]
'That's simple, Demon Lord.

494
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,416
There are things
I wish to protect.

495
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,083
Things I must protect.

496
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,916
It is this conviction, and
understanding of my duties,

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,958
that causes infinite
power to spring

498
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,916
from my depths.

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And lets me rise again.'" 

500
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
Yep, I rise again.

501
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,958
[GLENN]
Hello, kiddoes.

502
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,500
Settle in.

503
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,583
'Cause class is in session!

Yes, sir!
