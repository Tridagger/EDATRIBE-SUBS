1
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,666
Henrietta?

2
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,666
Would you mind if...
Can I watch as we leave.

3
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,875
Better hurry, We depart
in five minutes... Come on.

4
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:05,166
We should arrive in
Sicily by in the morning.

5
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,666
Um, Jose?

6
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,291
What is it?

7
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,791
I don't understand
why we're going away

8
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,750
like this on such
short notice?

9
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,958
You haven't had a
break in a long time.

10
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,333
We all need time away
from work now and again.

11
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,416
but This is the first time
I've gone away on a vacation

12
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,916
that wasn't planned
well in advance.

13
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm sure the chief just
wanted to be on the safe side.

14
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,000
Why, has
something happened?

15
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,291
Elsa has been murdered.

16
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,250
She was murdered...

17
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,750
Her body was discovered
early yesterday.

18
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,333
She and Lauro were attacked
outside a small town.

19
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,000
They haven't found
who did it yet,

20
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,625
but it's just a
matter of time.

21
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,291
What about Lauro?

22
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,916
He was killed, too.

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,541
Lauro's dead-

24
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,041
Henrietta...

25
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,208
It's good...

26
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,541
At least Elsa and
Lauro are together...

27
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,166
That way she
won't be lonely.

28
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,583
They were found in a park,
together, yesterday morning.

29
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,208
Damn, that's
disgusting.

30
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,416
Looks like they were probably
murdered late last night.

31
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,541
The male runs an
import firm in Rome,

32
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,166
the female's
his daughter.

33
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,458
It doesn't appear to
be motivated by theft,

34
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,958
his wallet's
full of cash.

35
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,958
It's odd... Why would the
killer leave his gun behind?

36
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,333
Good question,

37
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,000
you don't see expensive
pistols like that everyday.

38
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,333
Inspector Baracchi!

39
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,833
What'cha
got?!

40
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,000
There's a couple
of agents here

41
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,833
from Intelligence
to investigate.

42
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,833
Intelligence Agents?

43
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,708
Well, well... This is
getting better every minute.

44
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,416
Who's the officer
in charge here?

45
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,791
I'm Inspector Baracchi... 
So tell me, What did we do

46
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,083
to get Intelligence
all the way out here?

47
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,791
We have reason to believe
this may be related

48
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,708
to an ongoing
investigation.

49
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,500
We'll take over all
contingencies from here.

50
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,333
You'll find all the necessary
paperwork's been handled.

51
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,541
Fine- it's
all yours.

52
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,833
Don't you think it's odd for
them to show up like that?

53
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,500
How would Intelligence
even know find out?

54
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,125
A little bird?

55
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,083
If they want to clean
up the mess, fine by me.

56
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,583
Although, they do strike
me as a little odd.

57
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,541
Those guys seem way too
organized to be regular Intel.

58
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,291
But, they got the papers
signed by the right people.

59
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,333
Let's just let
sleeping dogs lie.

60
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,916
Is that one
of our cyborgs?

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,166
Yes sir, It's
definitely Elsa.

62
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,833
Shot in
the head...

63
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,791
execution-style.

64
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,333
Were they working out
on an assignment...

65
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:07,541
or were they just in the
wrong place at the wrong time?

66
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,916
The log says they went
out for personal reasons.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,791
At this time, there's no
way of knowing who did it.

68
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,208
If they were hit because
of their affiliation

69
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,625
with the agency, it could
be R.F. or Southern Mafia.

70
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,541
Or, another agency.

71
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,000
I want the killers
found immediately.

72
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,083
Yes, sir.

73
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,250
What about the press?

74
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,916
Don't worry, it
won't get covered.

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,583
Ferro's already taken
care of the media.

76
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,666
Get the bodies out of here

77
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,708
as soon as the
evidence is gathered.

78
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,333
I have to get back and
report this to the director.

79
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,458
Understood.

80
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,333
You needed to see me?

81
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,208
Ahh.

82
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,958
Have you heard about what
happened this morning?

83
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,500
I heard something
about a puppet

84
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,666
from Section 2
being attacked.

85
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,041
One of our men was
killed as well...

86
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,833
They still don't know
who's responsible.

87
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,916
That's what happens when you
go out for a Sunday drive.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,291
I want you to look
into the situation.

89
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,458
This is might be a good chance
to put pressure on Section 2.

90
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,875
Section 1 will hold
it's own investigation.

91
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,166
Uh... So, What do
you want me to do?

92
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,041
I don't like the
idea of cyborgs

93
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,625
running around
killing people.

94
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:20,833
They say its the way of
the future, I disagree.

95
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,625
Your report could recommend
the termination of Section 2.

96
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,083
I understand.

97
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,833
I want you to check
out these cyborgs...

98
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,708
Find out what they're
really up to.

99
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:40,208
Yes...?
Yes, sir.

100
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,666
Yeah... Right.

101
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,375
Section One's investigating?

102
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,583
No, I understand. I'll
cooperate fully. Of course.

103
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,458
They're here now.

104
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:14,000
This is Elenora Gabrielli,
I'm Pietro Fermi.

105
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,833
I've been expecting you.

106
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,750
Good to meet you.

107
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,250
And who's this?

108
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,458
Rico.
My cyborg.

109
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,208
Rico...? Isn't that
a boy's name?

110
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,250
Each cyborg is named
by her Handler.

111
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,708
We can give them
whatever name we want.

112
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,875
She have a last name?

113
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,250
No.

114
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,208
So, what exactly have
you guys come up with

115
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,541
as far as
possible suspects.

116
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,000
We're still
running it down...

117
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,625
But, in our
particular business

118
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,333
we tend to have
enemies everywhere.

119
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,333
And you insist on
having cyborgs

120
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,625
do all the
killing for you?

121
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,541
They're more efficient killers
than any human I've known.

122
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:54,208
They don't think, or feel,
they just do. They just kill.

123
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,833
You make it sound as if
these cyborgs you developed

124
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,000
were the perfect
killing machines.

125
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,666
Effective but not perfect.
Their eyes are the weak spots.

126
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,041
Hit them in the brain and
they die like anyone.

127
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,500
But that's the
rare instance.

128
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,958
The problem with
what you see here

129
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,000
is that no fratello has been
eliminated like this one.

130
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,791
Fratello...?
Ah, like siblings.

131
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,625
So, are you saying
these cyborgs

132
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,958
just follow the
orders they're given?

133
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,750
They're never free to
exercise their own judgment

134
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,000
when they go out
on a mission?

135
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,416
Every Handler is free to train
his cyborg as he sees fit

136
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,458
but strict discipline and
conditioning are used to ensure

137
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,041
that every one of them
does their job right.

138
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,375
But they do think
for themselves,

139
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,458
especially when their
Handler is in danger.

140
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,500
They would die
protecting him.

141
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,875
Interesting...

142
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:47,416
So they're not
just puppets.

143
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,791
Was there anything unusual
or out of the ordinary

144
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,666
that happened during any
of their recent missions?

145
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,666
Nothing was
reported.

146
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,500
Okay, what about
them as a team?

147
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,375
Did they work
well together?

148
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,458
They were
very effective.

149
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:37,750
Rico, put
the gun away.

150
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,875
Fermi... I understand your
curiosity about the cyborgs

151
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,416
but if you weren't
with the Agency,

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,708
you'd be dead
right now.

153
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,083
So, now you know what
makes the cyborgs tick.

154
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,583
Well then... Elsa died but
failed to protect her Handler.

155
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,833
It appears Elsa fired two
rounds at the assailant.

156
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,666
Have you found
the slugs?

157
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,166
Our people are combing
the entire area.

158
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,416
If she
hit anyone,

159
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,875
there could be traces of
blood we can analyze...

160
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,750
You know, Triela got
another stuffed bear

161
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,250
for her collection
the other day.

162
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,041
Now she has nine
bears altogether.

163
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,291
She was
so excited,

164
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,833
she stayed up all night
deciding a name for it.

165
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,500
Henrietta, you could have
any those things, too.

166
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,791
No... I'm happy
to do my job well

167
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,916
and make you proud of me...
That's enough for me.

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,416
You know, it's okay to want
something for yourself.

169
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,708
Here, that reminds me I've got
something I want you to have.

170
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,791
For all your hard work.

171
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,500
Open it now?

172
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,541
Of course.

173
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,041
Wow... you're sure
careful with it.

174
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,583
I want to save the box, the
wrapping paper and everything.

175
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,875
Thank you.

176
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,791
Now you can take pictures of
your friends or teddy bears...

177
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,333
...or anything you
want to remember.

178
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,375
I'll... take really
good care of it.

179
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:41,375
I should hold
your gun for now.

180
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
I want you to show them
around the cyborg ward.

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,041
So, this is kinda
like a dormitory, huh?

182
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,416
Uh-huh.

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,916
Rico, I wanted to
ask you something...

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,166
What?

185
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,375
Well... does it make you
sad that Elsa's dead.

186
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,166
It has nothing
to do with me,

187
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,625
We never even talked.

188
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,333
But, she was a
cyborg just like you.

189
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
It makes no
difference to me.

190
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,000
This was
Elsa's room.

191
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,666
It's empty...

192
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:30,541
Most of us share rooms, but
Elsa liked to live alone.

193
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,791
This place
is gloomy,

194
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,708
I hope all the rooms
aren't this depressing.

195
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,000
Henrietta and Triela
have lots of stuff

196
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,958
decorating
their rooms.

197
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,333
I think their Handlers give
them lots of presents...

198
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,250
But, I don't know
that for sure.

199
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,416
Was there anyone here
that Elsa confided in?

200
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,375
Um, maybe you should
ask Triela about that.

201
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,708
Triela?

202
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,125
Rico, you
back already.

203
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:07,833
Can we
come in?

204
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,291
Who are you?

205
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:18,125
Books, stuffed animals-
they're like regular kids.

206
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,125
This is Ms. Gabrielli and
Mr. Fermi from Section 1.

207
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,166
They want to talk
to you about Elsa.

208
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,083
Claes where
are you?.

209
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,541
You don't
need me here.

210
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,500
Why don't you tell me
what Elsa was like.

211
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,000
Just like most of the
girls around here,

212
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,541
she was totally infatuated
with her Handler

213
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,916
Does that go
for you, too?

214
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,125
Oh... I wouldn't
say that...

215
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,083
But, I'm I certainly
am devoted to him.

216
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,833
The Conditioning?

217
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,833
Conditioning and devotion
are two different things.

218
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,875
One comes from hard,
constant, training,

219
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,166
the other one comes
from the heart.

220
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
Sounds like it has a lot
less to do with discipline

221
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,291
or loyalty and a lot
more to do with love.

222
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,250
That's how
Elsa was.

223
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,166
How does it make
you feel to know

224
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,333
that one of your peers
has been murdered?

225
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:15,750
Well I feel... You see Elsa
pretty much kept to herself.

226
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,666
And, judging by the way she
acted most of the time...

227
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,708
I figure, she was
probably more than happy

228
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,333
to go to her death
protecting Lauro.

229
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,583
All right, then.

230
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,833
Thank you very much for
talking with us, Triela.

231
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,291
Next time you come

232
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,666
could you bring me a teddy
bear or some flowers?

233
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,291
What do you make of the
Section 1 investigator?

234
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,375
He appeared to me to
be a very capable man.

235
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,250
Well then.

236
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,708
Take this... it's the
ballistics report

237
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,291
on the bullets that killed
Lauro and Elsa. Look over it.

238
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,958
This is bad.

239
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,666
This could turn out to
be a problem for us.

240
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,791
Yeah I know, the
Director of Section 1

241
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,416
would never keep
this quiet.

242
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,583
He may become an obstacle
to our cybernetic testing.

243
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,541
Any ideas?

244
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,500
Well, I suppose we could try
to bury the ballistics report

245
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,208
and then blame it on some
simple clerical error;

246
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,541
that might take the heat
off for a little while.

247
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,916
I think they'd buy that,

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,541
and It wouldn't be a
mistake they could pin on us.

249
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,625
Elsa De Sica fought
and died bravely

250
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,541
trying to protect
her Handler.

251
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,500
Right.

252
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,208
And I want you to send
Jose and his cyborg away...

253
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,875
and I don't want to
see them back here

254
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,208
until this business
with Elsa cools off.

255
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,916
You're always trying to
protect Jose, you know that?

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Guys like Jose have to be
protected by people like us.

257
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,250
We have to protect him from
that which is most deadly,

258
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,833
the truth.

259
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,333
Jose!

260
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,625
Jean.

261
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,333
I find it difficult
to believe

262
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,000
Elsa could be brought
down so easily.

263
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,208
Whoever it
did this,

264
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,000
they knew exactly how
to both of them out.

265
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:26,125
They shot her in the eye
and Lauro in the head.

266
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,500
Well, They were
good at their job.

267
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,291
That's right...

268
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,708
So, the Republican
Faction was responsible?

269
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Yes, there's no
doubt about that.

270
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,333
Blood samples found
at the murder scene

271
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,041
match those of two
known R.F. operatives.

272
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,291
Their activities have been
known to target people

273
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,500
within various
government agencies.

274
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,000
I guess the cyborgs still
need a little more work.

275
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,833
I guess this concludes
Section One's investigation

276
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
into this matter.

277
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,791
We still don't know
how the R.F. was able

278
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,833
to track Lauro's team.

279
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,333
But, they obviously
marked them

280
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,500
and successfully terminated
them that night.

281
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,208
Elsa de Sica fought
and died bravely

282
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,666
trying to protect
her handler.

283
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,125
We'll, be working on impact
resistant optics right away.

284
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,000
So, she was happy to die
for her handler, huh...

285
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,333
Hey, Rico... Would
you be happy to die

286
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,291
if doing so meant that
Jean wouldn't have to?

287
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,791
I don't think I really
want to die... But-

288
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,208
The cyborgs serve
their Handlers.

289
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,541
For them there is
no other option.

290
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,375
Rico?

291
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,250
If Jean, my Handler, says
so then it must be true.

292
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,583
What? Sicily? Why
would they go there?

293
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,583
How should
I know?

294
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,875
They finished
their mission,

295
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,916
came back to headquarters
for a couple of days

296
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and then left for a
vacation in Sicily.

297
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,125
Oh and just for
your information,

298
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,291
you know this
phone line

299
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,125
has probably been
tapped by the Agency.

300
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,375
So? We're not doing
anything wrong.

301
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,833
Okay,
thanks.

302
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,375
Um, Pietro? Did You get the
report done for the Director?

303
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,791
Of course.

304
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,333
Was he okay with it?

305
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,458
Yeah, But... we have a couple
of things left to check out.

306
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,666
Let's go.

307
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,875
Henrietta-

308
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,208
Yes, Jose?

309
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:36,458
Good morning.

310
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,416
Oh, good morning.

311
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,375
Take a look outside.

312
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,666
It's beautiful!

313
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
Welcome to Sicily...
