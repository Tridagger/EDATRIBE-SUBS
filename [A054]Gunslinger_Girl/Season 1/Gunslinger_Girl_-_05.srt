1
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,833
[Jean] Good to see you
again Captain Raballo.

2
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,833
Jean... What could
you possibly want

3
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,541
with an old
retiree like me?

4
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,291
Well, recently I got
a new job...

5
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,541
And we're looking
for good instructors.

6
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,666
You know after you
left the unit...

7
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,625
I heard some
interesting things.

8
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,291
Can I assume you're involved
with that shady organization?

9
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a line of work that
both us are well suited for.

10
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:34,125
You mean, revenge at all
costs. Isn't that how it goes?

11
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,916
Wouldn't you like to return
to the Military Police?

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,541
After all, that
job was your life.

13
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,208
We could arrange for
your re-enlistment.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,708
[Raballo] So is she
one of them?

15
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,125
Not yet.
That is up to you.

16
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,458
Captain...?

17
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,958
Is she the one
you'll choose?

18
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,416
She wears glasses.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,833
That's not a problem.

20
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,708
Eyesight is part of our
correction procedures as well.

21
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,125
When you make your
final decision,

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,583
we'll hand her over in
tip-top combat form.

23
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,500
You speak as if... the
agency can do anything.

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,125
Yes... If it means you
will join our fight,

25
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,416
then we can...
So, will you choose her?

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
[Raballo] I guess
she's as good as any.

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,583
[Jean]
Great.

28
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,250
I think you made
the right choice.

29
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,916
Now your first job as her
Handler is to give her a name.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,250
Wait, do I have to
give her a girl's name?

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,416
No, it doesn't need
to be a girl's name...

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,250
You're free to name her
whatever you'd like.

33
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,916
I suppose that would make
the job more impersonal.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,750
[Jean] Do whatever you
need to feel comfortable.

35
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,625
It's about
time you hit one.

36
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,125
Don't bother
leaving this range

37
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,750
until you can consistently hit
that target from 20 yards.

38
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,583
I'm heading back.

39
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,375
Keep shooting, Claes.

40
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,250
Captain Raballo.

41
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,583
Yeah?

42
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,166
I have yet to see Claes
around the grounds today.

43
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,958
Me neither.
Her gunplay needs work

44
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,291
so I told her to keep
practicing yesterday.

45
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,083
I haven't
seen her since.

46
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,916
[Jean] What do
you mean?

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,416
I haven't seen her means
I haven't seen her.

48
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,208
She didn't even bother
giving me a final report.

49
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
I see.

50
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,916
It takes time for our
girls to grow accustomed

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,416
to their new implants.
Some longer than others...

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,125
Remember how long it took
you to learn to walk again

53
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,333
after your new leg.

54
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,916
You have be
patient with them.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,375
Learning to move freely should
come before firearms training.

56
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,750
A musical instrument
may help out.

57
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,791
Or even writing in
longhand may be effective.

58
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,500
I don't remember any of this
being in my job description.

59
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,416
[Jean] Check the
shooting range.

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,208
I'll bet you
she's still there.

61
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,833
What is she...?

62
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,500
[Jean] Because you
ordered her to be there.

63
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,208
Hello Claes.

64
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,708
Raballo...

65
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,958
I'm sorry sir... I still can't
hit the target every time.

66
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,750
Idiot... How can you expect
to get better at anything

67
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,416
when you're outside in
the rain all night?

68
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,791
Let's go.

69
00:06:53,708 --> 00:07:00,041
Okay, Claes... We gotta change
up your training somehow.

70
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,916
Come in.

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,333
[Claes]
Raballo?

72
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,916
What is
it, Claes?

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Did you sneak
out of your room?

74
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,958
Jean woke me up. He said I
needed to come talk to you.

75
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,666
He did...? He didn't tell
me... Well, have a seat.

76
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,958
You sure do
have a lot...

77
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,125
A lot of what?

78
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,625
Books.

79
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,583
Wait until the rest of
my stuff arrives.

80
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:36,083
You're looking at only
half my collection.

81
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,583
Filling these bookcases
will be quite the chore.

82
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,833
I'll help you fill
them if you want.

83
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,666
You should mind
your own business.

84
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,958
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,250
We may not look it on
the outside, but...

86
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,541
people like us,
in our profession

87
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,083
tend to read
books all the time.

88
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,458
I've found that uneducated
people make poor soldiers.

89
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,250
What kind of
books do you read?

90
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,916
Well, let's
take a look.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,958
Right now I'm reading a book
on how to grow vegetables.

92
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,583
I believe it doesn't matter
what subjects you read,

93
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,791
it's the act of exercising
your mind that counts.

94
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
What kind of
books do you read?

95
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:21,458
They gave me a few textbooks,
but I haven't opened them yet.

96
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,291
I'll read everything
I can get my hands on...

97
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,083
If that's what it takes
to make a good soldier.

98
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,333
That's good.

99
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,125
I'm suspending your firearms
practice for a while.

100
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,291
We're going out
tomorrow morning.

101
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,583
[Claes] It's
not a holiday.

102
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,041
You sure
it's okay?

103
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,125
Yes.

104
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,166
I consider this
training as well...

105
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,916
I put the bait
on for you.

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,625
Now just cast the line
underhanded like I showed you.

107
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,833
All right.

108
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,250
So what do I do now?

109
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,875
Now, you just sit and
wait for the fish.

110
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,666
Are you bored?

111
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,958
Huh?

112
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,125
I used to
always get bored

113
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,375
whenever I went fishing
with my old man.

114
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,583
At the time though...

115
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,791
I didn't understand
the joys of just sitting

116
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,458
and watching the
day pass you by.

117
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,458
I'm not bored. I'm
actually enjoying this.

118
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,416
You know this is so
different than anything

119
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,916
else I've
experienced so far...

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,375
I think I like
being a fisherman.

121
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,583
Understand that I
don't care about you...

122
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,041
All you are to me is
a job, nothing more.

123
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,583
The only thing
I care about...

124
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,875
Is returning to
the Military Police.

125
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,291
Mind if I ask you
about your leg?

126
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,291
A pistol accidentally
discharged into my leg

127
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,208
during my MP days.

128
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,125
Three years at the agency
and they'll get me back in.

129
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,708
That was Jean's
promise to me.

130
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,250
If that's the case,

131
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,875
you can count on me to act as
your legs from now on, sir.

132
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,208
Knock it off!

133
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,333
Did you not hear what I
just got finished saying?

134
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,750
Look! You've got a
bite! Pull it in!

135
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,083
[Claes] We visited countless
other lakes after that day...

136
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:41,458
Lombardy, Veneto, and
Piemonte, just to name a few.

137
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,750
At the agency, we
rarely ever talked.

138
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,416
We got our work done and
stayed true to our roles

139
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,125
as teacher and student,
but for some reason,

140
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:54,208
we would always talk at the
lake as if we were family.

141
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,416
It was our own
unspoken rule.

142
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,416
[Raballo] Alright... That was
the last train for the night...

143
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,916
Now Claes.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,041
We're gonna do a little on the
job training this evening.

145
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,916
So only take them out
if it's in self-defense.

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
If you can't handle
these subway punks,

147
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,625
then you can forget
about the real thing.

148
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,708
This should be a walk in
the park for you, Claes.

149
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,458
I'll do my best.

150
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,208
Alfonso... Claes
has made contact...

151
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,416
Keep the police off
our backs for a while.

152
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,208
[Alfonso]
Roger that.

153
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,708
Raballo.

154
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,083
Alfonso. Bring the garbage
truck around to our position.

155
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,208
[Claes]
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,625
You... idiot.

157
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,083
Knowing when to
shoot your weapon

158
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,041
is more important than
shooting itself... Dammit.

159
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,583
Don't you
understand...?

160
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,375
It's too late once you're
within a knife's range.

161
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,000
Next time don't
hesitate to shoot.

162
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,166
Yes.

163
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,833
Jose... You need to teach your
girl a little consistency.

164
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,708
Easier said than done...

165
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
So I should increase
her conditioning?

166
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,125
No Jose. That's
not what I meant.

167
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,958
You trying to
kill yourself?!

168
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,708
Raballo! Stop it!

169
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,291
Shut up!

170
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,166
What's she doing here

171
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,750
if she can't even
handle a gun correctly?

172
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,375
Did you assume it
wouldn't jam...

173
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,333
just because it's
a modern gun?

174
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,250
This blasé attitude is only
going to get someone killed

175
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,666
Raballo! Behind you!

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,541
Henrietta!

177
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
Stand down!

178
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,625
Captain...
You're not at fault.

179
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:47,166
It seems to me that Jose isn't
fully devoted to her training.

180
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,083
But the problem lies within
their brainwashing procedures.

181
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,083
I now see that the system
could use some improvement.

182
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,583
Do you feel it necessary
to recondition these girls?

183
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,208
I have no doubt Jose
will object to it, but...

184
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,583
both of these girls would
benefit from the brainwashing

185
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,583
for safety
purposes alone.

186
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
But if you went
through with that,

187
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,833
you'd be decreasing
their life span.

188
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:13,416
It may seem tragic to you, but
it comes with the territory.

189
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,041
Besides, this doesn't
concern you anyway.

190
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,708
Once the agency
lays the groundwork,

191
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,333
you'll be back with
the Military Police.

192
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,666
In the meantime,

193
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,666
take some R&amp;R for yourself
while she's recovering.

194
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,333
Jose.

195
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,750
I'm sorry for what happened,
Raballo. It was all my fault.

196
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,416
I just spoke with Jean.
You're not gonna allow her

197
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,416
to be reconditioned
again, are you?

198
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,083
[Jose] Of course not. I'm
gonna fight it all the way.

199
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,916
I see.

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,166
I can't figure out a way
to help them distinguish

201
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,666
between
friend and foe

202
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,791
without redoing the
conditioning process...

203
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,916
Fighting violence with
violence is all I know.

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,625
It's what my entire
career is based on.

205
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:10,833
[Raballo] 'Good soldiers read
books' Huh? What a load...

206
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,750
Don't tell Jean
I was, uh...

207
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,000
complaining like
this, you know.

208
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,541
[Agent B] So, what's
with the MP captain?

209
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,833
[Alfonso] He doesn't know
what to do with himself

210
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
and this
free time.

211
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,791
[Agent C] I think he
might have reached

212
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,625
his breaking point already.

213
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,416
No surprises there...

214
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,583
considering the
business we're in.

215
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,750
[Agent B] No need to
force him into continuing.

216
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,666
[Claes]
Raballo!

217
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,416
Hello, Claes.
It's been awhile...

218
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,416
Did you check
out today?

219
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,041
I managed to get out
of there a day early...

220
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,500
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

221
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,958
I heard a rumor that you're
quitting the agency...

222
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,750
Henrietta told
me all about it

223
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
when she came to
visit me the other day.

224
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,583
Oh, so you and
Henrietta made up?

225
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,083
What?

226
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,375
Nothing...
Don't worry about me...

227
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,791
I'm just gonna
relax here

228
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,708
until you're officially
released tomorrow...

229
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,833
I may go fishing, or finish
reading a book I started.

230
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,291
[Raballo] I don't know...
Oh, I almost forgot.

231
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,291
I have some things I
wanted to give you...

232
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,041
First, my room key.

233
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,916
From now on, you can read my
books whenever you want.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,041
There should be more than
enough for you to enjoy.

235
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,750
Also, I wanted you to have
your old glasses back.

236
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,791
Why'd you
keep these?

237
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,916
I've tried to turn you
into a one man army,

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,166
a killing
machine...

239
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,958
but lately, I've felt
guilty as hell doing it.

240
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,916
Always remember
to think clearly

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,375
before pulling the trigger...

242
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,916
No matter what the agency
orders you to do...

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,333
you mustn't use your killing
abilities outside of work.

244
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,458
I want you to be
the gentle Claes

245
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,041
whenever you put
those glasses on.

246
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,291
Now don't think of
this as an order...

247
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,375
It's a heart to heart promise.

248
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,375
Understand?

249
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,958
I do.

250
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,458
Hello?
Roberto Dandini.

251
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,083
Hey there- Good to
hear from you.

252
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:38,666
Yes, we looked into
your proposal...

253
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,333
Just me and the
editor know about it...

254
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,041
Yeah, we're game.

255
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,458
I've been
watching my back

256
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,791
and no one has followed me
for the past four days...

257
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,541
Now I expect absolute
secrecy on your end.

258
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,541
You sound paranoid... No,
don't even worry about that.

259
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,291
It's all taken
care of... So then.

260
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,250
What's your big story?

261
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
Today?
Like right now?

262
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,583
Where do you want to
meet? Okay. Got it.

263
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,916
Raballo sure is
taking his time.

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,583
Yeah.

265
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,041
Hi, Claes.

266
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,375
[Claes] Jean?

267
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,083
Captain Raballo...

268
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,875
...is dead.

269
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,250
He was in a
hit-and-run accident

270
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,458
two days ago
outside of Rome.

271
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,958
He died instantly.

272
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,208
[Triela] Jean!

273
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,708
You can't just come out
and tell her like that!

274
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,000
[Jean] You shut
your mouth.

275
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,250
[Triela]
Claes! Say something!

276
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,166
Take her.

277
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,875
Claes!!

278
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,500
[Jean] Unfortunately, this
girl is no longer of use to us.

279
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:58,291
An established Handler is
always difficult to replace.

280
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,833
[Doctor A]
I have a proposal.

281
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:00,833
Yes?

282
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,041
There is something...

283
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
We've been looking
forward to this testing

284
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,458
for quite some time...

285
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,875
If Claes would
be kind enough...

286
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
...to assist us.

287
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,750
Preparations complete.

288
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,833
See you...
I'll be back soon.

289
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,000
Bye.

290
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,500
Have fun.

291
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,083
I don't participate in
operations like everyone else.

292
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:40,375
In fact, I'm not even allowed
to step outside the agency.

293
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,458
For as long as
my memory allows,

294
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,666
this is the only way
of life I've known.

295
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,083
Go ahead and
change clothes.

296
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,916
You can put your
things over there.

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,583
[Doctor A]
Claes, Are you ready?

298
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,083
I want to test
your shoulder joints,

299
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,166
so pull as
hard as you can.

300
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,125
Okay.

301
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
Alright.
Let's begin.

302
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,583
How's her muscle
output looking?

303
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,666
Abdominal and tricep
muscles still not at maximum.

304
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,875
Now Claes... I said to
pull as hard as you can.

305
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,291
Give it some more
effort! Harder!

306
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,000
Harder! Harder!
I need more!

307
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,333
Her right shoulder
joint just gave out.

308
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,416
Hey, Claes.
Take a break.

309
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,750
We'll give you
painkillers in a moment...

310
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,750
Send her out for repairs.

311
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,125
Right.

312
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,416
Compare next week's muscle
model with today's data.

313
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,041
As I continue this
testing day after day,

314
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,625
something always
comes to mind.

315
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,958
[Claes] Shall we?

316
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:49,791
Huh?

317
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,875
So what are
we doing today?

318
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,958
We are going to plant
a vegetable garden.

319
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,041
Jean actually gave me
permission when I asked him.

320
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,625
Why a
vegetable garden?

321
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,125
I'm not really sure. It
just seemed like a good idea.

322
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:09,750
Claes.

323
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,125
Huh?

324
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,625
Don't you ever get lonely?

325
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,166
What do you mean?

326
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,291
Just you always having to stay
at the agency by yourself...

327
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,833
I'm pretty sure I
would die of loneliness

328
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,208
if I didn't
have Jose here.

329
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,208
You know what Henrietta?

330
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,666
Huh?

331
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,041
If I'm lonely one evening,
I'll decide that for myself.

332
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,958
Cooking food, drawing
pictures and playing music

333
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:40,416
is all fun, and I have as
many books to read as I want.

334
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,916
But of all the things I enjoy
the most, it's the idle time.

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,166
Just sitting outside
and watching the day

336
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,916
pass into night.

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,166
I think my father taught
me that a long time ago,

338
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,583
or was it someone else?
I get that feeling a lot.
