1
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,583
Hey Patricia...
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,875
They said something happened...
during a training exercise.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,791
I heard you got hurt...
But you don't look so bad!

4
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,083
This happens all
the time... Really.

5
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,875
Nothing to worry about.

6
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,958
Oh, good.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,958
They let you go because your
eyesight started getting worse?

8
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,125
It's a dog-eat-dog
line of work. Besides...

9
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,708
The squad captain was always

10
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,166
looking for a way
to get rid of me.

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,625
Too bad...

12
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,250
But it's not like you
have to quit working

13
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,333
on the force
altogether, do you?

14
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:15,041
I'm sure they'd let you do some
of the more routine police work.

15
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,041
No way...

16
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,916
Go push pencils behind a desk
or patrol the beat out here?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,583
I think I'll pass. I hate that.

18
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,750
Come on... It's no big deal.

19
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,208
A guy like me has
plenty of options open.

20
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,250
There's the army
airborne division...

21
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,250
or there's the navy
command unit...

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,791
Hell, there's even
the military police.

23
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,875
If were up to me,
I'd be fine with you

24
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:47,166
just being a regular
police officer, Marco.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,416
You would?

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,166
I thought you wanted me
to follow my dreams...

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,791
Just being a regular cop

28
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,208
isn't even close to
what I want for me.

29
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,875
I'm the kind of person
who needs to see

30
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,833
how far I can push myself.

31
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:03,333
That's not it... It's just...
I like the gentle Marco better.

32
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,958
Don't worry about a thing...

33
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,333
I'll find a new job before
you can blink an eye.

34
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,916
I have another task for you.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,833
Ask the president
to lay the groundwork

36
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,208
for lifetime senatorship.

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,250
He's a popular guy.
He can pull it off.

38
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,791
It looks like this reform
is gonna pass through easily.

39
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,916
I'll make sure of that...
This nation is ailing.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,416
What it needs is a good
dose of antibiotics.

41
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,750
Are you all right, sir?

42
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

43
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,500
Tell me you got a shot of that.

44
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,750
Of course.

45
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,791
I want it on the network
news tonight...

46
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,791
And, put some spin on it...

47
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,166
Appeal to people's good nature.

48
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,041
Tell me...

49
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,375
Have they identified
the person responsible?

50
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,083
Just one in a string of
nameless separatists...

51
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,791
Those FRF bastards
won't stop until they've

52
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,333
laid waste to the very
foundations of Italy...

53
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,458
Is that official?

54
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,166
Are we calling this
an act of the FRF?

55
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,500
Why not?

56
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,666
They're radical and violent

57
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
and all the people out
there hate them...

58
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,041
They've earned blame.

59
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,125
Since most people
feel this way...

60
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,958
I would suppose
that's the new truth.

61
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,583
What have they
been up to, lately?

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,125
We know this much.

63
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,041
Sources say the Milan Group
is clashing behind closed doors.

64
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:31,291
Take the offensive...
Spread some false information...

65
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,666
Arrest any sympathizers
hiding in the media.

66
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,041
Understood.

67
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,875
How I see the world
is truth to me.

68
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,250
And that truth is enough.

69
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,875
Jose!

70
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,875
Come on down...

71
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't have to watch with
the binoculars all the time.

72
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,625
Right! I'll be down in a sec!

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,458
Guess it's been about
a month since Milan...

74
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,916
Looks like Angelica's
gonna be just fine.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,958
I don't know, man...

76
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,083
I just know she's
gonna... screw up again.

77
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,958
Come on... Don't say that.

78
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,791
She's on her way out, Jose.

79
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,666
It's not like it used to be.

80
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,458
The girl I knew was never
that good with a gun.

81
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,500
The Angelica I
adored is long gone.

82
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,708
The little girl
that I know today...

83
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,708
Experience tells me
that she'll be dead soon.

84
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,125
Hey...! What's going
on down there?

85
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm so sorry, Marco!

86
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,250
If you want to blame
someone, blame me!

87
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,958
I'm the one who
wasn't concentrating.

88
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,875
Angelica... that's
enough for today, alright...?

89
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,541
You can go back to the dorm now.

90
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,958
Right.

91
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,583
It was all meaningless...

92
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,666
Triela...

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,291
Please don't touch me!

94
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:45,375
I... I just want to
be alone for awhile.

95
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,083
What is it Amadeo?
Watcha lookin' at?

96
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,541
It looks like the
princess is feeling down.

97
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,291
So that's what a child
prodigy looks like

98
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,500
when she loses her status.

99
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,958
I never thought one
of the cyborgs

100
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,708
would lose to a flesh
and blood person,

101
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,708
especially not our princess.

102
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,125
Wow, this Pinocchio guy must be
one big monster bad ass, right?

103
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,833
Yeah, some kind of eight foot
tall linebacker or something.

104
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,833
Triela!

105
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:48,458
What in the world are you
doing up there on the roof?

106
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:52,125
Get down here...
I have something for you.

107
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,666
And what might that be?

108
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,791
Would you drop the
childish routine, please?

109
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,125
But I am a child.

110
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,041
I went and got you
a new sidearm...

111
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,791
I believe you lost yours
in Montalcino didn't you?

112
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,666
It's a P-232. Same as mine.

113
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,791
It's a nice weapon... Thanks.

114
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,583
Is having your gun taken

115
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,500
that much of a shock
to the system...?

116
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,041
You'll have your chance
to take it back someday.

117
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,166
I won't lose next time.

118
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,833
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.
I want you to hold onto this.

119
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,416
What is it? Huh?

120
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,750
Angelica!

121
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,791
You on your way back?

122
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,666
Hey...! Yeah, I am.

123
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,291
Hop on. I'll give you a lift.

124
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,541
Oh, no... Did you
hurt your hand?

125
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,666
Yeah... It's nothing...

126
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,208
It'll be back to
normal in no time.

127
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,333
You better hold on tight.
I don't want you falling.

128
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
All right. Yes, ma'am.

129
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,666
Angelica, you don't have
to call me ma'am, okay?

130
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,458
Just call me Priscilla
from now on.

131
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,666
Welfare work?

132
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,625
I thought you wanted a job
that's not behind a desk.

133
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,333
Yeah, but the job is in Rome...

134
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,125
not to mention it's twice
what I was making before.

135
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,083
What do you do at the
Social Welfare Agency?

136
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,458
Oh... Look after some kids...

137
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,291
make sure they're staying out
of trouble. Things like that.

138
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,875
You and children...
I never would have thought that.

139
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,291
What are you trying to say?

140
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,250
It's just... I mean you
wanted to push yourself...

141
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,708
I suppose... taking care
of kids is the perfect fit.

142
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,416
Well hey, there, Patricia...

143
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,208
I certainly didn't
expect to see you here.

144
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,500
Leo. Still as stubborn
a mule as ever.

145
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,041
You should know by now...

146
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,833
I'm never going to compromise
myself and sit with you.

147
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,500
You're still heartless...

148
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,333
And the only woman
I've ever known who can

149
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,791
still manage to say no to
Leonardo Conti... ace reporter.

150
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,125
Now be honest... Come on...
You don't have a man

151
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,500
to fill that seat
across from you, do you?

152
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,875
Wait... That's that
fairy tale right...?

153
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,541
I hear it's good.

154
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,916
The Prince of the Pasta Kingdom.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,750
So who's the author?

156
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,791
It's a secret.

157
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,333
How nice...

158
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,666
I happen to have a weakness for
women with secrets you know.

159
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
Social Welfare Agency?

160
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,041
Right, what about it?

161
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,833
Nothing... Except that I
know a big secret myself...

162
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,333
Wanna hear?

163
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,041
Yeah, sure.

164
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,791
Truth is... that
Agency's a covert

165
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,125
government
intelligence organization.

166
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,583
I know.

167
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,250
My old boyfriend worked at

168
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,125
the Social Welfare
Agency for a time.

169
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,625
I see...

170
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,333
Then, he was the one who
leaked their secrets to you?

171
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,750
No. He never said a thing.

172
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,333
I knew... I figured it out.

173
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,208
How's that?

174
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,583
It didn't add up...

175
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,125
The guy was a gung-ho member
of the special forces...

176
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:01,083
There's no way he would ever
switch over to do charity work.

177
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,500
So why did you two split up?

178
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,708
Something in him was hurting.

179
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,875
Who knows...?

180
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,916
It could have been
me who was in pain...

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,208
I was afraid of knowing
the truth that he hid.

182
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,291
You look like something's
troubling you, miss.

183
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,083
Can I help you with anything?
You need directions?

184
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,291
Do you not understand Italian?

185
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,708
I do understand... a little bit.

186
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,333
If you're out here
sightseeing...

187
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,708
I can point you in the direction
of all the most popular places.

188
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,083
Thanks... but I'll be fine.

189
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:57,208
The city's so beautiful...
I can't stop looking.

190
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,583
I'm glad to hear that you
like Italy as much as you do.

191
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,500
The view from here
is a spectacular one.

192
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,166
That's something we
can see eye to eye on.

193
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,333
It's quite a view...

194
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,208
Are you doing a story on
the Social Welfare Agency?

195
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,250
Yeah, and what I'm
piecing together...

196
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,625
is that they raise and train
children to be assassins.

197
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,041
That can't be true.

198
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,125
I haven't heard anything
about that in the news.

199
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,791
The fact that it
isn't in the news

200
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,250
is more proof than
anything else.

201
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,791
Almost all of
the country's media

202
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,333
is controlled by
the prime minister.

203
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,250
Which makes it another
government run organization.

204
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,625
That makes him nothing less
than the 'media king' of Italy.

205
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,000
Right... But I know they
actually do charity work...

206
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,208
I've even gone by to
visit their facilities.

207
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,166
Listen...

208
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,208
I have my own vision, of
how this country should be...

209
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,208
The Public doesn't
care about the truth

210
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,875
only because they
don't know it...

211
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,708
See... I want to lift the veil
that shrouds this country.

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,791
Patricia...

213
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,291
I need to ask you if you
would help me with my story.

214
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

215
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,958
You're curious about your ex.
I know that you are...

216
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,458
Why else would you carry
that scrap of paper?

217
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,500
You want to know the truth.

218
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,583
Damn spooky, isn't it?

219
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,666
You got your cops,
politicians, city officials...

220
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,541
All of them denying everything

221
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,541
like they all sat
in the same room

222
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,333
to get their stories straight.

223
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,500
Makes me sick to my stomach.

224
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,750
Do you know...? Is it true
about the child assassins?

225
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,041
The editorial department
got an anonymous tip.

226
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,125
This was taken at
a place nearby...

227
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,333
It's not a clear shot,
but you can still make it out.

228
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,250
Hold on... You think...

229
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,083
You think that...
Marco's involved?

230
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,416
Don't have a clue...

231
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,541
Besides there's more than
one brand of justice...

232
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,708
I mean for all we know, he could
be one of the good guys...

233
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,583
You know what would help?

234
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,625
Do you have a photo
of your ex-boyfriend?

235
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,500
Maybe contact info for an
old boss of his or something?

236
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,250
Anything.

237
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,458
Leonardo!

238
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,333
Wow. The editor's in
early for a change.

239
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,458
There's no smoking in here.

240
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,833
It's not lit, genius.

241
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,083
There's a call
waiting for you...

242
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,458
I think it's some
police officer.

243
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,083
Hey, it's Conti.

244
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,916
I wanted to say thank
you for the other day.

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,125
I've suddenly remembered a rumor
about the Social Welfare Agency.

246
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
This rumor is that they
have a secret office

247
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,125
just outside of Rome...

248
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,291
Suspicious people coming
and going constantly.

249
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,541
I'll check into
that later today.

250
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,125
Thanks for the tip.

251
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,916
No, don't thank me...
I hope you find something.

252
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,166
Is that good enough for ya?

253
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,375
Absolutely, Lieutenant
Colonel... Good enough.

254
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,791
Shame Marco left the force...

255
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,041
But I guess he found
another niche, huh...

256
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,166
He doing a good job?

257
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,958
The investigation's progressing
well, but I need to do some more

258
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,541
research before I can
compile a full report.

259
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,083
Don't push too hard. Let the
information come to you.

260
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,500
Anything you find out about

261
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,208
these government
assassins will help.

262
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,208
So have you worked up a plan to
pull off the kidnapping yet...?

263
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,958
I'm eager to get
my eyes on that...

264
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,208
I don't know.
It's nothing earth shattering.

265
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,125
I doubt it will be enough to
stop the bridge's construction.

266
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,625
At least it should make
for good publicity.

267
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,291
Of course it will.

268
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,125
Listen, I gotta go. My contact's
here. I'll call you later.

269
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,166
Hey, I'm not interrupting am I?

270
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,875
Not at all... Hop on in.

271
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,000
Ready to do some digging?

272
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,625
The place is deserted... great.

273
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,375
Freeze!

274
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,291
Mr. Leonardo Conti...
I'm placing you under arrest.

275
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,375
I've heard a lot
about you, Marco...

276
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,375
How is it you can arrest me when
you're not on the force anymore?

277
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,458
What do you know about me?

278
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,916
Well for one, I know that
you screwed up your life...

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
And that you joined up
with the wrong side

280
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,250
and broke the heart of a woman.

281
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,625
What are you talking about?

282
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,041
Marco...

283
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,250
Patricia? What the...
Why are you here?

284
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,416
Leonardo and I know each
other through our jobs...

285
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,625
The question is...

286
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,708
Just what in the hell
are you doing here?

287
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,291
Get away from him now!
He's with the Padania!

288
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Leo...

289
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,666
Sorry I used you, sweetheart.

290
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,833
But I had to do
what I had to do.

291
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,833
Then he's telling the truth...

292
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,166
So Marco...

293
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,833
I checked your
background you know.

294
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,125
Central Securities Operations
Service is quite an elite unit.

295
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,791
And yet you quit. Why?

296
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,083
And what about her?

297
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,333
She's nice...

298
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,208
But just like your job,
you quit her too...

299
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,083
Is that how bad you wanted to
do the government's dirty work?

300
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,458
Shut your mouth!

301
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,458
Things aren't like this
because I wanted them to be!

302
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,250
I've had enough of your talk...

303
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,875
So I'm gonna blow your mouth
right off your goddamn face!

304
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,125
You can't make that shot...

305
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,208
Not with that bad
right eye of yours.

306
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,583
It'd be a shame to miss
and hit your princess.

307
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,833
Angelica!

308
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,250
They raise and train
children to be assassins...

309
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,250
Patricia...

310
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,250
You... You can't get any
more involved with this.

311
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,583
Why?

312
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,708
So is doing this the kind of
thing that fulfills your dreams?

313
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,125
Don't you think you've
pushed yourself far enough?!

314
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Listen to me...

315
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,250
I never wanted things to
turn out like this either...

316
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,041
Believe me.

317
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,541
It's hot out here today.

318
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,791
It is, ma'am... Uh, Priscilla.

319
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,416
And so we returned
closer than before.

320
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,166
They've got you housed back in
the dorms now, don't they...?

321
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,208
So what do you guys do for fun?

322
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,083
Having her call me
by my first name...

323
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,333
I wonder how that's
gonna work out.

324
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,958
I'm reading a new book...

325
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:09,375
It's called "The Prince of Pasta
Kingdom." It's really neat!

326
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,041
So... you like...?
Is it a good read?

327
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,458
Yeah!

328
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,208
If we could only go back to
the way things used to be.

329
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,666
Well we're not
professionals you know

330
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,333
and it's not like the story
has to be complex...

331
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,791
Just think of all the fairy
tales you heard as a kid.

332
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,416
They're all simple and
have memorable characters.

333
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,791
Like, maybe the dragon
that kidnapped the princess

334
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,458
just seems evil at first.

335
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,791
Okay, all done!

336
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,458
I wanted to help you,
but from the looks of it,

337
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,541
you should be protecting me.

338
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,416
Only because you're no good.

339
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,833
And so, after getting
the platinum fork

340
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,458
on the mountain of fire,

341
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,041
the prince safely returned to
the kingdom with the princess.

342
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,375
And all the kingdom rejoiced.

343
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,375
Well, what do you think?

344
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,208
It was wonderful!
