1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,750
I don't understand
why I'm the one

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,125
who's having to guard
some stupid little girl.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,166
She's not just
any little girl...

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,666
She's Mario Bossi's daughter.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,250
The trial is about to begin.

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,541
It would be the absolute worst
time for her to get kidnapped.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,083
But you don't need a cyborg
like me for a job this small.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,916
She's a regular girl
right around your age.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,958
Spending time with her might
be good experience for you.

10
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,541
Oh, you mean because I'm not
a regular girl! I get it!

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,166
That didn't go too well.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,916
All she's even willing to do
these days is keep training.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,250
Because of the Pinocchio thing?

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,375
Yeah. Taking a hit like that
has been pretty hard on her.

15
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,041
She's got a lot of pride
she's gotta fight through.

16
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,916
So what all do you know
about Bossi's kid anyway?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,250
She's his common-law daughter.

18
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,916
Lives alone in Naples. The
public doesn't know about her.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,333
Still, we're not going
to take any chances.

20
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,458
You know Jose... About Triela...

21
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,875
I'd so much like to show her

22
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,250
more of the world
than this violence.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,708
Augustus...
I'm back home again...

24
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,041
But tomorrow I have to leave

25
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,083
so I can get to know
a "regular" girl.

26
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,500
Of course, Hilshire and
I argued again today...

27
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:33,000
We always do... even though
I really don't want to.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,333
You want field work?

29
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,250
Hartmann... I am sorry.

30
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,458
But there's other
work for you to do.

31
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,083
You mean Rome,
or Paris, maybe Lisbon?

32
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,833
Or traveling
anywhere in the world

33
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,541
to meet with police
officials...? That work?

34
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,916
Precisely.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,916
Europol is like the European
version of the FBI...

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,458
We're hated by
police organizations

37
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,041
everywhere you turn.

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,875
Establishing friendly
relationships with them

39
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,625
is a very important job.

40
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,166
I don't care.

41
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,291
Do you realize that over
a million and a half girls are

42
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,666
illegally bought and sold
around the world, every year,

43
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,208
like cattle?!

44
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,916
Why don't you put me on
that task force, Sir?!

45
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,958
Listen Hartmann.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,791
About our little conversation
the other day...

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,458
I appreciate your passion...

48
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,416
but I can't give
you any field work.

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Why not?

50
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,791
It was requested by the German
police who sent you here.

51
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,875
What the hell...?
Why does that matter?!

52
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,458
You need to refine
your diplomatic skills...

53
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,083
Do that and
you'll be just fine.

54
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,916
You'll get what you
want out of your life.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,291
You can only realize your ideals
once you've laid the foundation.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,083
Here.

57
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,958
What's this?

58
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,916
Watch it and give it
some serious thought.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,750
It's a video depicting a scene
of child abuse we've found.

60
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,250
Have you ever heard
of a snuff film?

61
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,583
It's a video of a murder,
meant for entertainment.

62
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,833
What?

63
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,708
People either abduct the kids,

64
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,166
or buy them and film
them being killed.

65
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,833
I can't believe this.

66
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,000
Some are fakes. A lot
of them are, actually.

67
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,333
But, just like you said,

68
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,750
trafficking continues
every year.

69
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:13,041
While many children go missing
for good, some are found.

70
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,625
Found as cut-up corpses.

71
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:20,166
And a small percentage of those
cases are deemed as credible.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,833
This is the reality.
Our world is filled with evil.

73
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,500
Until you can accept that fact,

74
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:38,583
I can't send you on
field investigations.

75
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,041
You're blessed, kid.

76
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,291
You grew up believing that
people are inherently good.

77
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,333
I envy you for that.

78
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,166
Oh... Hi...!
I'm Maria Machiavelli.

79
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,166
Hello. Victor Hilshire...
This here is Triela.

80
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,875
Ciao!

81
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,250
Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,833
We'll be your security detail

83
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,500
until your father's
done testifying.

84
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,291
Uh, so...

85
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,416
What do I do when I want to hit
the town and stuff like that?

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,041
First off, you don't.

87
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,166
It's best for your safety
if you stay indoors.

88
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,416
I have to go talk
with the Naples D.A.,

89
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,250
so I'm leaving you in charge.

90
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,583
Me? In charge?

91
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,708
When are you going
to be coming back?

92
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,083
Beginning of next week...

93
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,375
And don't worry...
You won't be alone.

94
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,791
Olga and her team
will be staying here.

95
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,666
Say, I got a question.

96
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,875
Yeah, what is it?

97
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,583
I heard that you're
a professional killer.

98
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,041
Is that true?

99
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,500
It is.

100
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,250
Maybe you could show
me one of your tricks.

101
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
Well, okay...

102
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,208
So cool!

103
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,500
I got another question.

104
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,708
Yes?

105
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,583
You got time for any hobbies?

106
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,416
Hobbies?

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,083
I've been into
football lately...

108
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,958
I play it whenever I can.

109
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,083
No hobbies...

110
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,958
Well... Do you maybe
collect anything?

111
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,416
I do... I have a
teddy bear collection.

112
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,208
Tadah!

113
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,208
Every so often my dad
gives me one. Now...

114
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:59,791
There's Pepino, Guytano,
Jacinto, Zoff, and Bobo.

115
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,583
And this is Alex.
He's my favorite.

116
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,958
I got him last Christmas...

117
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,958
He's supposed to be
a football forward!

118
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Hey...

119
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,750
I have that same
one at home...!

120
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,833
I also got him as a
present last Christmas.

121
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,833
Yeah...? And what did
ya decide to name yours?

122
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,666
I call him Augustus.

123
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,375
That sure is a strong-sounding
name...! What position is he?

124
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,666
What?

125
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,750
You know Hilshire
told me that you were

126
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,416
the one responsible for saving
my dad's life over the holiday.

127
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,833
Uh, yeah. Ms. Machiavelli--

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,750
You can call me Mimi.

129
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,333
Mimi, I'm wondering if
you love your father...?

130
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,125
Because... I know
he's said before

131
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,541
that he hasn't seen his
daughter in a long time.

132
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,291
Do you hold a grudge
against him?

133
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,750
He's my daddy!
Of course I love him!

134
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,875
I'm glad.

135
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,208
I finally feel, like I'm being
useful to Hilshire for once.

136
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,333
Lately, I've been feeling
kind of depressed

137
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,750
because I messed up at work.

138
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,750
I guess you have it pretty
rough with these guys, huh...

139
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,375
But what about you, Mimi...?

140
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,583
I mean you're the one who
has to live all by yourself.

141
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,166
You kidding...? It's a blast.

142
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,083
I can do what I want, no
adults bugging me. I love it.

143
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,833
Checking over and over
won't change it, Pauline.

144
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,458
She was strangled and
died of asphyxiation.

145
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,833
The killer had to
be a large man.

146
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,625
Right... I know.

147
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,250
Sorry, Rachelle, but Agent Alain

148
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,958
kept pestering us
to check again.

149
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,583
He actually thinks it's
the medical examiner's fault

150
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,458
the investigation's
at a standstill?

151
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,208
The guy's trying his hardest...

152
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,250
Maybe you should give
him a break, okay...?

153
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,958
And why don't you
meet him sometime...

154
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,125
He would make quite a catch.

155
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,833
I'm doing fine on my own.

156
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,666
Rachelle, you should try to care
more about meeting new people.

157
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,541
You don't want the opportunity
of finding a man to pass you by.

158
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,708
I suppose you're right.
Maybe I should try.

159
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,833
Victor Hartmann?

160
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,500
Hi. Aren't you with
the Paris police?

161
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,291
My name's Rachelle Belleut...

162
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,291
and you and I work on the same
floor but we haven't spoken...

163
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,083
Do you need something
from me, Rachelle?

164
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,041
I was hoping that you
and I could talk some...

165
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,083
Do you have any
plans this weekend?

166
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,541
My job is to determine
the cause of death

167
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,791
for the children we find...

168
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,708
This one dies of blood loss.

169
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,541
That one was asphyxiated.

170
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,458
And of course, we never
can solve anything...

171
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,041
Even if we have intel
about human trafficking...

172
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,583
Europol has almost no authority

173
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,916
in whichever place
we find it happening.

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,208
Oh, uh... I'm sorry.

175
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,083
I've just been
talking your ear off.

176
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,000
No... It's fine.

177
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,250
I think I may have
forgotten how to do this...

178
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,000
It's been a very long time
since I've been on a date.

179
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,916
I even borrowed these
clothes and perfume...

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,291
Pretty sad, huh?

181
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,000
Na, it's been a
while for me, too.

182
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,375
I really only dine out
during business meetings

183
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,458
or by myself when I travel.

184
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,833
The chief got on my
case the other day.

185
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,708
Said I knew too little
about the real world

186
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,583
and needed to get out more.

187
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,541
He had a hell of a point.
I vastly underestimated

188
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,291
the scope of the
child abuse situation.

189
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,958
I had no clue that there were
so many people driven by evil.

190
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,333
I couldn't believe it, either.

191
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,333
Until I joined Europol...

192
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:11,833
I had never seen such
violently mutilated corpses.

193
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,541
And now...

194
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm scared at how
used to it I am.

195
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,333
Tell me, Hartmann.

196
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:26,041
What will you do when you learn
everything about the real world?

197
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,500
Forsake all hope and
return to Germany?

198
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,958
No... I'll cut a deal
with the chief...

199
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,750
I'll do whatever he wants if
it'll put me in the field.

200
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,875
I can't face that the
world is devoid of hope.

201
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,250
Those children need help.

202
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:46,000
Um, I heard from an Italian
investigator I know,

203
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,666
that the Naples mafia
has recently started

204
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,208
a new vein of their human
trafficking business,

205
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,625
based in Amsterdam.

206
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,416
Of course we can't
investigate it officially...

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,208
But we could both go
there... if you'd like.

208
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,833
Excellent vintage.

209
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,666
Machiavelli Chianti
Classico Riserva.

210
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,875
Oh yeah, daddy sent me
a case of that stuff

211
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,916
just because it
matches my last name.

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,708
This wine was made by Niccolo
Machiavelli's descendants.

213
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,708
You know that.

214
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:28,458
Uh... So who is he?

215
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,791
Triela.

216
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,708
A medieval philosopher...
A famous quote of his is

217
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,750
"One must be a fox
to recognize traps,

218
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,291
and a lion to frighten wolves."

219
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,000
Exactly right...
That's impressive, Triela.

220
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,708
Thank you... it was nothing.

221
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,541
Checkmate.

222
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,000
You're better than me at every
game we've played...! Geez!

223
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,958
Want to play foosball again?

224
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,500
Think I'll pass.

225
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,458
I've had my butt handed to me
for three days straight now.

226
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,083
So... Why don't we play a game
of real football outside...

227
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,208
I bet that's something
I can beat you at.

228
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,416
Doesn't matter...

229
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,208
While the trial's on
you have to stay inside.

230
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,083
But I really wanna
see my boyfriend!

231
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,416
Come on...! Pretty please!

232
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,000
You text-message him
constantly as it is.

233
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
Yeah, but I wanna see him!

234
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:34,375
I wanna see him and hug him
and kiss him all over! You know!

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,541
Now, I'm sure you could
persuade Hilshire somehow.

236
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,000
No.

237
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,666
Thanks.

238
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,916
I'm curious about something...

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,333
Yeah?

240
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,541
I get the feeling that
you're in love with Hilshire.

241
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,875
Why do you say that?

242
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,208
Well, it's obvious enough
to me, at least...

243
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,791
Have you told him?

244
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,875
Of course not...

245
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,583
Because I don't
even know for sure

246
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,166
if the love I'm feeling is real.

247
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,541
Besides, it wouldn't
matter to either of us.

248
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,958
We could never have a
relationship like that.

249
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,250
Yeah, why not...?

250
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,625
You wouldn't be the first
teacher and student

251
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,916
to fall in love.

252
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,166
Just look him in the eye
and say... "Ti amo!"

253
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,541
After that I'm sure
it'll all work out fine.

254
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,583
You may be right.

255
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
You know, when she's hanging
around with Mimi like that,

256
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,500
Triela almost seems like
your average teenage girl.

257
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,291
She really does.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,416
After living with Mimi
for several days now,

259
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,375
I've learned that--as much
as I'd like to deny it--

260
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,583
cyborgs are very different
from regular girls.

261
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,000
I know about things
like marksmanship,

262
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,625
firearm maintenance, martial
arts, and lock-picking...

263
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,958
I don't know a
single thing about

264
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,500
the latest music or popular
television programs.

265
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,916
Which means that I have only one
thing that I'm supposed to do.

266
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,458
Hilshire, I can't tell
you how much I appreciate

267
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,291
everything you've
done for my daughter.

268
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,250
It's no problem.
I'm just glad the trial could

269
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,083
come to a close
without incident.

270
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,125
My only hope is that
this can somehow

271
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,500
make amends for
the things I've done.

272
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,833
So what's next...?

273
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,333
Have you given any thought
to where you're going?

274
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,750
I'll escape overseas
like I always have...

275
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,541
And I would think that Mimi
wants to stay in Naples...

276
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,666
so I probably won't
see her for some time.

277
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,833
Too bad.

278
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,791
I was hoping you'd
give Triela my regards.

279
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,208
Nah, forget it...

280
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,041
She probably still considers
me one of the bad guys.

281
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,250
And I can't blame her.

282
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,291
Do you think that mobster from
Naples--that Mario fellow--

283
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,416
you think he was
telling the truth?

284
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,666
It seemed he opposed the
group's human trafficking angle

285
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,708
from the start.

286
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,125
That's not the kind of
business he was into...

287
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,041
He regretted it.

288
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:01,041
I can't believe behind that door
they're making snuff films.

289
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey... Why don't you stay
here and watch my back?

290
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
No way... I'm in.

291
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,625
I'm sick of seeing what
they do to these kids.

292
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,333
I never knew how painful
a bullet wound could be.

293
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,583
Rachelle, hold on!

294
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,250
Well, get you outside
and call the cops,

295
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,666
then we can get some help.

296
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,750
We haven't-- We still
haven't found the kids...

297
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,041
We have to help them...

298
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,083
Look, a light!

299
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,416
I'll be back. You don't move.

300
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,833
Have you ever heard
of a snuff film?

301
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a video of a murder,
meant for entertainment.

302
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,958
People either abduct the kids

303
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,416
or buy them and film
them being killed.

304
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:35,500
This is the reality.
Our world is filled with evil.

305
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,833
Rachelle, wait--

306
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
Keep watch in the
hallway, Hartmann...

307
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,500
Rachelle!

308
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,583
She's still alive. I have to
try... I have to save her.

309
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,458
I know, Hartmann.

310
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,583
I didn't want to
believe it either...

311
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,208
I had no idea the real
world was this revolting...

312
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,333
Was blind to it.

313
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,208
We've let countless
children die in the past...

314
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,375
But... if I can save this
one girl, just this one...

315
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,958
Then I think I'll actually
be able to believe

316
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:16,041
that this world isn't completely
devoid of hope... like you said.

317
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,833
Do you believe it, Victor?!

318
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,750
What?

319
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,708
There's still hope in our world!

320
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,416
That it's not completely gone...

321
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,166
Yes, I do!

322
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,625
I believe it because
there're still people

323
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,666
like you in the world!

324
00:19:55,916 --> 00:20:02,000
Rachelle...? Rachelle...?!
Rachelle...! Rachelle!

325
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,416
What do you call that crap?!

326
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,916
You're a disgrace to
the entire squad, soldier!

327
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,833
Put on your equipment.
10 kilometer run! On the double!

328
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,333
Sir!

329
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,250
Now, Triela...

330
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,458
Yes?

331
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,708
I must apologize for how
pathetic my men are.

332
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,458
You must be disappointed he
didn't put up much of a fight.

333
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,250
No, it's okay...

334
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,583
Use this... as an example.

335
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,541
This is what can happen
when even the toughest

336
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,666
of soldiers is
caught off guard, men.

337
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,083
Never lower your guard!

338
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,666
I don't care if your enemy
is bled out and dead.

339
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,375
Until now, you've always
relied on your body's abilities

340
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,958
to overwhelm your opponents.

341
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,833
Which is exactly why you lost
to this Pinocchio fellow.

342
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,958
Was that the kind
of thing you wanted?

343
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,958
She must be pretty
important to you.

344
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,083
She is... That's why
I called you here--

345
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,250
to make her feel some
real pain for once...

346
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,000
She can't train
with agency members

347
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,458
because of her conditioning,
so you're all I've got.

348
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,958
Plus we don't have any guys
around here of your caliber.

349
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,958
The whole exercise should
be a good bit of training

350
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,291
for my men as well.

351
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,083
Terrorists these days
aren't always adults

352
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,041
with scowls on their faces...

353
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,958
As for your girl there...
She's gonna be just fine.

354
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,791
In two weeks I'll change
that bunny rabbit

355
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,000
into an unstoppable force.

356
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,708
Thanks. I appreciate it.

357
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,166
Is the patient fully under?

358
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,583
Yes.

359
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,083
Alright. It's a routine
leg replacement. Let's go.

360
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,333
This new leg has a much
better performance level

361
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,625
than her previous one.

362
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,041
That so?

363
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,583
The development stage has
gone much more smoothly...

364
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,250
Ever since we started using
Claes for all the testing.

365
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,208
Donato, look...

366
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,333
Yes, what's the problem?

367
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,791
The cyborg it's... it's crying.

368
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,375
Just wipe them away.

369
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,333
Sir?

370
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,833
Wipe off the tears. It's normal.

371
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,541
They shed them in
their sleep sometimes.

372
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,583
You awake?

373
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,083
We've finished your maintenance,

374
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,958
so you can leave here as
soon as you can walk out.

375
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,666
What's with the tears...? You
have a bad dream or something?

376
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,291
I can't... really remember.

377
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,250
It seemed kind of
like a dream...

378
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,916
In it, I met my mother.

379
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,583
I know she was
wearing glasses...

380
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,958
And she had on the sweetest
smelling perfume...

381
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,750
She was saying something
I couldn't understand.

382
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,875
Then, right before I woke up,

383
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,500
she came down and gave
me a very gentle hug.
