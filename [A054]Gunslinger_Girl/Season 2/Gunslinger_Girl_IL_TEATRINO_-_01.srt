1
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,208
So... Have you picked out
your souvenir for Henrietta?

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,500
Not yet... I don't
know what to get.

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,416
She loves anything I give her
so that makes it tough...

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,875
You've got it easy. All you have
to buy are stuffed animals.

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,750
You don't get it, pal...

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,625
Triela researches
her gifts for me.

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,791
I can't just pick out
whatever I want...

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,708
She hates it when I find
something off the list.

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,416
So, of course, I got her
what she wanted again.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,666
A Steiff Bear.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,125
She wanted a German
bear from France?

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,458
Uh, Pardon me, sirs.

13
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,833
I take it both of
you are from Italy.

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,375
Yeah... Just a weekend
business trip...

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,541
The train back home
leaves in an hour.

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,666
Well, if it's a French
souvenir you seek,

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,791
I am most certainly your man.

18
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,125
That's great,
I could use some help.

19
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,458
I do hope that the gift is
for this girl Henrietta...

20
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,125
Because I believe I have
just the thing for her.

21
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,333
It has the most
wonderful story behind it.

22
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,583
I heard you're going
to the Balkans.

23
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,250
Is that true, Jose?

24
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,083
I'll be back before
you know it...

25
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,500
It'll only be six months.

26
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:50,250
But no! They say the radiation
is too dangerous...

27
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,708
Don't worry.

28
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,000
Your other brother will be
here to keep you company.

29
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:59,125
Jean never comes to my recitals,
but you're always there.

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,916
That's right, Jean.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,125
The meeting with
the French Minister

32
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,791
of the Interior ended well.

33
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,208
Couldn't have gone better.

34
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,083
We're on the TGV
now heading back.

35
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,291
There's going to be a massive
demonstration in Rome tomorrow.

36
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,250
I need you two
back here in time.

37
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,125
Understood.

38
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,958
Okay! I'll see you later!

39
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:20,916
Jose, confirm the activists do
not appear to be making a move.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,416
No... They're not doing
anything, brother.

41
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,666
This is my brother.

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,916
That's how I know him,

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,625
even though we're
not really siblings.

44
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,166
We're always together
during our missions,

45
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,125
so we're known as 'fratello.'

46
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,041
It means 'siblings'...
"Brother and sister."

47
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,166
We're close, but not
close enough to touch.

48
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,250
That's how great the distance
is between Jose and me.

49
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,458
I'd like more than anything to
be closer to him than this.

50
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,166
Rico--

51
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,208
Stay on the sidewalk.

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,458
Henrietta.

53
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,750
Is there something wrong?

54
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,208
No... everything's fine, Jose.

55
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,625
Got it...

56
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,625
Sir, we have a violent clash in
progress between the protestors

57
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,916
and the riot squad
at the Coliseum.

58
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,416
This is it, people...

59
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
They'll use this moment of
vulnerability as their chance

60
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,541
to make a strike
during the chaos...

61
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,541
Are all of the fratellos
on their marks?

62
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,583
Yeah, just about.

63
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,833
The Jean-Rico and
Jose-Henrietta teams

64
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,625
are heading north from
Circo Massimo Station...

65
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
Hilshire-Triela
team is on lookout

66
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,708
at the Memorial Observatory.

67
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,458
The other members are
on plain-clothes patrol,

68
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,166
looking out for
anyone suspicious.

69
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,375
Contact all of the Handlers...

70
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,125
Tell them that finding the
F.R.F. terrorists is priority.

71
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,250
Jose...

72
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,416
We're going back to the
chief's van for a few minutes...

73
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,291
Stay here and try to keep
an eye on the perimeter.

74
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,833
Got it.

75
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,458
So is it them...?

76
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,375
The Five Republics Faction?

77
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,083
No, these are all just
ordinary citizens...

78
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,541
Rome's got its
pro-indepencence supporters--

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Jose, you're not
injured are you?

80
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,166
Blood.

81
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,833
It's only a scratch...

82
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,708
Now put your eye
back on the perimeter.

83
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,000
Look!

84
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,791
Let's go!

85
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,250
Priscilla!

86
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,583
Jose, I heard the explosion.

87
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,208
Everyone okay? What happened?

88
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,375
Padania terrorists...
I need your bike.

89
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,291
It's yours. Take it.

90
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,166
Get on, Henrietta.

91
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,333
Right.

92
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,583
Great.

93
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,625
My poor Vespa...
I sure hope I get it back.

94
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,333
I did it... Killed ten
of those bastards...

95
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,250
And all thanks to this.

96
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,041
These bombs are incredible.

97
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,333
Now we can get close

98
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,708
without those police dogs
sniffing them out...

99
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,958
When we get the chance,

100
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958
we'll blow two or three
more of these suckers.

101
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,041
What in the--
I think we got a tail.

102
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,500
That yellow scooter.

103
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,583
It's been riding our
ass for way too long.

104
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,125
Not now... There's way
too much traffic here...

105
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,166
We cause a scene and the cops
will be on us in no time.

106
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,791
The passenger has a
Beretta Submachine gun.

107
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Don't fire yet.

108
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,875
Jose, do you read me?

109
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,291
You're heading into the
administrative district.

110
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,833
That's where we'll corner
the target once you get there.

111
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,958
Rico and I are on the way.

112
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,291
Rico. We're going to
get up ahead of them...

113
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,791
Then, you take 'em.

114
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,750
I won't miss a shot...
Do I kill them?

115
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,541
You don't...

116
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,458
We need someone
to interrogate...

117
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,916
Just make them hurt a lot.

118
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,125
Right.

119
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,666
Shit!

120
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,708
Yeah, I think this will work.

121
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,708
Lead their car down this narrow
alleyway and then pick them off.

122
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,333
It's perfect.

123
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,208
We can set the trap right here.

124
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,000
Right... Good idea. Get it done.

125
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,291
You all right back there?
Hold on, okay?

126
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,916
Okay... Don't worry about me...

127
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,041
Dammit!

128
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,416
Did I do good?

129
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,333
You did. That'll work just fine.

130
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,500
And stay there...

131
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,416
This is the most rest
you'll get for a while.

132
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,666
Several years ago, the Italian
Prime Minister founded

133
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,458
the Social Welfare Agency,
a public interest organization

134
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,875
designed to perform
charity work.

135
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,750
The truth is, it's an
intelligence agency

136
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,458
established to covertly remove
those who oppose the government.

137
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,041
Triela... You're
not hit are you?

138
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,458
At the agency, Special Ops
Section 2 finds subjects

139
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,708
from around the country,
each on the verge of death.

140
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,875
We bring them back,
give them mechanical bodies,

141
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,041
and send them out
on dangerous missions.

142
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
Using what's
calling conditioning,

143
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,083
memories of their previous lives

144
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,958
are wiped from the minds
of these young girls.

145
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,750
They're re-engineered
to obey the orders

146
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,750
of their partners
and the agency.

147
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,750
And while they've been given

148
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,250
powerful enough
bodies to survive,

149
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,958
they've had to trade in their
connection to their pasts...

150
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,000
Along with every
ounce of free will.

151
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,250
These cyborgs can wipe
out a life without fear,

152
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,333
without regret,
without remorse,

153
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,791
and without a
moment's hesitation...

154
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,541
"Today, I killed
an enemy for Jose."

155
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,750
"I'm sad that I
couldn't have been

156
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,291
more helpful with
the situation...

157
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,125
But it did make me happy
when he held me on the scooter.

158
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
I felt so safe."

159
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,125
The end.

160
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,333
Hey, Jose...

161
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,583
It's me, Henrietta.

162
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,750
It smells like
cigarettes in here.

163
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,583
I didn't know that Jose smokes.

164
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,041
I wonder if that's the souvenir
he brought me back from France.

165
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,833
A golden kaleidoscope...

166
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,625
It's written in French.

167
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:39,416
"For my beloved.
Louise Antoinette Rolle"?

168
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,916
Sorry. I wasn't looking.

169
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,666
Henrietta...?.

170
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
So it's a kaleidoscope
wrapped like a present,

171
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,875
but it's addressed
to some woman...

172
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,416
I don't know...

173
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,958
Wait... No need to get upset...

174
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,625
Now what was that name again?

175
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,666
The one inscribed on the bottom.

176
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,625
Um, it, was Louise
Antionette Rolle.

177
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,083
I should just accept the fact

178
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,083
that it really is
his girlfriend.

179
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,541
I don't think so...

180
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,541
Not unless his girlfriend
died in the 19th century.

181
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,916
Huh?

182
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,833
Of course it could be
someone with the same name.

183
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,625
But the name is that
of a married woman

184
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,750
once doted upon by
a great French writer.

185
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,458
One of this writer's
most well-known

186
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,791
and loved stories is based
upon himself and Mrs. Rolle...

187
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,541
And he just so happened
to name the heroine

188
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
in that novel Henrietta.

189
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,041
Oh.

190
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,291
That means--

191
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,041
That means that
the kaleioscope was

192
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,833
a gift for you from
the beginning...

193
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,000
And actually a rather clever
one at that, I might add...

194
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,333
'Night.

195
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:39,583
Uh... Well... I...
I'm sorry... uh... I was...

196
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,708
Uranus rotates horizontally,

197
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,833
almost along the same
path as its orbit,

198
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,458
which gives us an
interesting perspective.

199
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,125
It looks a lot like a target...

200
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,958
Rings circling the outside while
the planet hovers in the middle.

201
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,791
I shouldn't forget the moons.
It's got 27.

202
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,458
Some are referred to
as shepherd moons.

203
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,666
I bet you can't guess why
they're called that...

204
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,708
Hey uh... Claes?

205
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,666
What?

206
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,250
I'm trying to sleep, you know.

207
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,875
Did that lovey/dovey
French novel

208
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,375
you mentioned earlier
have a happy ending?

209
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,875
No.

210
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,458
Then wouldn't it be bad luck
to get a present like that?

211
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,875
She'll be okay...

212
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,291
It's probably a fake, anyway...

213
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,208
After all, the kaleidoscope
was invented

214
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,083
right around that same time,
maybe even later.

215
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,166
That's good, I guess.

216
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,291
Besides...

217
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,458
when love fails in
a story like that,

218
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,083
it's because it was never
true love to begin with.

219
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,208
Have I answered all of your
questions for tonight Triela?

220
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,666
Yes, Miss Cleas.
