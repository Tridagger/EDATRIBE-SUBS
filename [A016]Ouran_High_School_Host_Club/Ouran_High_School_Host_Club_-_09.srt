1
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,958
Really? All the afternoon
classes have been cancelled?

2
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,500
You mean, no one told you?

3
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,333
It's going to be crazy around
here for the next two days.

4
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,250
Ouran is hosting an exposition
for the cultural clubs.

5
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,625
Drama and choir clubs from
a bunch of other schools have

6
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:59,500
been invited. It's a big event
the school hosts annually.

7
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,916
Is that so?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,833
What?! You've never tried it?!

9
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,708
Didn't anyone tell you that
it's the preferred drink

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,083
of the Host Club?

11
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,666
And you are our manager
so you should drink it too.

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,291
Um, well I-I think I've heard
of instant coffee before.

13
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,125
Oh! That's right! Isn't that
when the coffee beans have

14
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,833
already been ground for you?

15
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,708
That's just ground coffee,
instant is something completely

16
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,583
different. I don't even think
there are any coffee beans

17
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,750
in instant coffee. You just mix
this powder with hot water and

18
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,708
then drink it- you don't have
to brew it. It's pretty awesome.

19
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,291
So it's basically just like
coffee but not as robust.

20
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,250
And yet, it's
strangely satisfying.

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,500
Now that you mention it we
just ran out of it, didn't we?

22
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,500
Go buy us some more, Haruhi.

23
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,833
Why do I have to go get it?

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,125
Because you're the only
commoner no one else knows

25
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,708
where to buy it.

26
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,583
We've even been serving it to
our guests lately and besides,

27
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,833
it's part of your job.

28
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,250
But the cultural club
exposition starts soon.

29
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,666
Yeah, but it's not mandatory
so if you're not interested

30
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
you don't have to go.

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,833
And with that being said.

32
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,833
Be careful out there!

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,541
Damn them.
I really hate rich people.

34
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,208
Thanks for
helping them out, Haruhi.

35
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,541
No problem. I just wish they'd
buy their own instant coffee.

36
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,125
Well, I don't know if that'll
ever happen but I'm glad

37
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,958
they seem to be
having a good time.

38
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,500
And it's all thanks to you, 

39
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,083
All thanks to me?

40
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,416
We've been in the same class
as the twins ever since

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,541
middle school.
They didn't used to be this

42
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,166
cheerful and friendly. They were
always quiet and withdrawn-

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,208
they didn't have many friends.

44
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,083
It's like they didn't want
anyone to get too close.

45
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,625
I don't think they liked
school very much they seemed

46
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,375
so bored by it.

47
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,750
I guess things started to change
when the host club was created.

48
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,250
Since then, they've come out of
their shells little by little.

49
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,541
Really?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,916
But they've really opened
up since you've joined

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,541
the host club, Now they talk and
joke with everyone in class.

52
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,375
That's why we wanted
to make sure you knew how

53
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,875
grateful we are to you. Because
of you the twins are having fun

54
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,333
and enjoying each day
to the fullest.

55
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,541
It'd be a shame for any harm to
come to that cute face of yours.

56
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,041
Young lady.

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,500
A Challenge From
Lobelia Girls Academy!

58
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,833
This looks like the place.

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,291
Mm-hmm.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,041
Welcome, ladies!

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,750
Well, well, well, I see you
ladies are from another school.

62
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,291
I certainly hope
we haven't startled you.

63
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,583
We love first-time guests.

64
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,291
I'm glad you've come,
princesses. My darlings,

65
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,166
even if the world were to be
destroyed, I'd put my life

66
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,958
on the line as your faithful
knight and servant.

67
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,666
I will protect you.

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,833
Oh my, do you really think
you'd be able to protect us?

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,750
That's awfully arrogant of you,
wouldn't you agree?

70
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,166
You think that's what
a woman wants to hear?

71
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,291
Well, you're wrong.

72
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,958
C'mon, give him a break,
Sister Suzuran.

73
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,166
Men are just lowly life forms
who don't care about

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,333
anything other than perpetuating
their testosterone-laden image.

75
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,041
By "protecting us" he is
actually attempting to disguise

76
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,750
the fact that he
is weak and unable

77
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,583
of even protecting himself.

78
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,416
You're such
a clever girl, Hinagiku.

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,750
Don't you think
that's a little harsh?

80
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,541
Fine then, what do women
like you want to hear?

81
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,625
Maybe something like, "I would
never leave my lover alone."

82
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:10,833
"If we fight, it'll be together.
If we fail, we fail together."

83
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,750
"Even if I were to die,
I promise you that I will never

84
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,125
leave your side, my love."

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
Benibara, we thought
you'd never show.

86
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,333
What are we going
to do with you?

87
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
So tell us where you found
this lovely young lady.

88
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,250
I just met her
outside of the school.

89
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,041
She may be dressed as
a boy but I knew the truth.

90
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,625
She has such pretty,
maidenly eyes.

91
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,833
Uh, thanks, I guess?

92
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,291
Wow, her skin
is incredibly soft.

93
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,916
Isn't it, though?

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,833
I think this one's going to be
a little diamond in the rough.

95
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,583
Don't go touching my Haruhi
without asking my permission!

96
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,166
Leave her alone!

97
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,833
She punched me!
She's so violent!

98
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,666
Get a hold of yourself!

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,666
Guess the rumors
we heard are true.

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,750
You guys are just a bunch
of weak little punks with

101
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,166
no sense between you.

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,125
Those uniforms.
I assume you ladies are from

103
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,125
the Lobelia Girls' Academy?

104
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,875
That's correct.

105
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,791
Lobelia!

106
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,500
Lobelia!

107
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,500
Lobelia!

108
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:29,125
St. Lobelia Academy, high
school 2nd-Year, Benio Amakusa.

109
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,583
Lobelia.

110
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,291
2nd-Year student,
Chizuraru Maihara.

111
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,708
Lobelia.

112
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,416
1st-Year student,
Hinako Tsuwabuki.

113
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Lobelia.

114
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,583
We are the members
of St. Lobelia Academy's

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:51,000
white lily league
also known as--

116
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,875
The Zuka Club!

117
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,958
The Zuka Club?

118
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,791
Oh man, what a stupid name!
The Zuka Club! My stomach hurts!

119
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,833
The Zuka Club! That's priceless!

120
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,625
And they had those get-ups
on under their uniforms!

121
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,750
You shouldn't
underestimate the Zuka Club!

122
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,250
I may not know much
about instant coffee but

123
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,958
I'm fascinated
with girls' schools.

124
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,375
St. Lobelia Academy! It is
truly a woman's world there.

125
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,083
The Zuka club is a group
of strong young maidens

126
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:09,083
who consider women
to be superior in every way.

127
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,125
The club prides itself
on its 30 year history.

128
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:17,083
It's a society of maidens,
by maidens, for maidens.

129
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,750
Zuka Club activities include:
"Maiden Tea Parties",

130
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,541
"The Maiden Debate Forum", and
most importantly musical reviews

131
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,500
performed by the
society's top members.

132
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,166
You sure have a vast wealth
of knowledge, Renge.

133
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,708
Well, I've always
admired St. Lobelia's.

134
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,208
I just couldn't go to school
there though- what would I do

135
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,375
without any boys?

136
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,500
A maiden's beauty.

137
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,250
It means possessing a spirit
pure enough to not give in

138
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,875
to power or to lust.

139
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,625
"As a girl, you"
"for a girl, you"

140
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,708
We've had quite enough
of all your oppressive

141
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,958
male contempt for woman-kind.

142
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,666
And our pride.

143
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,708
Comes from having meaningful
relationships based on

144
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:13,583
equality because
we're the same sex.

145
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,041
And yes, that includes
relationships of love.

146
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,791
Yeah, You tell them, Benio.

147
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,750
You're awesome, Benibara!

148
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
Whatever. We're so over it.

149
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,041
Why don't you gals just scram?

150
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,208
I find it hard to believe
that you silly boys

151
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,000
have nothing to say about
our sublime female love.

152
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,708
What the hell
is she talking about?

153
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,875
Hey, I haven't seen this one
before. I guess it's a new one.

154
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,541
You should feel
sorry for them, Hinagiku.

155
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,041
Their patented host skills
didn't work on us-

156
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,750
now they're all flustered
and they don't know

157
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,458
what to do with themselves.

158
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,958
True, I must say I'm glad
we decided to perform here.

159
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,833
It was fun to sneak a peek at
the notorious Ouran Host Club.

160
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,208
Hey guys, are we
really notorious?

161
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,625
Yeah.

162
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,583
And to think they're
dragging this sweet young girl

163
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,166
down with them.

164
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,500
The host club's president
may be a pretty little halfer.

165
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,708
But he shouldn't be using
his looks to create

166
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,916
a fictitious romance! Attempting
to fool the heart of a pure,

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,458
young maiden is demeaning!

168
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,958
Your so-called "club activities"
are nothing more

169
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,333
than debasing macho fantasies.

170
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,875
I promise you, we will
bring you guys down.

171
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,750
The Ouran Host Club
will be abolished!

172
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,750
All hail Zuka Club!

173
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,208
I see. I understand your
concern, but do you think

174
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,083
maybe we could
finish this later?

175
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Are you saying that
you're not going to face us?

176
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,458
Not at all.

177
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,125
It's just that our president
is still bedridden

178
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,791
from the initial culture shock.

179
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,083
You see Tama-chan is having
his nappy time right now.

180
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,250
Wake him up!

181
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,791
'Scuse me. I made some coffee,
would you ladies like some?

182
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,500
Why, yes! Aren't you
the sweetest thing?

183
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,416
You're a real pearl
among swine!

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,875
You know, coffee made
by a maiden always has

185
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,291
a more fragrant aroma.

186
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,416
But this stuff's just instant.

187
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,625
How about the four of us
have a little tea party?

188
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,458
You girls have it all wrong!
Don't you see there's

189
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,250
nothing to be gained
in a romantic relationship

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,083
between two women?!
If that were the case then

191
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
why did God create
Adam and Eve?!

192
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,875
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

193
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,500
You gotta be
more careful, senpai.

194
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,958
Thanks, Haruhi. Do you always
carry bandages around with you?

195
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,041
Nah. The supermarket
was giving 'em out with

196
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,250
the purchase of instant coffee.

197
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,208
You always get free stuff
at the supermarket.

198
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,875
Free stuff?

199
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,250
This little conversation doesn't
seem to be going anywhere.

200
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,125
Now that we know what's
going on, we can't allow this

201
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,041
maiden to stay here.
We'll prepare her paperwork and

202
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,333
have her transferred
to Lobelia at once.

203
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,958
And we'll welcome her
into the Zuka Club!

204
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,416
Hey, just wait
a second, will ya?

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,041
There seem to have been some
misunderstandings here.

206
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,166
I mean, first of all,
you called Tamaki a "halfer".

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,958
Cause he is a halfer. He's
half French and half Japanese!

208
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,958
Well, uh, anway, I don't think
it's fair for you to pick on

209
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,958
the host club just because
you don't think they have

210
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,625
the same history you do.

211
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,500
We barely have any history-
we were just founded

212
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,541
two years ago.

213
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,666
Yeah, The boss
created it whenever

214
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
he started high school here.

215
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,416
Be that as it may, saying their
club activities are only held

216
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,666
to satisfy their appetites is
just wrong. I mean, it's not

217
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,541
like the host club is charging
their guests or anything.

218
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,416
While I wouldn't call
it a charge we do have

219
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,000
a point system. We offer
priority services based on

220
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,666
the winning bids of auctions
held on our website.

221
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,625
Check this out, Haruhi. Your
used mechanical pencil just sold

222
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,500
with a winning bid of
30,000 yen. Good for you.

223
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,041
What?! But I thought
I'd lost that pencil!

224
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,541
Why didn't you tell me about
this before, Kyoya-senpai?!

225
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,541
I had no idea you
were collecting money!

226
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,250
So, you thought we were all just
working here as volunteers?

227
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,500
While it's not much

228
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,041
because of the expense
of organizing events,

229
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,000
we happen to make a small profit
from the online auctions.

230
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,458
You can't go selling
people's things without

231
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
asking their permission!
That's stealing!

232
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,666
It wasn't stealing you dropped
your pencil on the floor.

233
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,875
I'm sorry, Haruhi! It's not like
we were hiding it from you!

234
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Here, you can have mine! It's
got a cute teddy bear on it!

235
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,333
Senpai, I don't want you pencil.

236
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,708
Then to make it up to you
how about I do this.

237
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,166
I'll tell you the secrets to my
success and my fondest memories.

238
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,708
Not to be rude senpai,
but I'm really not interested

239
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,458
in that information.

240
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,208
Not interested?

241
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,291
Oh you poor dear.
I can't believe they've

242
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,833
been deceiving you.

243
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,916
Hey, why don't you just dump
these losers and come with us?

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,583
Hold on, Hinagiku. This young
maiden has had quite a day.

245
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,083
We'll give you some time
to think about it.

246
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,958
We'll come back
for your answer tomorrow.

247
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,041
Well then.

248
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
Adieu.

249
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,125
I'd better be going.
I've got some thinking to do.

250
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,291
Why did you have
to tell her the truth?!

251
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,958
You just added fuel to the fire!
What am I going to do now?

252
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,458
The facts are the facts.

253
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,291
Maybe we should've
asked before we sold

254
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,875
her pencil on the internet.

255
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,625
Yeah, for all we know it was
a keepsake from her mother.

256
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,375
Nah, it was just a freebie
they were giving out

257
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,333
at an electronics store.

258
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,875
Gentlemen, just think about it.

259
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,375
Haruhi may be
basically indifferent,

260
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,708
but if she had to choose
we know that she tends

261
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,708
to favor men's clothing. And
besides, when she first joined

262
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,791
the Host Club
didn't she tell us-

263
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,958
Being a host and getting
fussed over by a bunch of girls

264
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,166
might not be that bad.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,583
Why didn't I realize this
before? Perhaps they would be

266
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,666
a better match for Haruhi.
Maybe she'd be better off.

267
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,208
With the Zuka Club.

268
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,791
Yeah, she's perfect
for a girl's school.

269
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,416
Haru-chan is going to
transfer away!

270
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,833
What are we going to do?

271
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,791
Haruhi's so smart, passing
Lobelia's scholarship test

272
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,250
will be a piece of cake!

273
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,541
And Lobelia Academy
has the money to pay off

274
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,333
the 8 million yen debt
she owes us.

275
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,416
Calm down, gentlemen.
It'll be alright.

276
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Listen to what I have to say.

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,375
 I have a secret plan.

278
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,916
Lo!

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,458
Bel!

280
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,625
I!

281
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,166
A!

282
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:16,250
Ah!

283
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,541
I thought today's performance
went extremely well.

284
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,500
Our singing and acting skills
are admired wherever we go.

285
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,916
That's true, but the main event
has yet to begin, right girls?

286
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,625
Hi, young maiden.

287
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,000
We've come for your decision,
are you prepared to leave?

288
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,625
We're ready to confront
those Ouran Host Club idiots

289
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,750
and set things straight
once and for all.

290
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,541
Set what straight?

291
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,333
That you should come with us.

292
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,666
And go to school
with your own kind!

293
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,291
Ouran!

294
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,875
Ouran!

295
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,416
Ouran!

296
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,083
Ouran!

297
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,583
Ouran!

298
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,250
Ouran!

299
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,916
Host Club!

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,708
Welcomes you!

301
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,458
Oh, Haruhi, welcome back.

302
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,916
Look Haru-chan! I'm a
princess now! Aren't I cute?!

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,208
What is the meaning of this?!

304
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,375
Are you trying to make
fun of woman kind?!

305
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,583
Make fun? No,
that's not it at all.

306
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,666
Everything's going
according to plan.

307
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,291
Our strategy is guaranteed to
make even a crying child smile;

308
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,333
it's the Freebie Campaign!

309
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,375
My dears, you ladies have
all lived sheltered lives

310
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,500
at Lobelia, so you might not
know that commoners are weak.

311
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,500
They have a weakness
for free things.

312
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,625
Haruhi, you may be
distracted by the Zuka Club,

313
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,000
but choose us.

314
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,666
And you gain not only
a host club full of brothers

315
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,916
but sisters as well!

316
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,416
See? This way you can
experience feminine bonding

317
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,833
while staying in the host club!

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,125
Isn't that a great idea?!
Aren't I pretty?

319
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,541
We're the Hitachin Sisters!
Which one of us is prettier?

320
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,958
I'm just teasing you.

321
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,916
Listen Haru-chan!

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,083
You can call me
Big Sis from now on.

323
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,666
Why you! Do you idiots
really think you can

324
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,166
win her over like this? I've had
enough of your fooling around!

325
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,708
This is too much!

326
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,583
I don't even get what you
guys are tryin' to do!

327
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,000
I know you're a bunch
of goofballs but geez!

328
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,750
Are we really that funny?

329
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,750
Call me Big Sister! C'mon do
it! Just say it! Big Sister!

330
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,333
Say it, please?!

331
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
Come on, cut it out!

332
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,416
What were you thinking?
What's gotten into you guys?

333
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,708
We did this because
we don't want you

334
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,791
to leave the host club, Haruhi.

335
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,791
Well, maiden,
have you made a choice?

336
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,208
Yeah, I have. I'm sorry
but your club's not for me.

337
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,833
I think the idea of a
girl's school is great and

338
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,208
I think your views are very
unique and interesting.

339
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,208
But I came to this school with
a goal and a plan for my future-

340
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,208
so while I appreciate the offer,
I really already knew

341
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,000
that I was never going
to leave Ouran Academy.

342
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,750
Haruhi!

343
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,125
Hold on! If you knew
you weren't going to leave

344
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
then why did you act
so angry yesterday?

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,791
How would you feel if
I stole something of yours

346
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,208
without asking you?! I really
liked that mechanical pencil

347
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,791
it was easy to write with!

348
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,375
I'm sorry, but I was nice and
offered you my teddy bear pencil

349
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,166
in return and you said
you didn't want it!

350
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,333
That's right and
I still don't want it.

351
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,041
Um, Benio.

352
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,333
Yes... I know.

353
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,291
We're not going to
give up on you, maiden.

354
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,708
I swear this to you.

355
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,250
Someday we'll come and
rescue you from this place!

356
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,458
And when we do we'll abolish
the Ouran Host Club!

357
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,291
 Well, Adieu!

358
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:50,125
And so a new rival, the
Zuka Club, has appeared.

359
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,166
From this point on the story's
gonna get even more exciting!

360
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,291
What's gonna happen to our
beloved host club boys next?

361
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,083
Hang in there, Host Club!
Don't give up, boys!

362
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,333
Hey! It's not your job
to cook things up!

363
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,833
Is Haruhi really suffering
in a life of poverty?!

364
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,416
I have to go see for myself!

365
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,625
You're just gonna cause trouble.
You don't need to come over.

366
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,166
Whoa, you're Haruhi's father?

367
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,666
Next time, "A Day in the Life
of the Fujioka Family!"

368
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,833
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

369
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,208
We'll see you then!
