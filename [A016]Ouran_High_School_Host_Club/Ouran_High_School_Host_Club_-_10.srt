1
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,000
This can't be right.

2
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,583
Hey everyone.
Why don't you come in?

3
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,166
I know it's not much, but
please, make yourself at home.

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,125
I'll make us some tea.

5
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,666
Um. I'm sorry; we don't
have enough cups but

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,500
we do have some bowls.

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,875
Here ya go.

8
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,458
Hey boss. What's with
this place? She lives here?!

9
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,875
Maybe it's some kind of set.
You know, like in the movies?

10
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,333
I-I-I-I-I-I hope so.

11
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,583
Calm down you guys. I bet
this is the storeroom.

12
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm positive infinite cosmos
is just on the other side

13
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,541
of that closet.

14
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,125
Then should we try to open it?

15
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,041
Now's not the time.

16
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,458
Right.

17
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,333
Since you guys decided
to come by at lunch time my dad

18
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,291
said it would be rude
if I didn't offer you something

19
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,583
to eat. We've been fasting
for 3 days to save up money

20
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:26,250
to buy something suited
to your taste but it's all

21
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,583
worth it as long
as you guys like it.

22
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,041
Ta-da! A sushi sampler!

23
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:35,250
It was marked down at the
supermarket! How about that?

24
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,666
Sorry we came to visit
Haru-chan don't make us eat it!

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
Be strong men, Haruhi
has suffered for our benefit

26
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,791
so it's the least we can do.

27
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,958
But sir, I'm not even
sure this is fish.

28
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,458
Wow!

29
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,750
I can't believe it isn't this
is a piece of fancy tuna?

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,208
I've never tasted it til now.

31
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,583
It's delicious!

32
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,208
What?! No Haruhi,
that's just regular old tuna!

33
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,166
It's by no means fancy!

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Just a dream.

35
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,208
Morning, Master Tamaki.
Anything we can do for you?

36
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,083
I need to get going.
Please bring the car

37
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,375
around front at once.

38
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,791
Yes, of course, sir.

39
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,083
I beg your pardon, Master
Tamaki, but what would you

40
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,625
like for breakfast this morning?

41
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't want any! I already
told you I have to get going!

42
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
I can't shake that nightmare
I had this morning.

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,541
I respect the privacy of
our club members so I've

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,375
never intruded into
their personal lives but-

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,083
What if Haruhi really
is living in poverty?!

46
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,500
What if that hovel is
her home?! I have to go see

47
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,916
Haruhi and try to get
the truth out of her.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,250
I've got to get to school.

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,208
Hold it right there,
Master Tamaki!

50
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,250
I can't let you leave
the house like that.

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,083
You're still wearing
your pajama bottoms and

52
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,833
your house slippers.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,833
Well, he's not the
brightest young man.

54
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,958
Thank you, Shima.
I'll be going now.

55
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:21,000
I hate to be a bother, Master
Tamaki, but today is Sunday.

56
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,416
Which means you don't have
to go to school today, sir.

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,125
Oh, really? Well why
didn't you make me aware

58
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,833
of that fact earlier?

59
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,541
As your maid it's my duty
to help you, however,

60
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,833
I want you to become
a fine gentleman.

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,208
So you must be able to
recognize your own mistakes.

62
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,875
Since you suddenly have some
free time on your hands,

63
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,791
why don't we work
on your manners?

64
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,041
But I have to make a call!
Someone bring the phone!

65
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,041
Sure!

66
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,875
Hey Kyoya, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

67
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,041
"A Day in the Life
of the Fujioka Family"

68
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,208
That was some sale!
There's no better time

69
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,791
to hit the supermarket
than a Sunday morning.

70
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,791
Now all I've gotta do when
I get home is clean and

71
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,166
do some laundry.

72
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,375
What's going on? Why're they
in front of our apartments?

73
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,333
Check out that car...

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,958
Here you are, Master.

75
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,500
Wow, so this
is where Haruhi lives?

76
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,041
It's pretty big, huh?
Bigger than I thought it'd be.

77
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,750
Yeah! Look at all the rooms!

78
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,875
This building is what you might
call an aggregate commoner

79
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,666
dwelling. Haruhi's home
is just one of many units

80
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,041
in this building.

81
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,208
Kyoya! Why?! Why'd you
bring these idiots with us?!

82
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,250
Especially those
two doppelgangers!

83
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,375
Well you see. I knew you
didn't have the courage

84
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
to come here alone
so I thought it'd be best

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,125
if everyone came along.

86
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,916
Alright, let's go home.
I guess I underestimated

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,958
our great leader.

88
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,791
What?! I'm not going home!!

89
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry. Don't leave.
I don't want to be alone.

90
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,416
Is this for some kinda
movie shoot or something?

91
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,583
Rich people! Rich people!

92
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,333
Now listen up, men.
Don't you forget!

93
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,958
We must be polite. This is
a casual "we just happened

94
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,041
to be in the neighborhood"
kind of visit.

95
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,083
We're not here to judge the
Fujioka family's lifestyle.

96
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
The words "shabby,"
"cramped," and "run-down"

97
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,416
are absolutely forbidden!

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,958
Right! Yes, sir!

99
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,625
Don't say anything that might
offend Haruhi or her father

100
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,291
and cause them
to ask us to leave.

101
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,458
Well it's too late
for that- go away!

102
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,833
Haruhi!

103
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,541
That pink dress is pretty cute!

104
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,666
Shut up! Get
the hell outta here!

105
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Haruhi's so mad
she actually cursed at us!

106
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,166
--All of this is your fault!
--Hey, It wasn't us.

107
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,041
Excuse me, Haruhi,
but is everything alright?

108
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,416
Oh hi, Miss Landlady.

109
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Those young men are driving
such fancy foreign cars

110
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,291
they're not Yakuza, are they?

111
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,500
No, they're not.

112
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,583
Do you want me
to call the police for you?

113
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,458
Pleased to meet you, madam.

114
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,166
My name's Suou I'm one
of Haruhi's friends.

115
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,791
Really? My goodness, well
aren't you just adorable?

116
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,541
And he's got her.

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
We're just stopping by; we
didn't mean to cause a scene.

118
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,666
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,375
Oh, it's no problem.

120
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll stop by later with some
snacks for you and your friends.

121
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,250
See you later!

122
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,458
Okay, here's the deal,
I'm only giving you guys

123
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,000
a quick peak. 3 seconds.
Then you all go home, got it?

124
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,916
Look, I brought you
a gift Haru-chan.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,458
I know how you love cake;
there's both chocolate

126
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
and strawberry! I think
we should have some!

127
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,750
Fine, guess I'll make some tea.

128
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,666
At least it's
better than my dream.

129
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,625
What a hovel.

130
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,916
Shut up!

131
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,375
A wood-built 2 bedroom unit.

132
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,250
That's normal for
a commoner family of 2.

133
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,750
Haruhi's such a pipsqueak,
At least we know she won't

134
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,791
hit her head on
the low ceilings.

135
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,458
Well, I think it's
a super cute, little room!

136
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,208
You don't have to struggle
to compliment it.

137
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,208
Hold on, are we supposed
to take off our shoes, too?

138
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,541
Please, if you don't mind.

139
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,083
Did you hear that? We have
to take our shoes off!

140
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,333
It's kinda like going
to the dojo, huh?

141
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,416
Yeah.

142
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,041
Do you have any slippers
for us, Haruhi?

143
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,375
Wait, the room's covered
with tatami mats.

144
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,500
In that case,
we don't need slippers.

145
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,166
Great; thanks
for inviting us in!

146
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,166
Yeah, thanks.

147
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,583
It's greatly appreciated.

148
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,166
Yes, thanks Haruhi.

149
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,000
Whoa! Talk about small!

150
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,583
Ow.

151
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,500
Be careful. That light bulb's
just hanging from the ceiling.

152
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,708
This place is quite
unpleasant but I think I may

153
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,625
have underestimated
commoner housing.

154
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,333
I know it's a tight fit
in here men but just

155
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,041
pull your knees in
and sit gym-style.

156
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,000
Commoners have specially
developed this position

157
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,500
to conserve space.

158
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,916
I just gotta get
through this visit.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,750
I should've expected
this from them.

160
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,416
I'm gonna go
make us some tea.

161
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,666
Hey. Here's an idea.

162
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,208
Why don't you make us this?

163
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,958
It's black tea that
our father brought us

164
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,583
as a souvenir from
Africa. Here.Try it.

165
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,666
Um, sure, no problem.

166
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,458
It's best served as
a milk tea. Do you have milk?

167
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,125
I think.When was the last time
that I bought some milk?

168
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,750
Stop it! What the
hell are you doing?!

169
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
Don't be so mean
to her, you idiots!

170
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,750
What do you mean?

171
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,333
I know you're trying
to embarrass her by asking for

172
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
that African tea.

173
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,708
Look! She has no idea how
she's supposed to prepare it!

174
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,166
She doesn't even
have a teapot!

175
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,000
And she's too embarrassed
to tell us that she doesn't!

176
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,458
I'm sorry, Haruhi. You don't
have to go to all that trouble.

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,708
We don't need any tea,
We'd be fine with

178
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,416
a glass of water.

179
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,583
What? It's no trouble,
besides. I've already made it.

180
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,541
Oh, well then in that case.

181
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,166
Man, that was
a close one, boss.

182
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,375
We have been rescued
by commoners' wisdom.

183
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,875
What do you mean, sir?

184
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,833
Nothing we know to be true in
our world holds true here.

185
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,500
We have to be
careful how we react.

186
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,083
One little offhanded
remark could

187
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,125
break Haruhi's heart.
That means, in this fight.

188
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,708
The first person
to embarrass Haruhi loses.

189
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,791
While your antics are amusing
I don't understand why

190
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,166
you feel the need
to turn this into a contest.

191
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,208
Okay guys, the tea's ready.

192
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,666
I'm sorry that not
all of the cups match.

193
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,500
At least she's not using chipped
bowls and measuring cups.

194
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,625
Come on, Haru-chan!
You can choose your cake first.

195
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,166
You sure Honey-senpai?

196
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,583
Go ahead. We're rich- we eat
this kinda stuff all the time.

197
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,500
 Well in that case.

198
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,791
I was trying to
be considerate!

199
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,166
I'll have the strawberry.

200
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,500
She's so cute!

201
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,083
Okay Haru-chan...

202
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,041
I wish I could tell her how cute
she is but there's no telling

203
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,416
what might offend her.

204
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,875
The traps of the commoner's
world are terrifying!

205
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,500
You like strawberries,
right? You can have mine.

206
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,875
Thanks! That's nice
of you, Mori-senpai.

207
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,333
Why didn't we think of that?!

208
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,375
I should've been sharing
strawberries with her!

209
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,458
Why'd we let him trick us?!

210
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,416
Eating all that cake
sure wet my appetite.

211
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,541
Yeah, isn't it
lunchtime about now?

212
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,416
Well then,
what's for lunch?

213
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Would you guys quit being so
happy-go-lucky all the time,

214
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,416
please?

215
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,625
We'll take care of it.
We did drop in unexpectedly.

216
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,458
So we'll pay for lunch,
why don't you just order

217
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,250
all of us some of
your favorite sushi.

218
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,583
Thanks but no thanks.
I know that if I let

219
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,166
you guys pay I'll
only regret it later.

220
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,666
Oh, don't worry, Haruhi.
We'll just pay for it

221
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,416
using the profits
from the photos of you

222
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,791
we auctioned off.

223
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,000
So I'm really paying
for it after all.

224
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,458
Well, if that's what you want,
I do have a friend who runs

225
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,083
a nice little sushi shop
nearby so I can just give him

226
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,666
a call. Their stuff's
pretty high quality.

227
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,458
"Be careful, Haruhi. Just
because the sushi's packaging

228
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,833
says 'premium' doesn't mean
that it's high quality."

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,916
I'm not stupid. I could
figure that out on my own.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
How could you do that?!
Daddy even attempted to look

231
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,875
casual and not embarrass you!

232
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,041
I'd really love it if you'd
make us something for lunch,

233
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:43,916
Haru-chan!

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,250
No, Honey-senpai!

235
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,750
How could you ask that of her?!

236
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,250
Don't upset her!
Try to restrain yourself!

237
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,791
I guess I could whip
something up but

238
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,291
it's gonna take me some time.

239
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
We can wait!

240
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,750
Why didn't we think
of asking her that?!!

241
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,916
This means that we'll get
to eat Haruhi's cooking!

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,541
I'm gonna have to go
to the supermarket again.

243
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,708
We're coming with you!

244
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,791
We want to see
a commoner's supermarket!

245
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,333
Me, too! Me, too!

246
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,041
This could be
a learning experience.

247
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,541
Yay! Commoners' supermarket!
Commoners' supermarket!

248
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,541
This is gonna be fun!

249
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,041
Well, that's it. So much
for having the day off today.

250
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,750
Hey, senpai?

251
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,666
Aren't you coming with us?

252
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,125
I am I just wanted to pay
my respects to your mother

253
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,833
before we left.

254
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,375
Thank you.
You don't have to do that.

255
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,833
Looks like you
take after your mom.

256
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,333
I guess. That's what
my dad always tells me.

257
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,458
She was a beautiful woman and I
bet she was a smart one as well.

258
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,291
I'm not really
a good judge of beauty.

259
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,000
But she was smart.
She was a lawyer.

260
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,208
Oh yeah? No doubt
she was a great lawyer!

261
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,416
I can tell. Trust me, you
can't fool my eyes, Haruhi.

262
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
I don't know if
I trust your eyes, Senpai.

263
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,166
But my mom.

264
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,916
Well, Haruhi, your mom's gonna
go out there and do her best.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,250
Watch, we're gonna
win this one!

266
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,833
She was a great lawyer.

267
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,416
Everyone's outside
waiting for us,

268
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,375
we should probably get
going, don't you think?

269
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,250
That hurt.
Are you okay, Haruhi?!

270
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,250
I'm fine, but you
are kinda heavy.

271
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,416
I'm home, Haruhi! Hey,
why'd you leave the door open?

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,750
Welcome home, Dad.

273
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,583
At that moment
her father came home.

274
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,333
From his shift
at the tranny bar.

275
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,000
He saw his
daughter pinned down.

276
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,208
Or so it appeared.

277
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,708
Forcefully being held.

278
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,083
Or so it appeared.

279
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,125
By some strange boy.

280
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,750
"Dad"? You gotta be
kidding! This transvestite

281
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,791
is Haruhi's father?

282
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,791
So Dad, how was work?

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,708
Just stay calm.
It was an accident.

284
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,291
I'm sure he'll understand
if I explain what happened.

285
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,791
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,875
I hated having to
leave you alone last night.

287
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,208
You must have been lonely.

288
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,500
That sound.
He really hit hard.

289
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,791
Oh, dear, my left arm
has been bothering me lately.

290
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,916
It's so sore- like I went
hand-to-hand with some

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,416
ferocious beast. Maybe I've
just been working too hard.

292
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,708
Please, sir. It's not
what it looked like.

293
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,125
Hot tea?! I'll get it for you!

294
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,666
Do you use firewood
to boil it, Haruhi?

295
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,708
Help me out-
your dad wants tea!

296
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,958
Oh my. Would you look
at that, I seem

297
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,375
to have come across
a little pest.

298
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,875
Would you like to tell me
why you're addressing

299
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,333
my daughter with such
informality, young man?

300
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,250
Hey boss, what in the world
is taking you so long?

301
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,208
Whoa, check it out, that
person we passed downstairs

302
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,500
is Haruhi's father!

303
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,250
Hikaru! Kaoru!
Help me out here!

304
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,708
It's nice to meet you,
Haruhi's dad. We're good friends

305
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,083
of your daughter's,
the Hitachin Brothers.

306
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,916
So you're a transvestite,
aren't you?

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,833
You're the first real
transvestite we've ever seen!

308
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,166
You finally put the moves
on Haruhi, huh boss?

309
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,166
Sorry about him. He's a ladies'
man if you know what I mean.

310
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
He's a pheromone machine. In
fact, I bet he's fooled around

311
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,750
with more ladies
than you can count!

312
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,458
He likes to fool around, huh?

313
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,875
No! I'm not a ladies man! I'm
a nice guy! I care about her!

314
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,583
Is he confessing his love?

315
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,666
I'm being
completely honest here.

316
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,041
I care about Haruhi
like she's my own daughter.

317
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,083
I get it. You must be the Host
Club I've heard so much about.

318
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,625
You certainly are a fine
looking bunch of young men.

319
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,583
I'm not sure which
of you I like best.

320
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,916
What about you, dear?
I tell you what,

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,291
why don't you boys
go ahead and call me Ranka?

322
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,916
That's the professional name
I use at the transvestite bar

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,208
I work at.

324
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,208
Professional name?
You mean, like a stage name?

325
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,791
Exactly like that, Mitsukuni.

326
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,833
Hold on! How did
you know my name, sir?

327
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,208
You two are 3rd years
Mitsukuni Haninozuka

328
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,916
and Takashi Morinozuka.

329
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,041
And the two of you are first
years in the same class

330
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,625
as Haruhi.

331
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,916
You're the Hitachin twins, but
I'm not sure which one of you

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,916
is which! I've heard
a lot about you!

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,041
What? So Haruhi's
told you about us?

334
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,583
No. Kyoya told me about
you two over the phone.

335
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,750
You know, you're really are
a beautiful person, Ranka.

336
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,875
Say what?!

337
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,458
Kyoya.

338
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,541
We've been entrusted with the
care of his precious daughter,

339
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,708
it is only natural
that we introduce ourselves

340
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,666
and give him periodic reports.

341
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,541
Ordinarily, that would be
your job, wouldn't it?

342
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,291
I'm impressed the Club
has such a capable president.

343
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,125
But wait a minute,
you're only the vice-president

344
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,375
aren't you Kyoya? I guess
that president of yours

345
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,958
is pretty much good
for nothing, huh?

346
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,666
You never mentioned
this to me, Dad!

347
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,875
Why didn't you say
that you've been

348
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,500
getting calls
from Kyoya-senpai?!

349
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,250
What am I supposed
to do Haruhi?

350
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
You rarely tell me
anything about school.

351
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,000
So that makes it okay
to talk behind my back?

352
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,250
C'mon senpai would you please
stop growing mushrooms

353
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
in other people's closets?!

354
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,291
Haruhi, the thing
about you is--

355
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,625
You're cute
even when you're angry!

356
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,708
I don't know what it is
about him but Haruhi's dad

357
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,250
reminds me of someone.

358
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,750
This explains why she's
so good at handling the boss.

359
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,000
Wait, Haruhi,
where are you going?

360
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,500
The supermarket, alright?

361
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,208
I have to go shopping
and I wanna do it by myself.

362
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,375
So all of you just stay here
and try to behave yourselves,

363
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,833
Wait! We want to go to the
commoner's supermarket!

364
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,208
I wouldn't push it.

365
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,166
Once she's made her mind up
she'll never change it!

366
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,541
When she decided she wanted
to go to Ouran Academy

367
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,666
she did all of the enrollment
paperwork by herself.

368
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,833
While I respect her independent
spirit I wish she'd

369
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,625
be a little more dependent
on me sometimes.

370
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,083
Haruhi!

371
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,833
So Why didn't you
tell me that today was

372
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,416
"bring your parents
to school" day?

373
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,833
Sorry Dad, but I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you to go!

374
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,666
What? She's not goin'
through a rebellious phase.

375
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,375
Listen, I hate to be the one
to break it to you buddy,

376
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,375
but I have a feeling
she didn't invite you to school

377
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,833
with her cause she's embarrassed
her daddy's a tranny.

378
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,083
So I like to wear women's
clothing! What's it matter?!

379
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
I'll never love anyone
the way I loved Kotoko

380
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,833
and she never had a problem
with it! So lay off, would ya?!

381
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,916
Hey, Haruhi!
I brought your dad home!

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,750
He's drunk himself
stupid again!

383
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,958
Hello my darling! I'm home!

384
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,458
You smell like a bar.

385
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,125
He's pretty upset
about not getting to go

386
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,583
to "bring your parents
to school" day today.

387
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,541
You should invite him next time.

388
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,916
I can't.

389
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,583
I didn't invite you
'cause you work so hard

390
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,125
I thought you could
use the time off.

391
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,875
I know that you're
pretty tired, Dad.

392
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,541
So I thought you should use
your day off to catch up

393
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,166
on your sleep.

394
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,125
I want you to take
better care of yourself.

395
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,791
I hope you boys know
how grateful I am.

396
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,041
Since she's found,
you she seems to be happier,

397
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,458
she's enjoying herself.

398
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,541
Wouldn't you agree,
Tamaki Suou?

399
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,916
You know who I am?!

400
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,083
Well of course I do,
Haruhi's told me a thing or two

401
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,791
about you. You're the Host
Club's bumbling president,

402
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,958
right?

403
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,541
So, she talks about the Host
Club at home, after all.

404
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,875
Come to think of it you're
the one who didn't realize

405
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,416
Haruhi was a girl until
the very last moment.

406
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,083
You're clueless, aren't you?
Pretty pathetic.

407
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,458
Now that we've gotten all the
introductions out of the way.

408
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,041
How would you boys like
to have a little fun?

409
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,166
Why didn't he tell me?

410
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,333
I had no idea that
Kyoya-senpai's been calling

411
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,416
my dad and giving him updates.

412
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,250
So we're going to follow
her to the supermarket?

413
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,875
This is what
you meant by "fun"?

414
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,375
Yes! I call it
the stalking game.

415
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,958
What an attractive group
of young men!

416
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,625
 In all honesty.

417
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,541
I have a completely selfish
reason for bringing you

418
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,875
out with me. I want to be seen
with a bunch of cute boys!

419
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,875
Sure enough. Those two
are definitely cut

420
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,500
from the same cloth.

421
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,125
Do you really think it's
necessary to follow her

422
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,958
around like this? Are you
that worried about her?

423
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,833
As you know, Haruhi lost
her mother at a young age

424
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,000
and afterwards she took on
all of the household chores

425
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,625
and shopping by herself.

426
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,708
I decided to start following
her whenever she would

427
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:05,500
leave the house. Maybe I'm
just being overprotective.

428
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,666
I worry about her all the time.

429
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm the only one who
can protect her, you know.

430
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,000
Hold on.

431
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,458
Hey, what're you
doing here, Dad?

432
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,500
Oh, it looks like
you caught me Haruhi!

433
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,125
I followed you here
so that I could carry

434
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,000
your shopping basket! You know
how daddy loves accessories!

435
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,416
Now why don't you
just hand it over?

436
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,791
 You're so weird.

437
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,666
Either she doesn't know
how to depend on others

438
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,791
or she refuses to. She's
always been so independent

439
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,083
and so strong.

440
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,708
And she has this uncanny
ability to affect others

441
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,666
without even realizing it.

442
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
That's true. I've seen it.

443
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291
I understand.

444
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,583
What do you mean,
"I understand"?

445
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,875
Don't think you're
gonna win me over

446
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,666
just because you're
handsome. I'm warning you

447
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,458
I'm not ready to let go yet!

448
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,375
You could at least
let go of my face!

449
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,250
You've got some nerve!
You barely even know Haruhi!

450
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,333
That means-

451
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,791
From this day forward,
you're my enemy!

452
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,000
What the? Hey, what're
you doing here, senpai?

453
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,333
Oh, it looks like
you caught me, Haruhi!

454
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,791
I followed you here
so that I could carry

455
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,750
your shopping basket!
You know how daddy

456
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,625
loves accessories! Now why
don't you just hand it over?

457
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,416
 You're so weird.

458
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,791
What's with the mushrooms?

459
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,875
Weee! Faster, Takashi!

460
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,666
So, does double-coupons
mean I need two of them?

461
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,208
Ah, there's a whole stack
of commoners' coffee.

462
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,583
Was there anything particular
you wanted to eat?

463
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,416
How 'bout a stewpot?

464
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,291
One with lots of meat in
it and no chrysanthemum.

465
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,083
Yeah, That's a great idea.

466
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,875
A stewpot would be good
since we need to feed

467
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,708
a lot of people. It's
kinda warm for it, though.

468
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,458
I know it's going
to happen eventually.

469
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,500
One day my precious little girl
will be all grown up.

470
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,500
And she'll want to have that
special someone by her side.

471
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,083
Just thinking about
it gets my blood boiling!

472
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,750
Here Tamaki,
chrysanthemum, your favorite.

473
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,750
What's going on here?

474
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,125
We didn't know you had
a younger sister, boss!

475
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,250
As of today I will be
your big brother!

476
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,000
You know, you really
should think before you make

477
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,333
promises like that. Next time,
"Big Brother is a Prince".

478
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,875
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

479
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,250
We'll see you then!
