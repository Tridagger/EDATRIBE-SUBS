1
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,916
Can you tell?

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,208
Which of us is Kaoru?
And which of us is Hikaru?

3
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,416
Well, I think you're Hikaru.

4
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,750
The two of us
were always together.

5
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,500
We were like a single entity;
a unique being.

6
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,666
And that closeness was
very important to us.

7
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,125
However, we knew we were
in fact, separate beings.

8
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,666
The one that was
not me was Hikaru.

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,666
And the one that was
not Hikaru was me.

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,416
For us, this concept
was something that was--

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,583
Look's like she's here.

12
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,375
Yeah, you're right.

13
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,125
I'm sorry, were
you waiting long?

14
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,458
I read your letter.

15
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,500
Hikaru.

16
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,833
I'm really sorry, but-- 

17
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,500
I am Kaoru.

18
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,916
You must've gotten my desk
confused with Hikaru's

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and you put your letter
in the wrong one.

20
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,708
Do you think that--You
could like me instead?

21
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,291
I should confess, to be
honest, I've always thought

22
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,208
that you were really cute.

23
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:51,458
And besides, Hikaru has
a crush on someone else.

24
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,500
So, what do you say?

25
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,125
Uh well, I-I guess.

26
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,000
If you're okay with it
then I am too, Kaoru.

27
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,541
I see. Then, hey Kaoru!

28
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,250
She says that she'd
be fine with you instead.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hold on, so then
you are Hikaru?

30
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,250
This is getting old. You girls
just keep falling for it.

31
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,416
You jerk! Why're you so mean?

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
No, you're the one who's mean.

33
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,250
You're okay with
either of us? Really?

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,541
Who do you think you are?

35
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,083
By the way, that hairstyle
doesn't look so great

36
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,375
on you.

37
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,875
If you wanna go out
with us you should work on

38
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,250
your fashion sense.

39
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,958
And next time you write
a love letter make it good!

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,000
They're pretty mean,
aren't they?

41
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,208
Are you all right,
beautiful, young lady?

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,541
Hey Kaoru,
you wanna play a game?

43
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,375
Check it out,
I found a cool site.

44
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,625
Why don't we play
that game on the net?

45
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,416
Those guys are all
a bunch of pansies.

46
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
They're too easy to beat.

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,291
What's the fun in that?

48
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,833
Yeah, that's true. Nevermind.

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,541
Whenever something
got to be boring,

50
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,666
we'd ditch it. That's
just how we did things.

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,458
Man, those Hitachiin twins
are pretty intimidating.

52
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,458
Yeah, it's like they're always
looking down on everyone.

53
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,333
But my dad wants me to
at least try and be friends

54
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
with them.

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,875
Yeah, mine too.

56
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,625
Same here.

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,833
But why even bother?
I don't think those two

58
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,208
like anybody other than
the themselves.

59
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,541
That wasn't entirely true.
There was one person we were

60
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:47,416
very fond of. A maid
who took care of us.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,041
We adored her.

62
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,666
But that was
a very long time ago.

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:57,250
Aw, look at you!
You two look so cute today!

64
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,125
Just like little dolls.

65
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,458
Now the twin with blue hair
is Hikaru and the twin

66
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,625
with pink hair is Kaoru, right?

67
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,333
No, you're wrong, Auntie.
Kaoru's blue and Hikaru's pink.

68
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,625
You always get it wrong.
You must be dumb.

69
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,083
I'm sorry, boys.

70
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,583
It's just that,
you two look so much alike!

71
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,125
And you know what you
look like to us, Auntie?

72
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,458
A frog!

73
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,041
Oh no! You little
troublemakers!

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,041
I'm so sorry, madam!

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,583
We really liked that maid.
She was different.

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,583
She didn't try
to flatter us or win us over

77
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,750
like everyone else
in the house did.

78
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,083
What are you two doing here?

79
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,791
We're night exploring.

80
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,208
Well now that
you've found me out--

81
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,375
I guess, I have to
make sure you stay quiet.

82
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,083
If we push this button--

83
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,625
--all of the security
guards will come running.

84
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,791
Should we try?

85
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,916
Ready. Set.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,166
No! Don't do it!

87
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,625
We have the combination
for that safe.

88
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,416
If you'll play with us
for a little while--

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,666
--we'll give you
this piece of paper.

90
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,875
Fine, so what would
you like to play?

91
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,875
Let's play the
"which one is Hikaru?" game!

92
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,125
Hikaru, you sure the paper
with the combination is safe?

93
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,791
Don't worry. I hid it
in our piggy bank.

94
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,625
She can't get it out
unless she breaks it.

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,166
All we wanted was
for her to be able to tell

96
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,250
the two of us apart.
We really liked

97
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,166
that maid.

98
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Why did you break
your promise?

99
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,583
Sorry boys but
I didn't have a choice.

100
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,041
I can't tell you two apart.

101
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,125
You're identical. You know,
it's possible that no one

102
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,375
will ever be able
to tell which one's which.

103
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,416
That maid, the only
person we ever liked,

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,875
dropped that bomb on us
and then disappeared

105
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,166
into the night.

106
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,625
After that we became
progressively more twisted

107
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,208
as we grew up.

108
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,000
And so we built up
a barrier to keep others from

109
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,625
getting too close to us.

110
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,958
But regardless, there was
always someone too dense

111
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,916
to notice the barrier
that would come along

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,541
and try to befriend us.

113
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,875
You have plenty
of free time, huh?

114
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,625
I have an idea! Why don't
you help me form a club?

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,958
Who the hell is this guy?

116
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,875
Oh. I know who he is.
The girls in class

117
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,250
were talking about him.

118
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,916
You know, he's that
Suou kid that was admitted

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,208
spring semester.

120
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,625
Oh yeah. So this
is the guy, huh?

121
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,583
Yeah! You know me? I had
no idea I was so famous!

122
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,625
Oh my, I guess I'm guilty!

123
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,000
I should have known my internal
and external brilliance

124
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,875
would blind my peers!
But I can't help

125
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,833
but be radiant!

126
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:20,166
So, is this the fate
of God's chosen one?

127
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,208
His beautiful, blessed child?

128
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
Where'd you get
an idea like that?

129
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,625
There's no need to be
concerned about it.

130
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666
Although you're
not yet up to my level,

131
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,083
the two of you do show
quite a bit of promise.

132
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,750
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,125
I'm founding a new club
two months from now.

134
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,583
In April.

135
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,166
Ideally I would like it to
begin as soon as I graduate

136
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,625
into Ouran's High School.

137
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,958
It might be difficult
at first because you'd have to

138
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,250
come up from the
middle school for

139
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,583
the next year.

140
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,166
But I'm sure I can put in
a good word for you

141
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
and work it out.

142
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,333
It's going to be a lot of fun!
I've already asked Kyoya Otori

143
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,625
from my class to join.

144
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,041
I'm sure you know him.

145
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,916
And I'm also asking
high school First Years

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Haninozuka-senpai and
Morinozuka-senpai

147
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,291
to join us.

148
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,916
That's where you two come in.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,208
You're bugging us. Get lost.

150
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,500
We don't hang out with anyone.

151
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,625
And we certainly don't
wanna hang out with you.

152
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,958
But if you're absolutely
determined to get to know

153
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,041
the two of us--

154
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,375
--we should play--

155
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,250
--the "which one of us
is Hikaru?" game! You in?

156
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,708
The rules of the game
are pretty easy.

157
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,333
You just have to pick
which one of us is Hikaru.

158
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,125
And we'll give you one month.

159
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,708
You can guess as many times
as you want in that month

160
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,916
but we'll ask
for your reasoning.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,583
So no random guessing.

162
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,791
For the record, no one has ever
been able to get it right.

163
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,041
If that's all right
with you then try your best.

164
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,833
Looks like he can't handle it.

165
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,416
Who cares about him?
Did you hear that lineup?

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,708
It's obvious why he wants
to add the Hitachiin name.

167
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,500
Its like he's gathering the
kids of high-class families.

168
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,833
I've got one month, right?

169
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,083
Then I accept. But in return,
if I win, you both have

170
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,625
to join my club.

171
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,708
Sorry to break it to you but
there's no doubt in my mind--

172
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,791
-come April, you're both
going to be members.

173
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,791
I am certain of it!

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,125
Our game had commenced.
The clock was ticking.

175
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:24,000
Um, Hikaru, Kaoru, we're
planning a special class event

176
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,666
after this year's
closing ceremonies.

177
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,083
Whatever, I think we'll pass.

178
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,041
But, it's going to be the last
event of our second year.

179
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,708
You know, we really don't care.

180
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,708
The one reading
the book is Hikaru!

181
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,333
Hang on, you can't
barge into our classroom.

182
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,375
But was I right?
I was right, huh?

183
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,333
No, you weren't. Sorry.

184
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,375
But I've made a discovery!
Hikaru is right-handed!

185
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,958
Yeah, well we're
both right-handed.

186
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,750
Oh yeah? Well, Kaoru always
parts his hair on the right.

187
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,500
No, we switch parts every day.

188
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,375
When you're harmonizing,
the low part goes to-

189
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,625
What are we, a choir?

190
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,125
Um, excuse me. You're
Suou-senpai, aren't you?

191
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,166
That's correct, my dear.
I interrupted you, didn't I?

192
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,916
Um no.Well, I--I was just
inviting the twins to come

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,416
to a class event.

194
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,625
You're going to a film
festival, huh? How nice.

195
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,875
I'll put them
down as attending.

196
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,666
They'll be there.

197
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,750
Hey, that's our decision!

198
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,916
What are you doing?

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,083
Leaving. You're annoying.

200
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,541
Hey wait! What about our game?

201
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,291
You're not bad Suou.

202
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,458
But you're gonna
have to try harder.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,333
I thought you went
to go see the twins today.

204
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,958
I did but they ran away.

205
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,958
Can't blame them.

206
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,625
Would you help me
out here, Kyoya?

207
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
It's for the club!

208
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,166
Let it go. I mean, we can still
form the club without them,

209
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,708
right?

210
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,791
No, we can't! I want them
to be a part of it!

211
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,250
Let me guess, they're also what
you refer to as "our friends,"

212
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,166
is that it?

213
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,291
Well, yeah.

214
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,875
I don't understand what
they're thinking. If they

215
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,416
want people to tell them
apart, why don't they

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,583
wear different
hairstyles or something?

217
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,833
Maybe they don't
want to be told apart.

218
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,041
But that's the whole
point of the game, Kyoya.

219
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,458
Well, then they do
want to be told apart.

220
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,625
Hold on. Are you
even listening to me?

221
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
Well, I hear you talking.

222
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
Today Kaoru's hair is parted
on the right and Hikaru's

223
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,375
is on the left!

224
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,000
Good morning Hitachiin twins!

225
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,583
What do you want? You can't
just show up like this.

226
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
Am I right?
Did I get it right?

227
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,125
No, you couldn't be more wrong.

228
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,916
But I've made a discovery!
Kaoru, you're pigeon-toed,

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,083
aren't you?

230
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,333
You should fix that.

231
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,041
That's not true! How rude!

232
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,750
I came up with an idea
last night. We can focus

233
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,083
on your brotherly love
and make that your draw!

234
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,916
A somewhat taboo and
perfectly symmetrical

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
brotherly love.
The Hitachiin Brothers!

236
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,041
So what do you think?

237
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,291
You don't make any sense.

238
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,833
Wait! Don't run away again!
Come back here!

239
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,416
What the hell is with that guy?

240
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,458
I can't believe
he showed up at our place.

241
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,333
You know, when he
gets all dramatic--

242
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,791
Oh yeah! I thought so too.

243
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,041
He sounds like
some feudal lord!

244
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,333
I never thought I'd see a young
prince character like him

245
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,625
use that tone of voice!

246
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,041
"Come back here!" he said!
"Come back here!"

247
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,041
I bet pretty soon he'll
start talking in third person!

248
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,250
A feudal lord! What an clown!

249
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
But then again.

250
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,875
This game's getting
kinda boring.

251
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,916
Like we said, we're done.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,291
Game over.

253
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,750
What are you talking about?
You're calling it off?

254
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,000
We can do whatever we want.

255
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,125
That's right.

256
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,416
'Cause we heard you're
the illegitimate son

257
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,416
of Ouran's chairman.

258
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,666
Sorry to be so blunt but we
did a little research on you.

259
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,625
You've got quite a sad,
little, life story Suou.

260
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,916
I'm sure you wouldn't
want us passing

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,416
that information along.

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,791
We found out that your
real mother has gone missing.

263
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,166
Be honest, you're just
lonesome because you're

264
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,666
all by yourself, right?

265
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,000
We feel kinda sorry for you
but you can't force us

266
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,000
to be your friends.

267
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,458
We are pretty lonely but
at least we have each other,

268
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,000
that's more than you.

269
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,291
Hikaru, c'mon.

270
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,666
'kay.

271
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,916
He won't go sticking his nose
into our business anymore.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,041
But you know,
it's kind of a shame.

273
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,500
We probably could've played
the game a little longer.

274
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:12,625
But-- I'm not up for being
disappointed, not again.

275
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,166
We were always
contradicting ourselves.

276
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,166
We wanted to be told apart.

277
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,291
We didn't want
to be told apart.

278
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,000
We wanted people to know us.

279
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,791
We didn't want them to know.

280
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,291
We were always looking
for someone who would

281
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,333
finally accept us.

282
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,750
But there was no way
that would ever happen,

283
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,916
not as twisted as we were.

284
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,166
We were so afraid of
someone breaking through

285
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,583
our barrier and hurting us.
We kept a strong

286
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,125
lock on our hearts
to protect ourselves.

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,625
Hey, Kaoru?

288
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,791
She's here.

289
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,833
Yeah, you're right.

290
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,208
I see. Then, Hikaru!

291
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,041
She says she'd
be fine with you instead.

292
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,875
Oh well, should've known.

293
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,791
You may have a sweet
and pretty face but you're

294
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,458
a terrible person, you know.

295
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,458
By saying you'll
take either of us--

296
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,375
--you're really saying
you don't want either of us.

297
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,041
You're mean!

298
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,250
No, you've got it
all wrong, you're mean.

299
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,666
The one about to
rip the letter is Hikaru!

300
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,916
But how did you know?

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,333
Am I right? Did I get it right?

302
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,250
Your reasoning?

303
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,625
Intuition!

304
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,500
No way. I thought
we already told you that

305
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,208
you weren't allowed
to just guess randomly.

306
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,458
Yeah, sorry about that.
But it's still to early for me

307
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,916
to tell. I mean, you are
both totally identical.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,666
But it all depends on
how you choose to look at it.

309
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,166
Being so identical is
a talent in and of itself.

310
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,791
So from now on, you should
try to perfect the whole

311
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,083
"two-in-one Hitachiin
Brothers" act.

312
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,666
But you mustn't forget
that you're also

313
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,208
independent beings with
your own personalities.

314
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,416
And while you're doing that--
I'll keep bugging you

315
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,875
until I can tell you apart.

316
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,291
That doesn't make any sense!

317
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,750
It's contradictory!

318
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,500
And what's wrong with that?
Haven't you realized yet?

319
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,625
You two are contradictory.

320
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,166
It's what they call
"individuality."

321
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,833
What are you talking about?

322
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,125
If we play along with this
silly "Hitachiin Brothers"

323
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,958
act like you want us to,
you'll never tell up apart-

324
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,541
we'll be even more identical!

325
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,208
You didn't think
about that, did you?

326
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,125
How can we show our
"individuality" if no one

327
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,541
can tell us apart?
It's always like this-

328
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,666
we're the only ones who
can tell the difference!

329
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,166
No one will ever
be able to win the

330
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,333
"which one is Hikaru?" game.

331
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,000
And we've known that
from the beginning!

332
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,000
Then why don't
you tell me something?

333
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,041
When someone guesses wrong,
why do you look so sad?

334
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,125
And then, I remembered.

335
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,291
Well, I think you're Hikaru.

336
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,333
You guessed wrong.

337
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:37,083
And after that,
the little girl said.

338
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:41,083
I'm so sorry, please don't cry.

339
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,250
I remembered how surprised
I was when I heard

340
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,958
her say those words.
In fact, I bet we

341
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,291
both looked like
we were about to

342
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,291
cry at that moment.

343
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,208
Even though I may not be able
to, someday, somewhere,

344
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,750
someone's going
to come along who

345
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,291
can tell the two of you apart.

346
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,083
But I know this much
for sure. If you guys keep

347
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,666
living in your
own little world like

348
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,416
you do now,
chances are you're never

349
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,166
going to meet that person.

350
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,041
Here's what I think,
we should open the doors

351
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,000
of the Host Club together!

352
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,750
Let's try to expand
your world, together.

353
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,583
Our first meeting will
be after opening ceremonies

354
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
on the first day
of school. It'll be

355
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,041
in music room 3
in the high school.

356
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,500
That day, we were amazed.
He had answered correctly.

357
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,583
And subconsciously
we were a little bit,

358
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,333
just a little bit,
impressed with him.

359
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,791
Wow, this school's incredible!

360
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,208
If I am admitted,
am I even gonna be able

361
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
to handle it here?

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,208
I see. So, Suou invited you
to join the club too, Takashi?

363
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah.

364
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,125
Know what he said?
He told me it's perfectly okay

365
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,291
for me to like cute
stuff and that I can

366
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,541
eat all the cake
that I want.

367
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,875
Now I don't know
what I should do.

368
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,750
Do whatever you want,
Mitsukuni.

369
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,166
It's no big deal.

370
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,333
Okay! Sounds like a plan!

371
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,833
Yeah, I think I can manage it.

372
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,500
I just have to pass
the entrance exams.

373
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,125
Remember Kaoru,
we can't let ourselves be

374
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,833
moved by what that
foolish lord says.

375
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,833
Yeah, I know. We're just
here to kill some time.

376
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,916
Right, that's it.
We're just killing time.

377
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,708
You're identical.
You know, it's possible that

378
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,166
no one will ever
be able to tell

379
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,791
which one's which.

380
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,666
You were right, lady.
There's no one in this world

381
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,083
who can tell
the two of us apart.

382
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,166
No one at all.
I know that for a fact

383
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,208
but even so--

384
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,708
Let's open the doors together.

385
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,083
Ready, set--

386
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,625
And so we opened the door.

387
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,041
"The Door the Twins Opened"

388
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,416
Starting today, the Host Club
is having a special

389
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,583
Halloween week!

390
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,958
We're sorry, boss.

391
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,625
But we're going to miss it.
We have a class event.

392
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,625
Hey, wait up! Are you
taking Haruhi with you?

393
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,000
Next time, "Until the Day
it Becomes a Pumpkin!"

394
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,791
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you.

395
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,083
We'll see you then!
