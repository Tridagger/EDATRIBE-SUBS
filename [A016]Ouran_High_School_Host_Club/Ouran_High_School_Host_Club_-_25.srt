1
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,166
Oh, And those go in the central
building's main salon, okay?

2
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,166
Alright.

3
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,916
Hey, be careful with that.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,916
Uh. Aren't school fairs meant,
to be, I don't know,

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,458
more about students
proudly showcasing

6
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,375
unique things that
they've made by hand?

7
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,833
Perhaps for a mere
average school, yes.

8
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,625
But at Ouran, the emphasis
is on planning and

9
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,375
leadership skills.

10
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,083
Keep in mind, most of
our students are being

11
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,250
groomed into positions of
leadership, so they're

12
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,541
required to showcase a
talent for upward mobility

13
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,250
not arts-and-crafts.

14
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,000
Whoa, whoa.

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,750
Nicely done. You handle
the reigns like a pro.

16
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,583
Haru-chan!

17
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,458
Climb on board.

18
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,958
We're rehearsing for the
big Ouran Fair parade.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,208
Oh wow, it's right
out of a fairy tale!

20
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,333
How romantic!

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,666
Can we have a ride too?

22
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,500
Hey, you know, you've
gotten pretty good at this.

23
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,250
There's nothing to it,
you should've practiced

24
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,625
with me earlier.

25
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,833
Well, just because we're
twins doesn't make both

26
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,416
of us good drivers.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,583
It's kinda neat having all
of us together like this

28
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,166
for a carriage ride, huh?

29
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,583
Yeah, whatever.

30
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,958
Oh, and for the actual parade
tomorrow we'll all be

31
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,041
in 18th century
French costumes.

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,291
Your outfit will be
especially opulent, Haruhi.

33
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,875
Oh, wonderful.

34
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,875
Ah. The fair's opening
ceremony has started.

35
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,791
Let's make this fair,
the best one yet!

36
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,875
Sounds good to me.

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,208
"The Host Club
Declares Dissolution."

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,458
Now remember, as part of
the fair, the Host Club

39
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,083
will be open to
parents and vistors

40
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,500
for the next two days, which
means we will need to be

41
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,583
even more charming than
usual. Let's get out there

42
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,625
and show our honored guests
the time of their lives!

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,958
Isn't it just wonderful,
mother? This is the

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,541
Host Club I've been telling
you so much about.

45
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,791
What do you think?

46
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,375
Well actually. I cannot
say I approve of this.

47
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
I think that these
young men just enjoy

48
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,083
being fawned over.

49
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,000
You are quite right, madam.
We are such shameless,

50
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,958
selfish creatures.

51
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,875
All of this is mere pretense--

52
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,375
--for spending time
with lovely young ladies

53
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,125
such as yourself. It is
a weakness. Forgive me.

54
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,416
Oh!

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,541
What an enchanting club!

56
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,625
I told you!

57
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,458
You're too kind, both of you.

58
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,708
Good grief.

59
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,958
Here, your buttons are
mismatched. Allow me.

60
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,333
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,958
How adorable!

62
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,291
They must be brothers.
The older one is so thoughtful.

63
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,791
Wrong.

64
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,916
But you see,
our mother and father,

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,708
were both so busy. That they
had no time for the two of us.

66
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,875
We played by ourselves.
Which is the reason

67
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,333
we're so lonely now.

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,083
Oh, you poor things!

69
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,583
You have got to be kidding me.

70
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,708
One of our daily goals here
at the Host Club is

71
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,000
to evoke different time periods.

72
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,791
So we make it a point
to thoroughly research

73
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,333
a wide variety of historical
traditions in the interest of

74
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,958
maintaining authenticity.

75
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,125
That's quite impressive!

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,291
Yeah, quite
impressively political.

77
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,500
This is a bit too much
even by our standards.

78
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,958
You could buy
a small country with all

79
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,458
the money we're wasting.

80
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,000
What nonsense! That's not
the Host Club way

81
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,416
at all and you know it!
Happiness is above

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,208
any price tag! Besides, think
of all the exposure! We'll --

83
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,250
No, Haruhi's right, you have
overshot the budget.

84
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,541
Kyoya.

85
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,708
The use of this salon
notwithstanding, you had

86
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,875
a period-style carriage shipped
in all the way from France.

87
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,375
Must you always be so
capricious? Your impulsiveness

88
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,583
overwhelms my
accounting skills.

89
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,041
Typical.

90
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,458
Whatever! Capricious is just
another word for creative!

91
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,875
I'll have you know
the whims of the

92
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,791
Host Club King
are the stuff of dreams,

93
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,708
no price is too high!

94
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,791
Welcome.

95
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,166
Can I get anything for you?
Maybe something sweet?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,458
You're with the Host Club?

97
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,875
Yes.

98
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,000
Father!

99
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:44,708
Do not refer to me as father.
The term is far too familiar.

100
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,375
You will address me
properly as Chairman.

101
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,416
Ah very good! welcome sir.

102
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Please, let me
show you to your seat.

103
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,083
Thank you.

104
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,916
Kyoya, my boy, if not for
your being here I'm sure

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,875
this club would
be a shambles.

106
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,000
My son must give you
no end of trouble.

107
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,416
Oh, on the contrary, sir.
Your son's vision is what

108
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,541
keeps us viable.
May I bring you anything?

109
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,583
Yes, yes. Of course.

110
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,916
Haruhi, you're needed.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,625
What?!

112
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,166
So you're Haruhi Fujioka.

113
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,208
Come, sit with me.

114
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,208
Alright, thank you sir.

115
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,666
So this guy is Tamaki-senpai
father? Funny, they don't

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,708
look all that much alike.

117
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,583
Nice to meet you Chairman.
I was just thinking earlier

118
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,333
that I ought to have paid
my respects to you

119
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,291
a long time ago.
I'm so sorry.

120
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:48,250
You know, "Chairman" is so dry.
Why don't you call me, yes.

121
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:53,541
Call me your uncle.
It would please me.

122
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,791
Wow. I guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree

123
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,375
after all.

124
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,041
I find I'm just so busy lately
that I'm seldom here in person.

125
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,375
But I've certainly heard some
wonderful things about you.

126
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,541
Oh, why. thank you, sir.

127
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,541
If ever you find yourself
in trouble, I want you to know

128
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,041
that you can come to
your uncle for anything.

129
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,125
'Kay.

130
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,125
Father!

131
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,125
Chairman!

132
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,375
What do you think you're doing?!

133
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,583
Remove your hands
at once, please!

134
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,875
Kyoya-senpai!

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,166
Is this how my son has
been wasting his time?

136
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,333
That's Kyo-chan's
father isn't it?

137
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
Yes.

138
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,083
You are an embarrassment
to the Ootori name.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,291
Suou, my friend. I am sorry
you had to witness that.

140
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,041
That did seem rather harsh,
given how exceptional

141
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,375
he really is.

142
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,666
For a man with three fine
young sons to carry on

143
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,125
his legacy, your avarice
would seem to run deep.

144
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,625
I've heard about your
trouble. Believe me,

145
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,458
It's only a matter of
time before the media

146
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,333
gets wind of it. Please tell
me you're not taking

147
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,500
that out on your son.

148
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,708
Kyoya, are you alright?

149
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,208
Your dad is so mean!

150
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,083
You should never, ever hit
someone who's wearing glasses!

151
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
I don't think
it's really about that.

152
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,625
He wasn't upset with you 'cause
of the Host Club was he?

153
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,541
Don't worry about it.

154
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,291
It's not like I haven't
been expecting this.

155
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,333
Because of the host club?

156
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,541
Whims have
consequences, Tamaki.

157
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,208
Take my word for it,
they do not come cheaply

158
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,041
for people like us.
Accept it. Life is hard.

159
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,666
It's time for you to grow up
and realize that dreaming

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,625
only postpones the inevitable.

161
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,750
Haruhi!

162
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,375
Coming!

163
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,041
Thank you all so much
for taking time out of

164
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,416
your busy schedule
to visit us today.

165
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,333
Start thinking about
the future, son.

166
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,416
If you plan on becoming
head of the Suou family

167
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,291
there's a long,
hard road ahead of you.

168
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,541
You're going to have to live
with the choices you make

169
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,916
for the rest of your life.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,625
I advise you to think very
carefully about what it is

171
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,000
you really want before
it's too late.

172
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,541
Now look sharp.

173
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,416
Your grandmother is here.

174
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,250
Grandmother! I'm so
glad you could come!

175
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:44,291
Aw, that's so sweet. So that's
Tamaki-senpai's grandmother.

176
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,291
I hate that woman.

177
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,375
Please come in, take a seat.

178
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,166
Don't patronize me.

179
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,500
Filthy Child

180
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,916
Lady Éclair, come over here
for a moment please.

181
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,416
Hey, I was just.

182
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,166
What?

183
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,166
For the remainder of
the day and tomorrow,

184
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,666
you will be Lady Éclair's
personal escort.

185
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,541
What's wrong?
I gave you an order.

186
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,458
Hello there, Tamaki.

187
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,625
Very well, grandmother.

188
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,208
I will do everything in my power
to ensure her happiness.

189
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,041
Just as you wish.

190
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,750
Tama-chan isn't
coming back, is he?

191
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,250
So does he really
plan to spend-

192
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,625
-the entire fair
escorting some stranger?

193
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,833
Come my princess.

194
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,666
Let us be off.

195
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,000
Éclair , right?
Or something like that.

196
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,375
Who is she to him?
That's the mystery.

197
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,041
I could tell you.

198
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,333
Oh, Renge?

199
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,875
Éclair, Tonnerre, She's
the youngest daughter of

200
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,166
the renowned French
Tonnerre family.

201
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,250
They descend from royalty.

202
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,958
Indeed, the family has quite
a history. Their wealth is

203
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,541
something of a legend among
financial heavyweights.

204
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,916
In fact, just being associated
with them makes you part

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,666
of a very elite group.

206
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,000
They also own Grand Tonnerre,
a firm that's been

207
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,208
buying up a lot of business
in Japan lately.

208
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,541
Of course that doesn't
explain why Lady Éclair

209
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,875
has come here
to visit Tamaki.

210
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,333
Isn't this charming?
A picturesque gondola ride

211
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,250
and artists'
showcase all in one.

212
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,583
Everything you see here,
was created by members

213
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,541
of the Ouran Art Club.

214
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:10,166
How pedestrian.
Clearly the work of novices.

215
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,333
That was a bit harsh.
What would you have me do?

216
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,166
The students put a lot of
hard work into these pieces.

217
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,125
But we can go somewhere else
if you like, my lady.

218
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,833
Tamaki.

219
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,958
I would like to hear
you play the piano.

220
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,250
For me?

221
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,250
Of course that doesn't
explain why Lady Éclair's

222
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,375
has come to visit Tamaki.

223
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
In here?

224
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,625
Well, it is
a music room after all.

225
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,791
So this is the room
where you and that precious

226
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,291
little Host Club of yours
hold court, is it?

227
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,458
I must admit it was
impressive seeing you all

228
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,625
in action earlier.
You must be very close.

229
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,791
Naturally. You know
what they say,

230
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,583
"the family that plays
together stays together."

231
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,791
Family? What a sentimental
notion. I believe here in Japan

232
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,791
they refer to that
as "playing house."

233
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,750
You're so whimsical, Tamaki.
I'll bet they all fall

234
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,458
over themselves trying
to keep up with you.

235
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,791
Especially that one
in the glasses.

236
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,583
The one who got
slapped by his father.

237
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,583
Must you always be so
capricious , your impulsiveness

238
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,125
overwhelms my accounting skills.

239
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,666
Could that be true?
Is everyone making sacrifices

240
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,666
just to keep me happy?

241
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,875
Haruhi could be much closer
to becoming a lawyer

242
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,291
right now if I hadn't forced
her be part of this club.

243
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,083
She came here to study, but I've
completely monopolized all her

244
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,750
free time.

245
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,208
Who is it?

246
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,125
Oh, Haruhi. What are you doing?

247
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,416
I just came back
to change outfits.

248
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,666
You were the one who wanted us
to change costumes at least

249
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,250
three times a day.

250
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,500
Look, Everyone's upset
with you for disappearing

251
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,000
on us like that.

252
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,500
You should be with your club.

253
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,958
My apologies, I'm afraid
he belongs to me

254
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,166
for the time being.

255
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,750
Forgive me for asking, but do
I detect a hint of jealousy?

256
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,916
Oh Haruhi!

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,458
So Is it true?! Is it true?!
You're actually jealous?!

258
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,916
Sorry, but no. I guess
I'll be be leaving now.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,541
Some of us have work to do.

260
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,666
Hey, wait a second! Haruhi!

261
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,583
Please. You can't possibly be
interested in a shrew like that.

262
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,833
My lady!

263
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,500
I would appreciate it if
you would not refer to

264
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
my little girl as a shrew.

265
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,791
Your little girl?

266
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,500
They're not
a real family, Tamaki.

267
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,958
So stop playing house.

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,958
What are you doing?!

269
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,000
Wouldn't you prefer
the real thing?

270
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,458
Because I can give it
to you, you know.

271
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,625
How dashing!

272
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,250
Oh my!

273
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,375
Haru-chan looks great!

274
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,041
She does.

275
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,083
Not bad.

276
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,541
So where did the boss go?

277
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,208
He was looking forward
to this the most.

278
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,041
Our King is lounging
in Music Room 3.

279
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,708
He's "entertaining"
Lady Éclair.

280
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,875
Well, well, well.

281
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,166
It sounds like someone's
a little jealous.

282
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,791
Like I said. I'm not.

283
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,500
Like you said?

284
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,291
Look I. I just think he's
being even more irresponsible

285
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,000
than usual today.

286
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:42,125
You said it yourself,
Kyoya. He's impulsive.

287
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,125
True, he certainly is.
But in this instance he's

288
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,458
obeying the whims
of his grandmother.

289
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,666
Please come in,
take a seat.

290
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't patronize me.

291
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,125
Filthy child.

292
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,291
Um, You know, now that
I think about it,

293
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:04,000
Tamaki's grandmother seemed
really cold towards him earlier.

294
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,625
Is there some special
reason for that?

295
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,916
Well, everyone else
knows about it.

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,750
See, Tamaki-senpai
is illegitimate.

297
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,541
Twenty some-odd years ago,
the Suou Family patriarch

298
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,958
died at a young age.

299
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,458
For political reasons,
Chairman Yuzuru was rushed

300
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,916
into a marriage at
the behest of his mother

301
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,625
to a woman of her own choosing.

302
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,250
That's how he became
head of the family.

303
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,250
But several years later,
the chairman fell passionately

304
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,416
in love with a beautiful
young woman he met in Paris.

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,750
Not long after,
Tama-chan was born.

306
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,708
No Mother. I am leaving my
wife. I'm going to marry her.

307
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,916
The boss' grandmother
vehemently objected.

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,625
Because of her poor health,
living in Japan proved too

309
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,541
difficult for senpai's mother,
and so she raised him in France

310
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,125
until he was fourteen.

311
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,125
His childhood seems
to have been a happy one.

312
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,291
But as time wore on, the family
business on his mother's side

313
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,333
went belly up, and when they
were forced into debt.

314
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,541
The boss' grandmother,
worried about there being

315
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
no heir to carry on
the family name,

316
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,791
came up with a proposal.

317
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,583
I will provide you with
the means to live comfortably

318
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,666
for the rest of your days.

319
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,375
In exchange, Tahmaki is to come
and live with me in Japan.

320
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,250
Without You.

321
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,125
All contact between the two
of you will be prohibited,

322
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:36,416
forever. These conditions
are non-negotiable.

323
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,458
Wow.

324
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,000
The current patriarch may
be Chairman Yuzuru Suou

325
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,750
technically but for the time
being, all the family's assets

326
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,625
remain under the control
of Tamaki's grandmother.

327
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,875
What's more with his
mother's health being so frail.

328
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,625
Tamaki understood the grim
prospects facing her if she

329
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,375
were left to live in debt.

330
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,125
So.

331
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:03,750
I've decided. I'm going
to go to Japan,

332
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,666
It's all for the best.
Just promise me, mom.

333
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,125
Promise me you'll take care.

334
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,000
Not long afterward either out
of anguish or just plain guilt

335
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,666
over having bartered her son
away for financial security.

336
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,750
Tamaki's mother left France in
shame and went into hiding.

337
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,708
Her current
whereabouts are unknown.

338
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,291
To this day he's
never seen her again.

339
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,333
Not once.

340
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,791
So. I won't get to see
mommy anymore?

341
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:53,291
I had no idea. He always
seems so cheerful.

342
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,250
Who would have ever guessed?

343
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,583
If I were in senpai's shoes, I
don't know that I could ever

344
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,041
forgive my grandmother
for something like that.

345
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,250
It's easy to feel sorry for him.

346
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,500
But the hardships that
he endured as a child helped

347
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
mold him into the
person he is today.

348
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,250
He'll be fine.

349
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,875
The Host Club is his refuge,
which means when all

350
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,541
is said and done.
He still has us.

351
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,291
Tama-chan!

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,541
Everyone, I have an
important announcement.

353
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,583
As of today, Lady Éclair
Tonnerre and I are

354
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,208
officially engaged.

355
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,500
Futhermore, the Host Club
will be permanently

356
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,208
dissolved after the Ouran Fair.

357
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,000
That is all.

358
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,875
To be honest, I used to think
you were the strangest bunch

359
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,416
of misfits and loonies
I'd ever met.

360
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,625
I mean, serving as hosts
in an after-school club?

361
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:24,541
Next time, the final episode:
"This is Our Ouran Fair."

362
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,333
All of you, I...
