1
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,541
There might be a big,
nasty monster out here.

2
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,291
I'd better hurry up, and try
to find my Big Brother.

3
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,833
My Big Brother is a
strong, handsome prince,

4
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,833
so I'm sure he'd be able to
defeat a monster for me.

5
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,041
Welcome!

6
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,958
Oh my, what an
unusually young guest.

7
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:41,208
Well, glad you're here,
my little lost kitty-cat.

8
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,541
When I opened the door,
the police were there

9
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,291
waiting for me.

10
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,666
"Big Brother is a Prince"

11
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,916
Little kitty-cat, why have
you come to see us today?

12
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,916
It's a reverse harem!

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,125
This is a
reverse harem!

14
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,541
That can't be right.
I must've heard wrong-

15
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,583
maybe there's still some
water in my ear from when

16
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,958
I went swimming.

17
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,875
Water in the ear-
that's gotta be it!

18
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm sure we just heard
her wrong. There's no way

19
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,083
this cute, little girl said
the words 'reverse harem'.

20
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,541
Something's going on
with our ears.

21
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,458
There's debauchery here!

22
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,041
Yay! There's debauchery
here, isn't there?!

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,416
You're the glasses character!

24
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,916
You're the boy Lolita!
And the stoic type!

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,875
Twincest.

26
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,375
And the bookworm!

27
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,833
Big brother?

28
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
My brother's blond-
you must be him!

29
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,500
You never told us about this.

30
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,041
Since when do you
have a little sister?

31
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,875
I don't- I'm definitely
an only child-

32
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,541
at least as far
as I know...

33
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,416
The more I look at you
the two of you do look

34
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,000
a lot alike. You are
both blond, after all.

35
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,500
I want to know if 'glasses
character' is superior to

36
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,791
'big brother'.

37
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,625
But does it really matter?
I can't believe she

38
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
called me a bookworm.

39
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,458
'Scuse me. You want to tell
me your name, little one?

40
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,666
Kirimi.

41
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,916
Kirimi?

42
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,375
Kirimi-chan. I'm afraid
you've made a mistake.

43
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:33,041
I'm really sorry but, I
don't have a younger sister.

44
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,625
Are you sure?
You're blond just like me.

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,625
Well... that is true.

46
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,250
I give in! As of this
moment, I'm your new

47
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,500
big brother! You're
so cute! You're so cute!

48
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,708
I know you get
carried away by emotion,

49
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
but don't you think it's
irresponsible to make

50
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,083
such empty promises?

51
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,791
Don't you listen to that mean
Haruhi! I'm not irresponsible!

52
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,166
Come home with me
and I'll look after you.

53
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,500
What do you think
we should do Kyoya-senpai?

54
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,625
We should probably try
to find out if she actually

55
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,750
has a brother
at this school.

56
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:15,875
Kirimi. Kirimi.

57
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,875
Hey, uh, who the hell are you?

58
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,458
He's looks like
a foreigner!

59
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,833
What's up
with that?

60
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,500
How come the door looks
different all of a sudden?

61
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,125
Oh, Kirimi.

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,291
Master.

63
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,166
You forgot your cloak.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,916
Nekozawa-senpai?

65
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,625
Master Umehito is terribly
vulnerable to any kind

66
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,500
of bright light.

67
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,166
For that reason, if he doesn't
shroud himself in black,

68
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,875
he will fall victim to
the brightness of the

69
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,416
outside world and will
undoubtedly collapse.

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,541
And just to be comfortable,
he even has to cover

71
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,875
his beautiful blond hair
with a dark wig.

72
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,291
On the other hand,
his sister, Mistress Kirimi,

73
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,083
is frightened of dark,
dimly-lit places.

74
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,083
So this little girl
is Nekozawa-senpai's

75
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,083
younger sister?

76
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,541
You are quite insightful.
Yes, that would be correct, sir.

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,916
Kirimi, so this is where
you've been hiding.

78
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,291
Brother, save me
from the monster!

79
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,125
Please don't be scared.
I'd like to introduce you

80
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,333
to someone.

81
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,416
This is Belzenef. The
Nekozawa family has

82
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,750
worshipped cats
for generations.

83
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,458
You know, I get the feeling
she's not scared of the puppet.

84
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,166
Call me crazy but
I think it's, you.

85
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,416
It's probably your clothes.
We'll help you change, 'K?

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,291
Don't do that! It's far
too bright! I may die!

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,166
I know! Why don't we
just darken the room?

88
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,583
Don't do that!
I'm afraid of the dark!

89
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,583
Don't worry, little one.

90
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,875
So either way,
someone's unhappy.

91
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,750
It's a tragedy that
these two siblings

92
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,375
are such polar opposites.

93
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,125
As a result they have
come to be known as

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,208
the Nekohzawa family's
Romeo and Juliet.

95
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,166
But Romeo and Juliet
weren't brother and sister.

96
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,958
I think their situation
was a little different.

97
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,583
Oh, I'm well aware of that.
To be honest it's something

98
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,583
I just came up with on the
fly- pretty impressive, huh?

99
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,416
I thought it might make
the story more dramatic.

100
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,083
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,166
We were sent by the Master's
family to get our beloved

102
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,333
Mistress Kirimi
back home safely.

103
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,708
Is the rest of the family-

104
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,500
-as out of touch
as the three of you are?

105
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,458
How dare you say
such a terrible thing?!

106
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,458
The Nekozawas are
a distinguished family-

107
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,291
they're descendents of the
Tokarev dynasty of Russia!

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,000
Tokarev, huh?

109
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,708
Wait, you mean
Romanov, right?

110
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,666
There's a legend that says
once every few hundred years

111
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,750
a Nekozawa child is born.
A child who is destined

112
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,875
to be possessed by the
darkness, exactly like

113
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,791
our Master Umehito.

114
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,458
That legend may
or may not be true.

115
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,458
What do you mean
it may or may not be true?

116
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,875
Is it or isn't it?

117
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,166
Mistress Kirimi fell in
love with the handsome,

118
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,500
fairy tale prince of an
older brother she had seen

119
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,458
in portraits. However, as
a result of his condition,

120
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,333
the master is unable to go
near his sister without being

121
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,083
shrouded in black.

122
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,416
Once she learned that her
older brother was enrolled

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,708
in the high school here, she
decided to go looking for him.

124
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,583
That's what brought her
to your Host Club.

125
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,708
We've tried to keep her
comforted by reading her

126
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,041
bedtime stories about princely
characters like her brother.

127
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,666
But we ran out of stories. So
recently we decided to start

128
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,916
reading her shojo manga
that had princely

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
characters in them.

130
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,791
And I'm afraid she's
become completely addicted!

131
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,458
Shojo manga?

132
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,250
There's debauchery here!

133
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,791
Yay! There's debauchery
here, isn't there!

134
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,208
I see, so that's
where that came from...

135
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,208
Is there really
debauchery in shojo manga?

136
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,625
But Sashimi-chan's so young.

137
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,750
Not Sashimi!

138
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,916
It's "Kirimi"!

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,833
So Kirimi-chan doesn't
know that you're her

140
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,708
real older brother,
Nekozawa-senpai?

141
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,666
Yes. We've talked to her but
she refuses to believe us.

142
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,083
That's so sad.Well, no wonder
Neko-chan is so upset!

143
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,125
It's painful. That's why
every night I offer prayers

144
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,291
in hopes that one day
Kirimi will come to embrace

145
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,041
the darkness.

146
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,916
I think you've got
it backwards, buddy.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,833
You should try to get
accustomed to the light.

148
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,750
What're you trying
to do to your sister?

149
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,375
Come along,
Mistress Kirimi.

150
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,791
It's time to go home.

151
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,833
I'm not going with you!
I don't wanna go home!

152
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,250
I wanna stay
with my Big Brother!

153
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,291
Nekozawa-senpai.

154
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,708
Don't worry about me Suou.

155
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,958
All I want is
for my sister to be happy.

156
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,583
Make sure she gets
the love she deserves!

157
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,500
But wait a minute! Senpai!

158
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,958
Sibling relations are a source
of problems in any family.

159
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,041
Even so, I'm kinda jealous.

160
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,000
I grew up an only child
so I can't really relate.

161
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,666
But I can't imagine how tough
it must be to have a sibling-

162
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
-that's so different
from you that you can't

163
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,583
even spend time together.

164
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,083
Is something wrong?
Tell me big brother.

165
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,333
I'm sorry, Kirimi, but I'm not
the big brother that you've

166
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,166
been looking for.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,416
But don't worry,
he's still out there.

168
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,166
Believe it or not, you have a
big brother that's even more

169
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,625
handsome than I am,
and I promise you-

170
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,416
he's a real prince.

171
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,958
But Senpai.

172
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,666
Once she stepped foot in
this room, Kirmi-chan became

173
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,583
a guest of the Host Club.

174
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,166
And-

175
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,291
It's our job to make all
of our guests happy.

176
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,875
It's an absolute tragedy to
see a brother and sister

177
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,125
at odds this way!

178
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,875
We have to do
something to help them!

179
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,166
Starting now, "Operation:
Change Nekohzawa-senpai into

180
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,833
the princely character
of Kirmi-chan's dreams"

181
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,541
is underway!

182
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,583
Are you serious?

183
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,000
But, sir.

184
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,708
You want to change Umehito
from a prince of darkness

185
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,541
to a prince of light? I don't
know if that's even possible.

186
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,208
Senpai. Quit getting carried
away by your emotions!

187
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,166
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

188
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,041
Oh ye of little faith.

189
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,000
Have you forgotten that we
have an expert on our side.

190
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,416
Someone who knows
the importance of

191
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,375
changing characters.

192
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,083
You don't think?

193
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,458
He's talking about-

194
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,083
Yep, sure enough.

195
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,041
Your golden locks
glow in the candlelight.

196
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,541
Your skin like ivory.

197
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,666
Your smile,
mysterious as a flower,

198
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
illuminated by the moonlight.

199
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:36,041
Such beauty. It's as if-

200
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,291
You're a cursed wax doll
shrouded in darkness

201
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,958
and filled with
malevolence!

202
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,333
No way- you've got it
all wrong! You numbskull!

203
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,333
Who told you to say
something like that?!

204
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,083
How many times
do I have to tell you,

205
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,583
you're not allowed to use
any occult terms!

206
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,958
I'm really sorry, but my
vocabulary is a bit limited

207
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,166
without those words.

208
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,750
You're not allowed to talk
back to me either, you got it?

209
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,416
A princely character would
never try to come up

210
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,416
with a sissy excuse
like that!

211
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,291
Remember, it's okay
to have a dark side-

212
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,666
some girls like that.

213
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,541
Cute, brooding male characters
always go over well

214
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,083
with young girls. However,
refferencing anything

215
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,833
related to the occult
is out of the question.

216
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,708
Mori-senpai, go ahead and
add that to the board!

217
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,666
Wax doll.

218
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,750
Looks like Renge is really
on top of things.

219
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,291
Yeah, she's on a roll.

220
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,083
But I'm not sure the
lines she's feeding him

221
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,541
are appropriate to
use on his sister.

222
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,958
You just going to sit
and watch, boss?

223
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,333
Of course! I don't want to
end up with a curse on me!

224
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,625
Okay, it seems that you've
memorized most of your

225
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,291
new character lines. I think
it's about time we moved on.

226
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,333
Are you ready, senpai?

227
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Oh please no!! It's too soon.
I can't handle it yet!

228
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,958
Evil beam!

229
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,125
Don't let a simple flashlight
get the best of you!

230
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,500
Work up your nerve! It's not
physically affecting you,

231
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,416
so that means it must be
psychological. Even Edgar

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
was able to face the cross
once he built up his courage.

233
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
But I thought
you rejected the occult.

234
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,416
Occult fiction is good.
Occult fashion is not.

235
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,125
Is that so?

236
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,500
Don't judge him.

237
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,916
You're the one who's always
wearing weird cosplay.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,333
You've gotta put
your heart into the

239
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
delivery of these lines.

240
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,291
You have to imagine that you're
talking to Kirmi-chan's.

241
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,833
That's easy for you to say,
but that doesn't look

242
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,000
anything like her.

243
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,208
Would you quit complaining?!

244
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,500
Look at her through
the eyes of your heart!

245
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,541
The eyes of your heart!

246
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,458
That's right! Remember
why you're doing this.

247
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,458
It's all for Kirmi-chan's
sake! Just give it a shot.

248
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,458
It'll look like her
if you use your imagination.

249
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
Here ya go, boss!

250
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,541
We got this one ready,
just for you.

251
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,791
We think you should go ahead
and confess your love

252
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,666
to this Haruhi doll.

253
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,958
Wait. This doll is Haruhi?

254
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,500
You should teach him
by example!

255
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:15,166
Haruhi. I--

256
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,166
Yes, Senpai.

257
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,083
Excuse me.

258
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,041
Haruhi! You're the real one!
But when did you get here?!

259
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
Kirimi-chan came
to the club room

260
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,375
looking for you again today.

261
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,666
If you've got time to do
disgusting things like this-

262
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,500
Surely you can spare
the time to hang out

263
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,250
with her for a while.

264
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,541
What? Disgusting?!

265
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,333
Why don't you keep her
company Haruhi?

266
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,750
What's wrong-
don't like children?

267
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,666
Well no, it's not that
I don't like them or anything.

268
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,000
Read more, bookworm!

269
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,375
"I have finally made all of
these fine men my love slaves.

270
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,958
Oh, my, who shall I pick
to have entertain me

271
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,000
this evening?"

272
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,750
She's made me read about
50 volumes of shojo manga

273
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,750
to her over the last 3 days.
And to my surprise,

274
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,875
those things really are full of
reverse harems and debauchery.

275
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,666
Big Brother?

276
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,125
This room is dark and scary!

277
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,916
Oh, Kirimi-chan! I asked you to
wait for me in the other room!

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,916
What's wrong, little one?
There, there, calm down.

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,166
You see? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

280
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,458
Here we go!

281
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,833
Senpai?

282
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,166
I am a handsome, princely big
brother- I am a handsome,

283
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,166
princely big brother- I am a
handsome, princely big brother-

284
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,916
I am a handsome,
princely big brother-

285
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,666
I am a handsome,
princely big brother-

286
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,750
I am a handsome,
princely big brother!

287
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:12,916
And I'm not afraid of this
flashlight! Self evil beam!

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,250
He did it!

289
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,583
Nekozawa-senpai's
come a long way.

290
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,458
He's able to shine
a flashlight in his own face.

291
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,250
Bravo, senpai! Bravo!

292
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,125
Good job! I'm impressed!

293
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,625
You did it! Your little sister
is going to be so thrilled!

294
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,375
Look there,
Kirmi-chan. That gentleman

295
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,458
is your real big brother.

296
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,375
Big Brother!

297
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,916
Kirimi!

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,791
You're just
complicating things.

299
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,166
Could you please cut that out-

300
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,791
it's not gonna help, you know.

301
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,750
Huh? Did you
just say something?

302
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,333
Never mind,

303
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,208
Kirimi.

304
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,083
Kirimi, wait!

305
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,041
So I guess shining the
flashlight in his face-

306
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,083
Scared her and
sent her running.

307
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,708
Oh, Kirimi.

308
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,875
Nekohzawa-senpai.

309
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,833
I've had enough. Even if I
continue your special training,

310
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:31,791
there's no guarantee that
Kirimi will ever accept me.

311
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,000
I think she'd be better off.

312
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,125
If you acted as her big
brother in my stead, Suou.

313
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,916
But that's ridiculous-
you're the big brother

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,583
she's looking for.

315
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,291
If you care about her,
you'll do whatever it takes

316
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,083
to win her over!

317
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,416
Hey look! Kirmi-chan hasn't
made it out of the courtyard!

318
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,708
But there's something
down there with her.

319
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,500
Oh, it's just a cat.

320
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,750
Your family
sure does love cats.

321
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,958
Even strays warm up
to you guys.

322
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,666
What'd you say?!

323
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,250
They're revered by our
family- it's true, but Kirimi

324
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,500
wouldn't participate in
something like that.

325
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,166
Something as occult as
befriending a stray cat.

326
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,708
Kirimi is afraid of animals,
and cats are the creatures

327
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,708
she fears the most.

328
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,125
Kirimi!

329
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,416
Nekozawa-senpai!

330
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
But he's not wearing
his black cloak!

331
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,250
Someone help.

332
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,333
Kirimi!

333
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,666
Kirimi!

334
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,125
Big Brother!

335
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,958
Would you look at that!

336
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,666
This is all thanks
to my special training.

337
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,541
There's no need
to be afraid, Kirimi.

338
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,250
I promise it won't come
anywhere near you now, alright?

339
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:26,750
His name is Belzenef, with this
puppet's power, I can--curse.

340
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,625
Nekozawa-senpai.

341
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,916
He probably got more sun
than he ever will again

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,166
in that one day.

343
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,500
That may be true, but he
immediately went running

344
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,375
for the darkness again.

345
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,375
Yeah, we should've known.
What a waste.

346
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,458
He's back to wearing all
those black clothes again.

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,750
But even so.

348
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,291
Now I know that if
a monster ever appears-

349
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,083
I'll be just fine.

350
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,291
I have a princely
Big Brother who will fight

351
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,333
to protect me, even if
it means dashing out

352
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:04,041
into the sunlight. The one
thing he fears most of all.

353
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,250
I love sweets!

354
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,500
Be careful, Honey-senpai.

355
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,875
You're gonna end up
with cavaties.

356
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,750
Ow!

357
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,958
See, what did I just tell you?

358
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,166
This is my fault.

359
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,500
Next time,
"Honey's Three Bitter Days!"

360
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,916
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,208
We'll see you then!
