1
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,291
I love you.

2
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,416
And you're all I can think
about, my darling.

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,458
Let's spend the rest of our

4
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,750
lives together, just
the two of us.

5
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,375
Yes, Miyabi.

6
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm so happy.

7
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,625
Excuse me, Miss?

8
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,458
The Master has returned home.

9
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,125
Miss?

10
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,583
Renge?

11
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,125
You certainly love those
video games, don't you?

12
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,375
Is that so wrong?

13
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,916
No, not at all.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm your father and I want you

15
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,333
to feel free to live your
life however you please.

16
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,791
You know that I'll let you
do anything you like.

17
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,166
I've always promised
you that freedom.

18
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,416
Yeah.

19
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,833
Did your business trip
in Japan go well?

20
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:21,708
I think so.

21
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,291
I had a lovely dinner meeting at

22
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,916
the home of one of my
clients while I was there.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,458
I made sure to get a photo.

24
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,750
Take a look.

25
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,125
They have a boy in high school
who's about the same age as you.

26
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,625
He's the one.

27
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,750
I'm going to marry the
boy in this photo!

28
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,166
Don't forget, you promised me

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,750
that I could do whatever
I want, Father!

30
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,541
Uh. But, Renge.

31
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,958
I'm coming for you,
my prince charming!

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:58,333
Renge!

33
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,208
Renge!

34
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,916
Attack of the Lady Manager!

35
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Oh, Tamaki.

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,708
My dearest Tamaki, why
are you so beautiful?

37
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,333
I'm hoping to catch your eye,
even if for just one second.

38
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,000
Then why is your voice so
very sweet and mellow?

39
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,583
To set your nerves at ease so
that my true feelings might

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,166
reach your heart.

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,291
Why are your eyes filled with
tears every time you look at me?

42
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,375
Because, the sight of your
beautiful smile causes the

43
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,416
fountain inside me to
start overflowing.

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Oh, Tamaki.

45
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,250
I think it's adorable that
you're wearing matching kimonos!

46
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,125
Our mother designed everything
the hosts are wearing today.

47
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,000
If you see something you like we
can take an order for you.

48
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,333
Our grandmother even
helped us put them on.

49
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,750
But you know the only one who

50
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,791
will be undressing
you is me, Kaoru.

51
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,875
Hikaru you're embarrassing
me in front of everybody.

52
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,333
What a tender embrace!

53
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,375
They're up to that
nonsense again.

54
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,333
Haruhi!

55
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,166
You look so cute in your kimono!

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,958
Almost like a girl!

57
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,166
Thanks.

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,958
Haruhi, you've booked
another appointment.

59
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,041
It seems you've had a pretty

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,083
steady flow of new
customers lately.

61
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,708
Keep up the good work.

62
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm not going to charge
you interest on your debt

63
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,083
like I normally would
so keep this up

64
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,000
and you should be
able to pay it off.

65
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,458
Although, the rental fee on that

66
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,208
kimono you're wearing is
nothing to sneeze at.

67
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,708
He's like some kind of
heartless tax collector!

68
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,041
Hello, Kyoya.

69
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,083
I can't get over how great
you look in that kimono.

70
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,875
Are you planning to release
any more picture books

71
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,208
of the Host Club?

72
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,250
Unfortunately we don't have

73
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,083
anything planned at
present, ladies.

74
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,125
But doesn't the club
make a lot of money--

75
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,250
--from the sale of
promotional items?

76
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,708
That's true but the
items are poor quality.

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,125
Those picture books
were full of nothing

78
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,125
but amateur hidden
camera shots.

79
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,875
However, if we want to
create some higher-quality,

80
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,291
money-making products,
I'm afraid we'd have to

81
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,083
draw money from the
school's budget.

82
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,083
If it wasn't for
Kyoya the host club

83
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,666
would spiral into the
depths of bankruptcy.

84
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,000
Haru-chan, Haru-chan.

85
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,208
I don't know how but I
lost one of my sandals.

86
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,041
But you were just wearing
them, weren't you?

87
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,166
Mitsukuni.

88
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,000
Takashi.

89
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,666
I noticed that you dropped it.

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,125
Takashi!

91
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,208
How sweet.

92
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,583
Isn't it, though?

93
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,750
Looks like tears are popular
with the ladies today.

94
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,208
But how are they all
able to cry so easily?

95
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,458
What's this?

96
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,625
For your information,

97
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,125
it's common for a host
to use eye drops.

98
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,291
No woman alive can resist a
man on the brink of tears.

99
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,291
That's cheating.

100
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,125
Oh, don't be such
a party pooper.

101
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,375
Here, Haruhi.

102
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,958
This is for you.

103
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,125
It's for me?

104
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,958
Aren't you the cutest?

105
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,125
I didn't know you
liked sweets, Haruhi!

106
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,083
Well, to be honest with
you, I don't really.

107
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,416
But you know.
I think it would be

108
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,000
a nice memorial offering
for my mother.

109
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,083
How admirable of you!

110
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,541
Such devotion to your
mother's memory.

111
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,000
Please Haruhi take as many
of these as you like.

112
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,416
Let me guess, the
tears are fake?

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,541
How could you?

114
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,000
My tears are always
genuine, Haruhi.

115
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,375
Being able to cry without the

116
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,375
use of eye drops is the
mark of a true host.

117
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,250
Tell me, do I impress you?

118
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,041
Have you fallen for me yet?

119
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,208
You wish.

120
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,416
My romantic overtures do not

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,291
seem to be reaching
you for some reason.

122
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,500
Perhaps I should
add a little more

123
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,833
panache to my character, huh?

124
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,125
Looks like the host club
has a brand-new guest.

125
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on in.

126
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,250
What are you waiting for?

127
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,125
Watching from afar is no fun.

128
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,666
Please miss?

129
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,041
Stop that!

130
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,541
How many times do I have to tell

131
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,208
you boys to be more courteous
to our first-time guests?

132
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,041
Please, you don't have to
be afraid, my princess.

133
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,125
I welcome you to the
Ouran Host Club.

134
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:05,916
Yes?

135
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,000
No!

136
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,208
Don't touch me!

137
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,958
You're phony!

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,166
What do you mean I'm phony?

139
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,708
Just what I said!
You're phony!

140
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,250
I find it hard to believe that

141
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,083
someone like you is the prince
character of this host club!

142
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,500
You shouldn't go spreading your

143
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,083
love around so easily
like that, you stupid!

144
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,166
You must be a
dim-witted narcissist!

145
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,250
You're incompetent!

146
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,333
You're a commoner!

147
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,000
You're disgusting!

148
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,583
He's created a new technique!

149
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,583
One-man slow-motion!

150
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
I don't suppose you are--

151
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,833
It's you, Kyoya!

152
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,375
Oh, how I've longed to meet you!

153
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,333
My one and only prince charming.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Your fiancée?

155
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,583
Kyoya-senpai?

156
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,125
Of course.

157
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,875
My name is Renge Hoshakuji and
I'm transferring into Ouran

158
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,500
Academy's 1st-Year,
Class A tomorrow.

159
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,208
Why is he sulking?

160
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,250
Because Mommy was
keeping a secret from Daddy.

161
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,083
Whatever.

162
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,291
Why does everyone insist on

163
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,958
referring to us like
we're husband and wife?

164
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,916
Ours is a story of
love at first sight.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,833
I couldn't resist the way you
were adoring those flowers in

166
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,583
the backyard when you thought
no one else was looking.

167
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,041
And how sweet it was when you

168
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,791
reached out to that poor,
little injured kitten.

169
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,833
She serious?

170
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,125
Could you have the wrong person?

171
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,208
No way!

172
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,791
I could recognize
my love anywhere!

173
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,208
He's a gentle man who's
kind to everyone

174
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,375
but doesn't ask for
anything in return.

175
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,750
He likes solitude but in fact,
sometimes he gets lonely.

176
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,041
He looks like the star

177
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,875
of the popular dating sim,
"Uki-doki Memorial"!

178
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,125
You're my real life
Ichijo Miyabi!

179
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:50,833
Uki?

180
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,458
Doki?

181
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,166
Otaku!

182
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,333
Otaku?

183
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,041
I've never seen one!

184
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,083
I get it now.

185
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,666
You're in love
with that character.

186
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,958
You're projecting that love onto
me, and you've somehow deluded

187
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,458
yourself into thinking
that we're engaged.

188
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,250
I assume this Miyabi character
probably wears glasses as well.

189
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,958
So she made it up?

190
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,125
You're not really
her fiancée, right?

191
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,166
Well no, I don't remember ever
asking for her hand in marriage.

192
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,125
Besides, this is the first time
I've ever met the woman.

193
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,750
According to my research, I
understand that you're in charge

194
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,333
of managing the club,
is that true, Kyoya?

195
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,125
That's right!

196
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,625
Kyo-chan is our director.

197
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,541
You're the club's director?

198
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,958
That's perfect!

199
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:28,750
Oh wow!

200
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,000
I've always wanted to wear

201
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,833
a sandwich board to
advertise a business.

202
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,041
We don't advertise.
We're just a host club.

203
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,583
I've made up my mind.

204
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,958
From now on I'm going to be
the manager of this host club!

205
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,291
Um, listen Kyoya.

206
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,625
Miss Hoshakuji is the only

207
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,250
daughter of a very
important Ootori family client.

208
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,208
So please be polite and try
not to offend her, alright?

209
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,125
Well boys, I can't
wait to work with you!

210
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,583
I thought about it
a lot last night

211
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,541
and maybe having a lady
manager isn't such a bad idea.

212
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,000
Why do you say that?

213
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,458
Well it's fairly
obvious, isn't it?

214
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,458
Renge just transferred into
the same class as Haruhi.

215
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,000
So, if Haruhi has a girl friend

216
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,791
around could bring out
the female within her.

217
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,375
Renge's girlish air of
tenderness might be able

218
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,583
to stimulate Haruhi's own
sense of femininity.

219
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,458
Good grief.

220
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,875
Now is our chance to help Haruhi

221
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,500
get in touch with
her feminine side!

222
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,916
This is an important
project, men!

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,208
She doesn't have any
friends in class right

224
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,625
now except for these
two shady twins.

225
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,333
That's no good for her.

226
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,958
Like you have room to talk.

227
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,333
Hey everyone!

228
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,625
You'll be happy to know that
your new manager, Renge,

229
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,791
has baked all of
you some cookies.

230
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,375
Isn't she ladylike!

231
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm so moved by your generosity!

232
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,458
I didn't bake these cookies
for you, you phony prince.

233
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm sorry I burnt
them a little bit,

234
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,916
I did the best I could

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,166
and I already know what
you're going to say.

236
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,541
Anything that you
make for me is

237
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,833
going to taste
delicious my dear.

238
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,583
Oh, you're always so
sweet to me, Kyoya.

239
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,458
She wasn't kidding.

240
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,500
These cookies really are burnt.

241
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,291
Don't eat that Mitsukuni.

242
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,583
It's bad for you.

243
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,083
She's scaring me!

244
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,250
They're not that bad at all.

245
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,041
They've got a good
flavor to them.

246
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,000
May I try?

247
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,291
Uh-oh Haruhi, you've got
crumbs on your face.

248
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,916
Did you see what they just--

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,458
And suddenly the
trio of classmates

250
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,583
are closer than they've
ever been before.

251
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,250
You know, you could've just told
me and I would've wiped it off.

252
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,083
And if you wanted to try
one there's plenty here.

253
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,708
That's not the way you're
supposed to react, Haruhi!

254
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,583
You have to stay strong
and reject them.

255
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,000
Then casually brush
them to the side!

256
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,208
Do you understand?

257
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,458
This is sexual
harassment, Senpai.

258
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,833
Sexual harassment?

259
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,250
If that counts as
sexual harassment

260
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,833
then they're twice as guilty!

261
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:52,791
Someone call the police!

262
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,166
Cut it out, boss.
We're sorry.

263
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,458
Renge-chan, Renge-chan.

264
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,333
Want some?

265
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,833
It's milk.

266
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,750
Lukewarm.

267
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,208
Every single one of you!

268
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,083
Except for Kyoya, all of your
characters are lukewarm!

269
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,291
Each of you needs
to have some sort

270
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,833
of "dark" side, you understand?

271
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,666
Girls are vulnerable to handsome
young men who are troubled!

272
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,875
If you keep carrying on like
this it's only a matter of time

273
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,125
before the girls
get tired of you

274
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,750
and stop coming all together.

275
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,625
Are you trying to ruin my
precious Kyoya's business?

276
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,375
As your manager, it's
my duty to change

277
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,125
your character backgrounds.
Let's start with you!

278
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,625
If all you are is
cute, inside and out,

279
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,125
then you're no
different than a baby.

280
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,500
Therefore, from now on,
you are the baby faced thug!

281
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,000
And Mori-senpai, you're his
childhood-friend; the flunkie!

282
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,958
The twins will be
basketball players,

283
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,000
enslaved in their own world!

284
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,583
Haruhi, you're an honor student
who's constantly being bullied!

285
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,250
And as for you Tamaki, you're
the school idol who's admired

286
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,708
for your good looks but you
actually have an inferiority

287
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,875
complex you're hiding
from the world.

288
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,125
The lonely prince!

289
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,125
And Kyoya you're perfect
just the way you are now.

290
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,916
So I want you to stay as kind
and affectionate as ever, kay?

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,250
Thank you. I'm honored.

292
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,500
"The lonely prince."

293
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,916
It's true, that title
is perfect for me.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,250
Yeah right, she couldn't
be farther from the truth.

295
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,333
Come on, Kyoya-senpai.

296
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,958
You've gotta do something!

297
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,125
Why? It seems like the
boss is up for it.

298
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,458
How does this look, Renge?

299
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,083
Do you think these poses
work for a lonely prince?

300
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,291
Oh wow, you're pretty
good at that, Tamaki!

301
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,625
But you know, it would be even

302
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,708
more effective if you
were standing in the rain.

303
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,708
Let's just wait and see
how things turn out.

304
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,500
I bet it'll be interesting.

305
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,125
It always is.

306
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,291
Get a stretcher!

307
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,041
Take him to the
infirmary immediately!

308
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,333
Kaoru?

309
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,125
Kaoru!

310
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,333
Kaoru!

311
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,916
You've got to get back
in the game, Hikaru.

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,791
We need you!

313
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,000
Shut up!

314
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,083
Hikaru.

315
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,750
Listen to me,
please don't worry.

316
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,958
There's nothing you can do.

317
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,750
You can't share my pain.

318
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,625
You're not the one who got hurt.

319
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,166
Now go on.

320
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,583
I can't!

321
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,083
It hurts.

322
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,791
It hurts, Kaoru!

323
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,708
Your pain is my pain.

324
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,916
It doesn't matter to me if
no one else understands.

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,666
As long as we have each
other, we can go on living.

326
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,208
I'm sorry but I'm envious.

327
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,416
The way the two of you
support each other like that.

328
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,166
But Suou-senpai.

329
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,958
How can you be envious of us?

330
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,583
You're the school's idol.

331
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,666
An idol, right.

332
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,416
I hate that people
all worship me

333
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,458
for something so superficial
as my appearance.

334
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,500
I think it would be much
better for me to be alone.

335
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,000
One lonely heart meets another.

336
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,833
They pass each other,
wounding one another.

337
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,916
What are the hearts of
these young men made of?

338
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,708
You can't run away forever.

339
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,541
I'm gonna show you what happens
to anyone that crosses me.

340
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,083
Don't do it, Mitsukuni.

341
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,708
You should have
realized by now that

342
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,083
whenever you hurt others you're
really just hurting yourself.

343
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,833
I didn't ask you for any advice.

344
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,958
You want me to put you
over my knee again?

345
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,333
Will it be the
light of salvation

346
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,416
that ultimately
awaits these boys?

347
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,583
Or will it be something else?

348
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,166
You know, it really
pisses me off

349
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,333
when people don't
know their place.

350
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,166
I'm so sorry, Haru-chan!

351
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,125
I can't do this anymore!

352
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,625
Cut, Cut!

353
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,083
Cut!

354
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,125
Cut!

355
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,166
What's wrong with you?

356
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,166
You've got to stick
to the script!

357
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,916
But I can't!

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,041
Stop rolling, cameraman!

359
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,208
Yes, boss.

360
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,916
I want the rain to
make things seem tragic!

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,458
How'd we go from
changing our characters

362
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,708
to shooting a movie about them?

363
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,583
And why is there an entire
film crew here to shoot it?

364
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,000
Apparently, she flew
them in from Hollywood.

365
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,083
Don't you recognize
the director?

366
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,958
He directed the vampire
movie, "Millennial Snow."

367
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,750
It was the number-one
grossing box-office hit

368
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,500
in America last year.

369
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,458
Damn these rich people.

370
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,000
And another thing,

371
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,166
how come this stupid script
portrays Kaoru as the pitcher?

372
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,166
Yeah.

373
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,791
What does that mean?

374
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,250
If you don't know, never mind.

375
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,583
Pitcher?

376
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,083
Haruhi. So how was I?

377
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,625
Did you like my performance?

378
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,833
It was pretty awesome.

379
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,958
I'm surprised you were able to

380
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,791
get into your
character like that.

381
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,416
You were really believable.

382
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,583
I've discovered a new,
darker side of myself.

383
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm starting to think it might
be a good idea to explore it.

384
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,125
Are you sure about that?

385
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,291
Because I think you're fine just
the way you are now, Senpai.

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,958
You do?

387
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,125
Well.

388
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,500
If you say so, Haruhi.

389
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,125
If he gets in touch
with his darker side,

390
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,000
he'll be that much
more trouble.

391
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:56,750
Hey, Haruhi!

392
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,041
You're on!

393
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,375
Coming!

394
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,250
Over here!

395
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,958
These two gentlemen
have just agreed

396
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,291
to make a special
appearance in our film.

397
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,166
In your film?

398
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,208
What are you talking about?

399
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,250
After all, we're going to need

400
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,583
some tough guys for
the big climax!

401
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,125
That's when all of the club
members come together

402
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,208
to fight against the real
villains at their school!

403
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,208
According to the script,

404
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,791
these two are from
a wealthy family

405
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,750
that got their wealth by being
a part of the Japanese Mafia.

406
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,916
Don't you think that's a
brilliant casting choice?

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,208
What's with this girl?

408
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,875
Whatever my dad does
has nothing to do with me!

409
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,083
Wait a minute, Renge.

410
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,250
Just come over here
and wait for your cue.

411
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,250
Hey!

412
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:33,958
You think you can
push me around?

413
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,250
You don't even know me!

414
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,500
Watch out!

415
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,625
Are you okay, Haruhi?

416
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,500
That guy was right, Renge.

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,083
You can't do that,
if you judge people

418
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,250
by their appearance
you're stereotyping them

419
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,041
and you'll never see
the person inside.

420
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,291
Um.

421
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,916
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,041
What happened, Haruhi?

423
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,083
So which one of you
jerks started this?

424
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:13,791
Wait, Suou!

425
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,500
It's not what you think!

426
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,458
That girl started it!

427
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,041
She was giving us a hard time!

428
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,833
He's telling the truth, Senpai.

429
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,500
It wasn't their fault.

430
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,000
They were provoked.

431
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,375
Let's get outta here!

432
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,583
Haruhi, are you any in pain?

433
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,416
Yeah.

434
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,208
It's my contact.

435
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,333
Your contact?

436
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,208
Yeah.

437
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,708
I guess it must've slipped out.

438
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,541
I see how it is!

439
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,083
You're able to cry
without using eye drops.

440
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,708
So you're a
full-fledged host now!

441
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,875
You, you.

442
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,083
Please tell me you
got that, cameraman!

443
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,250
Yes, boss!

444
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,458
Other than Haruhi's
contact falling out

445
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,333
that was an ideal final scene!

446
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,666
All it needs now is a moving
narration by my sweet Kyoya.

447
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,083
No!

448
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,166
What'd you do to my camera?

449
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,833
What?

450
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,458
Is something wrong?

451
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,083
I'm terribly sorry but
I cannot allow there

452
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,041
to be any record of a club
member engaging in violence.

453
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,291
I think you've caused enough
trouble around here, Renge.

454
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,291
Please stop being such a pest.

455
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,250
A pest?

456
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,541
But you're supposed to
pat me on the head

457
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,875
and tell me not to worry!

458
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,666
You're supposed to be kind
and affectionate, Kyoya!

459
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,166
Why are you acting
so differently now?

460
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,958
Tell me why!

461
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
Because that's not
the real Kyoya.

462
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
Does it really matter?

463
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,083
Who cares if Kyoya is
a little different

464
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,333
than you expected him to be?

465
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,000
Take a good look at
the person inside

466
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,708
and get to know him
little-by-little.

467
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,708
It's a lot more fun that way.

468
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,791
Long time no see, Renge.

469
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,000
Why are you so down?

470
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,500
Come on, please smile for me.

471
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,041
Today's going to be
a beautiful day.

472
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,166
After all, today you've learned
a very important lesson

473
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,875
that will help you live
happily ever after

474
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,708
and I'm so glad that you
finally understand.

475
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,125
I think you're ready to move on
to the next level, Renge.

476
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,625
Hello ladies, come on in.

477
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,625
I bought the video of
that film you made!

478
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,291
I bought it too!

479
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,333
And so did I!

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,125
You did?

481
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,250
That scene in the rain
was just phenomenal!

482
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,625
I love the lonely prince!

483
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,583
And the loving relationship
between Hikaru and Kaoru

484
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,083
was so sweet!

485
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,083
I want to see Honey act
like a thug again!

486
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,500
It was so cute!

487
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,791
I couldn't get enough of
Haruhi's poignant expressions!

488
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,708
Mori was definitely--

489
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,791
Kyoya?

490
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,291
I may have broken
the camera's lens

491
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,833
but the footage that we had
already shot wasn't damaged.

492
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,375
But naturally, I did cut out
that one violent scene.

493
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,250
Sales have been
pretty good so far.

494
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,666
That Hollywood film crew
did a fantastic job

495
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,500
but then I guess
that's to be expected.

496
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
So is this what you
meant by "interesting"?

497
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
It's best to have as much money
as we can in the club's budget.

498
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,250
And just when did he start
calculating all of this?

499
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,041
Good day, everyone.

500
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,375
Renge?

501
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,541
But I thought you had gone
back to France already.

502
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,333
I can't believe I didn't
realize this sooner.

503
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,541
It was so chivalrous of you to
risk your life to protect me.

504
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,375
I could feel the love
when you lectured me

505
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,916
about judging people.

506
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,916
When you said it was fun to get

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,250
to know people little-by-little
you were talking about me!

508
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,083
Yeah.

509
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,416
Come on Haruhi,

510
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,208
let's go to my house and
play some games together.

511
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,166
I think it's time you
got to know me better!

512
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,500
What?

513
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,875
Hey. Kyoya-senpai.

514
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,166
You okay with that?

515
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,125
Why wouldn't I be?

516
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,083
Everything Renge said is true.

517
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,500
No it isn't!

518
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,916
But I thought you were the
one who wanted her to have

519
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
a female friend in
the first place!

520
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,125
Well yeah, a female companion!

521
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,416
Not a girlfriend!

522
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,250
Come on, Haruhi!

523
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,541
Let's go play together!

524
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,333
No wait!

525
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,125
Don't take Haruhi from me!

526
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,875
I'm so sick of your face!

527
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,541
Your haircut's stupid!

528
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,583
Sex pixie!

529
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,166
Sicko!

530
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,041
What's going on?

531
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,375
What's up with Hikaru and Kaoru?

532
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,750
Next time, "The Twins Fight"!

533
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,625
The Ouran Host Club
