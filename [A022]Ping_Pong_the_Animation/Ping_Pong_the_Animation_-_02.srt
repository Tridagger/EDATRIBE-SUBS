1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,416
This is terrible.
I wish I'd never been born.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Can't believe I got skunked.

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,375
The whole world's laughing
at me right now, I know it!

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,500
[HOSHINO groans]

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,208
[TAMURA] Do me a favor,
Peco, and go home.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,666
It's hard to work
over your pouting.

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,375
Damn you, China. What's your
weakness? You're too good.

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,083
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Hook loop! Inside out loop!

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,791
Smash! Back! Inside out!

10
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,250
Fore!

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,500
Crazy, his coach makes him
change his stroke on the fly

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,625
and he's still
hitting every target!

13
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,250
And Kong won't even play
a single game with us.

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,166
[TSUJIDO PLAYER 2C]
Course not. He thinks we suck!

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,250
[TSUJIDO PLAYER 2A] Dude.
You think that's the rubber

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,666
you can only get in China?

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,000
[TSUJIDO PLAYER 2C] Nah,
he probably stopped getting it

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,041
since he's off the
Provincial team.

19
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,250
[in Chinese] Shut up!
You're distracting me!

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,000
Uh, sorry, boys...
Would you mind being

21
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,125
a little quieter so
Kong can concentrate?

22
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,500
Yeah. Of course,
sorry, sir.

23
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,000
[in Chinese]
What's wrong, Wenge?

24
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,416
[KONG, in Chinese]
Is the chopper with glasses

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,000
out today, too?

26
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,833
Kong wants to know if the kid
with glasses is here today.

27
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,166
The one with the chop?

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,791
Yes, sir. We can get him.

29
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,791
Hey, Goda!
Kong wants to play you!

30
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,875
[KONG, in Chinese]
Let's keep going, Coach.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,208
[KONG, in Chinese]
Where is he?

32
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,958
[TSUKIMOTO] It's safe
and quiet in here.

33
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,916
I don't mind it.
I'm comfortable.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,291
If I don't make a sound, I'll
be fine. I can stay in here.

35
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll be so quiet they won't even
hear me breathe. Like a robot.

36
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,916
No! Leave me alone!

37
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,000
I told you. You can
go get him yourself.

38
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,916
When Peco's not here,
he's usually at the dojo

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,083
by the rail station. I already
said I'd draw you a map

40
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,500
if you think
you'll get lost.

41
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,333
Look, we're nice guys,
we don't like hazing.

42
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,250
But you're forcing
our hand here, bro!

43
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,541
That's completely
illogical.

44
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,125
[OTA] Don't use
math words with me!

45
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,833
Yeah, that's against team rules!
No algebra talk during practice!

46
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,250
[KOIZUMI]
That's enough.

47
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,208
Look, Mr. Tsukimoto. I'd rather
you not go to Tamura's.

48
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,125
Or play Hoshino anymore.

49
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,000
Why wouldn't I
play him? He's good.

50
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,375
Yeah. I'm confused.

51
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,000
Because you
go easy on him.

52
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,875
And that's bad
for your training.

53
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't do that.

54
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,000
It's subconscious, I guess.

55
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Tsukimoto, I want
you training with me

56
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,833
every day before school
from now on, five A.M.

57
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,958
You lack a thirst to win,
and we have to fix that

58
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,916
before Championships,
because if there's anything

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,583
a true competitor needs,
it's fighting spirit!

60
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,416
Of course, it's not mandatory.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,625
But I'm sure you want
to reach your potential.

62
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,958
So I look forward to seeing
you tomorrow, bright and early.

63
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,291
[TSUKIMOTO] I'm not
practicing early.

64
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,750
Certainly not at five.

65
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,166
[KOIZUMI] No problem,
take your time.

66
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,041
I'll be here when you're ready.

67
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,166
He'll wait for you. Sounds
like a great love story.

68
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,833
Coach and Smile,
sittin' in a tree!

69
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,791
Carbonation has gotten totally
weak these days. I know it's

70
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,083
part of that all-natural-
organic-health-craze crap,

71
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,791
but can't a guy have some
freakin' bubbles in his soda?

72
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,916
Hey, Smile, what's up?
I guess practice is over?

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,416
Yeah.

74
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,541
And lemme guess,
because I skipped,

75
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,250
the jerks made
you all run laps.

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah.

77
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,541
[HOSHINO]
That sucks.

78
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,958
Those upperclassmen
shouldn't harass you guys.

79
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,583
I'm the one not showin' up.

80
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,583
[TSUKIMOTO]
Mm.

81
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,750
Well, that'll end
soon enough.

82
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,666
I've decided I'm
gonna quit the team.

83
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,208
[TSUKIMOTO]
Mm.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,791
Seriously, that's
your response?

85
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,583
If you don't like it,
then quit.

86
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,916
Don't force yourself
to play a game.

87
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,625
[HOSHINO] Exactly my point!
It's supposed to be fun, right?

88
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,458
[HOSHINO] So, uh, how long
till Championship Qualifiers?

89
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,958
Two months.

90
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,083
Aw, that quick? Not even time
to feel sorry for myself.

91
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,833
Old Lady, we're
taking table four.

92
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,041
[TAMURA]
I'm charging you for it.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,708
[KOIZUMI] Four mornings
in a row, Mr. Tsukimoto.

94
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,541
I find that five A.M.'s a
bit too quiet in the gym

95
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,916
for just one old man
making serves at the wall.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,833
Why don't you come train,
like I asked?

97
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,250
Why should I be the only
one with extra practice?

98
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,958
I'd rather just sleep.

99
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,958
Didja know you're deprivin' my
life of meaning? A coach's job

100
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,958
has no purpose without
a great athlete to train.

101
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,125
Don'tcha want to be the protégé
who defines my twilight years?

102
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,500
Not really.

103
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,125
Well... Startin' today,
I don't wantcha thinking

104
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,166
about anything other
than table tennis.

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you thinking
about right now?

106
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,500
Question five.

107
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,166
That's nonsense! What good
has high school English class

108
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,750
ever done for anybody?

109
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Quiet, Mr. Koizumi!
We can't focus!

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,750
[KOIZUMI]
Sorry, kids, sorry.

111
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,250
[TSUKIMOTO] It's all
just killing time.

112
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,333
[HOSHINO snores]

113
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,000
[KOIZUMI]
Hm?

114
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,541
Playing ping pong
or learning vocab.

115
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,541
Both just kill time
until we die.

116
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,958
[HOSHINO]
What do you say, Smile?

117
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,541
You a peanut man
or a caramel man?

118
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,500
[TSUKIMOTO]
Uh, caramel?

119
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,916
Yeah, right? It's just
basic common sense!

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,916
But the convenience store
by my place only stocks

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,375
the peanut ones--it's lame!
It's like a torture experiment!

122
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,666
Who wants peanuts?

123
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,041
Mr. Tsukimoto.
What are you eating?

124
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,666
It's a hammager, sir.

125
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,291
Diction, boy, diction.
Hamburger.

126
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,791
Hamburger?

127
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,291
[KOIZUMI] It's a
lump of cholesterol.

128
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,833
I don't want you
eating that. Here.

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,625
[HOSHINO]
Who-o-oa!

130
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,750
[KOIZUMI] Starting today,
I'll be making your lunches

131
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,958
with food that's
actually good for you.

132
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,166
I call it the "Strong For
Ping Pong Diet." Enjoy!

133
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,541
You can't make
me eat this.

134
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,666
True love!

135
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,791
[KOIZUMI]
Yes! Love!

136
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,916
[KOIZUMI hums]

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,416
You seem happy, Jo.

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,916
Let's just say that springtime

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,125
has come again
for this old fool.

140
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,416
Hm? What's that?
A love letter from Coach?

141
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,333
[HOSHINO]
Oh, ouch. Tough love.

142
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,166
Throw it away.

143
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,750
Mix up your attacks!
Stay on it, more follow through!

144
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,416
And keep those feet moving!

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,875
Does Coach always get like this

146
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,708
when qualifiers
are coming around?

147
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,416
No, I've never
seen him this way.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,416
It is spring;
maybe he's in heat.

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,791
Your moves are too repetitive;
you need to vary your game!

150
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,000
The tough guy act's not gonna
work with Smile, though,

151
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,666
he hates getting yelled at.

152
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
Don't let him ace you--
knock 'im back!

153
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,791
Why aren't you attacking?
Make him miss!

154
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,541
See, that was
the time to strike!

155
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,750
Do what I told you!
Are you even trying?

156
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,958
Where are you going?
The game's not over yet. Wait!

157
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,958
He's out.

158
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,208
[KOIZUMI] Mr. Tsukimoto!
Come back!

159
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
Yup, and I guess
that's my cue.

160
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,625
[KOIZUMI grunts]

161
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,833
[HOSHINO] Dude! Check out
the view of Mount Fuji today!

162
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,166
You can't be in a bad mood!
The weather's too awesome!

163
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,500
[TSUKIMOTO] Everything
makes me so tired lately.

164
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,416
I hate dealing with people.

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,333
And even ping pong is getting
more complicated now.

166
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,333
It's not like
when we were kids.

167
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,333
[HOSHINO] He's a little
too hard on you, yeah,

168
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,375
but I think he's
a smart coach.

169
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,125
He's giving you the
training you need.

170
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,125
You're wrong about that.
I'm only in it to pass the time.

171
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,916
Having fun is enough for me.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,875
I don't want to
sacrifice things I like

173
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,500
or drag other people
down just to win.

174
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,000
[OTA]
Just bailed, man.

175
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,541
Hey!

176
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,583
[KAZAMA] Gentlemen!
My name is Ryuichi Kazama,

177
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,375
second-year at Kaio
Academy. I've come here

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,250
to observe your practice
today, if you will allow it!

179
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,500
Kaio, huh?

180
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,750
[KATASE PLAYER 1A]
That's Dragon!

181
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,708
He was the high school
champ last year, right?

182
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,750
[KATASE PLAYER 1B]
Fourth at World Juniors, too.

183
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,166
[KATASE PLAYER 1C]
What's he doing at our school?

184
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,500
[KATASE PLAYER 1B]
Headhunting?

185
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,958
[KATASE PLAYER 1A] Yeah,
probably came to watch me.

186
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,083
[KATASE PLAYER 1B]
Dude, shut up.

187
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,250
[KATASE PLAYER 1A]
Guy looks military.

188
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,125
Is he really in high school?

189
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,000
Would you mind stepping
outside with me, Mr. Kazama?

190
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,375
I think you're making my
boys feel a touch nervous.

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,166
[KOIZUMI]
Mr. Tsukimoto isn't here today.

192
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,541
He's the one you're
interested in, am I right?

193
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,333
[KAZAMA] I first saw him play
in a middle school tournament.

194
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,708
He lost, but his skills
were impressive.

195
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:50,208
Control, speed, playmaking,
reflexes, concentration.

196
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,833
He was far above
middle school level.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,541
Honestly, he was good enough to
make me question my own skills.

198
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,208
And yet you said he lost.
Who beat him?

199
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,583
[KAZAMA] A guy
named Manabu Sakuma.

200
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,041
He's a freshman at Kaio
this year, but I'm told

201
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,791
he trained at the same dojo
as Tsukimoto for a while.

202
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,583
[KOIZUMI]
I see.

203
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,208
[KAZAMA] Human reaction speed
maxes out at point-one second.

204
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,000
Becoming elite at table tennis

205
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,000
means getting as close to
that threshold as possible.

206
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,583
[KOIZUMI] Those are the words
of your school's president.

207
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,458
[KAZAMA] Yes. Our approach
is fundamentally different

208
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,583
from a casual
ping pong club.

209
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,333
That was a dig against
my school, wasn't it?

210
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,916
You're implying
we're a bad fit

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,291
for a player with
Mr. Tsukimoto's talents.

212
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,291
[KAZAMA] As I see it, he's a
swan among ducklings here.

213
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
[KOIZUMI]
Question for you, Mr. Kazama.

214
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,500
Whaddya suppose are the odds
that my "first year swan"

215
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,208
will beat you at qualifiers
two months from now?

216
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,083
Do you think he can?

217
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,666
[KAZAMA]
Not a chance.

218
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,208
I wanna be the
number-one player

219
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,333
on the whole freakin'
Earth. The best!

220
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,875
I want that gold World
Champion trophy on my shelf.

221
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,833
It's my biggest dream.

222
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,041
Guess we're different
that way, aren't we?

223
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,291
[TSUKIMOTO]
Mm.

224
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,708
It's all right; it makes
things simpler for me.

225
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,500
I hate losing, so I don't
care about hurting

226
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,583
other people's feelings
when I play 'em.

227
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,833
That's their problem--
I just want to win.

228
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,333
[TSUKIMOTO] Yeah, fair enough.
I'll be rooting for you.

229
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,250
Then promise me you'll come
to the club tomorrow, okay?

230
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,750
Cause practice is totally
pointless when you're not there.

231
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,333
[GIRL squeals]

232
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,750
[HOSHINO] It's shaping up
to be another hot summer!

233
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,416
Ya never answered me, Coach.

234
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,916
Why am I the only one
training this way?

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,291
Because you're a different sort
of player; it's simple as that.

236
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,041
Let's get goin', sweetheart.
No time to waste.

237
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,416
Two tables, damn.

238
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,083
The old man's brutal.

239
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,500
[KOIZUMI] Too slow,
too slow, too slow!

240
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,083
Pick up the pace!

241
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,583
No stopping!
Move, move!

242
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,208
And those ain't easy
serves to return, either.

243
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,791
I'm surprised Smile
is keeping up with 'em.

244
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,458
He runs a crazy fast
marathon, you know.

245
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,083
We're in the middle of
practice, Hoshino--

246
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,708
where'd you get that candy from?

247
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,916
Crossover!
Go! Faster!

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,416
The corner store.

249
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,958
[KOIZUMI]
Move!

250
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,708
No napping, Tsukimoto!
Do you see a couch?

251
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,375
What's the point
of all this, sir?

252
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,250
To get stronger.

253
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,375
But that's stupid.

254
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,166
It's how you win.

255
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,250
I'm not interested in shiny
medals. That's not why I play.

256
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,458
Some views you can't appreciate
until you're at the top.

257
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,583
I'm telling you
I don't care.

258
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,166
I think you give up and
withdraw into your shell

259
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,416
whenever you're challenged.

260
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,666
I live my life how I want.
It's none of your business.

261
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,750
All right, Mr. Tsukimoto, fine.
I challenge you to a match.

262
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,750
If you win, I promise to never
interfere with you again.

263
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,750
You'll be as free as a bird.

264
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,166
[TSUKIMOTO]
And if I lose?

265
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,541
[KOIZUMI] "Woof! Woof!"
You'll be my dog on a leash.

266
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,000
You'll obey my every command.

267
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,541
This is a best-of-three match!
Service to Coach Koizumi!

268
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,916
I'll make you heel.

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
Ready!

270
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,500
What the crap? Does the old
man really think he can win?

271
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,375
Not a chance. He was
famous back in his time,

272
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,208
but he's no match
for Tsukimoto now.

273
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,750
[KOIZUMI] It's time you got some
perspective, Mr. Tsukimoto.

274
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:44,333
I'll show you how soft and
weak your game actually is.

275
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,125
[TSUKIMOTO gasps]

276
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,500
[TSUKIMOTO]
Wha--?!

277
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,916
Aw, come on!
That wasn't a fair serve!

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,791
[KOIZUMI] Sure it was!
You returned it, didn't you?

279
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,166
[OTA] Point counts!
One-Love!

280
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,416
Kinda cheap trick there,
Coach, isn't it?

281
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
He's good.

282
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,208
[KOIZUMI] Are you gonna
get mad, Mr. Tsukimoto?

283
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,083
Of course not.
You'll shrink away,

284
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,000
like you always do
when you're confronted...

285
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,000
Here!

286
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,708
[KOIZUMI]
...like a scared child.

287
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,958
[KOIZUMI]
Yeah!

288
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,958
Listen to the old guy roar.

289
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,833
He's doing it for effect. He
knows exactly what Smile hates.

290
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,083
[KOIZUMI] I can read
you like a book.

291
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,416
If I send the ball to
you at this angle...

292
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
You'll return it
the same every time.

293
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:33,250
Straight, almost flat.
Leaving you exposed.

294
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,500
Like that!

295
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
[TSUKIMOTO sighs]

296
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,541
[KOIZUMI] And you mentally
quit at the drop of a hat.

297
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:44,041
Accepting defeat so
gracefully. It's naïve!

298
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,291
You'll never cross the sea
on such delicate wings.

299
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,166
Setbacks and defeats!
Loss and grief!

300
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
Holy crap.

301
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,041
[KOIZUMI] Isolation and turmoil!
Anguish and despair!

302
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,875
Not the kinda play
you expect from a guy

303
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,166
with one foot in the grave.

304
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
[KOIZUMI]
Nihilism and ruin!

305
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,083
[HOSHINO]
He's relentless.

306
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,750
[OTA]
Point! Five-love!

307
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,875
I'm gonna teach you
everything, Mr. Tsukimoto!

308
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,000
That's eight-love!

309
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,500
How fragile you are!

310
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,041
And how to find the
strength to conquer!

311
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,000
[TSUKIMOTO]
It's safe and quiet here.

312
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't mind it.
I'm comfortable.

313
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,083
[TSUKIMOTO]
Someone's coming!

314
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:34,375
No, it's okay. If I don't
make a sound, I'll be fine.

315
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,416
If I go outside...
it'll happen again.

316
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,416
[KOIZUMI
Hah!

317
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
[TSUKIMOTO gasps]

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
[OTA] Eleven-four!
Game to Coach Koizumi!

319
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,125
[KOIZUMI]
Hm.

320
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,458
[TSUKIMOTO]
The hero appears...

321
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,500
The hero appears...
The hero appears...

322
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,916
I don't believe it.
Coach may actually win.

323
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,250
[HOSHINO chuckles]

324
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,833
[HOSHINO] Once a softy,
always a softy, eh, Smile?

325
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,666
You'll never change.

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,041
[KOIZUMI]
Hah!

327
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
Your weakest spot
is down the middle.

328
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,750
Where players have to choose
between forehand or backhand.

329
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,291
Without fail, you'll go
with a long backhand chop.

330
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,250
Utterly predictable.

331
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,791
Look out!

332
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,333
I hope for your sake you're
not going easy on me,

333
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,458
or showing me mercy. Because
I'm about to make you my dog!

334
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,250
You'll shake when I say shake!

335
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,791
Spin three times
and bark on command!

336
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,458
I'll make ya do it too,
I promise! Put a leash around

337
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,583
your neck and walk ya through
the neighborhood every day!

338
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,708
What a nice boy,
respecting his elder!

339
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,375
A shining example for
your whole generation!

340
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
[TSUKIMOTO] Why can't
everybody leave me alone?

341
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm not getting mad,
I'm not laughing at anything.

342
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,208
I'm just here! I don't even
make a noise when I breathe.

343
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,375
I just sit in the back, being
quiet, doing what I'm told.

344
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,250
Like a good little robot.

345
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,625
[TSUKIMOTO]
The hero appears...

346
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,541
The hero appears...
The hero appears...

347
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,291
Who's that?

348
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,166
[KOIZUMI grunts]

349
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,583
Hand on the table!
That'll cost you a point!

350
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,291
Shut up. You really think

351
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,875
that's something worth
screaming about?

352
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,083
I want you to be
quiet too, Coach.

353
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,208
It's not distracting me.
It just pisses me off.

354
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,333
Hey! Get down! That definitely
seems against the rules!

355
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,458
All right.

356
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,708
Look who got cool.

357
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,708
[TSUKIMOTO]
Yeah!

358
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,333
Eleven-six!
Game to Tsukimoto!

359
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,958
Tsukimoto found his second
wind. Coach is screwed.

360
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,916
Yeah, you may be right, but it's
been one heck of a battle.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,750
[KATASE PLAYER 1I]
Coach is over seventy, right?

362
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,750
This has to be rough on him.

363
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,791
[HOSHINO] I can't
believe it, Smile.

364
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,083
When did you learn
to play like this?

365
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,166
[TAMURA] The kid's
not exactly friendly.

366
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,916
Can't he even say hello?

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,125
[YOUNG HOSHINO]
He never smiles.

368
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,708
[YOUNG TSUKIMOTO]
Ping pong?

369
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,041
[YOUNG HOSHINO] Softly, like
you're holding an egg. Okay?

370
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,500
[TSUKIMOTO yells]

371
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,291
[KOIZUMI pants]

372
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,958
[TSUKIMOTO] Stand up so we
can finish our match, sir.

373
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:48,041
It's really annoying the way
you pause after every point.

374
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,041
[robotic noises accompany
TSUKIMOTO's movements]

375
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,083
Do you see a
couch over there?

376
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,291
[KOIZUMI] I'm dizzy.
I need five minutes.

377
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,083
[TSUKIMOTO] Umpire.
My opponent's withdrawing.

378
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,750
No! I was only kidding!
I take it back!

379
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,625
Very good, Mr. Tsukimoto.
I was just testing you.

380
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,125
Way to stay tough!

381
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,875
I don't think Coach
is lookin' so hot.

382
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,625
Yeah, no, he's
totally broken.

383
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,583
Now Tsukimoto's being cruel.

384
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,708
[KOIZUMI] You're finally
starting to understand,

385
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:20,625
aren't you? You don't chase
the ball. The ball chases you.

386
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,208
Stand up to it, make it
bend to your will,

387
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:27,125
and you'll grow strong.
You feel it, right?

388
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:32,916
You feel it chasing you! Now,
show me what you can really do!

389
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,291
[KOIZUMI] Now the corner.
Prove you can return it!

390
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:46,791
[KOIZUMI] That's it, boy.
The ball chases you.

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,458
[TSUKIMOTO]
Can I be like you?

392
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,791
[YOUNG TSUKIMOTO] Do you think
I'll ever be like you, Peco?

393
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,875
[YOUNG TSUKIMOTO] Cause I wanna
be. I wanna be just like you.

394
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,791
[KATASE PLAYER 2C]
Aw, man! Coach is down!

395
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,791
[OTA] Guys, I think I
heard something crack.

396
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,291
[KATASE PLAYER 2D]
Is he dead?

397
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,166
First-years, take him
to the nurse! Hurry!

398
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,416
But look, he's smiling,
maybe he's okay.

399
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,458
Yeah, you're right.

400
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,791
Maybe that just
means brain damage.

401
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,875
I'm heading out now,
Peco. See ya.

402
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
[HOSHINO]
Huh?

403
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,500
[TSUKIMOTO]
Later.

404
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,833
You can't leave!
It's your fault he fell!

405
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,208
I haven't dismissed
you from practice!

406
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:31,625
You don't get to ignore me!
Hey! Get back here, Tsukimoto!
