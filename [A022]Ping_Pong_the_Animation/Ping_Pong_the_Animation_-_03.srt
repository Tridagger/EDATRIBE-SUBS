1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,541
[MRS. KOIZUMI]
Tsukimoto?

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,250
It is Tsukimoto, isn't it?

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,208
Are you here to pay my
husband a get-well visit?

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,875
Oh, how thoughtful.

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,666
They say he
overworked his muscles.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,583
I think he forgets
he's over seventy now!

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,833
Come on inside.

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,166
I'm sure he'll be
just thrilled to see you.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,000
Uh, no, that's okay.

10
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,750
As long as he's all right,
then I think I'm just gonna go.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,833
[MRS. KOIZUMI] Nonsense!
I'm making dinner. Join us.

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,708
[TSUKIMOTO] Thanks, but I
don't really like eating

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,208
at other people's houses.

14
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,833
Ah. Perfectly understandable.

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,291
Poor boy, you must
have it so rough

16
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,791
with that old man always
giving you such a hard time.

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,791
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,500
He can be a real
pain in the rear.

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,875
Well you're not big
on tact, that's for sure.

20
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,416
Sorry.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,041
No, it's refreshing.

22
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,083
Come see us again
sometime, will ya?

23
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,125
All right. I will.

24
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,666
Look forward to it!

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,375
He's adorable.

26
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,333
And such clear eyes.

27
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,125
Well that boy's gonna
become a monster before long.

28
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,666
He's about ready to
burst out of his cocoon.

29
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,958
Just needs a hard-ass
old Ping-Pong coach

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,750
to give him a
little push, is all.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,416
[KAIO PRESIDENT] I'm counting on
you to lead us to victory again,

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Ryuichi.

33
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,291
For in triumph, we find truth.

34
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,541
Your school needs
you to prevail,

35
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,458
to demonstrate to the world
this institution's supreme

36
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,041
quality in all fields.

37
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,541
[KAZAMA]
Yes, sir!

38
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,541
Though I have some concerns
about the team competition.

39
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,041
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
Whatever it takes, son;

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,833
patch any gaps
in our arsenal!

41
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,458
[KAZAMA] I do have my eye on
a chopper from Katase High.

42
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,500
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
Katase?

43
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,458
One of Koizumi's, huh?

44
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,791
And this chopper's that good?

45
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,375
I don't know yet, sir.

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,750
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
If he is, recruit him.

47
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,083
I trust you and Taku
can handle this.

48
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,083
[KAZAMA]
Yes, sir!

49
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,166
Any compromise

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
is like cutting
off your own arm.

51
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,750
Remember, if we lose,
it's entirely on you.

52
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,791
Yes, sir!

53
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,208
Yeah!

54
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,833
Come back in
three hundred years.

55
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,958
Maybe then you can beat me.

56
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,166
So Koizumi's
working with Smile, eh?

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,166
Huh.

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,666
I do not like that.
Not a bit.

59
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,875
[MIC CHECK GUY 3A]
Testing mic check.

60
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,458
[MALE PLAYER 3A]
Hey, is that Kaio?

61
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,791
[MALE PLAYER 3B]
Aw, they're here?

62
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,000
[MALE PLAYER 3C] Yeah,
d'ya think they'd no-show?

63
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,791
[MALE PLAYER 3D]
Whoa, check out their heads.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,458
Dammit, Mister Tsukimoto,
where are you?

65
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,458
[n Chinese]
What's wrong, Wenge?

66
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,875
Homesick?

67
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,958
[in Chinese]
Heh, you could say that.

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,500
[HOSHINO] So, how's
your bracket looking?

69
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,625
[TSUKIMOTO]
Sucky.

70
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,958
I've got Kong Wenge
in my third match.

71
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,958
Oh, man.

72
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,500
That really does suck.

73
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,583
What's yours like?

74
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,041
Meh, I got a
pretty tough match

75
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,375
in the quarterfinals.

76
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,625
but if I can beat him,

77
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,958
then I'm in the top four
and off to nationals.

78
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,875
Ah.

79
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,958
Speak of the nuisance,
he's coming this way.

80
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,375
Oh, Peco.

81
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,583
Whoops, sorry.

82
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,958
Guess I didn't see
you there, pipsqueak.

83
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:17,916
'Scuse me?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,250
Should I know who you are?

85
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,166
Y'talk a big game
for a middling player

86
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,583
from a second-rate school.

87
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,541
Least I'm not an
anchor dragging down my team!

88
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,083
Actually, they
just bumped me up

89
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,666
to the varsity squad.

90
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,958
[HOSHINO]
No way!

91
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,208
[TAKU]
Sakuma!

92
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,750
Team meeting!

93
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,708
On the bus!

94
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,250
[SAKUMA]
Yes, sir!

95
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,166
Hey, Smile, you're still taggin'
along with this whiny loser

96
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,666
wherever he goes?

97
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,041
Well, say hi to
the old lady for me.

98
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,541
Yeah, I will.

99
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,791
[SAKUMA]
And Peco!

100
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,416
Don't forget to bring
tissues to our match!

101
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,416
You always sob like
a baby when you lose!

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,666
Shut up or I'll
smash your glasses!

103
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,458
Kaio's Varsity squad, huh?

104
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,291
[TAKU]
You know those guys?

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,541
[SAKUMA]
Yes sir.

106
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,083
We used to hang out at
the same dojo as kids.

107
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,041
Um, sir, I haven't seen
Kazama around in a while.

108
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,958
[TAKU]
He's in the john.

109
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,166
Don't worry about it.

110
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,875
[SAKUMA]
The john?

111
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,916
Someday, you'll
understand just how tough

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,250
this all is for him.

113
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,666
[KONG, in Chinese] I can't
believe I have to play them.

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,333
They're like
kids messing around.

115
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,458
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
Get changed, Wenge.

116
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,875
You're up soon.

117
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,833
[KONG, in Chinese]
You wanna play instead?

118
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,333
You could win.

119
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,583
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
You're not a spectator here.

120
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,625
Play seriously.

121
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:30,958
[TSUKIMOTO]
Ni hao.

122
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,291
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
It's that boy.

123
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,458
I'll look into him.

124
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,541
[in Chinese] Suddenly
I feel like there's some hope.

125
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,083
[MALE STUDENT 3A] Hey,
isn't that Kong over there?

126
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
[MALE STUDENT 3B]
Didn't think he'd be so emo.

127
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,208
[MALE STUDENT 3C] C'mon, Mister
Bigtime, show us what you got!

128
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
[MALE STUDENT 3D] Dude, he
can't understand a word you say.

129
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,041
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
Yo, China!

130
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,666
Go back where you came from!

131
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,166
[KAZAMA]
Knock it off! Now!

132
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,416
Treating our guest
with anything but respect

133
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,625
will not be tolerated.

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,666
[MALE STUDENT 3B]
Who's the buzzkill?

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,458
[MALE STUDENT 3C]
Shh!

136
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,041
I'm Kazama, from Kaio.

137
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,083
Can we talk for a minute?

138
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,750
I thought Kaio was
supposed to be in a meeting

139
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,125
right now.

140
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,333
Is that a no?

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,375
You do not try to hide
how you're feeling, do you?

142
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,000
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
Whoa, awesome drive.

143
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,875
[MALE STUDENT 3B]
It's going dead sideways!

144
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,125
[MALE UMPIRE 3A]
Eleven-love.

145
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,375
Game goes to Kong.

146
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,625
[crowd cheering]

147
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,958
[MALE STUDENT 3C] Ouch,
that dude from Johoku

148
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,208
didn't score a single point!

149
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,875
Facing such a weak opponent,

150
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,166
it's almost impossible to judge
just how good Kong really is.

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,208
It's too much.

152
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,625
Not cool.

153
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,791
He didn't have to
embarrass him like that.

154
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,333
Not easy to bounce back
from that kind of defeat.

155
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,625
How very sensitive of you.

156
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,125
It's not sensitivity.

157
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,875
What then, confidence?

158
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,041
[KONG, in Chinese]
Yes!

159
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,000
[crowd cheering]

160
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,583
[KAZAMA] Kong knows
better than any of us

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,750
the agony that can come
from failing at table tennis.

162
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,083
His whole life was upended

163
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,708
when he was dropped from
the Chinese National Team.

164
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,791
Bet havin' to play here
on our little island

165
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,333
is the last thing he wants
to be doin' right now.

166
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,958
At least if he conquers Japan,

167
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,458
he'll have a shot at a
comeback in his home country.

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,833
But if he loses,
forget about China.

169
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,666
He probably won't even be
able to stick around here.

170
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Which means his career
is pretty much over.

171
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,250
Been meanin' to tell ya.

172
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,375
I don't like the way
you play the game.

173
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,583
Your technique is
flawless, I admit.

174
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,583
However, it absolutely
disgusts me how you always take

175
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,250
your opponent's
feelings into account.

176
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,166
That there tells me you're
not fit to hold a paddle.

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,958
Makes me physically sick.

178
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,041
Well, I can't say
it feels great

179
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,875
to be crapped on so bluntly.

180
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,541
Kazama. Time to go.

181
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,208
Yeah. I'm comin'.

182
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,708
[MALE UMPIRE 3A]
Match goes to Kong.

183
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,958
[MURATA]
Damn it.

184
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,375
[MALE STUDENT 3B]
I kinda wanna go home now.

185
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,791
[MALE STUDENT 3A] Murata
didn't even last ten minutes!

186
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,000
[MALE STUDENT 3D]
Poor guy.

187
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,791
Hey, I need you
to listen for a sec.

188
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,000
You have to promise me

189
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,541
that you're not gonna
hold back in there.

190
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,250
It's a bad habit you've got.

191
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,625
Don't worry, sir, I plan to win.

192
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,083
No holding back.

193
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,000
So how much should I win by?

194
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,166
Two points? Ten?

195
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,083
Total skunk?

196
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,125
Whatever you want.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,083
[TSUKIMOTO]
Oh, I know.

198
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,916
Since Kong won his
match in ten minutes,

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,166
how about I
get it done in five?

200
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,458
What's gotten into you, son?

201
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,458
Nothin', I just
wanna win, is all.

202
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,375
Is that so wrong?

203
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,458
Oh, no.

204
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,000
Music to my ears.

205
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,583
[SAKUMA] Dude, that
was pretty harsh of you

206
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
with Tsukimoto back there.

207
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,708
Now, don't get me wrong,
I think it'll do him some good.

208
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,041
He's always been
a stuck-up little--

209
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,208
[KAZAMA] You seem to know
this dude pretty well.

210
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,541
Any ideas on how to
get him to join our team?

211
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,708
Next year's gonna be rough

212
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,000
if I'm the only
strong player we've got.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
[KAZAMA]
Hey, Kong, what's up?

214
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,666
Ni hao, ni hao!

215
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,458
[in Chinese]
Come on, Wenge, that was Kazama!

216
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
[in Chinese]
I hate his type.

217
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,125
[SAKUMA]
Yeah, just ignore us!

218
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,458
Real nice, jerk!

219
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,000
[EGAMI]
Tsukimoto of Katase High.

220
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:18,625
Here.

221
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,750
Yeah.

222
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,541
[EGAMI]
Never heard of him.

223
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,750
Looks like he's a
decent chopper, though.

224
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,958
Let's have fun.

225
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
[TSUKIMOTO]
Okay.

226
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,125
[EGAMI] Well, this
is my last tournament.

227
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,916
Hope third time's the charm.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,333
I can't lose to some first-year.

229
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,708
[MALE UMPIRE 3B]
Ready!

230
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,291
[EGAMI] Man, I really
wanna make it to Nationals.

231
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,041
He's a chopper, so I guess
I'll serve short to his fore

232
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,125
to check out
his defensive skills.

233
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,541
If his return is weak,

234
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,791
I'll send a third ball attack
to the back and then...

235
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,166
Ah, I'll figure it out.

236
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,041
[MALE UMPIRE 3B]
Love-one.

237
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,666
He's playing
an offensive game?

238
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,000
Think he's gonna
stay so close to the table?

239
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,541
[in Chinese]
Is he conserving energy?

240
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,458
[in Chinese]
He's got a lot of confidence.

241
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,833
[EGAMI]
Tryin' to get under my skin.

242
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,333
Does he think I'm weak?

243
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
That he can wrap this up quick
without bothering to chop?

244
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,875
I'm insulted.

245
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,166
And a little hurt.

246
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,875
But his rubber's not
designed for offense.

247
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,708
He won't pull that stunt again!

248
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,458
[MALE UMPIRE 3B]
Love-two.

249
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,083
[EGAMI]
Aw, it's hopeless.

250
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,833
[in Chinese]
We know who will win this.

251
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,625
He scored on a return?
Are you kiddin' me?

252
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,708
This isn't table tennis.

253
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,750
[EGAMI] Why must life
always be so cruel?

254
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,791
Oh well, at least I stuck with
this longer than most things.

255
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,916
Put in three solid,
gloomy years.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,541
Maybe I'll just
go to the beach.

257
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,666
That sounds nice.

258
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,958
[MALE UMPIRE 3B]
Match goes to Tsukimoto.

259
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,250
Dude's been
holdin' out on us.

260
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,833
Can't believe he's
had that up his sleeve

261
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,291
this whole time!

262
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,916
That was some sloppy offense.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,416
Had to unwind.

264
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
What, you couldn't
have found another way?

265
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,166
Table tennis to kill time,

266
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,958
and offensive play to unwind.

267
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,541
It's stupid to stake
your life on table tennis.

268
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,875
I just don't get it.

269
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,916
It's revolting.

270
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,291
[in Chinese] He's
Makoto Tsukimoto, a first-year.

271
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,458
[in Chinese]
When do I dance with him?

272
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,375
[in Chinese] The third round,
barring any surprises.

273
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,458
[in Chinese]
The one after next, then.

274
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,541
[EGAMI]
Yeah.

275
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,041
Beach sounds good.

276
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,791
[HOSHINO]
I love Gari Gari Kuns.

277
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,458
Even with these new
stew-flavored ones,

278
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,208
they still have that
crunchy candy center

279
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,125
they've always had.

280
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,583
Way too many snack foods

281
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,875
are losing sight of
themselves these days!

282
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,458
Damn, it's hot this summer!

283
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,750
I still think it's important

284
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,083
for you to go
through with this.

285
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,000
Naw, screw that noise!
I'll still have my pride!

286
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
Dropping out's
more shameful than losing.

287
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,000
But Chinese players are
all, like, ridiculously good!

288
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,083
Just 'cause he's Chinese

289
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,000
doesn't automatically
make him good.

290
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,791
You know that's nothing
but a ridiculous stereotype.

291
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,875
Besides, Po, I like it
when a guy takes a risk

292
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,500
knowing he could fail.

293
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,583
Piiko!

294
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,875
[PIIKO]
Anyway, Mister Provincial Team's

295
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,375
a washed-up loser now.

296
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,416
[PO]
Washed-up?

297
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,833
[PIIKO]
You could actually win this.

298
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,000
[PO]
I could?

299
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,208
[MALE UMPIRE 3C]
Game!

300
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,708
Match goes to Kong.

301
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,750
[PO]
She was...

302
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,875
[PIIKO]
...so wrong.

303
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,291
Yeah!

304
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,666
[TAKU]
Good work.

305
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,708
Thank you.

306
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:20,041
[humming]

307
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,541
[HOSHINO]
You seem pretty confident.

308
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,500
That why you're not using
your strongest move out there?

309
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,500
What, does it bother you?

310
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,708
Maybe.

311
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,083
Offensive play's kinda
my thing, you know.

312
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,291
Oh it is, huh?

313
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,416
Then you prob'ly shoulda
put your name on it.

314
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
Akuma's not the same as
when we were kids at Tamura.

315
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,750
You should be careful with him.

316
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,833
I'm not worried.

317
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,291
I could beat that
clown in my sleep.

318
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,041
Good luck.

319
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,000
Well aren't you
a grump today.

320
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,875
What crawled up your butt?

321
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,291
Peco, do you believe in heroes?

322
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,458
Like if you're in real trouble,

323
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,875
a hero'll come
along and save you?

324
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,041
No matter how bad the trouble
is or how deep you're in it?

325
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,083
Ha! You're just
messin' with me, right?

326
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,750
You been readin' too much manga.

327
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,083
[TSUKIMOTO]
I used to believe.

328
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,375
For a very long time,

329
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,083
I was waiting for him to come.

330
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
Whatever, just quit
changing your playing style

331
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,583
at random.

332
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,250
It's a bad habit to get in.

333
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,041
[KOIZUMI]
Play him with this racket.

334
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:34,458
Um, Coach, this one
has long pips-out.

335
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,083
Oh, really?

336
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,541
I hadn't noticed.

337
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm not skilled enough yet.

338
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,041
Just give it a go.

339
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:39,666
But...

340
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm playing Kong.

341
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,750
All the better, really.

342
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,166
Good.

343
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,333
[in Chinese]
I'm keyed up.

344
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,916
I haven't felt
that way in a while.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,625
[in Chinese] Just
play it like any other game.

346
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,625
[in Chinese] I kind of
like the feeling, actually.

347
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,541
Tsukimoto and Kong are up now.

348
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,500
Come n' watch.

349
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,541
Thanks.

350
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,541
Hey, so uh, do you
mind if I ask you something?

351
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,875
[KAZAMA]
Huh?

352
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Can't help notice, you're
interested in Tsukimoto.

353
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,750
But why?

354
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,791
The answer to that one's
a little complicated.

355
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,833
Turns out, talent is a gift
that doesn't always wind up

356
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,958
going to the people
who actually want it.

357
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:34,416
[humming]

358
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,833
[humming]

359
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,291
Don't hold back.

360
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,791
Alright, Kong?

361
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,458
Because I don't suck.

362
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,416
[KONG, in Chinese] This is the
best you can do after all?

363
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,500
[in Chinese]
Yes!

364
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,000
[KONG, in Chinese]
Blame your environment.

365
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,458
You have no rival,
no master, no pressure!

366
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,416
You'll rust in this
hothouse you live in.

367
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,541
Just like an old bike
tossed in the river.

368
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,125
However,

369
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,041
I have someplace to go back to!

370
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,416
A bountiful country!

371
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,750
[MALE UMPIRE 3D]
Fault!

372
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,750
Game goes to Kong!

373
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,083
So even our ace
can't hold his own

374
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
against the Chinese.

375
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,666
[OTA]
Pretty much.

376
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,041
[in Chinese] Wenge, your
plays are getting rough.

377
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,750
[in Chinese] He's nothing.
He can barely return the ball.

378
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,875
[CHINESE COACH]
But he's--

379
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,166
[KONG, in Chinese]
He's no different.

380
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,583
I expected too much.

381
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,916
This is all this country's
players have to offer.

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,750
[TSUKIMOTO humming]

383
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,500
[KONG, in Chinese]
Don't worry.

384
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,041
I'll beat him straight up.

385
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,083
[humming continues]

386
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,208
[KONG, in Chinese]
Yes!

387
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,375
[MALE UMPIRE 3D]
Five-seven.

388
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,416
[humming continues]

389
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,750
[MALE UMPIRE 3D]
Six-seven.

390
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,166
[KOIZUMI]
Nice.

391
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,375
Looks like he tricked Kong

392
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,333
into anticipating
all the wrong strokes.

393
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,416
[in Chinese]
He's reading you, Wenge!

394
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,500
[in Chinese]
Don't shout.

395
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:12,541

[humming continues]

398
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,833
How 'bout you
actually step up

399
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,083
and compete for
once in your life?

400
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,166
There you go again,

401
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,708
givin' up whenever
you're challenged.

402

[MALE UMPIRE 3D]
Eleven-seven.

404
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,333
Game goes to Tsukimoto.

405
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,375
[KONG, in Chinese]
Shit!

406
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,333
[humming continues loudly]

407
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,208
Funny thing, talent.

408
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,250
[KOIZUMI]
Perfect!

409
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,250
[MALE STUDENT 3E] I hear China
could really lose this thing!

410
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,125
[MALE STUDENT 3F]
Who's he playing?

411
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,541
[MALE STUDENT 3G]
Some kid from Katase.

412
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,166
He's only a first-year.

413
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,916
No, he can't be.

414
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,666
And yet another
incredible play.

415
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,166
[MALE UMPIRE 3D]
Eleven-six.

416
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,208
Game goes to Tsukimoto.

He...

418
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,541
He can read me?

419
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,541
S'like Kong might be
startin' to let his frustration

420
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,958
throw him off his game.

421
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,250

all through that first match,

422

analyzing him.

00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,333
He's like a well-oiled machine.

[TAMURA] Smile's finally
living up to his true potential.

425

[in Chinese]
Shit!

Eight-four.

[MALE STUDENT 3I]
Oh, man.

430
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,458
[MALE STUDENT 3J] It's crazy,
but this could really happen!

431
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,958
[OTA] Tsukimoto is so totally
in the zone right now,

432
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,416
it's almost scary.

[in Chinese]
This is it, Wenge!

434
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,458
Be ready, because if you lose
this match, it's all over!

I thought you were going to
teach the team that dropped you

436

a lesson!

[MALE COMMITTEE MEMBER 3A]
That first-year's lost control.

00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,208
He's completely
on the defensive now.

That he is.

Am I nuts,

453
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,208
or was the

[FEMALE STUDENT 3B]
Oh, definitely!

455

Totally.
