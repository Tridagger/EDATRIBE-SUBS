Here, on my left knee.

It's bleeding bad.

Eh, that's nothing a little
bit of spit can't fix up.

Huh? What's that?

S'cuse me, sir.

00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,750
Are you Japanese?

00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:44,916
Oh yeah, I sure am.

[MALE INTERVIEWER 9A]
So, what were you doing abroad?

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,875
A friend of mine and I
had a wedding to go to.

16
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,416
We had a great time!

17

[EGAMI] I was on an utterly
aimless journey to find myself.

Wandered all over this world,

19
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,625
yet somehow never found a single
place that agreed with me.

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,250
Oh boy,

They won't use any of me.

Huh.

30
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,250
It's been exactly
one year since that day.

[EGAMI] I've come
a long way since then.

32
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,833
Maybe I'll go check
out some table tennis.

[in Chinese]
It's fine.

36
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,041
Upsets like this make
the sport interesting.

37
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,583
[KONG, in Chinese]
Yeah.

38
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,541
That bowl-headed kid
is the real deal,

39
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,750
and I don't say that
just because I lost.

no one had ever
heard of, named Hoshino.

[PLAYER 9B] Huh, I thought
Tsukimoto was the only one

00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,541
at that school
that had any game!

56
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
Yeah, they sold us
a bunch of lies.

57
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,208
This Hoshino's supposed
to be a powerhouse.

58
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,416
Coach says in the semis,
he might even give Kazama

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,958
a run for his money.

60
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,000
That's huge!

61
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,916
If that happens,
Kaio's in trouble.

Yeah, well in
the third round,

up against Tsukimoto.

knocked out that early.

above this mountain

do you think there's a chance

start to think a little

00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,958
That's the Smile
Monster's true gift.

179
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,791
[SANADA] So he was just testing
me this whole damn time?

180
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,333
Is that why he scattered
all his shots like that?

181
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,791
What a dick move!

182
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,750
When you mess with Kaio,
we take you down hard!

183
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,958
Here I go.

184
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,291
[SANADA]
Shit!

185
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,916
[SANADA] I can slam
shots at 'im all day,

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,041
but as long he keeps
returning 'em like that,

187
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,791
I don't stand a chance!

188
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,000
Net ball!

189
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,333
Eleven-nine.

190
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
Game goes to Tsukimoto!

191
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,000
[crowd cheering]

192
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,916
Wow, now that is
a ping-pong player.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,583
He totally turned the tables!

194
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,625
Ha, ha!

195
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,125
He just scored
ten points in a row

196
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,208
on Sanada!

197
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,583
[MALE SPECTATOR 9B]
Unbelievable!

198
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,833
To think Sanada could
go down in the third round!

199
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,416
[KOIZUMI]
Way to go, son.

200
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,833
[SANADA]
What's with this guy?

201
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,250
I can't spot a single weakness.

202
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,583
He's solid no
matter where I attack.

203
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
Not to mention, he...

204
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,375
Dang.

205
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,833
Smile's manned up.

206
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,125
[MALE UMPIRE 9A]
Out!

207
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,333
Eleven-two.

208
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,208
Game goes to Tsukimoto!

209
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:22,208
[crowd cheering]

210
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,541
[SANADA]
Gotta hand it to him.

211
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,833
There was nothing I could do.

212
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,291
He really is as
good as they say.

213
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,708
See why Kazama
wants him so bad.

214
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,875
I was dreaming.

215
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,416
You're the one
who's got real vision

216
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,416
and a spine of
steel, Kazama.

217
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,958
It's you who puts table
tennis and the team first.

218
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:53,458
I'm a soft, small-minded,
little man compared to you.

219
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,833
With my half-hearted attitude,

220
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,208
there's no way I could
ever compete with you.

221
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,333
I get it now, why
Yurie fell for you.

222
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,458
But I am still Sanada
of Kaio Academy!

223
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,166
So you damn well better
finish what I started, Kazama!

224
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,166
Come on, Muuko,
pick up the pace.

225
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,125
If you don't hurry.

226
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,791
I'll leave you behind!

227
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,625
Hey, look there, Bubu.

228
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,291
I think that that's
a swimming pool.

229
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,958
Can we go check it out?

230
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,291
Please?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,083
[SAKUMA] You wanna swim,
knock yourself out.

232
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
I'm going in now.

233
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,791
[MUUKO]
For Pete's sake.

234
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,375
I was just letting you know.

235
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,708
Sheesh!

236
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,958
Hey, are you mad at me?

237
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,083
Bubu, wait.

238
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,375
I'm talking to you!

239
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,291
[laughing]

240
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,291
[SAKUMA]
I could almost cry.

241
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,875
Hey, the
tournament's this way.

242
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,708
Isn't that why we're here?

243
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,291
Where are you going now?

244
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,625
Bathroom.

245
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm real sorry to
bother you, but Kazama?

246
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,833
It's Sakuma.

247
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,333
Manabu Sakuma.

248
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,208
[KAZAMA]
Right.

249
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,666
[SAKUMA]
Dang, it's been, what?

250
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,791
About six months
since we last spoke?

251
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,333
[KAZAMA]
Yeah.

252
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,916
How've you been, Sakuma?

253
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,000
[SAKUMA laughing]

254
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,750
What's so funny?

255
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,333
I've been all right.

256
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,375
Good.

257
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
So I saw the board.

258
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,791
Sanada faces Tsukimoto
in the third round, right?

259
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,500
Yeah, Sanada's a
top-notch player, no doubt,

260
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,083
but I can't see him even
winnin' one game in that match.

261
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,375
Poor guy.

262
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,625
Bet Smile's the last
person he'd wanna lose to.

263
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,875
The thing is, if you
really wanna win,

264
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,916
you've gotta be willing
to put in all the hard work

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,083
to get you there.

266
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,125
You know,
I honestly suspect

267
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,458
that's your actual opinion.

268
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,041
It's everyone's opinion,
'cause it's true.

269
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,875
Now that I've
given up table tennis,

270
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
and I've gotten
a little distance...

271
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,750
I think I finally get it.

272
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,708
Why you hide here
before a match.

273
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,833
And why's that?

274
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,625
[SAKUMA] Kazama, who do
you play table tennis for?

275
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,791
I play for
myself, of course.

276
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,458
[SAKUMA] Please,
don't joke about this.

277
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,250
Because if that were true,
then I wouldn't have...

278
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,958
Sorry, it's not my
place to say this stuff.

279
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,000
Just forget I said any of it.

280
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,250
I'll leave you alone.

281
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,291
[KAZAMA]
Sakuma.

282
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,875
Do you resent me?

283
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,875
I sympathize with you.

284
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,583
I don't really expect
you to understand,

285
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,166
but that's how I feel.

286
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,125
I look forward
to you winning.

287
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,333
I know you can do it again.

288
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,375
Thanks.

289
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,166
[MUUKO]
Bubu, is your tummy okay?

290
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,583
[SAKUMA]
It's fine, why?

291
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,000
[MUUKO] You were in
there a really long time!

292
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:18,958
[SAKUMA]
Wait here a sec.

293
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,166
I'll be right back.

294
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,583
Jeez, what's with you?

295
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,416
Gonna cry a bit.

296
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,500
[KAZAMA]
Hey.

297
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,250
Oh hey, Kazama.

298
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,416
Sanada's, um...

299
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,458
[KAZAMA]
Yeah.

300
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,291
I mean, it was like
something out of a nightmare.

301
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,750
There was no way
I could ever beat 'im.

302
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,833
That kid's just not human.

303
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,500
Ya know Sakuma's
here somewhere.

304
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,791
Did you see him?

305
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,375
Yeah, we talked
for a little bit.

306
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,375
Oh, yeah?

307
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,958
And what'd he have
to say to you?

308
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,166
Not much.

309
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,333
He did ask me who I
play table tennis for.

310
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,208
Yeah, so what
was your answer?

311
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,791
"I play for the
team, of course."

312
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,750
That sounds like
something you'd say.

313
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,458
[crowd cheering]

314
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,916
[MALE SPECTATOR 9C]
Whoa.

315
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,291
[MALE UMPIRE 9B]
Match goes to Kazama!

316
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,250
Yeah!

317
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,541
Oh, yeah!

318
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,125
[NEKOTA]
Yes!

319
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,125
[MALE UMPIRE 9C]
Match to Nekota!

320
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,958
[MALE UMPIRE 9D]
Nine-ten, Okano!

321
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,958
Booyah!

322
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,666
You're makin'
rookie mistakes, Peco!

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,750
Come on!

324
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,250
You only need to
get one more point!

325
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,666
He's not just dragging
this out for the fun of it

326
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,166
or to make things
more interesting.

327
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,083
If he was operating at
a hundred percent here,

328
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,416
he wouldn't be tired
from a few matches.

329
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,000
His knee's busted.

330
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:36,791
Pity.

331
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,791
Yeah.

332
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,375
See, he's favorin'
his right leg.

333
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
His balance is all outta whack.

334
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,250
Seems he's now paying
the price of our overtraining.

335
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,416
[MALE UMPIRE 9D]
Out!

336
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,875
Match goes to Hoshino!

337
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,958
[crowd cheering]

338
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,083
Peco.

339
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,750
[KOIZUMI] It's dangerous for him
to keep playing like that.

340
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,833
[MALE UMPIRE 9E]
Net!

341
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,875
[NEKOTA]
Crap!

342
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,375
[MALE UMPIRE 9E]
Ten-two. Tsukimoto!

343
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,333
[crowd cheering]

344
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,625
[NEKOTA] He never even
makes the slightest mistake.

345
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,625
Every error is mine.

346
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,375
He never loses his cool,
never gets tired.

347
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,166
His technique is flawless.

348
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,250
Perfectly calculated.

349
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,708
Should I serve now
or would you like more time?

350
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,458
[NEKOTA]
He really is a robot.

351
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,791
[NEKOTA]
Go ahead.

352
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,750
Does he even have blood
running through his veins,

353
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,291
or just circuitry?

354
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,791
[MALE UMPIRE 9E]
Match goes to Tsukimoto!

355
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,458
I think I might cry.

356
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,958
Great job, Tsukimoto!

357
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,375
Super match.

358
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,375
Yeah, thanks, guys.

359
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,541
[OTA]
You were amazing!

360
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,208
Seriously, I was blown away!

361
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,250
Where's Hoshino?

362
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,541
He's not here yet.

363
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,041
Yeah man, his knee.

364
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,083
Doc says it's real bad.

365
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,291
Oh? Is that right?

366
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,250
Yeah.

367
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,250
[TAKAMURA]
Hey, where ya goin'?

368
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,416
Aren't you gonna
stick around, bro?

369
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,958
Support Hoshino?

370
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,333
Hey, buddy!

371
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,333
What is this?

372
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,208
Where the hell's our opponent?

373
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,375
My guy's already warmed up

374
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,291
and now his muscles
are gonna get cold!

375
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,666
How long's he have to wait?

376
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,541
[MALE STAFF 9A]
Sorry, sir!

377
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,166
I'll see what I can do!

378
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,750
So now what?

379
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,375
You wanna practice a bit?

380
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,666
No, don't need to.

381
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,375
Suppose you're right.

382
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,125
This match will probably
get called off anyway.

383
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,875
[HOSHINO]
I feel great, Michio.

384
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,625
They shot me up
with painkillers.

385
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,250
You don't know how serious
a knee injury can get!

386
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,875
You made it to the Top Four,

387
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,291
meaning you can quit now and
still play the championship!

388
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,125
--[HOSHINO] Nah.
--[MICHIO] What?

389
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,041
[MALE STAFF 9A]
'Scuse me, Kaio's wondering--

390
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,041
It's too dangerous!

391
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,291
Be right there!

392
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,375
[MALE STAFF 9A]
So, um...

393
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,125
Just cool your
jets a second, will ya?

394
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,916
I want'cha to
listen good, Peco.

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,583
Players your age should
be reckless sometimes.

396
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Occasional lack of
caution can be a virtue.

397
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,291
However, if you truly
want a shot at becoming

398
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,041
a world champion,
you've gotta learn

399
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,708
how to fold when necessary.

400
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,625
Raise the white flag.

401
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm not new to this game.

402
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,666
I've been playing pretty
much since I was in diapers.

403
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,791
I've seen plenty of
tough guys burst into tears

404
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,416
after wrecking their knees.

405
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,208
And of course I know about how
a bum knee ended your career,

406
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,041
Old Lady.

407
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,500
So why risk it?

408
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,625
'Cause Smile is calling to me.

409
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,833
[HOSHINO] When we were little,
he got picked on all the time.

410
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,500
Even then, he never smiled.

411
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,250
The other kids gave
him stupid nicknames

412
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,333
like "Robot" and "Golgo."

413
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,541
Because of that, he always
just sat by himself,

414
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,833
and played video games
his dad bought him.

415
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,500
But when I showed him
how to play ping-pong,

416
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,458
the dude
smiled like crazy.

417
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,791
[TSUKIMOTO (CHILD)] Do you think
I'll ever be like you, Peco?

418
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,791
'Cause I wanna be.

00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,833
I wanna be just like you.

420
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,791
[HOSHINO]
But I forgot all about it

421
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,541
'til I saw that
photo at the dojo.

422
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,750
I didn't start callin' him
"Smile" because he doesn't.

423
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,291
I called him that
'cause of how he looked

424
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,083
whenever he played Ping-Pong.

425
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,416
[HOSHINO (CHILD)] Just call
me whenever you're in a pinch!

426
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,083
If you do that,
I'll come runnin'.

427
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:18,291
[HOSHINO] He's been waiting
on me for a long time now.

428
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,500
He's believed in me
since way back when.

429
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,791
The only reason
he stopped smiling...

430
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,583
...is 'cause of me.

431
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,166
I started phoning it in
and my gameplay stunk.

432
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,625
I knew it,
but I pretended not to.

433
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,375
I was scared, so I
just shut everything out.

434
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,208
But now, it's time
for me to go to him.

435
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,833
Michio, hand me my paddle.

436
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,250
[HOSHINO]
Before I face Smile,

437
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,958
I got one more giant
monster to take down!

00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,500

Who are you playing for?

439

No way!

this story, not him!
