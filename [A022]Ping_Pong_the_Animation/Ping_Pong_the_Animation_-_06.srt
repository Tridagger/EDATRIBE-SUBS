It'll be a fun break.

begin practicing on mats

at a very early age.

180
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,541
All the major international
championships are held on mats.

181
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:10,041
So we here at Kaio Academy now
have mats in our practice hall!

182
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,125
And why is that?

183
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,750

You need to practice serving.

You're a million years
from doing this right.

able to play like you?

with my eyes closed. No problem!

341
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,458
I was able to fly!

342
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,250
I could jump up
and touch the moon

343
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,416
without so much as
breakin' a sweat!

344
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Didn't think it was "miraculous"
'cause it came so natural!

345
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,083
Yeah, I wanted what you had
with every fiber of my being!

346
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,375
I copied your style,
your paddle, your form!

347
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,958
Literally everything about you!

348
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,250
But no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't be you!

349
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,833
[MAN 6A]
Ha, ha! Check it out!

350
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,458
[MAN 6B] Raw passion
o' youth right there!

351
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,083
[MAN 6C] Why don't
cha get a room?

352
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,583
Dude, everybody in our class,
we all looked up to you.

353
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,791
To us, you were always...

354
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,583
Peco, you love this
sport more than anyone!

355
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,500
[HOSHINO]
Watch this!

356
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,125
[SAKUMA]
What the--?

357
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
K-Kaw!

358
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,375
[HOSHINO] See?
I'm like a bird!

359
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,000
I really can fly!

360
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,958
Damn! This is exactly
what I'm talking about!

361
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,625
[SAKUMA] Really wasn't planning
on an ocean swim today!

362
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,375
Freezing!

363
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,666
[HOSHINO] Yeah, a depressing
sport you gotta play

364
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,583
all cooped up indoors in the
summertime is just not for me.

365
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:39,708
I mean, who cares where a tiny
little plastic ball goes.

366
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,375
[HOSHINO] Uh oh.
Didn't get enough sleep.

367
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,375
Can't breathe.

368
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,708
Jumping in with
all my clothes on?

369
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,250
Maybe not the best idea.

370
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,875
[gasps]

371
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,291
[HOSHINO]
I'm gonna die out here!

372
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,458
[gasps]

373
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,791
[HOSHINO] Where am I?
Near the Bonin Islands?

374
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
Have I passed Iwo Jima?

375
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,000
My body's going numb.

376
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,416
I'm fading.

377
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,291
[TSUKIMOTO (CHILD)] Everybody
says I'm like a robot.

378
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,875
[HOSHINO]
What's that, Smile?

379
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
Speak up a little.

380
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,583
Everybody says
I'm like a robot.

381
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,750
Like, everybody.

382
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,625
[HOSHINO]
Hey don't worry, Smile.

383
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,125
You're gonna--

384
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,125
[TAMURA] Look at you, kid.
You were born to play ping-pong.

385
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,375
[HOSHINO] Really?
You really mean that?

386
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,000
The Olympics, huh?

387
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,541
Uh-huh, that's right.

388
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,375
It's my one dream.
I'll be World Champ!

389
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,541
[HOSHINO] I'll be...

390
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,291
[TSUKIMOTO] Peco, do you
believe in heroes?

391
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,166
[HOSHINO] Seriously?

392
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,208
What's with him?

393
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,041
Grow up.

394
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,750
[dolphin sound]

395
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,208
And even ping-pong is
getting more complicated now.

396
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,625
[HOSHINO] Smile.

397
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,875
I don't want to sacrifice
things I like just to win.

398
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,416
That there is
rookie talk, kid.

399
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,041
[HOSHINO] Old Lady.

400
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,583
[HOSHINO screams]

401
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,708
Iron?

402
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,416
[HOSHINO]
Well, I guess this is it.

403
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,666
I just wanna put
an end to it all.

404
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,416
Go far, far away.

405
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,833
Uh!

406
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,208
Papua?

407
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,708
[SAKUMA] Y'ever run your
mouth off like that again...

408
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,291
...I'll kill you.

409
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,625
Can't believe what a
freakin' moron you are.

410
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,041
Tryin' to kill yourself
in the shallows.

411
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,250
Next time aim for
the open water, huh?

412
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,666
Or stick with ping pong.

413
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,541
Run 'til you puke your guts up.

414
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,916
Swing 'til your palms
are covered in blood.

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,833
Won't feel any worse than you
do right now, Mister Hero.

416
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,000
[ping pong sounds]

417
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,458
[HOSHINO] Hm? Old Lady?

418
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,583
Huh.

419
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,458
Old Lady! Old Lady! Old Lady!

420
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,708
[TSUKIMOTO] I don't wanna
see Peco embarrass himself.

421
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,416
Do you believe in heroes?

422
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,333
[door closes]

423
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,083
Old Lady!
This picture here.

424
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,250
Just look!

425
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,958
I think every time
we played back then...

426
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,833
Bring back memories?

427
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,708
Found it when I was going
through some old boxes.

428
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,875
Please, listen.

429
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,791
Spit it out.
You tryin' to propose to me?

430
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,125
Come on.
I'm being serious here!

431
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,916
I'm begging, teach me the whole
sport again from scratch!

432
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,708
"Give a fool your time,
and you'll waste the whole day."

433
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,541
[HOSHINO] Please, I need you to
help me send China packing!

434
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,000
Help turn me into
the King of Ping-Pong!

435
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,333
I still wanna be world champ!

436
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm gonna feel like a real
idiot if you waste my time.

437
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,750
So you better be ready.

438
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,833
Love ya, kid.
