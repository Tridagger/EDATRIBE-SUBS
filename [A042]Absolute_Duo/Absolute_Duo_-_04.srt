to him privately, peon.

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,625
[TORA grumbles]

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,875
All right then.

183
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,833
Tor?

184
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,583
I'll be right back.

185
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,125
You'll let me borrow your
notes later tonight, won't you?

186
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh!

187
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,583
I almost forgot.

188
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,875
I just transferred here
from the England campus.

189
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,458
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.

190
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,541
Right, now my name's
Miss Bristol.

191
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,041
However, you may call me
by my first name, Lilith.

192
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,708
[birds chirping]

193
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,208
Oh, thanks so much.

194
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,166
Uh...

195
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,583
This is good!

196
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,750
Yes.

197
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,625
Your tea is outstanding
as always, Sarah.

198
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,041
Why thank you,
Miss, I'm flattered.

199
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,791
[TOR thinking]
I wish Julie could try this.

200
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,000
[LILITH]
Now, then.

201
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,416
Huh?

202
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,125
Tor Kokonoe.

203
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,416
Starting today, you
shall be my Duo partner.

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,541
Wait.

205
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,291
What did you just say?

206
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,541
Don't make me say it again.

207
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,166
Look, I really appreciate
the offer, Lilith, but I can't.

208
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,208
Because I already
have a Duo partner.

209
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,583
I know that.

210
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,000
But it doesn't matter.

211
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,333
The reason is
because I'm special.

212
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,750
I am an Exception, you see.

213
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,125
You're an Exception?

214
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,333
And what is that?

215
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,000
Back in England, I heard
rumors about the Irregular.

216
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,666
So I specifically transferred
here to meet you.

217
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,291
You should be grateful.

218
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,041
You think a lot of
yourself, don't you?

219
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,250
Wait!

220
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,958
Did you just say you
came all the way here

221
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,583
because you wanted to meet me?

222
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes. Precisely.

223
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
You're unique just like I am,

224
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,166
and another
Unrivaled to be exact.

225
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,875
Therefore,
both you and I are

226
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,333
perfectly suited to be
Duo partners.

227
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,208
Let me stop you there.

228
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,000
Maybe you're unaware of it,

229
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,333
but school rules forbid
breaking up a Duo.

230
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,666
Yes, so what?

231
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,500
The rules at this school
don't apply to me at all.

232
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm allowed to do
whatever I want.

233
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,208
I am an Exception.

234
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,125
Well, Mr. Kokonoe,
what do you say?

235
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,041
Not that you need to think
it over, of course.

236
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,166
You're right.

237
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,458
I don't need to.

238
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,166
Then it's settled.

239
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,416
Sure is.

240
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,750
Sorry, but I'm not
partnering up with you.

241
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,750
Or breaking up my current Duo.

242
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,166
[gasps]

243
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,458
Thanks for the tea.
It was delicious.

244
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
Now, Tor, wait a minute!

245
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,791
You're actually turning me down?

246
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,375
To borrow a phrase from you,

247
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,750
don't make me say it again.

248
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,666
You have my answer.

249
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,416
Just ten more laps
and you're done!

250
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you crazy?

251
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,583
Each lap's four kilometers!

252
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,125
That's an entire marathon,
you monster!

253
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,416
I'm no monster, I'm a bunny!

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,541
[laughs]

255
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,583
I can't do anything
about Miss Priss,

256
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,458
but I sure as hell
can punish you

257
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,083
for ducking out of class today!

258
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,625
[growling]

259
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,333
That's so unfair!

260
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,083
Dammit.

261
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
She is one nasty vorpal bunny.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,875
[JULIE]
Tor?

263
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
Uh, what's up, Julie?

264
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
You forgot your towel.

265
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,291
Oh, I did?

266
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,375
Thanks.

267
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,833
Just leave it there
and I'll get it.

268
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,958
Yeah.

269
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,375
Um, I really can't do that

270
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,583
if you're still standing
there watching.

271
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,875
Oh, right.

272
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,333
[door closing]

273
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
You're having some, right?

274
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah.

275
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,541
Thank you, Tor.

276
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,583
Huh?

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
It's delicious once again.

278
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,916
Why, thank you.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Tor, I was wondering.

280
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,875
Mm?

281
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,666
If you don't mind, could
we sleep together tonight?

282
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,041
Hey, come on, now.

283
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,458
That was supposed to be
a one-time thing, remember?

284
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,541
[whimpers]

285
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,791
[TOR thinking]
Oh, no! Not good!

286
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,833
You okay?

287
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,583
Oh, know what
I've been thinking?

288
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,041
That maybe we should go
somewhere on our next break.

289
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,583
Does that sound good?

290
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,250
I mean, we never even left
the school campus, have we?

291
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,833
I think we could use a change
of pace around here, right?

292
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:30,750
Well?

293
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,958
Yeah, Tor.

294
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,083
I agree with you.

295
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,125
All right, so where
should we go then?

296
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,083
Do you have any suggestions?

297
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,291
To be honest, I would like to
buy some new things to wear.

298
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,250
All I that brought to school
with me were winter clothes.

299
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,583
Okay.

300
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,791
Shopping, huh?

301
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,875
Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,916
[TOR thinking]
Yes!

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,250
I distracted her!

304
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,541
[JULIE]
Tor?

305
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,791
Come on.

306
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,708
Let's get to bed, 'kay?

307
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,708
Yeah.

308
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,166
Look, there's a flock
of seagulls out there.

309
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,583
I also see a big city up ahead.

310
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, that's where the mall is
where we're gonna go shopping.

311
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,750
Well, if you ask me, the best
place to shop for clothes

312
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
is the A La Mode mall.

313
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,208
Cool, thanks a lot, Miyabi.

314
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,833
Oh, hey, if you're free, would
you like to come along with us?

315
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,250
What?

316
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,791
I'm sorry, but I don't
know if I'm emotionally

317
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,833
ready for something like that!

318
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,875
All we're doing is
buying clothes for Julie,

319
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,166
and I thought
it might help her

320
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,458
if she had another
girl's opinion.

321
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,833
Clothes. For Julie?

322
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,208
Oh.

323
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,833
Uh...

324
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,166
I'd love to, but I've already
got plans with Tomoe that day!

325
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Sorry!

326
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,458
No problem.

327
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,208
Maybe next time then, okay?

328
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,666
Uh.

329
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,958
Sure! [giggles]

330
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,875
I know about
the best places in town

331
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,125
thanks to all the helpful
advice Miyabi gave me.

332
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,208
Yeah.

333
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,333
She's a very kind
person, isn't she?

334
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,791
This place is so big.

335
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,583
It is, so don't get lost.

336
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,750
What the--?

337
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,625
Help me, Tor!

338
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
Please!

339
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,833
Hold on, Julie!

340
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,458
[BOTH panting]

341
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry for getting
into that jam.

342
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,833
No, I'm sorry for not
keeping you close to me.

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,833
Oh!

344
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,083
Sorry!

345
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,041
Wait a sec, what are
you doing that for?

346
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,666
So we don't separated.

347
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,583
'Kay?

348
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,416
Yeah, sure.

349
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,500
Awww!

350
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,166
[GIRL 1]
Isn't she gorgeous?

351
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
[GIRL 2] Uh-huh, she
looks just like a doll!

352
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,541
We already have gawkers.

353
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,958
Ooh!

354
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,083
Tor, why don't we try
that store over there?

355
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,083
[TOR]
That one?

356
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,166
Sure. Sounds good to me.

357
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,541
Yeah.

358
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,291
Let me just try this dress on
and then I'll be right out.

359
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,958
That girlfriend of
yours is so adorable!

360
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
Oh, no, she's not--

361
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
You are one lucky guy,
you know that?

362
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,250
Thank you, but--

363
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,958
So are the two of you on a date?

364
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,083
Huh?

365
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,333
Julie!

366
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,541
Oh, wow!

367
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,041
Well, what do you think?

368
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,916
[TOR]
It looks really great on you.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,458
Thank you very much, Tor.

370
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,041
Miss, I'll take this one.

371
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,500
Whoa, that was fast!

372
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,875
You want to try anything else on
while we're here maybe?

373
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,375
That's a great idea!

374
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,041
I'm sure you'll love
these designs.

375
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,333
Yeah. Let's see them then.

376
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,208
[TOR]
That's a good one, really nice.

377
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,250
[JULIE]
I'll take it.

378
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,416
[TOR]
Mmm, cute!

379
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
[JULIE] Then I'll be
taking this one, too.

380
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,625
[TOR] Uh, nice and cool,
and for the spring.

381
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,375
[JULIE]
I'll take it as well.

382
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,375
[CLERK] And this one?
What about this one?

383
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,125
Just try it on,
that's all I ask.

384
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,291
You don't even have to buy it!

385
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,291
What, since when?

386
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,875
[JULIE]
May I pay with this?

387
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,375
But of course, this
establishment gladly accepts

388
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,166
Koryo Academy student cards!

389
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,458
[beeping]

390
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,583
I guess you kind of
overdid it, didn't you?

391
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,916
Nej.

392
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,875
These are all lovely
clothes that I really like.

393
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,416
And you said you did, too.

394
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,458
Uh.

395
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,708
Well, your clothes will
be sent to the school.

396
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,375
But since we're here, why
don't we check out the mall?

397
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,041
Yeah.

398
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,416
Let's do that.

399
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,291
[TOR]
Here you go.

400
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,958
I think you said you
wanted strawberry?

401
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,541
Is something the matter, Julie?

402
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,125
No, it's nothing.

403
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,333
Thank you for getting us this.

404
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,666
Sure thing.

405
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,333
Let's dig in, shall we?

406
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,125
This gelato, Miyabi
says it's the best.

407
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,583
If she recommended it,
then I'm sure that it is.

408
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,625
It's really tasty.

409
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,916
I know, right? Mine too!

410
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,916
What did you get?

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,791
This is rum raisin.

412
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you want to try some?

413
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,541
Yeah, I do.

414
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,916
Ahhh.

415
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,541
You're kidding!

416
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,208
Look, I can't, not in public!

417
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,833
But Papa and Mama used
to always do that for me.

418
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,791
Uh...

419
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,083
Ahhhhh.

420
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,833
[grunting]

421
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,791
[sighs]

422
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,041
All right.

423
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,291
Say "ah."

424
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,500
Ahhhh.

425
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,500
It's so delicious.

426
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,666
I know.

427
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,916
Want more?

428
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,625
No, thank you, but now
I want you to try mine.

429
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,541
Huh?

430
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,041
Tor.

431
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,458
Say "Ah."

432
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,166
Uh, no, thank you. I'm good!

433
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,041
Ahhhhhhh.

434
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,666
[TOR]
Can we be done with this now?

435
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,083
[JULIE]
Nja.

436
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,583
"Nja"?

437
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,791
Why do you look so woozy?

438
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh-oh.

439
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,166
Crap! Could the rum raisin
have done this?

440
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,625
Um, hey, Julie.

441
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,541
Are you maybe
feeling a little drunk?

442
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,666
No, Nej.

443
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
[slurred]
I am not drunk at all.

444
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,166
Dammit, you're definitely drunk!

445
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,708
Nja, yam not drunk.

446
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,708
How many fingers
am I holding up?

447
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,541
I can see free of you, Tor.

448
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,000
How is this happening?

449
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,583
You gotta get sober!

450
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,541
Let's go get you
some coffee, okay?

451
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,958
Oh, no, Tomoe!

452
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,208
What do you think it means

453
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,458
if he's touching
her face like that?

454
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,000
Geez, calm down, would ya?

455
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,416
Now let's think about this.

456
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,750
Are you positive those two
aren't on an actual date?

457
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,500
If it was an actual date,

458
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,416
why would they invite me along?

459
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,375
But still.

460
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,166
Yeah, good point.

461
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,000
Because there's still suspicion
of illicit activity going on,

462
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,291
we should keep an eye on them.

463
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,750
Besides, look what
he's doing now.

464
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,875
[MEN snickering]

465
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,250
Aw, you two sweet
things look lonely.

466
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,291
You won't be if you
come hang out with us!

[MIYABI whimpers]

468
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,708
No, thank you.

469
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,833
Let's go, Miyabi.

470
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,875
Come on,
just for a little while!

471
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,041
We won't do anything weird!

472
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,041
You dog!

473
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,250
Ow!

474
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,541
Hey, if you're gonna
go hurtin' my buddy,

475
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
that means you're definitely
coming along with us!

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,916
[TOMOE] He started it
and the answer is no!

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,458
You got a lot of nerve
dissing my bro like that!

478
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,416
Just get behind me, Miyabi.

479
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,958

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,916
Hey, you creeps!

482
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
You guys better back off!

00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,083

Says who? You?

484
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
Tor, thank goodness.

485
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,375
You're here too, Julie?

00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,666
Nja.

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,708
[BOTH]
Uh?

488
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,166
If you've got a
problem with them

489
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,500
you've got a problem with me
do you understand?

490
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,875
Oh, you're gonna have a problem

491
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,916
once we get done
pounding on you, pal!

[TOR]
Lilith?

495
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,666
What does she have?

496
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,375
[CROWD]
Wait, were those gunshots?

497
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,916
Those guys are hurt.

498
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,958
Hmm!

499
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:55,041

a rifle Blaze?

Oh, man.

501
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
That's nuts.

Uh... uh...

503
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,750
You know, Julie.

504
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,458
It's such a coincidence
that you're shopping

505
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,125
for underwear on the
same day as me and Miyabi.

506
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,166
So then, what do
you think about that bra?

507
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,583
How does it fit?

508
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,458
It seems to be a little
too big here in the front.

509
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,166
In that case, you
should get the one

510
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,333
that's sized
a little smaller. Okay?

511
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,333
Yeah.

512
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,708
