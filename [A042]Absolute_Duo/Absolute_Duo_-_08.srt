For neglecting me the way that
you did, you insensitive ape,

184
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,291
since you told all those
other girls how they looked

185
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,666
but not me!

186
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,625
So how do you like
me in beach mode?

187
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,458
Tell me what you
really think, okay?

188
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,458
Your beach mode seems to be
the same as your bitch mode.

189
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,458
Oh, yeah?

190
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,750
So then tell me.

191
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,166
Do you think I'm
any more violent in

192
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,416
beach mode, you
rotten little brat?

193
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
[TOR]
You're cutting off my air!

194
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,791
[RITO]
Well? Huh?

195
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
[laughing]

196
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,958
Wow, those two sure
are close, huh?

197
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,083
I guess.

198
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,541
It must be nice.

199
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,125
Miyabi.

200
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
[TOR] Yep, the beach
was definitely

201
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,750
a good place to have fun.

202
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,375
Um.

203
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,750
Hi there, Tor.

204
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,666
Hey, do you think

205
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,875
you'd want to

206
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,958
swim with me?

207
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,875
Oh no!

208
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,083
Julie!

209
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,375
I told you not to go out alone!

210
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,833
Hey, look at this, Tor!

211
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,125
Thanks to you, I can swim
forward all by myself now.

212
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,291
I see.

213
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,333
Nice job, Juli--

214
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,458
Are you okay?

215
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,708
[JULIE coughing]

216
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,500
--Ja, I'm fine, thanks.
--[TOR screaming]

217
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,791
Julie? Up top! Look!

218
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,208
Hmm?

219
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,666
Looks nice and sunny.

220
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,875
No, your swimsuit!

221
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,625
Did you see anything?

222
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,708
I did, but just barely.

223
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,791
Well, I guess "just barely"
is okay then.

224
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,625
But let's go get my
top back, all right?

225
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,583
Ah!

226
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,083
Wait.

227
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,916
Julie. Let go, would ya?

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,875
Nej, Tor.

229
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,416
I can't do that right now.

230
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,875
If I let go, then you
might get a peek.

231
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,833
Look.

232
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,375
My top's right there.

233
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,666
And what goes in it
is right against my back.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
Oh, help me, Tor!
Look, I'm drowning!

235
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, come on now!

236
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,791
I know that you
know how to swim!

237
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,041
Yes, but not when I'm
drowning in your love!

238
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,500
[TOR]
Oh. You are not!

239
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,000
Knock it off, 'kay, and would
you please let go of me?

240
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,166
Hah!

241
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,875
If you're getting
cold feet, Irregular,

242
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,000
put some more
backbone into it, would ya?

243
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,250
Are these guys always like this?

244
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,666
Yes, they usually
are, unfortunately.

245
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
Good grief.

246
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,291
By the way,

247
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,250
have you noticed anything
about Miyabi lately?

248
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,833
[TOMOE]
Yeah. I sure have.

249
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,750
She'd been down on
herself for a while.

250
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,166
But now it seems like
she's recovered.

251
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,958
I'm glad. Is that what you mean?

252
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,291
Yeah.

253
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
We'll be saying
goodbye tomorrow.

254
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,416
I guess a little
meddling can't hurt.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,750
[TOR sighs]

256
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,833
Mmm, this is so nice.

257
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,625
Talk about relaxing.

258
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,000
The branch school
is lucky to have

259
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,375
a hidden gem like this place.

260
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
[MIYABI]
Wait, Miss Tsukimi!

261
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,333
No, don't!

262
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,000
Stop! Please don't
grab them like that!

263
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,583
[RITO]
Oh, wow!

264
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,333
One touch is all it takes!

265
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,375
Look at how these
bazongas bounce!

266
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,958
[laughing]
[MIYABI] No!

267
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,208
[LILITH] I must admit you have
two amazing attributes there.

268
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,875
[MIYABI protesting]

269
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,000
[LILITH] In terms of bust size,
I know when I've been defeated,

270
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,375
therefore I concede to you.

271
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,458
[RITO] What's your
bra size, Miyabi?

272
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,458
[gasps]

273
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,625
[MIYABI]
I'm not telling you that!

274
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,000
[RITO]
You better tell me!

275
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,375
[MIYABI]
Ah! Hey, no pinching!

276
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,750
"Pinching"?

277
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,708
[RITO] Or this'll keep
happening until you do!

278
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,833
Pinchy-pinch!

279
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,250
Pinchy-pinch!

280
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,625
[MIYABI screaming]

281
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,583
[MIYABI] I'll tell, I'll tell,
just please stop!

282
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,041
It's an F!

283
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,208
I wear an F!

284
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,125
Miyabi's an "F" for
"Fantasy Size?"

285
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,875
[MIYABI]
Ah! Stop!

286
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,041
They're not cantaloupes--

287
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,916
[LILITH] It's rare
I'm ever intimidated.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,041
But now I guess I'll have to
consider her a real rival.

289
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,083
Oh, my, what a
strange phenomenon!

290
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,666
These are so soft
and supple, but these

291
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
little bits here
just got real hard!

292
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,583
No, please knock it off, okay?

293
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,208
--Pinchy pinchy pinchy--
--[MIYABI] No more!

294
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,875
I'm begging you to stop!

295
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,208
[TOMOE]
That's enough!

296
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,916
If you really insist on
groping somebody's bosom,

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,583
then let it be mine
instead, Miss Tsukimi!

298
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,166
Oh, so then you're
volunteering for

299
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,291
my little squeeze test, are you?

300
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,500
--[TOMOE screaming]
--[RITO laughing]

301
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,750
[TOMOE]
Miss Tsukimi?

302
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,666
Ooh, this pair is worthy, too!

303
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,833
And her.

304
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,958
We're both about
the same size I'd say.

305
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,083
No, don't! Please stop this now!

306
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,625
Julie, you've gotta save me!

307
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,083
But I'm curious about them, too.

308
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,708
[TOMOE]
No, not you, too!

309
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,833
[TOMOE screaming]

310
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,791
These remind me a lot of Mama.

311
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,291
You okay, Miyabi?

312
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,458
Uh-huh. 'Least now I am.

313
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,750
[JULIE]
They're soft.

314
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,041
[IMARI]
Hey, tell me something.

315
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,291
[distant screams]

316
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,875
[IMARI]
You like Tor, don't you?

317
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,958
[MIYABI]
Yeah.

318
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,041
Hey, wait a minute, you mean
that you can actually tell?

319
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,625
But how did you know?

320
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,125
Well, that's easy.

321
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,916
You haven't been able to
take your eyes off of him

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,250
since you got here.

323
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,583
[whimpers]

324
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,083
You've got some serious
competition for him.

325
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,250
That's true.

326
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,041
[IMARI]
There's the passionate Lilith,

327
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,166
the friendly Tomoe,

328
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,958
and even the filter-less
Professor Bunbun.

329
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,291
Then of course there's Tor's
Duo partner and roommate,

330
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,833
the exotic Julie.

331
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,791
I'd say she's your
biggest foe of all.

332
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,208
[MIYABI]
I know.

333
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,708
She's genuine, cute,
and incredibly strong.

334
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,916
So I don't stand a
chance against her.

335
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
[IMARI]
To be honest,

336
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,125
I really can't see
those two as a couple.

337
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,958
They seem to be more
like parent and child.

338
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,666
Or maybe even a
master and his dog.

339
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
C'mon.

340
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,125
Then again- you have
got a point there.

341
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,708
You know, I've seen you
looking at Tor a lot yourself.

342
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,083
Hmm?

343
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,916
Um, You okay?

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,041
[laughs]

345
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
We both clicked
when we first met.

346
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,208
It was right before
the opening ceremony.

347
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,166
I figured that we'd end up
seeing a lot of each other.

348
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,833
And maybe even become
more than just good friends.

349
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
Except that

350
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,666
I failed the Screening Rite and
ended up here far away from him.

351
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,875
And that's the reason why I
want you to go for it, Miyabi.

352
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,541
So that you won't
have any regrets. 'Kay?

353
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,750
You're really sure?

354
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,083
[IMARI]
Go for it!

355
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
[MIYABI]
I will!

356
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
[violin playing]

357
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,958
[MIYABI] So how
exactly do I do this?

358
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,875
How do I get Tor to notice me?

359
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,458
[screams]

360
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,333
Huh?

361
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,625
[MIYABI]
Ow!

362
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,000
[TOMOE]
Are you all right, Miyabi?

363
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,208
Uh-huh.

364
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,666
I think I just twisted it.

365
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,583
I wouldn't be so
sure about that!

366
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
In fact, you better
not walk on it until

367
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,875
you've gotten it checked out!

368
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,458
In the meantime, why don't
you just let Tor carry you?

369
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
But I'm not that hurt!

370
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,916
No, Imari's right.

371
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,541
Well, then, hop on.

372
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,458
[giggles]

373
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,083
Uh, okay.

374
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,625
Thanks so much, Tor.

375
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,291
[IMARI] Wow, will you
look at the time!

376
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,958
We better hurry back
because we're on

377
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
chow duty tonight, guys!

378
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,625
We are? This is the
first I've heard of it.

379
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,333
Oh, I must have forgot to tell
you they asked if we'd help out!

380
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, it's almost dinner time,

381
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
so we better get a
move on and quickly, too.

382
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
[IMARI]
Tor, Miyabi,

383
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
we're gonna go on ahead, okay?

384
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,166
Oh, Lilith, Professor Bunbun,

385
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,625
you're both on kitchen
duty as well.

386
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Hah!

387
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,916
Seeing those brats all
buddy-buddy the way they

388
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,375
really chafes my cheeks!

389
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,916
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Priss?

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,083
No, because everybody
gets a chance, I guess.

391
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,333
Not that anyone
else will win, though.

392
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,750
What was that about?

393
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,750
[TOR]
Hey, you know what?

394
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,791
This isn't the first time
you and I have done this.

395
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,291
I also carried you
after you collapsed

396
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,083
on the track, remember?

397
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,500
[MIYABI]
That's right, you did.

398
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,458
You even said some
words of encouragement

399
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,791
to me that day, and I can't tell
you how much I appreciated them.

400
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,375
They really brightened my day.

401
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,916
[TOR laughing] If that's all it
takes to cheer you up

402
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,708
I'll say anything you like.

403
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,750
Oh, you would?

404
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, there is something I'd
like to hear you say to me.

405
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,250
And that's my name.

406
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,208
I know, that sounds weird but,

407
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,041
I'd like to hear you say it.

408
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,791
I'm sure Julie and Lilith
like hearing theirs.

409
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,416
So, will you, please, Tor?

410
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,208
Sure, of course.

411
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,416
I'd be happy to do
that for you, Miyabi.

412
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,041
[MIYABI]
Wow.

413
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,958
Thanks, Tor.

414
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,250
That means so much to me.

415
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,958
[TOR]
Oh, sure. Um, you're welcome.

416
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,083
[distant waves crashing]

417
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,791
[BOTH gasp]

418
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,625
[MIYABI]
How beautiful.

419
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,750
[TOR]
Yeah.

420
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
It's breathtaking.

421
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,541
Tor, I think I'd like to
walk on my own now.

422
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
You sure your foot can take it?

423
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,125
It seems to have gotten
a whole lot better.

424
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,583
Well, all right then.

425
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,750
Just don't overdo it, 'kay?

426
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,041
[MIYABI]
Tor. Wait.

427
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,833
[TOR]
What's up?

428
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
[MIYABI]
I want to thank you,

429
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,666
for everything.

430
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
'Cause, you know. If it
wasn't for your help.

431
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,833
I wouldn't be here now.

432
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,708
You've really made an
impression on me.

433
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,833
I have?

434
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,541
That's right.

435
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,166
So much.

436
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,625
That, I also...

437
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,958
Well, you see
the thing is, Tor...

438
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,541
I like you.

439
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
I really like you.

440
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,666
I have to admit
those outdoor baths

441
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,125
are quite relaxing and
aren't bad at all.

442
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,500
So you mean you're actually
enjoying student life.

443
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,500
What strange turn
of events led to this?

444
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,666
If my time at school leads to
me achieving Absolute Duo,

445
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,666
then I don't see any reason why
I shouldn't enjoy the ride.

446
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,958
Correct?
[ping]

447
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,166
Seven people brought together
with Absolute Duo at their core.

448
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,083
You're a member of Reign.

449
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,666
You don't need me
to explain that.

450
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,708
Do you, Blaze Diabolica?

451
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,541
Don't bandy that name about.

452
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,250
Or I'll make you
regret it if you do.

453
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,083
[LILITH] You're rather cold
to somebody who's

454
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,000
currently in Reign's sights.

455
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,208
[sighs]

456
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,583
That older gentleman
must be in quite a bind.

457
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,333
I'm sure that he is.

458
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,583
And in fact,

459
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,500
he'll probably try
something tonight.

460
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,291
Well, if you're mistaken,

461
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
then it appears that
my coming here

462
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,000
will have all been for nothing.

463
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
I see, so then you're the bait?

464
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
[SAKUYA]
Yes.

465
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,750
Just like these branch school
students that I've prepared

466
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,000
to serve as
sacrifices if need be.

467
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,583
Tor Kokonoe.

468
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,583
He even thanked me for giving
all those students another shot.

469
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,125
Not knowing my true
intentions for them, of course.

470
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,750
Hmph.

471
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,750
Miyabi.

472
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,541
I'm sure it seems kinda sudden.

473
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,791
You and I haven't known
each other for very long,

474
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,583
but you've always cheered me on
in the short time that we have.

475
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,333
Your kind words have
given me so much

476
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,208
support and encouragement
that actually--

477
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,875
I love you!

478
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,083
Do you feel the same way?

479
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,958
If you do,

480
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,375
then would you please
be my boyfriend, Tor?

481
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,666
[TOR thinking]
Miyabi,

482
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,750
is in love with me?

483
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,125
But...

484
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,625
these hands of mine.

485
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,541
[gasps]

486
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,125
[breath quivering]

487
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,916
[YOUNG BOY]
Oh, Tor.

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,416
Another one dead
because you're too weak.

489
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,458
[TOR gasps]

490
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,083
[TOR]
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,791
But I can't do that, Miyabi.

492
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
[gasps]

493
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
[TOR]
You see.

494
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,916
I'm weak.

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,375
That's why I can't.

496
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,291
Oh okay.

497
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,583
Um. Yeah sure,
that's no problem.

498
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,666
I understand, and I'm also

499
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,916
stupid.

500
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
I should have just kept quiet!

501
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,666
[cries]

502
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,083
I'm sorry!

503
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,500
[TOR]
No, wait.

504
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,291
[explosion]

505
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,333
[gasps]

506
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,958
What the?

507
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,750
--[gunshots]
--[screaming]

508
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,916
[K]
Now, then, shall we begin?

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,875
The Rebels, our
god-slaying corps

510
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,500
and the Exceeds.

511
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,083
It's time to judge and
be judged in the Selection!

512
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,125
It's those armored guys
who butted in on our Survive.

513
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,041
I never thought
we'd see them again.

514
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,583
Tomoe. They seem tougher
than they were before.

515
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,583
That's not a problem
'cause so are we!

516
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,666
Let's go!

517
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,500
[JULIE]
Next time: "Rebels."

518
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,541
Miyabi. Please be all right!
