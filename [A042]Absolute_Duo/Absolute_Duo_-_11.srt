00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,375
You see?

2
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,500
It's me.

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,750
But as you can tell,
I've been reborn.

00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,625
[gasps]

5
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,833
No.

6
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,541
What have those monsters
done to you, Miyabi?

7
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,375
You look just like--

00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,000
[ETHNARCH]
Stand back, guys!

9
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,208
Let's take her down, team!

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,208
[ETHNARCH TEAM]
Right!

11
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,166
No, don't!
She's our friend!

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,875
Blaze on.

13
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,416
[ALL screaming]

14
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,833
You're in my way.

[MIYABI giggles]

18
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,250
Did you see how easy
that was for me?

19
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,333
Well, Tor?

20
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,250
I want you to see how
strong I am now.

21
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,500
Miyabi.

22
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,208
What have they done to you?

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,958
[laughing]

24
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,333
We just gave her a gift.

25
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,833
That's all.

26
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,125
A heavens-piercing,
god-slaying gift.

27
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,125
Hey, Tor. Get ready.

28
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,833
[MIYABI]
Hey, Tor. Get ready.

29
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,791
[shocked grunts]

30
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,666
Watch out!

31
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,125
Thank you. That was close.

32
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,041
There's no need to thank me.
I'm just glad that you're okay.

33
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,500
[TOR grunts]

34
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,708
It looks like

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,208
you're interfering.

36
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,041
I am. And I'll keep
doing so, too.

37
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,333
I'll stop anyone from
hurting Tor, even you.

38
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,291
Blaze on!

39
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,208
[STUDENTS]
Blaze on!

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,708
She's got the power to lay out
a bunch of Ethnarchs.

41
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,291
That's way stronger than
a Level 2 like her should be.

42
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,791
There are ways to enhance
one's strength quickly.

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,291
That must be the case.

44
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,833
You mean Miyabi's been
enhanced with Rebel technology?

45
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,208
Precisely!

46
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,583
What you see before you
is the crowning achievement

47
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,625
of Equipment Smith's
research and development.

48
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,625
She's the perfect combination
of Exceed and Unit!

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,916
[MASTER ARMORER] What do you
think now, Miss Witch?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,125
The power that you tried
so hard to keep from me

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,291
is really quite incredible,
wouldn't you say?

52
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,791
Now feast your eyes upon
my greatest masterpiece!

53
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,833
It's only a matter of time until
she wins and makes me

54
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,583
the victor
of this killing game!

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,541
A Fusion,

56
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,750
of an Exceed and a Unit?

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,291
Correct.

58
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,666
And it was completed with her
full cooperation, of course.

59
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,791
This bold young woman
made stopping by your

60
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,000
wretched little island
worth the effort.

61
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,250
[growls]

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,333
How dare you!

63
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,916
You get your hands off of her!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,750
Filthy swine!

00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,875
[laughs]

66
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
Miyabi!

67
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,333
He somehow forced you
into doing this, didn't he?

68
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,708
Don't you worry!

69
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,083
We're gonna protect you, okay?

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,750
Protect me?

71
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,541
Get away from her, Tomoe!

72
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,458
Huh?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
[TOR]
Tomoe!

74
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,375
No.

75
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,250
I don't think I require your
protection any longer.

76
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,500
You're so weak.

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,333
Especially compared to me.

78
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,416

79
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,625

[BOTH gasp]

81
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,041
Oh, that's right!

82
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,875
A Blaze can harm
flesh and blood.

83
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,500
When it's wielded
with deadly intent.

84
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,625
Oh, no.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,166
Miyabi's probably
been brainwashed.

86
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,791
[gasps]

87
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,500
Or something very similar
to that, I'd wager.

88
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,208
[SAKUYA]
I can only assume

89
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,541
that you've been
keeping a close eye

90
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,458
on this Academy's students
for quite some time now.

91
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,416
[MASTER ARMORER] The battle-
hardened body of an Exceed

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,708
combined with such a
delicate and imbalanced spirit.

93
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,375
Once you factor in
how desperately

94
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,333
she yearns for strength,

95
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,291
that young woman was
truly the ideal candidate.

96
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
With just the slightest
bit of encouragement,

97
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,125
she has harnessed a power
beyond our wildest dreams.

98
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,583
And grown to become
the perfect soldier.

99
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,000
One who'll fight to
the death, if ordered.

100
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,166
Perhaps you've had
a change of heart.

101
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
About the alliance
that we talked about?

102
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,333
Well, then?

103
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,333
[SAKUYA]
Yes.

104
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,791
I've made a decision.

105
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,625
Oh?

106
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,625
First we have to get rid
of your inside men.

107
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
We can't have a pitiful
old man spying on

108

female students for
some clandestine purpose,

109
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,416
which I'm sure wasn't
just for research, either.

[laughs]

111
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,708
When you put it that way,
it does sound pretty creepy!

[growls]

114
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,750
That man gave me
this incredible power.

115
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,166
I was so weak.

116
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,333
And now look at
how strong I've become.

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,708
Brainwashing is despicable!

118
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,541
I won't argue with you there.

119
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,333
But she asked
for this herself.

120
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,916
We didn't need
to brainwash her.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,416
Ridiculous!

122
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,625
There's no way Miyabi would
ask for this kind of power!

123
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,125
[laughs]

124
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,958
Do you honestly believe I don't
want strength like this?

125
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,625
You really are very funny.

126
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,458
You are.

127
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,791
But,

128
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,250
you know nothing about me
or what I want, Tomoe.

00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,791
[gasps]

130
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,916

134
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,458
It's quite heroic,
don't you think?

Maybe now you
realize you've been

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,291
under observation
all this time.

137
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583

Stop it.

138
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,458
I must admit it was amusing.

139
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,250
It almost felt like
I was watching some

140
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
preposterous teen movie.

00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,791
Tell me why you've always
looked at everyone except me.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,291
Tell me.
Why, Tor?

145
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,083
How is she so strong?

146
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,416
Look at me! Look!

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,625
Look at me, Tor!

148
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,083
Look how strong I am now!

150
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,458
See? Look, Tor!

151
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,375
Don't just stand there,
you blockhead!

152
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,750
We must deal with Miyabi.

153
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,875
Are you going to help?

154
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,833
Ja.

155
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,250
If we only use Blazes,

156
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,833
I think we can stop her
without actually hurting her.

157
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,375
You guys.

00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,333
Why don't you understand?

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,875
That all I need is Tor!

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,083
Don't worry. I'm fine!

[MIYABI] Did you see how
easy that was for me?

164
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,750
Well, Tor? I want you to see
how strong I am now.

Miyabi.

166
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,750
[MIYABI]
Remember?

167
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,583
When it was just
the two of us on the beach?

168
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,416
And then you told me
you were too weak.

169
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,291
That's why.

170
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,000
I decided then and there
I was going to get stronger.

171
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
That I wouldn't let
anything hurt you.

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,750
That's the only reason
I'm doing all of this.

173
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,916
I thought that if I could
protect you from everything,

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,166
maybe you'd love me.

175
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,166
And then, we could
be together, forever.

00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,291
Bravo
Not only did you prove yourself

183
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,083
most effective
against Exceeds,

184
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,291
you took on an Exception.

185
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,750
Impressive.

186
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,000
But unfortunately for me,
playtime is just about over.

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,916
And where do you
think you're going, K?

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
[K laughs]

189
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,958
I know that we're in the middle
of our little game and all--

190
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,833
[gunshots and shouting]

191
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
But I have other
matters to attend to.

192
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,083
I'm afraid I must
greet the Blaze Diabolica

193
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,708
on behalf of the corps.

194
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,625
[LILITH gasps]

195
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,583
You wouldn't dare hurt Sakuya!

196
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,666
[K] With her intelligence
and resourcefulness,

197
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,291
I'm certain that the witch will
make an excellent test subject.

198
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,750
I bid you adieu.

199
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,458
I sincerely hope
that all involved

200
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,041
enjoy the rest of the game.

201
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,125
[growls] Not so fast!

202
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,458
Look out!

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
No, look at my power.

204
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,750
Soon I'll have more.

205
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,500
And more! And more!

206
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,791
And more!

207
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,875
And more and more!

208
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,666
Just stay
and watch me, Tor.

209
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,541
Huh?

210
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,083
Tomoe!

211
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,166
[grunts]

212
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,708
Hey, guys? Listen.

213
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,958
I'm gonna need you to let me
deal with Miyabi by myself.

214
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,458
But that's insane!

215
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,291
Yeah, I know what
it sounds like.

216
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,458
It's just--

217
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,333
If there's
a way to help my Duo.

218
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,833
I have to try!

219
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,458
[TOMOE]
Go.

220
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,041
I can take care of this!

221
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,708
Come on. Let me go!

222
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,750
That's enough.

223
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,541
We should leave them.
Let's go.

224
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,208
[TOR]
But Julie--

225
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,500
Listen.

226
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,041
We should trust her,

227
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,791
and the bonds shared by a Duo.

228
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,208
All right.

229
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,875
[TORA]
No objection here.

230
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,916
She's all yours, Tomoe.

231
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,458
[MIYABI]
And now, he's gone.

232
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,416
Interrupted yet again.

233
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,666
I won't let you get
away with this, Tomoe.

234
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,916
Miyabi.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,708
You should know I'll be
the one to stop you.

236
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,291
[TOR]
Rebels.

237
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,083
[BOTH grunt]

238
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,291
Lilith! Tora!

239
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,000
--[gunshots]
--[slashing and screaming]

240
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,916
We'll hold them off
here as long as we can!

241
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,666
I usually won't
say things again.

242
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,333
But this time,
I'll gladly do so.

243
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,291
Please go help Sakuya!

244
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
We're on it!

245
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,083
Ja!

246
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,041
[slashing and screaming]

247
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,416
Hmph.

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,666
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you

249
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,166
got the short end of the stick.

250
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Everyone knows a wife's
duty is to stand by her man.

251
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,208
No matter how bad things get.

252
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,583
You're way more of a weirdo
than I thought,

253
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,208
Miss Lilith Bristol.

254
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,958
So are you, Aoi Torasaki.

255
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,583
[TORA] Okay, shall we do
this as an ad-hoc Duo?

256
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,291
[LILITH] Yep! We two shall
remain together always,

257
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,208
and so on and so forth.

258
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,250
C'mon!

259
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,125
Go big or go home!

260
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,333
[TOR]
K?

261
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,958
What took you two so long?

262
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,583
You're not after
the Headmistress?

263
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,708
I knew you'd come running if I
threatened your precious Sakuya.

264
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,958
Honestly,
I only want one thing.

265
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,875
And that's revenge for
our last encounter.

266
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,291
More than anything,
Tor Kononoe,

267
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,666
I want to see the look
of despair on your face

268
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,166
when the person you
swore to protect is dead!

269
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,916
And gone!

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,750
I can tell you right now
that your wishes

271
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,375
won't be coming true.

272
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,375
We're not about
to let that happen!

273
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,500
Do you hear me?

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,083
Ugh!

275
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,208
How long will you keep
getting in my way?

276
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,791
[TOMOE]
For as long as it takes!

277
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,291
That's right!

278
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,708
And I'll keep doing it
till you give up that

279
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,500
crazy borrowed power,
you hear me?

280
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,708
I don't understand
what your problem is.

281
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,416
Our Lukifers are basically
just borrowed power, too.

282
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,708
You're wrong!

283
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,416
Our Lukifers won't work
if we're not always

284
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,875
trying to better ourselves!

285
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,500
What we gain from dedication,

286
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,833
hard work and
overcoming difficulty.

287
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,833
That's real strength!

288
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,041
Isn't that the reason why you
worked so hard for so long?

289
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,458
It was...

290
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,583
for him.

291
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,166
What do you mean?

292
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,916
It was for him!

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,166
[groans]

294
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,541
You're wrong!

295
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,625
I didn't train every day to
better myself, Tomoe!

296
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,916
It was for Tor!

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,875
I wanted the person
I liked to notice me!

298
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,541
That's all!

299
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,250
[gasps]

300
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,750
A young woman on
a quest for power all for

301
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,708
the love of a boy
who rejected her.

302
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,500
It's heroic.

303
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,458
[TOMOE]
I see.

304
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,041
I really don't know anything.

305
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,041
--[grunting]
--[metal clashing]

306
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,791
It seems to me you two
are being rather cold-hearted.

307
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,666
You left behind
one single friend

308
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,583
to try
and take on the Fusion?

309
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,208
That's not what
sane people do, is it?

310
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,208
Don't waste your time
trying to psych us out.

311
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,166
We believe in
the bond they share.

312
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,708
A Duo's bond.

313
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,791
Whatever's happening, we
know that they'll work it out.

314
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,250
I'd better hurry if I
want to catch up to Tor.

315
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,625
[TOMOE]
We're not done.

316
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,208
Please. Give it a rest.

317
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,375
[grunts]

318
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,541
You were right.

319
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,166
I really don't know
anything about you.

320
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,291
But still--

321
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,750
That power of yours is
wrong and you know it!

322
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,750
Tor would say the same thing.

323
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,291
[gasps]

324
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,291
[TOMOE] That's the kind of
honesty you can expect from him.

325
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,916
Don't say that!

326
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,708
All I wanted to do was
get stronger for him!

327
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,416
Tor would never try to
tear me down like that!

328
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,416
[gasps]

329
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,541
Then tell me one thing.

330
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,708
Miyabi,

331
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,791
did you tell him how,

332
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,333
well,

333
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,541
how you felt about him?

334
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,208
Yes, I did.

335
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,125
And then,

336
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,666
he rejected me.

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,375
Because I was so weak.

338
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,291
I see.

339
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,750
Well, in that case,

340
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,416
you don't need that
kind of power after all.

341
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,583
Don't you start on that again!

342
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,166
[TOMOE] But only because you're
so incredibly strong already!

343
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,125
[gasps]

344
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm not good at girl stuff.

345
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't know even
know how to flirt.

346
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,583
And I--

347
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,583
I've never once been in love.

348
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,125
But,

349
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,375
despite all that,

350
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,958
I still know how
hard it must be to

351
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,000
confess your
feelings to someone.

352
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,916
Miyabi.

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Believe me,
you're strong.

354
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,708
So much stronger
than someone like me.

355
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,416
[gasps]

356
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,958
You think I'm stronger?

357
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,541
I'm ashamed to
have thought I was

358
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,333
supporting you all this time.

359
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,875
And that's why,

360
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,166
I can't bear to see you drowning
in all of that false power!

361
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,458
You were brave enough
to tell Tor how you felt,

362
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,041
so I know you can get
stronger without that stuff!

363
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,458
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

364
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,250
If I don't have this power,
there's no way

365
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,375
I'll ever be able
to face Tor again!

366
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,375
And if I just hang
on to it, then I know

367
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,333
that he'll want to be
with me forever!

368
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,166
[TOMOE] Don't give up!
You've got to keep trying

369
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
with your true strength!

370
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,500
I'll never be good enough
for that to work!

371
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,958
I can't stand the thought
of being rejected again.

372
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,458
I'm so sick of all
the sadness and pain.

373
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,625
I can't take it.

374
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,250
[TOMOE]
You have me!

375
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,875
Anytime you're ever in pain.

376
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,083
You can count on me
to comfort you.

377
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,416
Let's both get
stronger together.

378
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,541
Okay?

379
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,250
Like a real Duo should!

380
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,500
That sounds...
so nice.

381
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,000
[screaming]

382
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,083
Concentrate on the sound
of my voice, Miyabi!

383
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,250
--Concentrate!
--Shut up!

384
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,916
I will destroy anything and
everything that gets in my way!

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,666
First I have to say,
I'm so sorry.

386
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,958
I wish that I was
more clever than I am.

387
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,500
But this is the only
way I can think of

388
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,958
to make you open your eyes.

389
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,666
So, brace yourself!

390
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,583
Miyabi.

391
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
Tomoe.

392
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you okay, Miyabi?

393
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,541
You can slap.

394
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,541
That really hurt me.

395
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,833
Yeah.

396
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,000
It hurt me, too.

397
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,083
Tomoe.

398
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,875
I'm so sorry.

399
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,625
Don't mention it.

400
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,791
We are a Duo.

401
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,916
Yeah.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,875
We sure are.

403
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,916
Thank you,
Tomoe.

404
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,250
What? No, how could
the device stop working?

405
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,333
That's impossible!

406
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,625
I don't understand!

407
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,625
[TOR]
Ha! We told you, K!

408
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,375
[JULIE]
We knew Tomoe could do it.

409
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,208
Miyabi is free now!

410
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,750
Don't celebrate just yet.

411
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,416
This isn't over!

Ah, there it is!

414
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,166
I knew I'd get to see it!

415
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,333
It's priceless! The look
on your face when

416
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,833
the one you swore
to protect gets hurt!

417
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,125
And we're just getting started!

418
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,916
Now, why don't you show me
more of that pathetic face?

You alright?

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,291
Ja. It's just a scrape.

Heh. It's no big deal.

[K clapping]
How magnificent!

427
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,541
Your resolve to protect your
friend is the real deal.

428
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,458
And, oh, so charming!

429
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,041
I did want a sound bite.

430
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,708
I was really hoping
for a tearful goodbye

431
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,791
as your beloved friend lie
dying in your arms, perhaps.

432
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,291
This is low.
Even for you.

You know people like you
make me physically ill.

434

Risking your life to
protect a special someone?

435
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,333
I can't think of anything
else more revolting.

436
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,375
Run, Tor!

437
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,916
Get out of here!

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,250
Don't worry about me!

439

Hey, K. Listen.

443
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,125
I'll kill you!

444
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,583
I swear that I'll kill you!

445
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,208
I want to protect you, Julie.

446
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,541
I wanna be the one
you can rely on.

447
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,000
Julie, stop!

448
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,166
Still,

449
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,833
keep in mind the world
waits for no one,

00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,708
nor is it so kind to
let you have your way.

And, yes,
that includes this!

And what good

will that do?

00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,083
You'll see.

457
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,750
It'll affect the embodiment
of my soul-power, my Blaze!

So!

00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,125
No one can hear you.

542
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,458
No one will come to
protect you, old man.

543
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,041
Ugh!

544
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,541
Having a stingy old crank like
you around might ruin my plans.

545
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,125
And now,

546
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,833
this is mine.

547
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,583
I have the ultimate armor.

548
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,708
Destruction!

549
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,208
And I will use it

550
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,583
to destroy Kokonoe
and his friends!

551
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,958
[TOR]
I've always wondered.

552
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,625
Why does my soul-power
take the form of a shield?

553
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,208
Well now I finally
know the answer.

554
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,708
And it's because of you.

555
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,625
[JULIE] Next time,
the finale: "Absolute Duo."

556
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,083
[BOTH]
Head off the fang! Aegis Desire!
