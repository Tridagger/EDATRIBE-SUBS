00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,958
Imari and Miwa, I need you two
to go take care of the injured!

7
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,041
You got it!

8
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:04,916
Okay!

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,333
Tora and Tatsu, come--

[groans]

11
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,250
Hmm.

12
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,375
There's something different
about these guys now.

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,708
[TOMOE thinking]
Please be all right, Miyabi.

14
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,000
I can say with
absolute certainty

15
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,625
that this is Equipment
Smith's team.

16
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,083
These new Units,

17
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,333
they're not the same
as they were last time.

18
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,416
They're Rebels.

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,000
The so-called
"god-destroying corps".

20
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,250
It seems that they have
lived up to their name.

21
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,916
[laughing] Well, if you ask me,
the name is super dramatic.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,125
But that doesn't change
the fact that as we speak,

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,458
they're giving
our little Level 2's

24
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
a pretty serious spanking.

25
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,000
Luckily, there hasn't been
a single casualty reported.

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,791
He must not want any.

27
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,666
And in fact, knowing
what I do about him,

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,458
this is what that older
gentleman would

29
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,208
call a first-round Selection.

30
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,125
Only a barbarian
could take pride in

31
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,375
something as brutal as this.

32
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,625
Sarah, is the main school
sending reinforcements?

33
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,750
Well, Miss,
about that.

34
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,333
So the campus is being
attacked by another squadron?

35
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,750
Damn.

36
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,000
They want the underground
research facility.

37
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,625
Or so I assume.

38
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,166
I accounted for this
in my plans, as well. Rito?

39
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,291
[laughs]

40
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,750
Well, it's about time!

41
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,625
[SAKUYA] It's not every day
we have a Selection.

42
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,500
Since this is such
a special occasion,

43
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,333
why don't you show them
the true extent of your power?

44
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,875
Hmph!

45
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,583
[laughs]

46
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,291
You don't have to ask
me twice, Headmistress.

47
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,958
It's been too long since I've
had the chance to go all out.

54
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,500
You okay?

55
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,041
Mm-hmm.

56
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,708
Thank you, Imari.

57
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,458
That's just what partners do.

58
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,750
However, we won't last long.

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,083
Hey, Tomoe,
you got any bright ideas?

60
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,375
Only if they come
a little closer.

00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,041

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000

00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,916
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

65
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,791
These jerks have destroyed
nearly everything in their path.

66
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Unforgivable.

[distant cackling]

68
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,291
Why on earth would you
pick a fight with us?

69
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,125
I guess that's the main
question I'd like to ask you.

70
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,458
But first, I should warn you.

71
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,416
I'm not pulling any punches!

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,333
[gasps]

73
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,958
Hiyaaah!

74
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,583
I'm not gonna lie,
it feels pretty good

75
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,791
having that stupid
limiter out of the way!

76
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Now who else wants
to see what I can do?

Come on, come on, come on.

Don't tell me that's all
you weenies have got?

82
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,791
Is she?

83
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,916
Yeah.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,416
She's way stronger
than she was before.

85
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,208
[SQUAD LEADER]
This woman's an exception!

86
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,958
Go ahead and kill her!

87
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,541
I can see that some of
you didn't get enough

88
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,083
in that first go-around.

89
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,375
In that case.

But keep your distance so you
kids don't get chopped to bits!

Using your Blaze!

96
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,000
When an Exceed goes
beyond Level Four,

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,083
she can release the power
hidden deep in her Blaze.

98
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,208
Just like this!

99
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,083

You were going
easy on us before.

[laughs] Yeah, let's just say
it's a grown-up thing.

109
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,250
Now listen.

110
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,625
Tell me what you saw.

111
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,208
Well.

112
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,083
I think I finally got to see how
powerful your Blaze really is.

113
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,125
That's exactly what it was.

114
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,875
Where are you going?

115
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,250
Duh, where else?

out on a foxhunt.

Let's get back to
the others, 'kay?

119
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500

Is Miyabi not here
with you guys?

124

The main school says

125
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,416
the entire squad that was
attacking them has been--

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,291
[groaning]

127
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,750
Absurd.

128
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,000
Everyone's been downed
by a single combatant?

129
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,291

00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,500
[groans and gurgling]

131
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,625
They managed to wipe
out the attackers!

132
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,541
Well, you've got them right
where you want them, don't you?

133
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,458
I should've known.

134
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,500
[MAN]
I wouldn't be so sure.

135
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,791
We have come here
to collect you.

136
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,541
Blaze Diabolica.

137
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,458
So both the main corps
and the academy attack.

138
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,916
They were just diversions?

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,416
Hmph.

140
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,833
They were simply sideshows
to entice the Blaze Diablolica.

141
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:03,375
Your employer must really have
his heart set on Exceeds, eh?

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,750
That's right, now
come with us, or else.

143
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,750
I have to say I'm quite aghast
at your utter lack of manners.

144
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,458
How dare you enter a lady's
room without knocking.

145
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,166
That just won't do.

146
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,166
I'm very sorry.

147
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,000
But unlike last time we met,

148
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm afraid that I don't have
an invitation for you today.

149
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,458
Look out, Miss!

151
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,875
Even if you did, I'd tell
you the same thing.

152
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,958
Don't make me say it again.

153
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,333
Well, That's an
Exception for you.

154
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,250
It's clear that you've
become even stronger

155
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,208
and more beautiful
than you were before.

156
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,083
[cocks gun] But I haven't the
time nor the inclination

157
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,583
to entertain you right now.

158
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,791
Farewell.

00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,166
What the hell?

161
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,583
Was anybody in there?

162
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,333
Well, I think
the headmistress was.

163
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,625
Along with Lilith
and her assistant, too.

164
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,375
You go deal with that.

165
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,541
Before I do anything else, I've
got to find out where Miyabi is.

166
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,166
Did you guys get separated
back on the beach?

167
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,166
She took off a while back.

168
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,458
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,416
[TOMOE] There's no
need to apologize.

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,666
This isn't your fault.

171
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,333
I will find Miyabi
if it's the last thing I do.

172
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,958
I should go with you.

173
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,041
You're going to need someone
who's familiar with the island.

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,833
Then let's go.

175
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,541

00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,125
Oh, dear me!

178
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,458
Are you okay, Miss?

179
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,166
Lilith! Is everyone all right?

180
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,958
Hello, Tor.

181
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,083
It seems we've been had.

182
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,250
She jumped in the way,
trying to protect us.

183
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,041
My mind was made up.

184
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,916
I simply wasn't going to let
them hurt either one of you.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,250
[grunts]

186
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,041
Whoa, take it easy.

187
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,750
[LILITH]
Don't worry about me.

188
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,375
You have to help her.

189
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,750
Wait, help who?

190
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,375
Sakuya.

191
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,625
I'm ashamed to admit it, but,

192
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,958
I failed and they took her.

193
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,416
Please find her
and bring her back.

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,125
Will you promise me
that you'll do that?

195
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
Yeah.

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,125
You ready, Julie?

197
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,666
Ja.

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,125
You can admit it now.

199
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,250
You have nothing left
in your arsenal.

200
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,708
[grunts]

201
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,625
That far of a fall is kinda
pushing it a little bit.

202
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,958
Even so,
we made it.

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,416
That's right.

204
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,916
We sure did.

205
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,625
[TOR]
Why did you attack us?

206
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,291
[K] Why I do what
I do is my business.

207
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
It's of no concern to you.

208
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,541
[TOR] When you opened fire on my
friends, you made it my concern.

209
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,041
[K] You won't be concerned
with anything if I kill you.

210
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,791
Listen up.

211
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,583
Despite all appearances,
I can assure you

212
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,541
I'm a truly merciful man.

213
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,958
As such, I'll forgive
your interruption

214
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,208
if you jump off this boat
in the next five seconds.

215
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,125
I don't need five seconds.

216
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,625
I told Lilith I'd bring Sakuya
back and I'm a man of my word.

217
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,708
Like Tor, I refuse as well.

218
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,333
And because I can't swim.

219
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,541
[laughs]

220
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,333
I didn't realize
how funny you two are.

221
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,833
Well, enough talk.
Let's get down to it, shall we?

222
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,791
Finally.

223
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,458
I'll eliminate you obstacles.

224
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,041
Julie! Let's go!

225
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:34,916
Ja.

226
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,541
[grunting]

227
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,708
How do you like this?

228
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,625
Hyah!

229
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,958
[bones crunching]

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,208
What a remarkable
power you have.

231
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,583
It's amazing, really,
for just flesh and blood.

232
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,541
[grunts]

233
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,708
[screams]

234
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,791
Oh, whoops!

235
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,041
We can't stop now!

236
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,166
Ja!

237
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,375
[grunting]

238
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,250
Good, but not enough!

239
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,875
Hyaaaaah!

240
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,000
You almost landed that.

241
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:15,875
Almost.

242
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,916
Yeah?

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,208
Well, how about this?

244
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,916
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

245
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,333
Aaaah!

246
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,458
Now, let's find
the headmistress.

247
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,208
[VOICE]
That was quite a blow.

248
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,916
[gasps]

249
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,833
That was a direct hit
that should have killed you.

250
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,500
Sort of.

251
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,041
It might have been fatal
to someone else.

252
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:54,416
However.

253
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458
Such an attack has
no effect on me.

254
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,250
So that's the new Unit Equipment
Smith has been developing?

255
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,083
It appears to be quite powerful.

256
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,333
Just as you Exceeds
have surpassed humanity

257
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,583
with the power of your Lukifers,

258
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,916
we have now surpassed
you with the power of Units.

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,375
I'm sure you'll agree.

260
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,416
Oh, yeah?

261
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,541
[TOR thinking] Maybe they're
more powerful than my fists.

262
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,416
But what about Julie's sword?

263
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,166
Have we finished
with the chitchat yet?

264
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,333
Excellent.

265
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,666
Because I'd like to
make my move now.

266
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,666
Hyah!

267
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,125
[screaming]

268
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,166
Is that all you've got?

269
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,666
I can barely feel it.

270
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,166
[JULIE]
Hrungnir!

271
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,958
The roar of thunder!

[yelps]

274
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,708
Are you okay?

275
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,958
I'm fine.

276
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,291
So what now?

277
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,625
One more round, all right?

278
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,916
Ja.

279
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,625

[whimpering]

283
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,750
Breaking through
your special move

284
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,416
was enough to
throw you off, huh?

285
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,250
You have so much to learn.

286
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,291

00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,166

[whimpers]

289
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,416
And losing your cool just
because your partner's hurt?

290
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,541
The only way I could
describe this behavior

291
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,500
is completely hopeless.

292
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,708
That's why

293
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,041
you will die!

00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,125
You move well
with that injured leg.

297
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,416
I promised her

298
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
that I would protect
her no matter what.

299
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,500
Protect her?

300
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,291
Don't make promises
you can't keep!

301
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,208

302
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,000

Aaaaaagh!

00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,500
[K]
What a lovely voice you have.

306
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,375
Now I want you to repeat
to me what you said

307
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,750
about how all you
want is to protect her.

Papa!

311
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,583
Julie.

312
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,625
Don't.

313
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,833
Be a good girl and wait there.

314
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,625
Just be patient and
soon enough I'll

315
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,000
send you to your grave as well.

316
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:53,958
You won't.

317
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,125
I won't let you.

318
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,166
Sorry, I have to protect Tor.

319
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,250
I swore I always would.

320
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,666
I made that promise to myself.

321
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,458
And I'll keep it!

322
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,250
Hyaaaaaaaaaah!

323
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,041
She's so fast!

324
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,916
These moves.

It's okay.

331
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,791
That's enough!

Incredible.

00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,791
You've been hiding all
that power this whole time?

[TOR]
You!

337
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,333
Do you actually expect me
to believe that you could

338
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,666
protect this girl considering
the shape you're in?

339
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,208
I do.

340
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
Because I'll do
whatever it takes

341
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,416
to keep all my friends safe!

342
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,375
Hearing you spout
nonsense like that,

343
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,250
it makes me sick.

344
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,791
Do you really think you're
good enough to protect her?

345
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,958
How could a broken-down runt
like you protect anybody?

346
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,958

349
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,833
Stand by a little longer.

350
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,666
I have in my possession
the Blaze Diabolica, sir.

351
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,500
[MAN]
That won't be necessary.

352
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,583
As luck would have it,

353
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,958
we already have
what we came here for.

354
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,166
But.

355
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,833
[MAN] We must prepare
for another banquet.

356
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,875
I'm ordering you to
return immediately, K.

357
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
Understood, sir.

358
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,625
I never did catch your name.

359
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm Tor Kokonoe.

00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,791
Nice to formally meet
you, Tor Kokonoe.

361
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,125
I'll kill you the next
time we cross paths.

362
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,583
I give you my word as a Rebel.

363
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,333
You can call me K.

364
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,666
Wait!

365
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm going to remember that name.

366
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,166
You made it!

367
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,708
So Tor was able to
keep his promise, eh?

368
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
Yes.

369
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,875
We must find a way to thank him.

370
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,625
Tell me.

371
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,958
Why would your captors
give you up so easily?

372
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,416
The answer to that
is elementary, my dear.

373
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,333
Obviously I was never the older
gentleman's intended target.

374
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,916
Do you mean--

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,875
[phone ringing]

376
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,166
Yes, hello?

377
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,875
Fine, go ahead.

378
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,958
[gasps]

379
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,625
It's an invitation
to the Reign Conference.

380
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,125
Isn't it?

381
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
[JULIE]
Papa.

382
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,708
He was the hero of Gimle.

383
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,833
One winter night,

384
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,291
Papa went into battle,

385
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,875
and lost.

386
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,833
To him.

387
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,166
Papa was kind
and loving to the very end.

388
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,541
He patted my head and smiled.

389
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,041
As if to say,

390
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,375
"I'm sorry."

391
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,916
And then, the same man
who murdered my father,

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,666
he gave me the scar
that runs down my back.

393
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,500
That's why I want to be strong.

394
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,541
Strong enough to kill
that man for what he did.

395
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:29,916
And strong enough to
avenge the death of my father.

396
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,208
That's the whole reason why I
came to study at Koryo Academy.

397
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,708
That's why you said you're
an avenger like me?

398
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,625
Ja.

399
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,708
But Tor,

400
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,583
even so,

401
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,333
you've still had to
protect me a lot.

402
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,916
I'm so weak.

403
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,166
No, you're not.

404
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,000
You've protected me.

405
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,333
But you're the one who's always
working so hard to protect me.

406
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,250
Well, yeah, of course.

407
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,458
I am your partner after all.

408
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,666
Ja.

409
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,916
That's right,
and I'm your partner.

410
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,541
Mm.

411
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,166
[TOR thinking] All I want
is to keep Julie safe,

412
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,291
so she'll never get
hurt like this again.

413
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,791
And that's why

414
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,666
I've got to get stronger.

415
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,500
Will this thing really
make me stronger?

416
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,916
Yes.

417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,666
I think you'll find that
it's incredibly effective.

418
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,208
Especially for those who
know their own weaknesses.

419
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,958
I guarantee it.

420
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,833
[gasps]

421
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,375
So what do you say?

422
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,416
Remember this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

423
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,166
A chance for you to grow
stronger in every possible way.

424
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,875
[MIYABI thinking]
If I were stronger,

425
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,708
maybe Tor would...

426
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,958
[TOR] I didn't have
the slightest idea.

427
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,208
Not about why this
Academy was made,

428
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,250
or about what this Academy
was actually making.

429
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,708
None of it.

430
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,000
[JULIE]
Next time: "Reign Conference."

431
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,625
This is reality.
Get used to it.
