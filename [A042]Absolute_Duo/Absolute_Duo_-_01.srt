Ah!

Hi! I guess you're
new here, too.

to walk together?

Out of all the kids from my

who got accepted here.

Truth be told,
I'm a little nervous.

I guess that makes
two of us then.

So, um,

00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,625
the martial techniques
that we'll study here.

I want to personally welcome

00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,291
all you new students
to Koryo Academy.

00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,625
I'm Sakuya Tskumo,

40
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,083
the headmistress
of this institution.

00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,291
Congratulations on
making it here.

42
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,083
To start things off,
we'll begin by performing

43
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,083
our traditional
Screening Rite.

44
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,625
First, please take note of
the person sitting beside you,

45
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,500
because he or she
will be your partner.

46
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,916
It looks like you and me
are teaming up, Imari.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,958
Yeah, I guess so

48
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,750
but I wonder for what?

49
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,208
[SAKUYA]
When I give the signal,

50
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,208
you're all to rise and
begin battling your partner.

Only the winners
will be permitted entrance.

53

The losers' Lukifers
will be removed.

54
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,833
And they'll be asked to
leave the premises.

56
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,666
But I got an acceptance letter
to this school!

57
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,000
[MALE STUDENT] Me, too!
Isn't that enough to get us in?

58
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,583
[FEMALE STUDENT]
A battle? Is she serious?

59
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,875
[SAKUYA]
Oh, I should add

60
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,666
that if your battle
isn't over in ten minutes,

61
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,000
both you and your
partner will fail.

62

Headmistress!

63
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,875
[SAKUYA]
Yes, you there.

64
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,708
Isn't it a bit extreme
to kick us out just because

65
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,333
we lost a battle?

66
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,750
[SAKUYA] If you can't pass this
special entrance examination,

67
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,500
then you don't belong here.

00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,333
This test's purpose,

69
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,958
and that of Koryo Academy,
is to teach you how to survive

70
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,583
based on one simple rule.

71
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,625
You must defeat others
to stay alive.

72
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,583
Yeah, but this is
only our first day!

73
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,375
You'll all be plunging headfirst
into battle soon enough

74
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,250
so what better time to
start than right now?

expressed interest

00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,875

we switch partners?

you're trying to do.

I can hold my own.

But, a Blaze,
your soul power...

123
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,166
it's always supposed to
manifest in the form

I've gotta admit,
I'm a little surprised.

00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,833
Well, you know, since Blazes are
weapons produced by your soul,

156
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,125
I suppose souls are the
only things they can hurt,

157
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,083
so that would leave
the body untouched.

158
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,458
So is that why you were
holding back in there?

159
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,041
I didn't use the full
power of my Blaze

160
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,083
because I was afraid
that I might hurt you, Imari.

That was very sweet of you.

do that anymore.

what your power is, or how

00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,500
two more guinea pigs for
Sakuya Tsukumo, doesn't it?

180
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,166
Wow, that's a real negative
way of looking at things.

181
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,125
C'mon, think about it, man.

182
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,166
We got our Blaze powers
from those Lukifer things

183
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,666
she gave us.

184
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
There's gotta be an ulterior
motive for giving us those,

185
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,791
don't you think?

186
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
If you ask me, this whole
school is nothing but a big

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,541
research lab for Sakuya,
and we're just lab rats

188
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,166
in her experiment.

189
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,041
Oh, hey, look, there's the
first-year classroom, Tora.

190
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,750
We should probably
get a move on.

191
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,541
Hmm. Hey, what's
the big hurry, "lab rat"?

192
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,958
You think you're
ready for this?

193
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,291
Yeah, I sure am!

194
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,458

[STUDENTS whispering]

197
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,791
[FEMALE STUDENT]
She's so cute!

198
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,541
Whoa, it's her.

199
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,041
Do you know that girl?

200
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,041
Well, I've seen
her before but...

201
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,125
You're Tor.

202
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,208
Uh...

203
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,583
Hey, do I know her?

204
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,541
How am I supposed to
answer that question?

205
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,291
[TORA]
Dude, she's looking at you.

206
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, I can see that,
but I don't know why.

207
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,250
[TORA]
Why don't you ask her?

208
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,791
Yeah, all right,
I think I can do that.

209
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,791
Hey, so I uh--

210
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
Um, I...

211
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,833
So, tell me--

212
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,875
Ugh.

213
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,625
[TORA]
Wow. She's good.

214
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,750
[TOR groans]

215
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,375
[WOMAN]
Hello, hello!

216
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,250
Nice to meet you,
I'm your homeroom teacher

217
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,625
Rito Tsukimi, but I insist you
call me "Professor Bunbun."

218
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,250
What's with
the strange looks, class?

219
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,375
Oh! I get it, you're all dazzled
by how gosh-darn cute I am.

220
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,875
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh?

221
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
[STUDENTS] No, we just
didn't expect a teacher

222
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,166
who'd be wearing bunny ears.

223
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,958
[TOR] All this and
she's still looking at me?

224
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
Well, since I've
introduced myself to you,

225
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,541
now it's your turn, class!

226
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,041
Tomoe Tachibana.

227
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,500
Um, my name is Miyabi Hotaka.

228
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,541
Aoi Torasaki.

229
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,083
[grunts]

230
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,333
[RITO] 'Kay, and next is
you there in the back.

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,958
I'm Tor Kokonoe.

232
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,375
Kokonoe?

233
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,208
Oh, right! So you're
that Irregular, huh?

234
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,333
You were the talk
of the teacher's lounge!

235
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,375
Oh, I was?

236
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,750
[RITO] Now you, the
silver-haired girl beside him,

237
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,333
please stand up!

238
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,833
Yeah, my name's Julie Sigtuna.

239
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,625
And I'm pleased to meet
each and every one of you.

240
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,166
[TOR thinking]
Julie, huh?

241
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,875
What is this girl's deal?

242
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,375
[RITO] To make sure you've
gotten the hang of this place,

243
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
let's review some things.

244
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,791
Remember, your student ID can
also be used as a credit card.

245
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,208
Plus you get
100,000 yen each month

246
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
to use how you like!

247
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,708
Boys, if you don't know what
to spend all that dough on,

248
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,708
I accept tips! Tee-hee!

249
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,958
[BOTH groaning]

250
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,000
Now let's talk about the special
Duo system we have here.

251
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,583
You'll be paired up
with a partner

252
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,375
and you guys will
do everything together

253
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,583
from training to eating
to sharing a room.

254
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,750
[JULIE]
Hmm.

255
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,666
[TOMOE]
Professor?

256
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes, dear?

257
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,625
Can you tell us why the
Academy has such a system?

258
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,833
Well, the answer to that
is once you graduate,

259
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
all of you will be placed

260
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,208
in the Dorn Agency's
peacekeeping corps.

261
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
And when you're there, you'll
be working in teams.

262
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Primarily in teams of two!

263
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,041
So then I guess we're
getting used to what

264
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,916
life in the corps will be like.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,083
Is that correct?

266
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,833
Bingo, you hit the nail
right on the head!

267
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,375
[TOMOE]
Thank you. You're too kind.

268
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
Two Duo partners
work together as one

269
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,541
everywhere they go,
whether it's in the classroom

270
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,083
or in the dorms,
and speaking of which,

271
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,541
all partners will also be
doubling up as roommates!

272
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,583
All right, now listen up!

273
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,916
Permanent Duos will
be discussed and decided

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,958
officially by this
weekend, okay?

275
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,000
So until then, all of you will
be placed in temporary Duos!

276
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,791
[TOR]
Temporary, huh?

277
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,625
Well, Tora what do you say?

278
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes, I suppose we could
work something out.

279
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,500
[RITO]
While these Duos are temporary,

280
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,125
they are pre-assigned.

281
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,125
And by "pre-assigned"
I mean that

282
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,125
the person next to
you will be your partner

283
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,250
like in the screening rite.

284
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,375
The person...

285
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,833
Next to me's...

286
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,458
[TOR]
My partner?

287
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,625
[JULIE]
Mm.

288
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,208
We can change that, right?

289
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
Sorry, already been decided!

290
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,541
No, please, you've
gotta be kidding me!

291
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,333
Consider yourself lucky!

292
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,958
You get an exotic,
beautiful girl

293
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,500
as a partner and roommate!

294
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,375
That reminds me, Koryo Academy
is no place for infants.

295
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,333
So no funny business.

296
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,916
Oh, man, this sucks!

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
[STUDENTS]
Are you serious?

298
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,500
This is my roommate?

299
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,666
Really?

300
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,666
Please, Professor Bunbun,
I'm begging you,

301
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,916
this isn't sensible!

302
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,541
Remember this morning's
opening ceremony?

303
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,625
This school made you students
savagely fight each other

304
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,333
and was that sensible?

305
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,416
Ah!

306
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,833
[TORA]
Just be a man and suck it up!

307
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,833
[TOR] That's the problem!
I am a man!

308
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,583
[TORA] Boo-hoo,
it's time for lights out!

309
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,208
No, wait!

310
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,333
[sighs]

311
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,625
[groans]

312
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,500
Geez, what should I say
when I walk in there?

313
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,708
Good evening!

314
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,875
Excuse me, miss.

315
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,791
Guten Abend!

316
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,416
Now wait a minute.

317
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,958
This is my room,
too, so I can just

318
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,333
walk in and not
say anything at all.

319
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,583
Here goes.

320
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,833
Um, it's me, Tor.

321
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,291
She's not here.

322
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,375
Maybe she wasn't too thrilled to
have me for a roommate, either,

323
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,958
and crashed someplace else.

324
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,166
[TOR]
Hmm?

325
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,333
[gasps]

326
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,083
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,250
I hope you don't mind
that I showered first.

328
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,791
Ah, wait, what the hell
are you wearing?

329
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,291
My pajamas.

330
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh, no, no, no, those
are definitely not pajamas!

331
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,041
If I sleep in it,
that makes it pajamas.

332
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,833
What else would it be?

333
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,666
[screaming]

334
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,625
[clears throat]

335
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,250
Um. Why don't I just
reintroduce myself, okay?

336
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,333
Hi, I'm--

337
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,333
Tor, right?

338
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,791
[TOR]
Oh, so you remembered.

339
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,125
Your name's hard to forget.

340
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,208
It sounds a lot like the word
"Thor" that's used

341
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,000
in my homeland, Gimle.

342
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,166
Gimle, huh?

343
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,500
And where exactly
in the world is that?

344
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,916
Scandinavia.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,041
And Thor, of course, is
a thunder god and one of the

346
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,000
mightiest in all of
Norse mythology.

347
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,666
[JULIE]
It's a good name.

348
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,125
So cool, that's one of
the mightiest gods.

349
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey, Tor?

350
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,958
Hey, Tor?

351
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
Is something wrong?

352
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,833
Um, no, it's just that--

353
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,250
Well, to be honest, I noticed
you were staring at me

354
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,666
all through class today,

355
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,958
kinda like you are now.

356
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,083
Do you mind explaining
to me why?

357
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,250
It's because I'm
interested in you, Tor.

358
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,250
Huh?

359
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,583
You heard me.

360
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,208
Really interested, in fact.

361
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,083
You're the only thing
I've thought about.

362
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,833
So by "interested,"

363
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,916
do you mean--?

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Huh? Wait, hold on!

365
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,666
Aren't you taking
this a little too fast?

366
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,208
We just met this morning!

367
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,625
[gasps]

368
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,666
I saw you use this exact move
back at the Screening Rite.

369
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,875
And it's interested me
ever since.

370
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,750
Oh. So...

371
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,625
--The move, huh?
--Yeah, Tor.

372
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,041
Do you think you could
teach it to me?

373
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,750
Um. I'm sorry.

374
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,875
But I can't 'cause it puts way
too much strain on the body.

375
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,416
If a girl your size tried it,
it might destroy her.

376
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,250
So, I'm sorry, but I can't.

377
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,875
Are you sure, Tor?

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,875
That's too bad.

379
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,750
[TOR]
Hmm?

380
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,208
Are you okay?

381
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,166
My apologies.

382
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,000
It must be
the time difference.

383
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm so tired,
I could fall asleep.

384
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,916
No problem. I'm sorry
I acted so spazzy tonight.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,291
Now go get some sleep,
Miss Sigtuna.

386
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,541
Ja, Tor.
I think I will go do that.

387
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,250
So good night,
and sweet dreams.

388
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,500
Hey, wait! I didn't
mean on the floor!

389
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,500
Where's your bed at? You're
gonna catch a cold out here!

390
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,708
[breathing softly]

391
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,208
Ahhh!

392
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,000
Crap!

393
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:58,916
[TOR grunts]

394
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,750
And it's still only
the first day.

395
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,041
I better turn in as well.

396
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,375
[liquid pouring]

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
As if I could even sleep!

398
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,708
[sighs]

399
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,375
[JULIE]
What was that you just said?

400
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,541
[groans sleepily]

401
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,625
[TOR]
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

402
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, nej.
What is that?

403
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,916
It's just some instant
apple tea I made.

404
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,166
That's all.

405
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,291
It smells so good.

406
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,083
Yeah, it does.

407
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,791
Do you want some?

408
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,708
Ja.

409
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,958
Well, here you go.

410
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,750
Thank you very much, Tor.

411
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,291
Ah!

412
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,083
Delicious.

413
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,291
Hey, I've been
thinking, Miss Sigtuna.

414
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,625
Nej, Tor.
"Julie" is fine, okay?

415
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,291
Oh, all right then.

416
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,750
Anyway, I'd like to
make this work

417
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,333
till the real duos
are announced.

418
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,708
--That okay, Julie?
--Ja, Tor.

419
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,250
I'd very much like to
make this work as well,

420
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,500
my new "partner."

421
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,125
[TOR] What exactly
does "Ja" mean anyway?

422
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,666
[JULIE] It means "yes."
It's always "yes."

423
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,625
[TOR]
Ja!

424
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,500
[JULIE]
Ja, "ja."

425
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,416
[TOR]
Ja?

426
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,333
[JULIE]
Ja, "ja."

427
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,333
[TOR]
Ja?

428
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,791
[JULIE]
Next time, "Duo."

429
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,833
[TOR]
Ja. That's deep.
