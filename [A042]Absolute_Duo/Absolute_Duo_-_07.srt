I froze.

00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,333
In that moment I was helpless,

00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,625
a liability for everyone else.

Well, don't beat yourself up.

Nothing useful ever
comes from that.

Thanks, Tomoe.

Mmm.

I brought my swimsuit.

Here we are,

summer camp and I'm--

33
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,708
It isn't your fault that it's
hot and you got seasick.

34
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,000
Besides, there's no way this is
just your average summer camp.

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,083
So you should rest while
you have the chance.

Seeing Julie like this,

42
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,958
she reminds me of
some adorable little critter.

Is Julie feeling okay?

Uh, Yeah.

48
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
I think the fresh air
has helped a little.

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,875
It's better than being
cooped up inside, anyway.

00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,583
Yeah, I bet.

00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,708
She looks pretty comfortable.

52
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,458
It's got to be hot over there.

Want to come and sit
in the shade with us?

54
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,125

The shade?

56
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,916
Well. It would be
nice to cool off.

There's no way.

you're really serious?

This is so Sakuya can sit back

81

and observe all of her
little lab rats at once.

Oh.

what we're doing,

I'm always holding you back.

187
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,666

[MIYABI] Everyone else is
probably way ahead of us now.

[TOMOE]
It's okay.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,250
I don't think there's
anything wrong

193
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,666

I'm soaked, too.

195

I'm so sorry, Tomoe.

Stop right there.

[TOMOE]
You're my partner, Miyabi.

If you truly feel that
disappointed in yourself,

201
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,083
you're also disappointed in
me because I'm your Duo.

That's not what I--

203
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,333
[TOMOE]
You, Miyabi Hotaka,

are the partner that I
chose above all others.

Now we can rinse off all
that salt from the ocean!

It's going to be dark soon,

[fabric tearing]

[TOR] I know this
isn't exactly ideal.

216
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,958
But it's probably better than
going barefoot the entire way.

Oh, Tor, they're perfect!

That's why you're
my future husband!

mind, my Duo partner, too!

Hey, Tor.

Those are Kunai.

next move here be, I wonder?

to move around

and one thing only.

365
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
That this path I'm on,

366
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,458
will one day lead me
to Absolute Duo.

367
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,125
[FEMALE STUDENT] The way you
fought back there was amazing!

368
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,416
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
It's no wonder you

369
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
got into the main school!

370
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not that impressive.

371
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,625
You most certainly are!

372
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,375
Every day I find something
new to admire in you.

373
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,083
Um, Thanks a lot, Tomoe.

374
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,916
I'm going to go get some food!

375
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,083
[MIYABI gasps]
Huh?

376
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,583
Sorry 'bout that!

377
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,583
No, please go ahead.

378
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,416
So, you're the talk of
the training camp.

379
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,958
I heard about how bravely you
fought to save Tomoe earlier.

380
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,500
Well.

381
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,625
There was a point where my
instincts just took over.

382
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,750
And that was
mostly because you--

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,250
[gasps]

384
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,416
Huh?

385
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,666
What was that you
just said about me?

386
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,416
Uh.

387
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,333
It's nothing.

388
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
Of course.

389
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,083
It's because Tor has been
there for me so many times...

390
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,125
that I feel...

391
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,208
I feel like...

392
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,875
Hey, Miyabi!

393
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,541
Tor, what are you
doing over there?

394
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,708
Coming!

395
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,291
Let's go!

396
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,458
'Kay!

397
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,750
[MIYABI thinking]
Now I know.

398
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,000
That what I'm
feeling for Tor is love.

399
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,583
True Love.

400
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,083
[MAN] The Unit is now
completely calibrated.

401
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,083
All that's left is to
move onto the final stage.

402
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,125
But, of course,
in order to do that

403
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
I require one last component.

404
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,833
[loud chewing]

405
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,625
And you'd like me to obtain it.

406
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,666
Is that right?

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,250
[MAN]
Yes.

408
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,208
And there's no reason for you to
report this to the higher-ups.

409
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,875
They are just as
curious as we are

410
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,250
to find out how
powerful this thing is.

411
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,833
The test results should be more
than enough to satisfy them.

412
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,541
The test.

413
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,458
Assess and be assessed, is it?

414
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,416
And what will the
codename be this time?

415
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
[chuckles]

416
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,291
A competition.

417
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,125
Let's call it Selection.

418
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,291
What do you think?

419
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,125
[sinister laugh]

420
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,375
[grunting]

421
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,291
That should do it.

422
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,291
I need a favor that
might seem strange,

423
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,875
but will actually help
us bunk together

424
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,000
for the rest of our time
here at summer camp.

425
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,708
Oh, yeah, sure.

426
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,666
I'd be happy to help.

427
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,000
Ja.

428
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,083
About what happened today.

429
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,291
I now know that it taught me

430
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,333
a very important
lesson about life.

431
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,583
An ounce of prevention's
worth a pound of cure.

432
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,250
Please hang on to these
in case I need them?

433
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,625
These?

434
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,333
Tor.

435
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,291
Is it necessary
to look at them?

436
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,916
[sputtering]

437
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,708
Sorry.

438
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,333
"These" were not
what I was expecting.

439
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,916
[IMARI]
It's summer!

440
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,750
[ALL]
Yeah!

441
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,208
[IMARI]
Time for swimsuits!

442
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,916
[ALL]
Yeah!

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,375
[IMARI]
And hot springs!

444
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,458
[ALL]
Yeah!

445
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,291
Next time, "Selection."

446
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,958
Plus, a wardrobe malfunction!
