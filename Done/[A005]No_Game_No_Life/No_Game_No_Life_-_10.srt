1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,191
We shan't allow you to fight the Eastern Federation.

2
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:05,787
Do our lives mean nothing to you?

3
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:08,735
Come out, you moron! We know
you're working with the Federation!

4
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:17,250
So, um, this is nice, sitting all together
like this, but why are we here again?

5
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:20,874
You remember what I told you after we won yesterday.

6
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:24,663
Demand number two, I want you, Elf.

7
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:28,333
Fiel, I'm gonna reserve the right
to alter your memories as I please.

8
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,048
What?

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,313
If I'm not mistaken, you need us to spy for you.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,585
You want spies?

11
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:38,485
The reason we bet Imanity's race piece is
because if we did it, it would make you, Miss Kurami,

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,189
spy of the Elven Gard come out of hiding.

13
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:44,852
and when you did, we could beat you in a game.

14
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:48,983
You thought that if you could somehow
give your memories to me during the game,

15
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:52,518
you could bring me over to your side
without using the pledges to force me.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,861
However, even though I agreed to help you,

17
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:59,738
I didn't see anything in your memories that would lead
me to believe that you can beat the Eastern Federation.

18
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,345
Are you sure you can do it?

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,934
I said I could, didn't I?

20
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:08,178
Anyway, I've brought the lot of
you here for a very particular reason.

21
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,941
Before we go any further, there's something we must do.

22
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:14,492
This next step is crucial to us fighting together.

23
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,409
What is it?

24
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,881
This sounds bad.

25
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:24,947
Let's get intimate, yeah!

26
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,138
What do you mean by intimate? I'm going
to assume you mean introductions... hmm?

27
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:17,631
I'm Kurami Zell, nice to meet you.

28
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,075
That's it?

29
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:21,039
Just your name?

30
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,717
Don't you have anything else to add?

31
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:25,568
Sorry, that's all I want to say.

32
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:30,612
Um... she's 18 years old, which is
the same as me, 158 centimeters tall,

33
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:31,853
her measurements from the top are...

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,532
Hey, stop! That's not fair!

35
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:34,733
And her bras are padded.

36
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,880
So she's actually a size...

37
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,050
Fine, fine! Stop! I'll do it for real, just shut up!

38
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:43,921
But it doesn't make any sense to do my
introduction before you hear Fiel's first.

39
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,242
Why, hello there, everyone, I'm Fiel Nirvalen,

40
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,977
and all of you except that hideous demon over there

41
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,615
can feel free to simply call me Fiel if you like.

42
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,094
Why, it seems you've already become prejudiced against me.

43
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:59,429
Have I done something to offend you, my dear?

44
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:01,153
Let's see.

45
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,230
I suppose it might have a little something to do
with the hundreds of thousands of my people slaughtered

46
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:10,346
by the hands of a certain filthy
Flugel during the great war...

47
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,281
or something like that.

48
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,129
Defendant Jibril, your plea?

49
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,593
Goodness, I don't know what to say.

50
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:20,404
See, this is what happens when
forest creatures learn magic.

51
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:23,818
If you dumb little animals hadn't put
an anti‐flight spell over your city,

52
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,527
I never even would have noticed you.

53
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,595
Your little trick brought nothing but tragedy.

54
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,398
I fell out of the sky and got a
big ouchy on my head, you know?

55
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:36,062
It's not my fault that you all ended
up dying for putting me in a cranky mood.

56
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,343
Judgment, the defendant Jibril is guilty.

57
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:40,497
Oh, poop!

58
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,536
Okay, since we're gonna work together,

59
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,098
I don't want any hard feelings.

60
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,393
What could Jibril do to help you forgive her?

61
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:50,309
Okay, I'm afraid that's a very difficult question for me.

62
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,460
Hey, Fiel...

63
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:52,032
Hmm?

64
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,544
We're going to need her power for Sora's plan to work.

65
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,521
Could you do it for me, at least?

66
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,666
All right, how about...

67
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,480
you lick my feet and say, "please forgive me,
M'lady Fiel," and then I'll consider pardoning you.

68
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,299
Huh? What's this?

69
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:11,750
You long‐eared, tree hugging mongrels certainly are cocky
considering how pitifully weak and easy to kill you are.

70
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:14,883
And the verdict, Jibril is guilty.

71
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,528
What now?

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,365
I seriously have to lick this
gross little monster's hooves?

73
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,571
Serve your sentence.

74
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,613
Okay...

75
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:28,921
This is the biggest pile of bull crap, but if
that's my master's order, then I have to obey.

76
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:33,100
Please forgive me, my lady Fiel.

77
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,991
Since you're so pathetic I suppose I must.

78
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,477
Wow, that went better than I thought.

79
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:42,290
My Master, licking this vulgar forest
turd's feet and having to apologize

80
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:45,270
is surely the ultimate humiliation, and yet, why?

81
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:49,663
Why, when I think that I'm doing it
because you ordered me to does it excite me so?

82
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,095
Tell me, Master...

83
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,098
Who is Blank that they're
capable of doing this to a Flugel?

84
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:55,537
Excuse me!

85
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,815
If we're talking about hard
feelings, then I have my share, too.

86
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,614
That girl used Elven magic to cheat against
me and I'm still super pissed off about it!

87
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,152
It's your fault for being a sucker.

88
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:10,098
Upon closer inspection, maybe he's just a bully.

89
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,025
Fiel is my childhood best friend,

90
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,544
but to be specific, she's also my owner.

91
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:18,386
Huh?

92
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,493
The kingdom of Elven Gard is a democracy, but
despite that fact, they maintain a social hierarchy

93
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,012
and promote the control of lower‐ranked races.

94
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,684
To put it bluntly, their society
revolves around a slave system.

95
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,734
You mean, Kurami is‐

96
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:33,711
That's right.

97
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:38,883
My family has been slaves of the Nirvalen
nobility since my great‐grandfather's era.

98
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:41,568
I was born and raised among Elves.

99
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:47,003
The Nirvalen is one of the most famous families in
Elven Gard and has served in the senate for generations,

100
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:50,157
but Fiel never seemed to care about my position.

101
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:51,619
Are you hungry?

102
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,956
Fiel, please don't be so nice to me anymore.

103
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:58,659
If you treat a slave like me as a
friend, then you might get in trouble.

104
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,539
But she did treat me as a friend.

105
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:02,153
That doesn't bother me.

106
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:06,126
Of course, in public, she can't
allow herself to show any signs of it.

107
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,382
To be honest, I think the whole idea of
slavery is rather cruel and unnecessary.

108
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,585
Since the last head of the
family passed away about a year ago,

109
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,619
Fiel is now their de facto leader.

110
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:20,442
So from the perspective of society, our
relationship has become even more complicated.

111
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,467
Wait a minute, Fiel!

112
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,636
Does that mean you're an acting senate member now?

113
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,534
And since your sort of plotting in secret to free
the slaves, wouldn't that make you guilty of treason?

114
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:29,443
Huh?!

115
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,566
I know, right?! It's like a huge deal!

116
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,300
Yeah, a huge deal you were
actually able to follow all that.

117
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,325
Oh, my God! I'm gonna pound you.

118
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,748
Are you sure you're okay with this, Fiel?

119
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,938
I mean, considering your position, aiding us could lead
to the destruction of Elven Gard society as you know it.

120
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:51,698
Oh, yes, I've already thought this through, and I'm
okay with anything so long as Kurami doesn't get hurt.

121
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:57,863
I honestly don't care in the slightest
what happens to my family or that kingdom

122
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:01,406
because they're a bunch of stuck‐up
pricks who can all die and rot in Hell.

123
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,577
Wow, Fiel, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?

124
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,454
Kurami's all I care about,

125
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:11,061
and I need to keep her very close
because she cries whenever I'm not around.

126
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,953
I don't cry! I never cried in my life.

127
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,939
Dude, When you lost that battle against me for
the crown you were bawling like a little baby.

128
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,959
No, no, no!

129
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:21,040
I did nothing of the sort! I did
not cry! I had something in my eye!

130
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,692
Oh dear, I was afraid that would happen.

131
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:24,494
Don't listen to them. I didn't cry.

132
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,755
Just because you've known me since I was a baby, doesn't
mean you can treat me like a kid forever, you know!

133
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,697
Kurami tries to push herself too hard.

134
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,165
Oh, there, there.

135
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:36,227
She seems kind of more like
her nanny than her best friend.

136
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,571
Oh, there, there.

137
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,288
Anyway, enough of this crap!

138
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,166
It's the Eastern Federation we've got
to start worrying about now, all right?

139
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:48,657
After their ruler, the Shrine Priestess came to power,

140
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,101
they became the third‐largest country
in the world in less than 50 years.

141
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:55,215
No one knows how great a threat they truly pose.

142
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:59,370
Also troubling is their mysterious
blood‐destruction ability.

143
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:03,429
Have you thought of some sort of plan to deal with that?

144
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:04,234
I'm on it.

145
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:08,333
But first, if we're gonna fight together, it's
crucial that we be on better terms with each other.

146
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,003
We need to strengthen our bonds as friends.

147
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,818
And the hands down best way to do that...

148
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,091
I'm not gonna take a bath with you, so forget it.

149
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,199
But how did you figure out my plan?

150
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,885
Give me a break, did that idiot seriously
forget that he gave me all his memories?

151
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,102
Too bad we walked all this way.

152
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:33,772
Kurami, it is very important to have a good
rapport with the people you'll be teaming up with.

153
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:34,894
Are you freaking kidding me?!

154
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:36,078
Yes, that's correct.

155
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,461
In the world we came from, a land called Japan,

156
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,258
there was a traditional ritual
for getting to know each other,

157
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,562
hanging out while naked!

158
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,839
I haven't used the pledges to force your will in my favor,

159
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:50,242
thus, my only hope is to rely on
the ways of traditional culture.

160
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,350
Seems to me that all you're relying on
is worldly desires and ulterior motives.

161
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:56,854
Jibril, please explain our ways to the girl.

162
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:02,167
Ahem, the concept of carousing while
naked dates to the Japanese civil wars when...

163
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,155
So as you can see,

164
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:10,049
because both the ancient Romans and the modern
Japanese shared this unique concept of a public bath...

165
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,847
the comics became an unlikely hit,
and its popularity grew nationwide.

166
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,793
Do you understand now, Kurami?

167
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,005
I'm not even sure what we're talking about anymore.

168
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:20,727
Don't worry about it.

169
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,419
I'll just go ahead and refuse for you, all right?

170
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:24,120
What? Uh...

171
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,250
This is what Kurami is really trying to say.

172
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:30,326
She doesn't want to take a bath because
she's self‐conscious about her tiny boobies.

173
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,644
Oh, my God!

174
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,797
Oh, it's fine, Kurami.

175
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:38,042
Don't worry, a woman's worth is not
determined by such itty, bitty trivial things.

176
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,688
Fine, I'll get in the bath!

177
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,473
If I do that then you'll get off my back, right?

178
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,228
Yeah, baby!

179
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:49,861
Don't we have any shampoo that
isn't so weird and degrading to use?

180
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:58,496
Kurami, what were you so worried
about? Your figure's just fine.

181
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,762
You wouldn't know 'cause I wear baggy clothes.

182
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:04,352
Master, did you predict that
something like this would happen?

183
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,329
But of course.

184
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,308
Fiel I mean, M'lady Fiel,

185
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:13,370
is the magic you're using on Kurami an illusion or
did she actually grow some tatas in the last 20 minutes?

186
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:15,047
Kurami, he figured it out.

187
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:19,314
I think it's rude to be using magic like this
when we're supposed to be bearing our true selves.

188
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:19,751
Oh...

189
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:23,500
But you said something about an alteration yourself.

190
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,224
How gracious of you to ask.

191
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,823
Is it possible to turn me into a girl?

192
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,143
Then I too would be able to bond
with you ladies without worrying about‐

193
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,963
Hey, what are you doing?! Stop it!

194
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,227
Why, I sure can!

195
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,761
Well, lets get cracking!

196
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,459
But it's permanent. so I won't be able to turn you back.

197
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:39,621
Is that okay?

198
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,888
Unacceptable.

199
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:45,055
Well, they certainly seem energetic, don't they?

200
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:49,849
And it's delightful to think that there's
still some Imanity foolish enough to challenge us,

201
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,315
wouldn't you agree, Ino?

202
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,565
Wholeheartedly, My Lady.

203
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,116
We shall soon see how well
their brash demeanor serves them.

204
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,184
You two have but one responsibility

205
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,918
I hope you are well‐prepared, Izuna.

206
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,117
Hey, Sora!

207
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:14,562
We didn't even get a chance to talk today.

208
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:17,056
Ugh, where the heck did he disappear to now?

209
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,536
Sora? Huh?

210
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:28,132
Wow, so your strategy is to read books in the dark?

211
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,966
Super awesome plan.

212
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,993
Honestly, this is Shiro's area of expertise.

213
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,568
It's pretty beyond me. I'm just here to keep her company.

214
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:38,207
So in the meantime, I'm just reviewing today's bath.

215
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:43,100
If you're expecting me to get all flustered
like that Steph weirdo, it's not gonna happen!

216
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:43,793
Too late, You're blushing.

217
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:46,461
And you've assumed the stance of a Steph.

218
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,871
You came to ask me if I think
we can win or not, didn't you?

219
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,874
Yes, I suppose I did.

220
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,197
I've reviewed your memories closely, and from what I've
seen, all your victories have been extremely close calls.

221
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:03,090
Like I said earlier, this time,
you're fighting the Eastern Federation.

222
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,800
You can't rely on chance. One misstep and you're doomed.

223
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,543
I don't think that you can win the same way again.

224
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:13,506
Okay, so I'll just have to avoid making any missteps.

225
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,613
Can you honestly be sure that
you won't make a single mistake?

226
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,051
No, that's impossible.

227
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,174
If it were just me, I'd screw up for sure, but, see,

228
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,478
Blank is a whole different matter.

229
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:25,971
Huh?

230
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,713
If I make a mistake, Shiro pulls through.

231
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,892
That way, the two of us safeguard each other.

232
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:32,566
Oh.

233
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:34,219
What's the matter?

234
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,547
Don't you want to be friends with me anymore, Kurami?

235
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,722
That's not it at all,

236
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:43,848
but if they find out about us, and something
bad happens to you, then I'd never forgive myself.

237
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,113
As long as we stick together,
you don't have to worry about that.

238
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:47,686
Huh?

239
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,752
If I ever make a mistake, I know
that you'll be there to help me out.

240
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,829
Kurami, it would be perfect if you were always by
my side, looking out for any mistake I might make.

241
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:01,214
Then I'd never have to worry
about losing the person I love.

242
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,249
That thing you said just now,

243
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,592
did you get that from my memories?

244
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:11,696
Maybe.

245
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,815
Anyway, the point you're trying to
make is that I wouldn't be doubting

246
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,797
you so much if I could see your
sister's memories along with yours.

247
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:18,718
I get it.

248
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,167
You've really found your wings, haven't you?

249
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:24,013
Hmm?

250
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:28,318
Hey, Shiro, they say anyone can change their fate.

251
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,491
I wonder if that's true.

252
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:35,790
It's a little cheesy and all,
but I think the sentiment is nice.

253
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,220
You should be proud of yourself.

254
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,579
Sh‐sh‐shut up!

255
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,233
It must be hard to have such a talented sister.

256
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,370
You've got your pride to think of.

257
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:45,595
Don't let it get you down, Big Bro.

258
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:47,334
Get out of here already!

259
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,710
If you stay in Elkia too long, people will talk.

260
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,309
Tomorrow's the day, isn't it?

261
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:52,142
Huh?

262
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:56,120
I want you to know I'll be rooting for humanity.

263
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,315
Of course you will.

264
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,317
You're human, too, you dummy.

265
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:08,906
Here he comes!

266
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,339
You've got some nerve, asshole!

267
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,897
Bastards like you don't deserve the crown!

268
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,582
Let's kick his ass!

269
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,259
W‐what?

270
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,436
I can't believe we're just leaving
through the front gate like this.

271
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:25,019
You two must be insane!

272
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,679
Can't you see the people are rioting?

273
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,007
Oh, I can see it.

274
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,603
I started it, after all.

275
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,383
Uh, what do you mean by that?

276
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:35,156
Well, looks like they made room for us, so no worries.

277
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,461
Let's head off, shall we?

278
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,842
First stop to visit Izuna's house!

279
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:39,557
Let's go!

280
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:43,107
Why are you ignoring me?!

281
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,350
Welcome, we have been expecting you.

282
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:02,264
Now then, while the game is being prepared,

283
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:04,631
we ask that you please wait here.

284
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,794
Okay, but don't forget to let the audience in.

285
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,437
You're still feeling up to this, right, Shiro?

286
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,121
All green here.

287
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,853
And how about you, Jibril?

288
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,410
I am an ultimate weapon.

289
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,928
How I feel has no relevance to the situation.

290
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:25,113
Simply say the word and I will
most graciously give you my all.

291
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,402
I don't feel too good.

292
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,963
Oh, by the way, Steph, remember that game
we played where I threw rocks at those birds?

293
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:35,663
Well, you still owe me something for losing that one.

294
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:40,811
Hey, Jibril, can you keep the Warbeasts from
hearing what we're talking about for a little while?

295
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:41,829
Certainly.

296
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:47,836
I can surround you and Dolly in a spirit
barrier to keep the sound from getting out.

297
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,641
All righty then, Steph.

298
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,763
I'm going to cast a very special spell on you.

299
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,957
Oh, no, I've got a bad feeling about this.

300
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:14,237
Now everyone, please take a seat in your designated booth.

301
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:25,938
Before we begin today, allow me to
review the contents of each party's pledge.

302
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:30,738
The Eastern Federation bets everything
it owns on the Lucia continent.

303
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:35,014
And the kingdom of Elkia bets its race piece.

304
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:41,695
In other words, all the rights of Imanity, their
territory, and everything they possess is on the line.

305
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:48,209
The game designated by the Eastern Federation is between
our chosen representative and the two rulers of Elkia,

306
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,100
along with their two attendants.

307
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,000
The game will be conducted with these five players.

308
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,669
Should the Eastern Federation win,
as is our custom,

309
00:17:56,755 --> 00:18:01,164
it will demand that all memories regarding
the contents of this game be forgotten

310
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,266
by the members of the opposing party.

311
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,644
This includes all of the players as
well as all Imanity viewing the game.

312
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:11,909
Also, the rules will not be
explained until the game has begun.

313
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:16,450
So then, once you hear the rules and
decide you do not want to participate,

314
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,909
the match will become null and
void and your memories of it wiped.

315
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,015
Are you absolutely certain you want to proceed?

316
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,551
Oh, yeah, sure, it all sounds great.

317
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:28,078
But there are two things I want to make clear first.

318
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:32,487
One, if we decide to default, all
we lose are the memories of the game.

319
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,391
If your true goal was to create some impossible game

320
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,730
so that you can wipe us clean of our
memories, you better give it up now.

321
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:39,518
Hmm...

322
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:44,554
And two, if we catch you cheating during
the game, it's grounds for an immediate loss.

323
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:48,153
Well, that's one of the ten pledges,
so I'm sure I don't have to remind you,

324
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,226
but I'll be watching.

325
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:54,168
Very well! I will interpret that as an
agreement and ask that you state the pledge.

326
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,488
Aschente!

327
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,222
Aschente. Thank you.

328
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:06,618
Let's do this, Izuna.

329
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,334
Hmm...

330
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,965
I won't lose to losers. Thank you.

331
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:21,802
Hey, there, Izuna...

332
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,407
Yes, what now, please?

333
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:27,092
When's the last time you really had fun playing a game?

334
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:27,578
Huh?

335
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,932
Now then, are all of you ready to begin?

336
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:34,854
Okay, Shiro, don't let go of my hand.

337
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:36,468
You neither.

338
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,280
All right, let's start this game up!

339
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,660
I sense the presence of magic.

340
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,544
Kurami Zell? What's she doing here?

341
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,104
And there's someone else.

342
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:06,012
Aw, you're trying to pretend you didn't notice.
But I saw your ears move when you felt my magic.

343
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:11,152
Fiel, it doesn't look like we'll be
able to interfere with the game from here.

344
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,355
Yes, it's okay.

345
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,261
I'm aware.

346
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,534
What's more important is the fact
that we're watching in the first place.

347
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:21,061
Right, so the Eastern Federation
can't use any obvious cheats.

348
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:25,638
Sora... I hope you know what you're doing.

349
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:30,938
So he's sharing information
with the Elves, then, little shit.

350
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:34,117
You think you're quite clever, don't you, boy?

351
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:39,629
But you're nothing more than a fool if you think the
Warbeasts would allow you to beat us at our own game.

352
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,994
Are you sure we're really going to be okay?

353
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,878
I have a feeling we might not win this one.

354
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:50,984
Come on, Steph, do you need me
to repeat what I told you earlier?

355
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:53,701
Don't you remember why I said I needed to start that riot?

356
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:56,052
Could you please not answer my
question with another question?!

357
00:20:56,441 --> 00:21:00,263
I need the people of Elkia to be angry
because I don't want an audience who's sure

358
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,462
that we can win this thing.

359
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,617
The way it is now, everyone is
watching us as hard as they can,

360
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:07,056
making sure we don't lose on purpose.

361
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,949
As a result, it's harder for the
Eastern Federation to use obvious cheats.

362
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:15,445
There's no more trusted observer
than someone who suspects you.

363
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,487
How very crafty of you, master.

364
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:21,562
I'm sure they're gonna try to
use as many tricks as they can,

365
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:24,066
and with their Warbeast abilities at their disposal,

366
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:27,163
we're gonna need an observant audience to watch our backs.

367
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:31,645
Victory will depend on how quickly we
can react to the expected and unexpected

368
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,291
and how we can use both to our advantage.

369
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:40,320
Uh, Jesus Christ!

370
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:43,744
Where in the world are we?

371
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:48,145
Well, I've never seen anything quite like this before.

372
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,420
It's so loud and colorful. Master, where are you...

373
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,347
Oh, dear, Master, what's wrong with you?

374
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,174
We're all doomed.

375
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,176
This is impossible.

376
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,749
Sorry, Imanity's finished.

377
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:05,816
Are you friggin' serious, after all that smack talk?!

378
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,414
I'm sorry, I didn't expect it to be set in Tokyo!

379
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,060
I can't do anything here! It's
our home and we're the away team!

380
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:13,794
We can't help you, I'm sorry.
Please handle this on your own.

381
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:16,589
We can't do it. Try to understand,
I'm so sorry. Please forgive us!

382
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,154
What the hell?

383
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,071
No doubt in my mind!

384
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,229
I believe in you, Shiro!

385
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,420
You can do it!
