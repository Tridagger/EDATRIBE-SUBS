1
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,060
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,823
a little girl was sent to an institution

3
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,664
before she was one year old

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,961
because of her super intelligence.

5
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,090
She would learn many new things there

6
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,600
like how to walk and how to speak.

7
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:33,510
It was then that she was introduced to games as well.

8
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:38,725
She was made to play many games
they called intelligence tests,

9
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:43,696
but they were so boring that she didn't
enjoy them no matter who she played with.

10
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,882
And then after two years had passed,

11
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,982
she was reunited with a woman
whom she was told was her mother...

12
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:55,652
as well is a boy who was seven years older than her.

13
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,870
The boy told The adults whatever they wanted to hear

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,345
and grinned at everyone with a fake, empty smile.

15
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:07,000
The girl said to him, the first words
she had spoken in a long, long time...

16
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:10,803
You seem so empty.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,317
So, you want to play a game?

18
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:45,579
Who's Sora?

19
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:48,136
Blank...

20
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,136
Blank does not..

21
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,820
Blank does not...

22
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,289
Oh, dear, you must've had a really bad dream.

23
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:13,761
I'll bring you a glass of warm milk. Does that sound okay?

24
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,293
No, no!

25
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,949
He was with me! He's always been with me!

26
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,292
That's why...

27
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,070
Shiro.

28
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,076
Shiro!

29
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,573
It's cold.

30
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,372
Master? That's where you were.

31
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:49,138
Dolly was panicking and said that you ran off
somewhere, so I was wondering what could have happened.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,227
Jibril.

33
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,457
Yes, can I help you with something?

34
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:55,024
Tell me the names of your masters.

35
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,655
Huh? Is this some sort of game?

36
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:58,379
I don't know why you would‐

37
00:02:58,404 --> 00:02:59,427
Answer me!

38
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,089
You are my only master.

39
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,623
Then who was it that made me your master?

40
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,346
Well, it was you, of course.

41
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,426
But... Then who told Stephanie to fall in love with them?

42
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,246
It was you, Mistress Shiro.

43
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:17,647
Who found out about the Eastern Federation's games?

44
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:21,775
You, Mistress Shiro, with the help of
what Dolly's grandfather left behind.

45
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,462
It was all you.

46
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:28,347
I was charmed by your unparalleled
brilliance right from the beginning.

47
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,929
That's why I decided to obey you, Master.

48
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,096
Obey me?

49
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,717
Yes.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,772
Only you, Mistress Shiro, Queen of
Elkia, and representative of Imanity.

51
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,484
So she's saying that there was somebody else besides her?

52
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:48,923
But there's no sign of this somebody.

53
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:54,191
I expanded my range of inquiry to the entire
city in addition to the castle to no avail.

54
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:59,790
Yeah, no one in the protest demonstration
seems to know anything about him either.

55
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,848
Yes, I was afraid of that.

56
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:07,912
It seems as though master must have
played a game with someone unbeknownst to us.

57
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,853
She then lost and had her memories altered.

58
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:14,979
That's impossible, there's no one who could...

59
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,296
The Eastern Federation.

60
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,798
Yes, they are capable of that.

61
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,548
Master?

62
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,087
Let's play a game.

63
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:28,885
Uh...

64
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:34,534
A game?

65
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:39,804
Yes, we can just bet the false memories
that have been implanted inside you, okay, Miss?

66
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,375
False memories?

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,561
And I know it's very rude to ask of you,

68
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,166
but would you please lose?

69
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:50,719
All right then, that's a check.

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,569
False memories.

71
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:56,273
But they... seem so real.

72
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,056
Are they true or not?

73
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:02,222
Is that why they're disappearing?

74
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:09,841
Shiro...

75
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:14,071
They say anyone can change their fate.

76
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:15,879
Wonder if that's true.

77
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,151
They're all...

78
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,084
all disappearing.

79
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:26,351
If someone decides they want to
fly, will they suddenly sprout wings?

80
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:30,321
I don't think so. You can't change what you are.

81
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:32,398
You can just change how you do things.

82
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:33,945
Sora?

83
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:36,199
You have to make your own way.

84
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,581
You have to create a way to
fly even while you stay the same.

85
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,311
That's how you survive.

86
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,776
Let's think of something together, okay,

87
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,492
a way to give you wings.

88
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,438
No need to hurry.

89
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:49,788
They're all...

90
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,067
fake memories...

91
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,666
all of them, lies.

92
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,998
If they disappear, I'll feel...

93
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:10,469
"You're... Blank"?

94
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,566
Master?

95
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,428
Blank does not...

96
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,787
Blank doesn't...

97
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,711
Blank does not...

98
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,604
Blank does not lose!

99
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:44,004
Why... did you win, Mistress Shiro?

100
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:47,432
He's real! Sora is real!

101
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:50,217
I know! I know he's real!

102
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,204
Shiro...

103
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,467
Master, please calm down.

104
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,540
He's real! He is real!

105
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,130
Just slow down, Master. Try
to think through this logically.

106
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,401
You're right.

107
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:03,756
I mean, it absolutely does make
more sense to think he doesn't exist,

108
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,538
but somehow I feel in my heart that he really does.

109
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,571
But Dolly, he doesn't.

110
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:14,585
Besides, I couldn't imagine you
losing. So it must be something else.

111
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,628
Oh, Steph.

112
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:17,391
Then where is he?

113
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,480
Yeah, he's gotta be here somewhere!

114
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,340
There must be some reason why this
happened, some reason why we can't remember.

115
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,534
Come now, you're being ridiculous,

116
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,733
This doesn't make sense.

117
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:27,814
Hey, guys?

118
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,133
What did we do yesterday?

119
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,413
Uh... yesterday?

120
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,374
I was busy dealing with the demonstrations.

121
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,743
After that, you played a game in the throne room.

122
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:38,637
That was the day before yesterday, the 19th.

123
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,371
Let me rephrase my question.

124
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,792
Do you remember where you were two nights ago?

125
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:47,480
Okay, let's see, now think, what
was I doing the night before last?

126
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,442
Well, um, I huh?

127
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,975
I can't remember.

128
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,103
Right, none of us can.

129
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,009
Huh...?

130
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,511
Now let me see.

131
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,267
Mmm!

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,953
Well, this is... different.

133
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,298
Well, Steph, do you like this or not?

134
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,753
Excuse me, how am I supposed to respond to that, exactly?

135
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:09,947
You don't like it?

136
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:12,616
Even though I made you fall in love with me?

137
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,747
Not really.

138
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,422
So you're saying that someone other than you
must have told you to fall in love with them, right?

139
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,870
Yes, it was my brother Sora who told her that.

140
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:25,906
Okay, but didn't you already decide
that he existed without this test?

141
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:29,917
Yeah, that's right, so why did you just
totally grope me if you already knew that?

142
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,675
I, uh... wanted to be sure.

143
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,146
Thanks a lot, Steph. You were a big help.

144
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:36,687
Oh, sure.

145
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,311
Then let's think hard about this.

146
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,495
If Sora actually exists somewhere,

147
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,276
then how could he have disappeared?

148
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:49,853
He wasn't just taken away. Our memories of both him
and the last day and a half have all vanished, too.

149
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:56,708
A large‐scale magic spell could conceivably do something
like that, but it would've left some traces of being cast.

150
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:00,092
What if it was a game?

151
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,022
A game?

152
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:05,677
What if the rules are altering our perception of reality?

153
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:08,270
It's possible because of the pledges.

154
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:13,481
Hmm, if the game involved Imanity's representative,
then I suppose it's possible that the rules

155
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,531
would be able to affect the entire race,

156
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:17,750
but it shouldn't work on Jibril, should it?

157
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,485
No, because Sora's my master now,

158
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,787
he should be my representative, too.

159
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,656
We can assume I'm under the same effects as well.

160
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:31,120
Okay, I guess that makes sense, but if that's the
case, then what kind of game are we talking about?

161
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,017
I don't know.

162
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,299
But I know what... Sora said to me.

163
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,296
You know that I believe in you.

164
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,420
Shiro, never forget the two of us are always one.

165
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,370
Sora would never leave me all by myself.

166
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:51,617
So...

167
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:55,447
Shiro, where are you?

168
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,515
You're still there, right, Shiro?

169
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,266
Sora?

170
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:01,904
Huh?

171
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,740
Would you just hold on to me somewhere,

172
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,466
anywhere that I can still feel?

173
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,757
I'm losing my mind in here.

174
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:14,663
Sora!

175
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,099
Shiro?

176
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,789
It's time to use every last brain cell I've got.

177
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,651
What's really going on here?

178
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,921
Come on, Sora trusted me with this.

179
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,741
I've got to try and use all the memories I still have.

180
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:38,597
Sora said that we're always together,

181
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,489
so he must be here somewhere.

182
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,374
And he said that the game is
always won before it even begins.

183
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,433
He was trying to prepare me for this.

184
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:58,291
He told me the two of us are not like comic book heroes.

185
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,930
No, I've got to think harder! Harder!

186
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:07,238
He said he was going to get the last piece we needed.

187
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:09,724
Get the piece we needed?

188
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:15,459
Then this game is to get us something we
need before we can face the Eastern Federation.

189
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,143
A tool? A strategy?

190
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,154
An observer. An Elf?

191
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,705
He's going to get an Elf, but how?

192
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:28,910
Challenge Elven Gard? Kurami?

193
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:32,065
No, Kurami doesn't believe in Sora.

194
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,328
She'd never agree to help us.

195
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,932
What if the game...

196
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:44,643
was to steal each other's being?

197
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:51,346
Shiro! Shiro!

198
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,681
A game to steal each other's existence?

199
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:57,674
That's right.

200
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:02,502
These 32 stones collectively make up your existence.

201
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:05,959
They're individually numbered
and ranked in order of importance.

202
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,081
Their priority is assigned to them by your subconscious.

203
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:12,876
So in other words neither of us can
consciously know which of these stones

204
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,985
constitutes which part of ourselves
until our opponent has taken it away.

205
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,521
What importance does your subconscious
place on that elf next to you?

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,318
Or your arms, legs, nerves, or memories, for that matter?

207
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:29,668
In the end, your very existence is taken
and no one will even realize that you're there.

208
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:31,896
In other words, you'll disappear.

209
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,372
Are you serious?

210
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,440
Uh‐huh.

211
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:39,711
Pledge number five, the challenged party
has the right to decide the rules of the game.

212
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:42,210
If you don't like it, the game is off.

213
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,687
What do you say?

214
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:44,728
Kurami.

215
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:50,520
Fiel, you realize this man is saying that
he's willing to bet Imanity's race piece?

216
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,555
We can't simply ignore that.

217
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:59,353
Look, honestly, I was sort of hoping that we'd
be able to possibly reconcile after what happened.

218
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:04,770
Oh, we can reconcile but to do that,
first you gotta trust me and give me that elf.

219
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,698
You know that's not gonna happen.

220
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,962
I guess you're right.

221
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:09,725
What exactly are you betting?

222
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,276
Let's say the winner gets the right
to make two demands of the loser.

223
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,152
One could, for example, make
the results of the game eternal,

224
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:20,038
erasing the other's existence permanently.

225
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:24,986
Then they could alter the memories of the
loser's partner to make them their ally instead.

226
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:29,641
So then what you want to do
here is bet not only our partners

227
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,334
but our existence as well?

228
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,312
That's right.

229
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,447
You are just insane.

230
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,734
Well, then, since I'm apparently out of my mind
already, I'll go ahead and impose one more important rule.

231
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:45,664
Sora?

232
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,334
Master?

233
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,162
Shiro, are you feeling okay?!

234
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,302
Sora!

235
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,553
Jibril?

236
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,255
How can I help you, Master?

237
00:13:56,725 --> 00:14:00,563
In a game, could you steal someone else's existence?

238
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,399
No, I don't think you could.

239
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:06,404
It's only possible in a fake world
like the one we used to play word chain.

240
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,278
What if an Elf helped you?

241
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,381
An Elf?

242
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,328
Those disgusting little forest creatures?

243
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:17,031
Why, during the great war, I easily
destroyed one of their capital cities‐

244
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,200
But could you?

245
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,079
I suppose it is possible.

246
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:25,584
Gross and weak as they are, those animals do
have some small measure of skill when it comes

247
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,822
to constructing complicated spells at least.

248
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,824
Then what you're saying is that this Sora guy
managed to erase his own existence by playing this game?

249
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:33,556
Yes.

250
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:37,483
But if he's been erased, then wouldn't it
mean the game's over and he's already lost?

251
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,500
What else could it mean otherwise?

252
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:44,950
Yeah, that's true, if he won, he would exist, and
we wouldn't be worrying about this in the first place.

253
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:47,970
What if it was neither of those?

254
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,782
You think the game's still being played now?

255
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:53,172
Mm‐hmm.

256
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:54,652
That can't be.

257
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,210
Jibril, see if you can detect any magic in this room.

258
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:01,705
I understand, Master.

259
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,424
I woke up here in this room.

260
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,466
Even though my brother and I sleep somewhere else,

261
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,095
this is where I woke up.

262
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:20,552
Sora always said he would never leave me alone.

263
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,131
You're right, magic is being used here.

264
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,547
But I can't tell from what exactly.

265
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,439
Okay, we just have to search
everywhere until we can find something!

266
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:38,022
Oh, dear, you just tripped over literally nothing, Dolly.

267
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:41,025
You aren't obligated to embarrass yourself.

268
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,149
How'd that happen? Something was there.

269
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,875
An Othello disc? Hmm.

270
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,546
That says "three" in the Elf language.

271
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,342
Why are there discs but no board?

272
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,074
Because they haven't been played yet.

273
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:00,865
If they're still here, then I can play.

274
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,307
Yeah, but even if that's the case,

275
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:09,471
all we have here are two sets of three discs. There isn't
any way for us to know if we're playing black or white.

276
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,502
It's simple. Sora said that we're one.

277
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,682
The two of us are one player,

278
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:19,411
and I'm still participating in this game.

279
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:22,368
This rule is very important.

280
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,598
Each of our partners will play in the game as well.

281
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,989
If one of us can't continue to play,

282
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,577
our partner can play for us.

283
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:34,582
That's why I still kept some memories.

284
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,618
Then can you see it, the playing board?

285
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,573
I can't.

286
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,244
But I... know what Sora would do next...

287
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:49,670
What is this? You're deliberately
trying to lose, aren't you?

288
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:53,667
No, I've set it up so I can still win like this.

289
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,670
How he would lead his opponent on.

290
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,874
Hmm? What happened? Are these were memories?

291
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,573
Does that mean you're making me
steal your memories to prove that

292
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:10,230
you're not using the magic
abilities of another race to win games?

293
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,466
That's not such a bad answer.

294
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,967
How he would tell me what he wants...

295
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,437
Now he can't continue the game.

296
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,139
I won then, I guess.

297
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,736
Then why is the game still here?

298
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:40,676
Huh? What is going on? Shouldn't the match have ended?

299
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,530
There's three left.

300
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:47,470
What parts of Sora do they represent?

301
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:51,757
How he would deceive his opponent, and then...

302
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,065
how he'd be able to win.

303
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:02,358
Sora, you're amazing.

304
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:05,052
Nobody would be able to figure this out.

305
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,849
Nobody but us.

306
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,346
Now I understand.

307
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,994
I know what parts of you are contained in these discs.

308
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,754
Three, the way to win this game.

309
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:29,402
Two, the absolute faith you have in your little sister.

310
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,219
And the last one...

311
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,834
everything I am to you.

312
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,024
Now please...

313
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:42,997
come back to me!

314
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,745
SORA!

315
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,099
Oh...

316
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,062
We did it.

317
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:23,278
Shiro...

318
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:28,878
Okay! You can punch me if you want!
Give me your best shot! Let me have it!

319
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,917
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

320
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:37,577
Sora! I should have come sooner!

321
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,340
I can't believe I actually forgot my master.

322
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,206
I'm still so confused.

323
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,145
Kurami!

324
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,471
Please wake up! Kurami!

325
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:52,340
Can you hear me? Oh, say something.

326
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:55,676
Now then, since I'm the victor,

327
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,602
it is time for me to make my demands.

328
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,248
Please, please I beg you, you can do whatever
you want with me, just don't hurt Kurami.

329
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,462
Yeah, whatever. Demand number one.

330
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:07,713
Please, no!

331
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,450
We keep a copy of the memories we stole
from each other and return the originals.

332
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:13,378
Huh?

333
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,917
Kurami.

334
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,910
Wait, what's going on?

335
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,802
They each get to keep the
memories they took from one another,

336
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,042
but they all get their own memories back as well.

337
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:30,684
Now Kurami Sora know everything about
each other so there's no need for distrust.

338
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:35,539
In other words, they can work together without
having to wonder about what the other's motivations are.

339
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,534
This is the last piece that he had been looking for.

340
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,877
Demand number two, I want you, Elf.

341
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:45,652
Fiel, I'm gonna reserve the right
to alter your memories as I please.

342
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,382
Wha...

343
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:47,743
Don't worry.

344
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:51,834
It's fine, Fiel. He only wants one thing from us.

345
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,004
If I'm not mistaken, you need us to spy for you.

346
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:56,864
Yeah, you got it.

347
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,342
Sounds like we're both on the same wavelength already.

348
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:02,059
But spies? What does he want us to spy on?

349
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:05,547
Mmm, oh, I'll tell you later.

350
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:08,510
After seeing what was in your head,

351
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,019
I changed my mind about you.

352
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,251
You can count on me.

353
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,533
You're amazing, Sora.

354
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,102
Hmm? Aren't I!

355
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:22,140
Tell me how proud you are of your
big brother. Come on, don't be shy now.

356
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:23,038
Mm‐hmm.

357
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,028
So proud of you. You're my hero.

358
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:31,357
Oh, shucks, when you put it like
that, it really makes me blush!

359
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,559
Oh!

360
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:33,693
Master?

361
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:38,803
Shiro... are you ready to do this?

362
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:40,336
Yeah.

363
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:44,466
I'll be standing by. Any time is okay.

364
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:46,285
Fiel...

365
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:48,318
Kurami...

366
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:56,161
Oh, my God, I was so scared! I'm never doing that again!

367
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:03,987
What's wrong with them? Are they okay?

368
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:07,569
They like to put on such a tough show all the time.

369
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:10,795
But they have a sensitive side, too.

370
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,251
All your base are belong to us.

371
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:51,142
Shut up!

372
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,946
I know all the memes, yay!
