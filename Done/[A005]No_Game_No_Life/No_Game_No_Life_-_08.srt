1
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:06,328
That's kind of ridiculously overdone.

2
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:09,927
Why would they ever need to
build something so absurdly huge?

3
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:12,883
They couldn't possibly be trying to
compensate for something, could they?

4
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:15,839
Okay, well, this was a nice little vacation

5
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:18,198
but could you please take me far away from this place now?

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,281
Hey, wait, this embassy's on foreign soil.

7
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:23,799
Yeah, yeah, but it was originally
our castle, too, you know.

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,359
But this is an invasion of their territory.

9
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:27,646
Just relax, I made an appointment already.

10
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:28,687
Hey there!

11
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,586
Greetings, Lord Sora and Lady Shiro.

12
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,032
Welcome to our embassy.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,919
I'm the assistant ambassador to
the Elkian embassy, Ino Hatsuse.

14
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:39,777
A pleasure to meet you.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,073
Wait, when did...

16
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:41,773
This morning.

17
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:46,626
I could see the old dude checking me out in
the library, so I signaled to him I'd come over.

18
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,949
Man, just like they say, those
Warbeast senses really are awesome.

19
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:53,057
It's like they've got telescopic vision.

20
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,200
You could've told me about this, you know.

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,839
Undoubtedly the reason for your visit
is to meet with Ambassador Izuna Hatsuse.

22
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:01,299
Is that correct?

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,914
It looks like the rumors really were true.

24
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,741
The Warbeasts can read people's minds.

25
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,372
Glad to hear we're all on the same page.

26
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:10,729
Right, let's get moving.

27
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,266
Very well.

28
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,339
This way, if you please.

29
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,049
Forget about the Warbeasts.

30
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,964
How did Sora see him from way over there?

31
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,539
In case you hadn't noticed...

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,532
Uh...

33
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:30,084
The game...

34
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:33,237
it's already begun, hasn't it?

35
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,149
Hey, Jibril?

36
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:27,181
Yes?

37
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,770
What do you guys call this?

38
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:31,288
It's an image display device.

39
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:35,015
But wait, the Warbeasts can't use magic,
so I don't know how they're doing it.

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,178
My, but it is rather fascinating!

41
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:38,919
Cool.

42
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:44,534
What's going on? Why have the floor moving?

43
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:49,554
Pardon, but I beg you follow proper
procedures when making an appointment next time.

44
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:54,876
Due to an incident, many Warbeasts
harbor extreme animosity toward Elkia.

45
00:03:55,156 --> 00:04:00,382
Since you arrived so quickly, most weren't
informed and may not act entirely... civil.

46
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,650
Well, that makes sense, I mean, a dog that
talks and walks is still just a dog, right?

47
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:07,367
Hey, Steph, what incident?

48
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,315
Yeah, he's referring to the Construction Wars.

49
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:13,906
Having a foreign embassy bigger than
our palace was really bad for our image,

50
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:16,282
so we ended up building a new bigger one.

51
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:18,444
That's the one we live in now, right?

52
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,956
No, 'cause after that, the Eastern Federation built
their embassy even bigger, so we had to keep competing.

53
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,921
But when it comes to construction technology,

54
00:04:26,953 --> 00:04:29,312
Elkia lags way behind the Eastern Federation, so...

55
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,458
Isn't that ironic?

56
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:35,255
If I recall, the Warbeasts are only ranked 14
themselves, so looking down on Imanity is... well,

57
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:39,934
I'm not sure how your people say it, but we
say it's like a moron laughing at an imbecile.

58
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,166
That may be true in a sense,

59
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:46,623
but it seems a bit petty coming
from someone from the sixth order.

60
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,340
Speaking of which, as a weapon, I fear you're defective

61
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,383
if you're serving a bunch of shaved monkeys.

62
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:56,220
Okay, guess relations in this
world are pretty strained, huh?

63
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:59,053
The war dragged on forever,
and thanks to the ten pledges,

64
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:03,186
they can't get violent, so they ended up
letting out their aggression this way instead.

65
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:12,023
My lords, please wait here.

66
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,675
Each culture certainly has its own style, huh?

67
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,188
Master, you never told us how
you make contact with the Warbeasts.

68
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,761
Nobody's talking about it, so just take the hint, okay?

69
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,197
I apologize for prying, master.

70
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,514
But I can't read minds like the beasts here

71
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,762
and I really, really want to know.

72
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:39,163
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell
me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

73
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,030
Hmm?

74
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:46,796
So even with your little magic rectangle,
you still couldn't see him clearly,

75
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:50,524
but you guessed that he saw you and
gestured to him accordingly, is that right?

76
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,226
Don't tell me you bluffed someone who can read minds.

77
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,142
I apologize for the wait.

78
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:01,861
Presenting the Eastern Federation's
ambassador to Elkia, Miss Izuna Hatsuse.

79
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,490
Erase time!

80
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,453
Pretty girl with animal ears, want to come play with me?

81
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,424
I'm a little bit of a perv, but I've got a clean record.

82
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,826
Why the hell are you assholes touching me, please?

83
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,041
What?!

84
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,665
Minus 50 cuteness points for sure.

85
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:21,207
Who said you shitheads could stop? Thank you.

86
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,544
You popped out of nowhere and surprised me is all, please.

87
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:27,235
Commence the petting, peasants, thank you.

88
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,620
Uh...

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,182
Adding "please" and "thank you" at the end of a
sentence doesn't automatically make it polite, you know.

90
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,320
Of course it does, you idiot, thanks.

91
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,957
I apologize if she has offended you.

92
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,577
My granddaughter's still getting
a grasp of the Imanity language.

93
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,931
Oh, and by the way...

94
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:51,446
Keep your filthy monkey paws off of her, you
hairless primates, or I'll rip you a new asshole!

95
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,384
Or that's what I would say if you weren't so charming.

96
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,656
So I guess she gets it from the old fart, huh?

97
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:59,467
He's a bad accessory. Minus 1,000 points.

98
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:02,254
But I just love her conflicting personalities.

99
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,823
Plus 1,050 points.

100
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,229
You hairless monkeys do that way better than grandpa.

101
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:07,907
Please, keep going. Thank you.

102
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:10,648
Look, why don't we give the whole monkeys thing a rest?

103
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,325
I'm Sora. That's my little sister Shiro.

104
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,302
Nice to meet you, Izuna.

105
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:18,410
Sora and Shiro, got it. Please, thanks.

106
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:23,241
Well, then, let us hear what you
feces‐tossing apes have to say.

107
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,862
I thought you could read our minds.

108
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,539
This is a place of diplomacy,

109
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,120
a place to exchange ideas.

110
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,950
Or is that too complicated for
you knuckle‐dragging gorillas?

111
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,649
Don't get pissed.

112
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,561
She just likes us better, Pops.

113
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,317
He's so immature.

114
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:39,526
Master, I advise you to be careful not to
shatter the Warbeast's fragile, dainty heart.

115
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:42,420
He's so pathetic, we wouldn't
want to hurt his little feelings.

116
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,019
Didn't anyone teach you people manners?

117
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,888
All right, gramps, I'll tell you what we're here for.

118
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,924
How about we play a game, and you
bet your granddaughter's panties?

119
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,228
And I'll put up Steph's for my bet.

120
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,077
Hmm?

121
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:03,861
If you wanted me to roll you in a rug and beat to
death, You Should Have Just Said So, You Damned Monkey!

122
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:06,215
What? You'd rather have Jibril's than Steph's?

123
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,241
Certainly, as you wish, my master.

124
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,267
Don't tell me you want Shiro's.

125
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,952
Come on, gramps, that's sick. She's only 11 years old.

126
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,541
No, don't tell me.

127
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,538
You don't want mine, do you?

128
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,212
Sorry, but I don't swing that way.

129
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,575
It's okay, Sora,

130
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,027
I'll protect your chastity.

131
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,402
Too many choices or what?

132
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,355
Her panties are a pretty good deal for you, old‐timer.

133
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,399
Please excuse me, but if you refuse to tell us
why you're really here, then maybe it's best...

134
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,245
Drop the pathetic act already.

135
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:33,974
Hmm?

136
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:38,811
If you can read thoughts like you say,
then I'd suggest you go for the panty game.

137
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,966
Look, I know it's not the panties you're after.

138
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:47,099
It's just a low stakes match, and a good chance
to wipe away all my memories about your games.

139
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,347
So let's shake on it.

140
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:51,755
Oh, second‐guessing, huh? Looks like I was right.

141
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,860
Smells to me like cold reading,

142
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:58,230
cheap parlor tricks that don't even
need the amazing senses of a Warbeast,

143
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,042
just some observational skills and a bit of intuition.

144
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,824
Coincidently, that just so
happens to be a specialty of mine.

145
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,199
Is he...

146
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:12,508
So you done confirming this isn't a bluff yet?

147
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,602
Now then, since we've established that
your so‐called mind‐reading ability

148
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,160
is a bunch of crap, let's get down to business.

149
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:25,052
Like why we really paid you a visit.

150
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:32,313
We, Sora and Shiro, designated representatives of
the 16th order of Imanity in the kingdom of Elkia...

151
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:39,432
Have blessed the Eastern Federation with the
opportunity to become the first honorable sacrifice

152
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,363
on our path to world domination.

153
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:45,216
Therefore, we hereby challenge you

154
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,353
to a game between nations.

155
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,764
And we demand everything the Eastern
Federation has on this continent.

156
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:57,872
A game between nations?

157
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,018
So you mean we're officially
attacking the Eastern Federation?

158
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,697
Did I really just hear you correctly?

159
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:06,628
Yep, and by the way, we're not changing our bet.

160
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,131
It's still for Steph's panties.

161
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:12,232
Should have just bet Izuna's
panties while you had the chance.

162
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,319
Sorry, Gramps, them's the breaks.

163
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,854
And that's a check.

164
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:20,532
Master, could you please
explain the madness going on here?

165
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,408
What's wrong, Jibril? You still don't understand?

166
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:26,530
Basically, we've got the Federation backed into a corner.

167
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:29,849
Over the last 50 years, their
technology evolved pretty rapidly,

168
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,630
and they grew more and more powerful,

169
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:36,628
but despite being so advanced, they're still an
island nation that needs resources from the mainland.

170
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,560
Before they could even set foot on the main continent,

171
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,214
Elven Gard attacked, or perhaps they were lured in.

172
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:49,173
Either way, no other country would agree to play an
unknown game that even the strongest nation kept losing.

173
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,437
The Federation couldn't get onto the continent.

174
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:54,359
They should have just lost so
more countries would challenge them,

175
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,490
but for some reason, they didn't.

176
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,215
Let's solve these mysteries in order, shall we?

177
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:00,971
Question one!

178
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,195
Why do they wipe all memories of the game?

179
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,024
If they don't, they won't be able to win every time.

180
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,663
Correct! It defeats the goal of luring others into play.

181
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,261
Even though it's not entirely logical,

182
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:15,247
they wipe memories because there's
something they're trying to keep secret.

183
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,982
But still, you can erase people's memories

184
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,864
but not the fact that they lost.

185
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:21,771
Question two!

186
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,258
Why'd Elven Gard challenge them four times?

187
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:27,928
They knew that they might lose, but they
wanted to figure out what the game was.

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,771
Unlike Elkia, Elven Gard is a really big country.

189
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:34,230
They were prepared to suffer
some losses to do their research.

190
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:38,662
After their first loss, they figured it must
have been a game where you couldn't use magic.

191
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:41,897
An Elf would think that was the
most likely reason they'd lose a game.

192
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,432
So they came up with some kind of countermove

193
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:46,957
and challenged a second time and lost again.

194
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,662
Then they played a third time.

195
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,153
I'm not sure how, but they figured something out.

196
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,111
So they went back to using their official cheats they
call magic and made their fourth and final challenge,

197
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,995
and they lost again.

198
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,483
That's quite an imagination you have.

199
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:05,644
In any case, I'm not too concerned with the way they lost.

200
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,464
What I want to know is why they stopped after four games.

201
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:13,062
If you think all that's just my imagination, that's cool.

202
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,431
I mean, you're old and kind of grumpy. I get it.

203
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,472
I see two options.

204
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:21,494
The first‐ they realized the game was impossible to win.

205
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:25,242
And then the Elves could've exposed the cheating and won.

206
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:30,358
Or second, they learned the tricks of the game
but could never figure out why they kept losing.

207
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,711
So that's why the Elves stopped challenging them.

208
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:36,683
But still.

209
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:40,291
Now that's odd. So what do we have here?

210
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:44,792
You were able to figure out the game,
but you have no idea why you kept losing.

211
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,852
Starting to get good, party people!

212
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:48,742
Time for question three!

213
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:52,088
What works equally well on these very different races?

214
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:56,600
What game would be a guaranteed win made
by technology only the Federation would have?

215
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,865
And the answer is?!

216
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:02,555
They made a video game where you can cheat all you want.

217
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,362
They made a video game?

218
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,199
What the hell is a video game?

219
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:08,335
I doubt that you'd know, Steph, but, Jibril,

220
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:13,229
you challenged the Eastern Federation once already, so how
come you'd never seen that thing at the entrance before?

221
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:15,112
Uh, well,

222
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,149
I guess that's because...

223
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,758
Because you'd forgotten it.

224
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,706
It's a memory associated with the game.

225
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:25,369
Still, despite all that, if a Flugel
like Jibril doesn't know anything about them,

226
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:29,104
it's pretty safe to say the Federation is
the only country in the world with video games.

227
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,935
You erased the memories to keep the games a secret.

228
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:35,689
Because guess what everyone in a
video game where you're the game master,

229
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,133
you can keep cheating your
ass off till the cows come home.

230
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:41,314
And your opponent, who's busy
running in circles, stays clueless.

231
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,952
Plus, if you don't even know what
cyberspace is, then magic's pointless.

232
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,063
All that mind‐reading garbage is just a
cover story so your opponents won't look closer

233
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,806
and find out you're cheating, right?

234
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:53,524
Hang on, we're almost done here.

235
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,637
So you can tell when someone's lying,

236
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:58,584
but there's no way you can read their mind.

237
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,009
And the final question is?

238
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,009
Golly!

239
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,219
How in the world were they able to figure all this out?

240
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,913
The answer's on the house,
pops. Do you care to take a guess?

241
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,472
Don't tell me it was the former king.

242
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,007
We made him swear by the pledges to tell no one,

243
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,130
but even he didn't realize we couldn't read minds.

244
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,194
No, that's not the problem here.

245
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:23,055
Right, that's not the real problem.

246
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:28,133
You made the former king promise not to speak
about the games to anyone, but since he did,

247
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:30,945
it proves you couldn't read his mind. How?

248
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,328
'Cause he pledged to tell no one so long as he lived.

249
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:37,548
That doesn't mean he couldn't tell anyone after he died.

250
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:43,330
So now that we know all about your devious game,
are you starting to get a little worried, Old Man?

251
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:47,493
'Cause if you're not, Gramps, we'd be happy to go
to the Elves and tell them all about your tactics,

252
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,026
and you'd be forced to play them all over again,

253
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:51,972
and you'd lose.

254
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:55,397
At this point, it's in your best
interest to erase our memories.

255
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,091
But if you're prepared to bet your
territory just for Steph's panties,

256
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:02,284
then I guess that means my imagination must be correct.

257
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,283
Damn it.

258
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,075
Then that means...

259
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,219
Your only other option is to claim
my theory is just a load of crap

260
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:11,055
and run away from our challenge, right, Old Man?

261
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,497
But you said you could run away?

262
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,578
I'll make it worth your while.

263
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,888
I'll throw in all of Imanity.

264
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:18,470
Huh?

265
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:19,630
Huh?

266
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,961
And Imanity's race piece!

267
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:28,414
K‐Kurami? Why is‐

268
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:29,467
Listen, Fiel.

269
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,259
Do you know of any games in the past

270
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,453
where someone bet a race piece?

271
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,552
Of... of course not, never.

272
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,760
If you bet your race piece and lose,

273
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:40,112
then you also lose all your rights as an Exceed.

274
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:40,947
That means...

275
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,029
That the ten pledges no longer apply.

276
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:45,507
In other words, we're no better than animals.

277
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:48,621
It's like a death sentence for all of Imanity.

278
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,353
That son of a bitch!

279
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,930
Sora, are you insane?

280
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:58,181
I've bet our entire territory and put
the lives of all Imanity on the line.

281
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:03,734
If you try to back out now, that's like telling
the entire world that my imagination was correct.

282
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,352
Bet you didn't see that coming, did you,

283
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,654
Mr. Freakin' Mind Reader?

284
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:12,369
Check and mate.

285
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,177
Are you sure you want to do this?

286
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:21,767
Even if you're correct, keep in mind
Elven Gard still lost this game four times.

287
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:25,009
Plus you dare bet your precious race piece?

288
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,202
Do you want your people to go extinct?

289
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,655
Say, Old Fart,

290
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,668
remember when I flagged you down from the library?

291
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,138
Maybe if you'd thought about how we could do that,

292
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:38,150
you'd have realized that the
two of us are not from this world.

293
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:45,412
When it comes to video games, you can use as
many cheats or assists as your heart desires.

294
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,811
None of that will help you.

295
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,582
Blank will never lose to anything like that.

296
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,316
When we showed up here...

297
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:55,811
Did you really think we would
just roll over like easy prey?

298
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,951
Now it's your turn to be the hunted, Warbeast friend.

299
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,432
Who the hell do these two think they are?

300
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,071
Well, guess you can't agree to a
game of this scale on your own, right?

301
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:10,750
We can do this another day.

302
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:14,187
We're betting our race piece, so
all of Imanity has the right to watch.

303
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:17,423
The four of us are ready, and we're
not gonna let you squirm out of this.

304
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:17,957
But wait...

305
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,892
I don't really get any of this, thanks.

306
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,167
But, Sora, and Shiro, sounds like you
buttwads challenged me to a fight, so thanks.

307
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,019
A fight? No way.

308
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,950
Izuna, let's play a game next time, okay?

309
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,239
I won't lose to losers, thank you.

310
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,296
Sorry to disappoint, but you will.

311
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:38,403
Everyone knows, Blank never loses a game.

312
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,325
See you soon, Little Izuna.

313
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,348
You idiots, what the hell were you thinking?!

314
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,714
Do you realize what you've done? And what if you lose?

315
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,106
What the heck are you gonna do?

316
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:55,731
I don't know.

317
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,609
If we lose, we're pretty much
done for, so what else is there?

318
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,765
I know if we lose, it's game over
for us and three million people,

319
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:05,838
but if we win, we get the animal girls and their land.

320
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:07,021
Not too shabby, eh?

321
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,306
Isn't it so exciting, Shiro?!

322
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,498
It's so exciting.

323
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:12,734
What... What's wrong with you two?

324
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:13,958
Just relax, Steph.

325
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,612
It's just a game, right?

326
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:17,699
I knew it.

327
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:21,681
It was stupid and naive of me to entrust
these people with my grandfather's hopes.

328
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:24,105
If it bothers you, Dolly, then consider this‐

329
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:29,284
if the Masters win, every Warbeast on the planet
will be stripped of their land and also their rights

330
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:30,738
and possibly face death.

331
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,614
Who do you think should take responsibility for that?

332
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:38,459
We rule each other and kill each
other through games instead of violence.

333
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,034
The losers are exploited, enslaved, and killed.

334
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,261
That's the essence of the ten pledges,

335
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:50,305
being daring enough not just to risk your
own life but also the lives of all your people

336
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,277
just for the tiniest opportunity to defeat your enemy.

337
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:56,193
Those are the qualities we need in a ruler.

338
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,076
Huh? Say what now?

339
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:00,531
What?

340
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:03,415
Don't tell me you guys haven't figured it all out yet.

341
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,187
The way to win, the way to beat this world.

342
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,198
The way to win and beat this world?

343
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,692
Well, now I see why God gets so bored of this place.

344
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,908
Poor Tet. I feel sorry for him.

345
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:17,484
Don't worry, guys, we'll conquer the hell out
of this world as promised, the whole damn thing.

346
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,101
We won't lose.

347
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,825
There's no point in even
planning for that sort of outcome.

348
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,129
No chance of us losing, you got me?

349
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,910
And that's checkmate.

350
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,761
Come out here, you stupid kids!

351
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:44,750
My, how quickly their attitudes
have changed almost overnight.

352
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:47,683
How do you think you'd feel if you
were suddenly given a death sentence?

353
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:51,066
I think it's actually pretty
strange that they're acting this calm.

354
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,109
Are you going to do anything to quiet them down?

355
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,488
If they were that mad, they could
try and take the throne back from us.

356
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,639
It's just a bunch of whining,

357
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,428
and I doubt any of them have the guts to challenge us.

358
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,271
More importantly, what's the hold‐up?

359
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,384
It's been a week already.

360
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:08,627
You mean why the Federation hasn't
picked a date for the game yet?

361
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,806
With their whole country at stake,
I'm sure it will take some time.

362
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,092
Yeah, I figured as much.

363
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:17,516
I'll just wait for someone with
more of a backbone to show up.

364
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,724
Uh, huh?

365
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,767
Looks like they're finally here.

366
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,268
Kept me waiting long enough.

367
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,171
Yeah, of course I know what you guys want.

368
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,647
I'm ready when you are.

369
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,649
Shiro, listen up, 'kay?

370
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:39,061
You know that I believe in you.

371
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:43,519
Yeah, I know. I believe in you too, Sora.

372
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:47,643
Shiro, never forget the two of us are always one.

373
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,552
The two of us are bound by a promise.

374
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:56,142
Shiro, we're not the heroes of some stupid kid's manga.

375
00:20:56,676 --> 00:21:01,020
Shiro, we've always won the game before it's even started.

376
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,316
Sora?

377
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:07,242
I'll get the last piece to beat the Federation, okay, Sis?

378
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,103
Sora?

379
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,804
No! W‐wait!

380
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:18,364
Let's get this game started, shall we?

381
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,773
Sora?

382
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,038
Shiro, rise and shine.

383
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,665
What's the matter? Hey, what's wrong, Shiro?

384
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:07,044
Sora? Where are you?

385
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:11,374
Come help, please! You can't leave me here alone!

386
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:14,543
Shiro, who are you talking to? Who's this Sora guy?

387
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,563
Do you want me to go find him for you?

388
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,797
No way.

389
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,293
No way!

390
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,312
Shiro, is everything okay?

391
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,371
Steph?

392
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:33,643
Where's Sora?

393
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,377
Where is he?

394
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,561
My brother?

395
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:40,244
Brother?

396
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:43,605
You have a brother?

397
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,103
And his name's... what again?

398
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:50,485
I won't let go of your hand, Sora.

399
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,894
It would feel like my soul was leaving me.
