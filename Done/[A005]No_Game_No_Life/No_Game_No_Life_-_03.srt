1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,055
Your attention, everyone.

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:08,520
Having won all of her games thus far in the
tournament, Kurami Zell awaits her next opponent.

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:11,070
Is there anyone left who is up to the challenge?

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,676
Sora, wait, you can't be serious.

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,138
You're gonna crash the coronation?

6
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,386
Hey, I just scored a new life in this world.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,500
I can't lose my place to live that quickly.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,287
Yeah, but...

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:27,897
Now then, I think it's time for me to
become king and take back our lost territory!

10
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,562
If there are no other challengers,

11
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:16,432
I shall proceed with the former King's final
wish and crown Kurami Zell as our new ruler.

12
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,195
Should anyone wish to protest, speak now‐

13
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,603
Objection!

14
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:22,772
You heard me!

15
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,989
Objection!

16
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:30,565
So, are you saying that you
request to be her next challenger?

17
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,209
Yep.

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,414
Despite your loss, you're still desperate enough
to win that you're sending your butler after me?

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,093
In case you hadn't noticed, Little
Princess, this isn't a playground.

20
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:45,154
Yeah, and it's not the place to hand
over the throne to some con artist either,

21
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,244
especially one who's getting help from another country.

22
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:51,660
Well, Shiro?

23
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:52,653
There's one.

24
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,632
Anyone else hiding their ears?

25
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:55,457
Nope.

26
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,207
That strange device, they used it before.

27
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,162
And just what do you mean by that?

28
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:05,270
Oh, come on now, let's say, for example,

29
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:08,074
if the crown was given to
someone in cahoots with the Elves,

30
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,791
Elkia would be pretty much screwed, right guys?

31
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,851
What exactly is the meaning of this?

32
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,266
So what, is this your pathetic
attempt at accusing me of cheating?

33
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,269
Calm down. I clearly said "for example."

34
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,432
Or maybe it actually rings a bell for you, huh?

35
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:28,300
Fine then, since you've made your objection,

36
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,390
I suppose I'll have to humor you with a game,

37
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,292
is what you want?

38
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,245
Yay! Thanks, Madam. I'd really appreciate that.

39
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,688
But, but Miss.

40
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:37,053
One thing, if we're playing poker again,

41
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,837
maybe this time, you should ask your friend to leave.

42
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,086
I'm sorry to have to do this, but...

43
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:45,168
There's an elf here! What the hell's going on?!

44
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,550
So these two witches were working together?!

45
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,697
Nothing to say?

46
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,939
The pretty swindler's gonna abandon her partner in crime?

47
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,249
How cruel.

48
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:55,849
I get it.

49
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,015
So you've teamed up with some random elf

50
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,034
to try to make me out to be
an enemy of Imanity, is that it?

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,982
Pretty good deflection, I must admit.

52
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:07,946
Perhaps it's best you left. Elves have no place here.

53
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,134
There. You satisfied?

54
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,343
Ready to play now?

55
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,344
Sure am.

56
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:17,404
As you're likely aware as stated by the pledges,

57
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,863
I get to decide the game.

58
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:22,407
But no need to worry. I'll choose
a game where cheating is impossible.

59
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,863
Pledge number five,

60
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:27,475
the challenged party has the right
to decide the content of the game, huh?

61
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:29,827
Dang, no poker this time?

62
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,615
Well, since I'm such a nice guy,

63
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,394
I won't bother asking about your reasons.

64
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,394
Say cheese!

65
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,015
Hmm.

66
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:38,162
Wow, you're not really photogenic.

67
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,926
If you smiled once in a while, you'd be a lot cuter.

68
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,682
We'll hold the game in another venue.

69
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,717
I'll call for you once it's prepared.

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,778
Wait, you're telling me she used magic to beat me?!

71
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,852
Hey, will you keep it down a little bit?

72
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,443
That's right, Shiro and I both noticed
when we saw your game at the tavern.

73
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:57,778
Don't you mean I noticed?

74
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,477
Don't sweat the small stuff, Sis.

75
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:03,918
So that's what it does then, that special secret
tool of yours is for detecting magic, isn't it?

76
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:07,000
So how'd they do it? What kind of magic did that Elf use?

77
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,675
No idea, sugar pants.

78
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,410
Magic's amazing, isn't it?

79
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:14,962
If you could change cards when they're
face‐down, we could never prove it.

80
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,941
Under normal circumstances, there's
essentially no way to beat her.

81
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:22,044
Why do you think we didn't challenge her before?

82
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:25,711
Look, Steph, I'll break it
down as simply as I can for you.

83
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,764
First of all, this round‐robin style tournament
to become king is pretty jacked up to begin with.

84
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,017
Let's say a country partners up with an
Imanity with the promise of becoming king.

85
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,295
From there on, they can manipulate the games.

86
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:43,062
They'll play against other Imanities who also
can't detect magic, so it's a guaranteed win.

87
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:47,488
Now that they've got a puppet king, they can
pretty much do whatever the heck they want with Elkia.

88
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:50,434
The plan's so simple, even a baby could've dreamt it up.

89
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,177
But then, guess what the other countries start thinking.

90
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:57,815
So what do you think we should do now?

91
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,619
There's nothing to worry about.

92
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,320
He's just another Imanity.

93
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,607
Even if he's probably getting
help from another race, so am I.

94
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,799
It's not like I didn't expect this.

95
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:12,161
Kurami, do you really think you'll be
able to handle playing the games without me?

96
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:14,841
I'll be fine.

97
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:20,012
So you really think it's possible that Kurami
has convinced herself that we're getting help

98
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,188
from another race?

99
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:24,066
Yeah, by now she probably realizes

100
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,925
that Elkia is caught in a
diplomatic war between other nations.

101
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,342
Then we're in luck. She can't use magic again
since she'll think other races will be watching,

102
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,280
ah‐ha!

103
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:36,642
So she'll have to play fair and square, and
it'll be impossible for her to cheat using magic!

104
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,819
It's all sunshine and flowers in your head!

105
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,146
Just crush my optimism, why don't you?

106
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,735
I'm sure they expected it.

107
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,587
Another country was bound to intervene.

108
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,875
But I'll bet this time, they'll use
some spell or mind trick we can't detect.

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,022
If we can't even spot their regular
tricks, then we're totally doomed.

110
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:55,486
They'll lay out a game that looks fair on the
surface so it doesn't seem completely hopeless.

111
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,745
But they won't use their magic directly on
us, like screwing with our vision or memories,

112
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,374
because it'll be too obvious.

113
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:04,433
In other words, it won't be completely impossible to win.

114
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,800
So is that supposed to make me feel better?

115
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,089
As long as there is some path
to victory, no matter how small...

116
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,917
Then you can bet your sweet fanny that Blank won't lose.

117
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:14,410
There you go.

118
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,237
Hmm?

119
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,355
Let me be honest with you guys.

120
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:25,937
The only reason I struck a deal with the
Elves was to secure a place for Imanity to live

121
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,408
after I've won the tournament.

122
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,840
Once we've acquired a fair amount of territory,

123
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,699
I'll cut ties with the Elves for good.

124
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,558
Oh, jeez.

125
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,675
Oh, jeez.

126
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,673
I know she's dumb, but you
didn't have to say it out loud, Sis.

127
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:41,089
So you know, we might be spies, and yet
you're still telling us your plan‐ cuckoo!

128
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:44,142
Think about it, the only way for us to survive

129
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,519
is to win the right to live under the
protection of a powerful nation, give up on games,

130
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:49,941
and close off our borders.

131
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:53,396
There's no other choice, right, Little Princess?

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,899
You of all people should understand that.

133
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,353
Well, I‐

134
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,770
What's more, Elven Gard currently
comprises the largest nation in the world,

135
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,675
and not a single race has been able to defeat their magic.

136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,828
It's impossible for you to beat me,

137
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,586
so it's in your best interest
just to withdraw from the game.

138
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:13,406
I swear to all Imanity that I won't
let the Elves make me their puppet.

139
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,043
Sora...

140
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,148
Okay, not a bad plan.

141
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,754
We live quietly under another nation's wing.

142
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,432
Sounds pretty promising.

143
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:22,149
Doesn't it?

144
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,766
That's why you should withdraw‐

145
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,260
But I refuse!

146
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:28,508
You know one of the things Blank loves best?

147
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:32,219
Telling people "no" and shutting them down
when they think they've already run the game,

148
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:35,015
then telling them they can go screw themselves!

149
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,959
Number four on our list of things we
always wanted to say someday! Sweet, we did it!

150
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,246
Yeah, we're so awesome.

151
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:46,806
It appears that reasoning with you is a waste of time.

152
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:50,396
Then just as you wish, I will make you yield by force.

153
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,480
It's your funeral.

154
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,135
But, Sora, why not?

155
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,817
Why what?

156
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,518
That plan she was just talking about,

157
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,554
it kind of makes sense given
the desperate situation we're in.

158
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:07,344
Steph, look, don't you think it's about time
you learned to stop being so trusting of people?

159
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:11,443
For one, what proof do we have
that anything she said is even true?

160
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:16,726
Second, if she's so confident that she
can win, then why did she ask us to withdraw?

161
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,634
And third, even if anything she said was true,

162
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,987
I could be a spy from another country, and anyone
dumb enough to spill their plan shouldn't be ruling.

163
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:29,557
Okay, fourth, if we play along and she does any
digging on us, we're totally screwed, comprende?

164
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:33,371
Wow, you really put a lot of
thought into that speech, didn't you?

165
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,994
Look, those are just details.

166
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,147
Don't sell humanity short.

167
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:41,919
We're better than that.

168
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:52,955
Chess?

169
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,385
That's right, but this isn't your normal game of chess.

170
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,445
Each piece has a will of its own.

171
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,988
Give them orders, and they'll move.

172
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,672
Think of them as your own personal army.

173
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:09,490
So that's how this works. Shiro, what's the plan?

174
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,684
Chess is no different than a game of tic‐tac‐toe.

175
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:16,837
So, like, it's cool if we rotate mid‐game right?

176
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,152
Sora.

177
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,455
I'm not trying to be difficult, but
the two of us count as a single player.

178
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:26,324
Plus you seem to be pretty familiar with this
game already whereas we don't have a clue. Cheese!

179
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,915
They'll never figure this out.

180
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,782
You may do whatever you wish.

181
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,437
But why? Do you think I'm going to lose?

182
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:35,565
Hey, don't take it personally.

183
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:39,299
Hell would freeze over before
you ever lost a game of chess.

184
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,603
But this isn't the game you're used to.

185
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:46,003
And don't forget, combined, we're a single player.

186
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:47,950
Blank is both of us.

187
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:51,358
You're right, I know. I'll be careful.

188
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:52,566
Let's go.

189
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:53,297
Right.

190
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,285
Finished with your little chat?

191
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,255
I'll let you make the first move.

192
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,649
And the game is officially underway.

193
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,247
Aschente!

194
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,050
Kurami...

195
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:17,632
D‐2 to D‐4.

196
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:23,814
Chess favors the first player.

197
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:26,585
If both players always pick their best moves,

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,794
then the first player has a higher chance of winning.

199
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:30,660
What the...

200
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,820
There's no way she's not aware of that fact.

201
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,861
G‐7, advance.

202
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,077
But it moved three spaces!

203
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,452
That isn't fair!

204
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:46,806
Weren't you listening?

205
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:50,432
In this game, the pieces have wills entirely of their own.

206
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:52,233
Now I get it.

207
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,648
The players' traits affect their moves,

208
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:58,242
stuff like charisma and one's potential leadership skills.

209
00:11:58,549 --> 00:11:59,950
You're a quick learner.

210
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:03,287
It's the perfect game to decide
the next king, don't you think?

211
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,836
Knight, please move to C‐3.

212
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,325
Now F7, forward.

213
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,902
Just "forward"? That's kind of vague.

214
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,268
What kind of move's that supposed to be?

215
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,635
Just shut up and watch.

216
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,997
E‐2 to E‐4.

217
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:23,967
F‐5, forward to take her piece.

218
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,389
Let's not forget,

219
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:30,451
once Shiro's deep into a game,
her concentration is unbreakable.

220
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:35,169
That's how even my little sister
has the power to defeat a god.

221
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,344
Queen to H‐5.

222
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,406
Check.

223
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,496
Wow, Shiro's amazing!

224
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:46,467
Even with Kurami sidestepping the
rules, Shiro's totally destroying her.

225
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,373
It's not that amazing when you think about it.

226
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,584
Take a game of shogi, for example.

227
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,554
It's entirely possible for a top player
to defeat their opponent using nothing

228
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,341
but their King and Pawns.

229
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,132
Simply bypassing a few rules
isn't enough to defeat a true master.

230
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,396
F‐2, move to F‐4.

231
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,342
However...

232
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,505
F‐2, move to F‐4.

233
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,572
Wait, why isn't it moving?

234
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,622
I knew this would happen.

235
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:13,130
Mind filling me in?

236
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,669
What's different about this chess game

237
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,326
is that sometimes, the pieces won't move.

238
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,072
What?

239
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:23,811
No soldier would willingly put themselves in
a situation that would result in their death.

240
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:27,638
They are either need a fantastic
leader or extraordinarily high morale.

241
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:28,753
But that means...

242
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:33,237
Correct, she's incapable of sacrificing any of her pieces.

243
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,583
Better make your move.

244
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,807
Otherwise, you're going to run out of time.

245
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,486
Now, knight, take H‐7.

246
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,199
A‐2, move to A‐3.

247
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,394
Bishop, forward.

248
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,930
Hurry and take out the opponent's knight.

249
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,991
And Knight, take H‐5.

250
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,890
D‐4 to D‐5.

251
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,573
A‐3...

252
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:19,955
Bishop...

253
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:22,797
I'm...

254
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,852
Sorry... Shiro.

255
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,598
Sora, I can't do it.

256
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm really, really sorry.

257
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,553
Sora? Shiro?

258
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:51,821
Sora?

259
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:59,310
Attention, all forces!

260
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,060
As your King, I hereby declare,

261
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,832
those who fight bravely...

262
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:08,830
will be heroes and win the right to
get it on with any woman they like!

263
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:11,611
Also, all you soldiers fighting on the front line,

264
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,295
if we win, you will be relieved
of any further military duties.

265
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,575
I'll make sure that you're exempt from paying taxes,

266
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,221
and you'll be handsomely compensated by your country!

267
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:23,789
Therefore, fellow virgins, you must not die!

268
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:28,626
And to all of you who have family
and other loved ones back home,

269
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,567
I promise you will all come back alive!

270
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,155
But wait, you can't really promise them that!

271
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:41,935
Thanks to you,

272
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,793
I realized this game wasn't real chess.

273
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:47,599
We gotta think of it as a strategy game.

274
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:51,753
I'll take it from here, but if I start
losing it, feel free to jump in, okay?

275
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:57,196
Now watch, 'cause games like
this are totally my specialty.

276
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,478
Attention, Pawn Squad Six!

277
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:03,149
The enemy's moving from the front
line! Strike first and cut them off!

278
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:06,865
He can't do that!

279
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,200
Now cavalry squad two, the
pawns made an opening, so move in!

280
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,394
King and queen, listen up! Hurry
and move your asses to the front line!

281
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,238
Hey, wait a minute, it's supposed to be my turn!

282
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:20,139
Sorry, but in a real war, what
fool waits for their enemy's turn?

283
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:23,841
Pawn Squad, advance and form a defensive wall!

284
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:28,845
Ha, see that? Just a couple of cowardly monarchs
hiding themselves behind their own soldiers.

285
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:32,858
What kind of ruler lets their men die on the
front line while they sit behind and watch?!

286
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,011
Ignore him!

287
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:35,973
Listen, soldiers, listen, friends,

288
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,843
this battle decides the outcome of Elkia, of humanity!

289
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:42,710
The city represents the final bastion for our people,

290
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,483
and the fate of everyone now rests in your hands!

291
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:47,255
Open your eyes!

292
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:51,266
Do you honestly want to risk your lives and
your people's future by handing over the crown

293
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,451
to some shifty charlatan like her?!

294
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,861
But if we come together and
win, then she will be your queen,

295
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:02,081
this girl who mere moments ago gathered all of her
courage in her little heart to march you towards victory,

296
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,200
this girl, who is crying on the inside

297
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:07,364
because you wrongly accused
her of being a merciless tyrant!

298
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,716
And you bastards call yourselves men?!

299
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,744
What is this? Where'd this power come from?

300
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,803
Proud knights, bishops, and rooks, now is your chance!

301
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,131
Prove to me that you live up to your rank.

302
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,746
Give the pawns support and crush the enemy's defenses!

303
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,470
This can't be happening. It's impossible.

304
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,718
Should be, right?

305
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:31,492
I figured you're using Elf magic to
force the morale of your troops higher.

306
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:35,107
It would be easy to just claim
you have more charisma than we do.

307
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:35,869
Who wouldn't?

308
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,745
It's not like anyone can prove it.

309
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,327
Unfortunately, you made one giant mistake.

310
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:41,812
And what was that? Throughout all of history,

311
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:46,729
the wisest of kings know that an army
will not obey oppressive or tyrannical rule.

312
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,534
People will only fight for
what they believe is truly right,

313
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,568
and in this world, there is only one thing

314
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,245
that is absolutely, truly right!

315
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,183
What is he talking about?

316
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,519
The one eternal truth,

317
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,665
the one virtue to rule the whole world is cuteness!

318
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,499
Cute is the world!

319
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,954
Our instincts and desires are driven by it!

320
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,252
And for it, we'll give everything!

321
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:10,221
Sorry, but that's just the way us men are!

322
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:12,877
But that's... ridiculous!

323
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,636
I still don't know which race is helping them,

324
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,725
so if I do this, they might find me out.

325
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,354
But I have no choice.

326
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:25,987
Now, king, move forward to E‐6!

327
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,363
What the heck just happened to that piece?

328
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:49,878
This is bad.

329
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:54,318
Everyone, retreat! All forces, pull
back! The enemy's using brainwashing magic!

330
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,565
He knows.

331
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,756
Can someone explain this to me, please?

332
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:58,806
Don't let the opponent touch you.

333
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,554
They don't know how I'm doing it.

334
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:06,505
As long as they can prove that I'm cheating, then I win.

335
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,286
Now, all forces advance!

336
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:12,011
Oh, crap!

337
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,544
crap, crap, crap, crap.

338
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,070
I've royally screwed this one up.

339
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,955
I thought she had only one cheat up her
sleeve and disregarded any other possibilities.

340
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:22,085
I can't believe I made the same
mistake I was just lecturing Steph about!

341
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:24,492
What, were the stakes not high
enough for me or something?!

342
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,941
I'm better than this!

343
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,583
Sora?

344
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,514
Off with the enemy King's head.

345
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,667
Finish him, my Queen.

346
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:36,933
And that's... checkmate.

347
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,310
Queen, wait!

348
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,005
Wha‐ Sora!

349
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,787
Oh, my Queen.

350
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,270
I beg you, put down your sword.

351
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:52,895
To me, you're...

352
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,040
...beautiful!

353
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,052
Say what?!

354
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,975
My Queen, my dear love,

355
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,262
please search deep within your heart.

356
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,996
Do you truly find any value in
that so‐called King's service?

357
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,155
She brainwashes her soldiers,

358
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,905
abusing and using them like expendable tools.

359
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,265
Then she forces you to lead the assault,

360
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,648
unworthy of your sword.

361
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,762
I beg you to reconsider this.

362
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,993
Please think of your people,

363
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,861
think of the kingdom that you've sworn to protect.

364
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:37,144
When it comes to dating games, there's nobody,
and I mean nobody out there that's better than me.

365
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,177
Way to go!

366
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,622
Looks like we've got their Queen!

367
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,331
He figured a way out!

368
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:42,283
Not yet.

369
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,015
Huh?

370
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:47,734
The enemy's using some kind of magic that
lets them brainwash others just by touching them.

371
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,186
Stealing one piece from their side and adding it
to our ranks won't be enough to change anything.

372
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,385
It won't?

373
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:57,014
All right, if a virgin like
you can sweet‐talk a chess piece,

374
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,193
surely you can find a way out of this mess.

375
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:00,210
I caught her off‐guard.

376
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,386
Maybe if we wait, she'll make a sloppy mistake.

377
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,421
No, that might even be worse.

378
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,304
Maybe I should hurry and make the next move.

379
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,258
Damn it, what should I do?!

380
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:11,849
I royally screwed the pooch on this
one. How the hell am I gonna fix this?!

381
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:13,740
Sora.

382
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:15,565
Shiro?

383
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,054
The two of us are Blank.

384
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,667
We'll... be... fine.

385
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,102
Stay strong.

386
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,174
Don't back down.

387
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:30,749
Now, knight, I want you to advance
and eliminate that traitor Queen!

388
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:31,686
That's it!

389
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,063
What's wrong? Come on, move it!

390
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:54,115
Jackpot!

391
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,688
This is how we're gonna win.

392
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:58,294
Shiro, you focus on commanding the army.

393
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,779
Keep them moving so we don't get brainwashed.

394
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,449
Piece... of... cake!

395
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:05,459
You finally have a plan?

396
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:06,620
Listen up, Steph,

397
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,767
you don't always have to lift your
sword to fight a battle, understand?

398
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:11,204
Huh?

399
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,769
There's always more than one way...

400
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,939
...to win a game!

401
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:50,664
Must I talk like this

402
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,413
if I'm going to be king?
