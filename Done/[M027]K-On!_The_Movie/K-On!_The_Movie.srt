1
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:25,685
Morning!?

2
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,566
I'm going to practice.

3
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,479
Bye, see you later.

4
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:06,785
Okay, bye-bye, Azusa.

5
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,412
Sky high!

6
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,217
No.

7
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,849
The music that I think we should be aiming for...

8
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,701
is NOT this at all!

9
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,295
Yeah but this is the direction that I think we oughta go.

10
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,357
What?!

11
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,381
You're cocky!

12
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,255
You're cocky!

13
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,716
You're cocky!

14
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,193
Stop it! Stop it you two!

15
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,045
What exactly is going on here?

16
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,576
Well After-school Tea Time may break up, that's what.

17
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,342
Break up?! No way! Why now?

18
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,818
Because everyone seems to be
moving in different directions.

19
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:18,209
Musically, that is, we're not actually moving, Azu-nyan.

20
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,185
That's nothing but a bunch of bunk!

21
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:24,553
Face it, Yui, you learn one new chord and
then proceed to forget the previous three.

22
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:27,363
Yeah well, you fell and showed
your panties to the whole school.

23
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:29,310
What?! Th-That's irrelevant!

24
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,473
Um you're talking about musical direction?

25
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,911
What's your opinion, Azusa?

26
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:38,881
Um... Well isn't After-school
Tea Time suppose to be all about

27
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,778
being all bright and bouncy?

28
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,545
Honestly...

29
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,404
That's all just fluff!

30
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,856
I've grown tired of it.

31
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,457
Look who's talking!

32
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:52,715
When you first came and joined this band,
all you wanted was this so called fluff.

33
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,787
You had the musical sense of an old lady!

34
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:55,200
Old lady?

35
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:58,959
You begged me to join, saying I could
just sit around, eat snacks and take it easy.

36
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,099
Um guys, you want to play Old Maid?

37
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:06,224
Not now, Azusa! We don't have time for that!
We're talking about the survival of the band here!

38
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,115
Azu-nyan.

39
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:07,904
Yes!?

40
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,021
We'll play a little later.

41
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:15,809
Don't forget, we let you join us even
though you couldn't play guitar or harmonica!

42
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,341
What do you mean? I can play
harmonica! Oh really? You can?

43
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,348
Then show me!

44
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,037
I can't! I'm sorry, I lied!

45
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,841
You're all crazy, you know that?!

46
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:25,654
Mugi-chan?

47
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:26,771
Mugi?

48
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:32,777
Come to think of it, it's Mugi's fault for
distracting us with all those snacks and teas.

49
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:34,662
You pig out more than any of use!

50
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,254
Well she brings really good stuff!

51
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,574
Well I'm sorry if it bothers you so much.

52
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,449
Hey don't get sarcastic. Say something, Mio!

53
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:42,990
Uh okay. I blame Ritsu!

54
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,644
Ah! What did I do?!

55
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,373
Yeah, it's all Ritsu's fault!

56
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,037
This is what you just played.

57
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,998
What are you doing?

58
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,732
You caught me.

59
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,060
We're copying "DEATH DEVIL".

60
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,084
Oh it's so much fun!

61
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,216
Okay can we all stop the play
acting now and get back to practicing?

62
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,763
You really got into it, too, Mio.

63
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,748
Play acting?

64
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:22,849
Yeah, that's right.

65
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:27,279
We were pretending to have a big ol'
nasty fight over musical differences.

66
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,662
You know it's standard rocker stuff.

67
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:32,544
Yeah. I should have guessed what was going on.

68
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,208
Well now that Azusa's arrived...

69
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,935
Oh, wait just a second.

70
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,735
Let's have some tea.

71
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,544
What?!

72
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,857
Alright, now it's time to grade ourselves.

73
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:34,318
I thought Azu-nyan would get a lot more
startled than she actually did when walked in.

74
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,318
I thought she meant we were gonna grade the music?

75
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,334
Oh! Don't worry, I already fed Tonchan.

76
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,209
Oh, thanks a lot, Senpai.

77
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,498
We weren't that convincing, were we?

78
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:48,793
Mugi's "You're all crazy!" was a little bit over the top.

79
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,740
I don't mind.

80
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,076
Yeah but we do.

81
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,451
Boy, I had no idea what a total slacker
after-school club this would turn out to be.

82
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,560
Hey watch it, Azusa.

83
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,849
That tea!

84
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:07,560
You wouldn't have been able to taste it
anywhere else but at this after school club.

85
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:10,568
It's the pride of the Kotobuki family.

86
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm sorry. It's delicious.

87
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:15,412
Oh! Is that baumkuchen, Mugi?

88
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,349
Let's eat it layer by layer.

89
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,498
Please don't. That's torture.

90
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:21,498
Mugi! Hurry and open it!

91
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,279
I can't.

92
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:30,013
for the past years, we've been meeting in this club
room, having tea and cake and sometimes band practice.

93
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:34,599
All that's left for us now is graduation.

94
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:38,841
That may be true, but should you really be
kicking back so casually like you're doing?

95
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:42,519
Sure. I already got into college. Didn't I?

96
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:47,694
It's a miracle, I mean I
expected Mio and Mugi but...  What?

97
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,274
Huh? What did she just say?

98
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:55,966
Senpai, what is this?

99
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,211
Cute, huh?

100
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,896
It opened.

101
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:04,099
What are we gonna toast to?

102
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:07,607
How about to everyone of us
getting into the college they want?

103
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,591
Okay, let's toast to that.

104
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,779
You too, Azu-nyan.

105
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,732
Um... okay.

106
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,138
Cheers!

107
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,404
Cheers.

108
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,118
Sawa-chan!

109
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:28,689
I for one am extremely relieved
that you all passed your classes.

110
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:32,288
I imagine that teaching seniors must be really hard.

111
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:39,041
Oh my, I just can't believe you're all
graduating already. Where did the time go?

112
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,974
Boy, I wonder how many cups
of tea we all drank in 3 years.

113
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:45,350
I think a thousand cups, easily.

114
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,552
A thousand cups!?

115
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,654
Well we are After-school Tea Time.

116
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:52,031
Boy, I guess we really lived up to the name of our band.

117
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,021
All that's left now is for you to
get ready for your big sendoff...

118
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:58,070
if nobody's held back of course.

119
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:59,126
Held back?

120
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,877
There's a meeting next week.

121
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:10,923
It's to determine if you've all met your basic
attendance requirements and other such things.

122
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,862
No kidding! Is that true?!

123
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:21,627
S-Sawa-chan, w-we were just
doing a DEATH DEVIL impersonation.

124
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,297
The DEATH DEVIL rules!

125
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,359
That was Miss Yamanaka's killer band!

126
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,633
That's right, so what?

127
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:32,231
A-A-As big sister to our club, please have mercy!

128
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,480
You're my mentor!

129
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:34,734
That's some serious begging.

130
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,968
Kissing up won't save you.

131
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,370
Oh please, oh please, oh please!

132
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,014
Madam Sawako Yamanaka!

133
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,436
What's wrong?

134
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,210
Worried about not graduating?

135
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,831
No, not really.

136
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,178
This has to belong to Yui.

137
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,809
I guess I'm afraid that we're graduating without
giving Azu-nyan a really good reason to look up to us.

138
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:16,912
What!?

139
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,866
Now that's not true.

140
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,298
Because the four of us...

141
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,243
Are taller.

142
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,415
And older.

143
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:23,508
And active.

144
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,438
Is that all we've got?

145
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:26,391
I know!

146
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:30,503
Why don't we come up with something
real senior-like for Azu-nyan?

147
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,561
That's perfect!

148
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,655
I'm in! Nice one, Yui!

149
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,633
So what is it we're going to do?

150
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,053
Well I think a thoughtful present might be nice.

151
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,388
Something very Azu-nyan-ish.

152
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:49,019
There you are.

153
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,951
Wow! This is so exciting.

154
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,969
Just don't say a word to her, okay?

155
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:54,066
Hello there.

156
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:55,723
Oh Azu-nyan!

157
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:59,247
You- You kind of left a trail of garbage to here.

158
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,948
I did it on purpose cause I wanted
to be able to find my way back?

159
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,830
Well I picked it all up.

160
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,729
I'll never find the room now.

161
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,661
Oh don't be silly. Come on, let's get going.

162
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,245
Something that Azusa would like, huh?

163
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,213
Yeah.

164
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,401
A thing or an act or something.

165
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,007
Let me think.

166
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,813
Aw come on, Ui, you're in her
class. Has she said anything?

167
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:38,678
Like how cool we seem to her or something like that?

168
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:40,142
Well...

169
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,828
She must have said something.

170
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,970
She told me she wishes you guys
would practice a little harder.

171
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:51,999
And um, that you would try to keep
the club room just a little bit tidier.

172
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:55,590
And uh, that would try to stop hugging her so much.

173
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:56,669
That's it.

174
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,590
What's wrong, Sis?

175
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:01,497
That's what I figured she'd say.

176
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:09,080
We probably should be thanking her
for putting up with us all the time.

177
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:15,047
the only thing Azusa ever really talks
about is the band and the Light Music Club.

178
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,285
You mean it?

179
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,111
Yeah.

180
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:22,835
Not only that, she decided she
wanted to join the Light Music Club,

181
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:25,491
after she heard you guys play at that concert.

182
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,518
Did she really say that?

183
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:35,640
Oh! Why don't you all just hold
yourselves back so you can graduate with her?

184
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,282
No wait! I'm just kidding, Sis! Don't even think about it!

185
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:00,045
Azu-nyan.

186
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,502
What should we get you?!

187
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:21,932
Yui!

188
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,984
Good morning, Mugi-chan!

189
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,743
You've got guitar lines on your face.

190
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,778
I slept on Geeta.

191
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,382
It's so cold!

192
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:36,408
Let me feel your hand, okay?

193
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,532
Guess what?

194
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,152
What?

195
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,847
I wrote some brand new lyrics
last night before I went to bed.

196
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:45,473
Oh a new song? "Ice Cream Boy" huh?

197
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:48,399
Yeah, I need Mugi to put some music to it.

198
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,496
Ritsu! Mio-chan!

199
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:52,024
Good morning!

200
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,483
Same to you!

201
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,929
Mugi-chan's hands are so hot, I'm actually sweating.

202
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,700
Yeah well, Mio's hands are so cold,
it feels like they're frozen solid.

203
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:01,892
What's that mean?

204
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,982
Did any of you think of a present for Azu-nyan?

205
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:05,743
Did you?

206
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,940
I fell asleep thinking about it.

207
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,146
So did I. Socks and all!

208
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:12,411
I take them all off for bed.

209
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,366
Really?! Mio, how very audacious!

210
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,906
I meant my socks!

211
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:20,457
Good morning. You're here early.

212
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,522
Yeah I know, but I guess I just miss seeing everybody.

213
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:25,908
That's a good idea.

214
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,347
Morning, Nodoka-chan.

215
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:28,300
Good morning.

216
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,501
Alright, so let's go book it tomorrow.

217
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:33,496
Then we'll go shop for bathing suits.

218
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,201
Oh wow! My first trip to Hawaii!

219
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:39,096
Hey Mugi-chan, did you hear that?

220
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,361
Mika, are you going to Hawaii?

221
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,577
Yeah. For a graduation trip.

222
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,380
Isn't the Light Music Club going anywhere?

223
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:50,519
Rit-chan!

224
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,434
What's up, Yui?

225
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:52,779
So what do you guys think?

226
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,550
The volleyball team's taking a graduation trip.

227
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:56,689
Really?

228
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,537
I think we should, too.

229
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:00,326
When are you guys going?

230
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,724
The week right before graduation.

231
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,534
When the fares are still cheap.

232
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,901
Well, Rit-chan?!

233
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:08,182
That's before spring break.

234
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,130
Come on we should do it too.

235
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:11,937
Hmm...

236
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:15,205
Nope. We do our thing. They do theirs.

237
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,723
Awww!

238
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:22,212
Let's not forget that our priority right
now is to think of something to do for Azusa.

239
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,682
Listen up, everyone!

240
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:28,360
I think it'd be nice if we pulled together
and did something as a class for Ms. Yamanaka.

241
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,794
Any ideas? Oh and we have to keep it a secret, of course.

242
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,890
What do you think would be good?

243
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,216
Something tearful.

244
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,521
Sing the school song for her.

245
00:16:38,586 --> 00:16:40,922
What does Ms. Yamanaka like anyway?

246
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:42,518
Tht's a good question.

247
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:43,940
And so guys...

248
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,792
I think we should take a graduation trip!

249
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:52,466
Didn't we all recently go and
get our passports squared away?

250
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:56,009
You told us we were all suppose
to think of a present for Azusa.

251
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,417
Hmm well yeah, we'll do that, too.

252
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:00,856
Yeah. No way!

253
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:04,590
You're always putting things off
and then we have to scramble to fix it.

254
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,045
What's a little trip, Ms. Stingy?

255
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,098
I interviewed my sister about Azu-nyan yesterday.

256
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,431
Yeah? Well give us your report then.

257
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:14,657
Well, she told me that...

258
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,723
Wait a sec! What is that?

259
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:20,773
That's a flying Beast! It's one of
Japan's oldest and most talked ab...

260
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,753
Right. What did your sister say?

261
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:27,655
Oh, she told me that we should all
just stay in the school for another year.

262
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,683
And that way we could graduate with
Azu-nyan instead leaving her behind.

263
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,908
You mean flunking as a present?

264
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,997
Yes. Flunking!

265
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:41,883
What's with you guys?

266
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,807
But I'm sensing a lot of panic.

267
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,825
You are?

268
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,875
Plus I though I heard someone say the word "flunking".

269
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,069
Our problems are many and vary.

270
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,492
So where did you hear that, Azusa?

271
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,836
Just now, from you guys when I came in.

272
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,538
You're hearing things, Azu-nyan.
It was just your imagination.

273
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,285
What are you doing that for?

274
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,957
We were discussing where we
might go for a graduation trip.

275
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:08,333
And there's this city in the
middle of Germany called "Flunken".

276
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:08,929
What!?

277
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,355
It sounds totally awful.

278
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,824
Let's not go there!

279
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:14,466
Really? Graduation trip, huh?

280
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:22,443
Dubai!

281
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,747
What happened to the idea of going to Hawaii?

282
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:26,693
Dubai!

283
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,400
Let's go to Europe!

284
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,555
How about a hot springs with ping-pong?

285
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,350
How about you Mio?

286
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,413
I don't know.

287
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:41,144
I think London, becuase of its deep
historic rock n' roll musical roots.

288
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,132
It's home to some great musicians.

289
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,498
Pretty tough decision.

290
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,570
How about you?

291
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:49,541
Oh. I'm not graduating yet, so I really can't say.

292
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:57,980
How did we end up talking about a
graduation trip instead of her present?

293
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,808
It sort of just happened.

294
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,135
My bad. My bad.

295
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,239
Don't you want to go on a trip with us, Mio?

296
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:06,947
Of course I do. I didn't mean that.

297
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:10,668
Okay, who DOESN'T want to take a graduation trip?

298
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,251
Silence.

299
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:13,728
Tonchan.

300
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,896
It's settled, then!

301
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,522
Whoa that was quick.

302
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,829
Great! Let's choose where
we're going by ghost leg lottery.

303
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,674
I'm the type that's pretty good at
that sort of thing if I do say so myself.

304
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,071
What type is that?

305
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:27,613
It's done!

306
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,657
Here you go, Captain Ritsu, it's all yours.

307
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:35,320
Who, me? Okay then... this one.

308
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:38,440
All righty. Let's see where it leads us to.

309
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,031
The decision is in!

310
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,129
Europe it is!

311
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:01,166
Wow that was your choice, Yui.

312
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,914
So where exactly in Europe are we gonna be going?

313
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:05,439
Yeah Yui, where?

314
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:07,305
Senpai?  Yes?

315
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,108
Can I take a look at that paper for just a second?

316
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:12,469
But why? How come?

317
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,946
No reason.

318
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,399
Well...

319
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,016
She's running!

320
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,316
And falling!

321
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,199
Yui!

322
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:28,128
Yui?

323
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:29,805
Yui!

324
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,091
Yui?

325
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:34,929
YUUUI!

326
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:38,354
Rit-chan.

327
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,421
Yui!

328
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,600
I can finally do this. You see, Rit-chan?

329
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,444
That's great! That's great, Yui!

330
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,723
Thanks.

331
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,770
I knew it. this whole thing was rigged.

332
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,595
What!?

333
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,054
Oh drat!

334
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:58,820
Yui's always so obvious about this stuff.

335
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,793
Hey, you conned us.

336
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,952
Though it was pretty impressive, Yui.

337
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,734
Hey, don't gloat.

338
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:08,611
It was a simple mistake.

339
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:14,162
You can stay like that for a while.

340
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,274
Yui.

341
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,665
Okay, let's decide this the right way.

342
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,074
But no one here agrees on where we should go.

343
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:26,606
Let's take a vote.

344
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:28,441
Meaningless.

345
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:31,372
I know! Let's have Tonchan decide!

346
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,114
Stop it already.

347
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,280
Which teacup will Tonchan choose?

348
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,268
It's like a theme park or something in there.

349
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,954
By the way...  What?

350
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:48,494
The Europe cup looks a lot smaller
than all the rest of the cups in there.

351
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:50,709
Yeah, that's the penalty for cheating.

352
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:51,949
Oh I see.

353
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:59,983
I never thought Tonchan would
shoulder such a big responsibility.

354
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,415
Tonchan's swimming pretty high today.

355
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:07,076
He doesn't look at all interested in any of the cups.

356
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,544
What a nice day.

357
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,754
Everyone's so bored!

358
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,489
T-T-Tonchan! Look!

359
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,389
He's in front of Europe!

360
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,152
Yeah, but he's touching London.

361
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:31,666
Does this mean that it's London?

362
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:37,190
London's in Europe so you should be happy, Yui.

363
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:38,309
What? Really?

364
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,169
Wow! How far does Europe go anyway?

365
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:45,117
I feel sorry for the university you're going to.

366
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:48,266
Mio, we're going to London!

367
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,447
Congratulations, Mio.

368
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:53,513
YES!

369
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:54,780
Mio?

370
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,444
Yes, London! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

371
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,104
Okay, take it easy. Will ya?

372
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,670
Lo-lo-London!

373
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:09,192
I guess you really wanted to go there, Mio-chan.

374
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,925
We can have afternoon tea there.

375
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:14,857
You mean they have tea in London?

376
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,716
It's the country of tea.

377
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:20,115
Really?! Then that's perfect for us!

378
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:24,403
There's 5 of us, so we should get two rooms.

379
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,341
3 and 2?  Mhm.

380
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,122
You're coming too, aren't you?

381
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:32,739
Oh no. I shouldn't go, it's your graduation trip.

382
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,479
Did you lose your passport?

383
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,863
No, of course not, but I still have to go to school.

384
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:40,389
You don't have classes after your finals, right?

385
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,353
Well no. We all get a 5-day break.

386
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,291
Great! So what's the problem then?

387
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:45,902
But...

388
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,260
We've all gotta go together.

389
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:51,384
It just wouldn't be right without you, Azu-nyan.

390
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,614
Azusa, don't you want to go?

391
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:03,291
I do! I'd love to, but wouldn't I just be in the way?

392
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:04,873
'Course not.

393
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:09,881
Then... yes. I'll go.

394
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,059
Yeah! It's settled!  Yay!

395
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:16,325
It's not quite settled yet. I've
got to check with my parents first.

396
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,202
Hello, Mom? It's me Azusa.

397
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,642
Yeah, listen um...

398
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:31,164
Oh thank you, Mom!

399
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,230
My Mom said that I can go, so...

400
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,279
That's right. London.

401
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,781
5 days. It's our graduation trip.

402
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,618
Uh, hi, Mom...

403
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,026
I'll never ask for anything again!

404
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:52,211
Mhm, Ritsu's going so you can relax.  Really?!

405
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,175
I think they really need me.

406
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:05,448
What?

407
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:08,810
You mean "London" as in the real London?

408
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:14,582
Well of course the real one. Which London
did you think we'd be going to, Nodoka-chan?

409
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:21,109
I don't know. I thought it might be
the name of a new shop of some kind.

410
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,032
We're all going to talk to a travel
agent tomorrow so we can book the trip.

411
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:31,235
That's terrific. You know, I had no idea you
all had such a big interest in going to England.

412
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:35,441
That's interesting outfit, Yui.

413
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,000
It was Mio who came up with the idea of
going there, but Tonchan decided for us.

414
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,686
A turtle decided?

415
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:48,621
Yeah to keep it fair, but Tonchan decided
that we're going to London, not to England.

416
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:51,276
Yui.

417
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,683
I hate to break this to you but...

418
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,295
London is in England.

419
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:00,227
It's all so sudden.

420
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,285
But I'm going to London.

421
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,090
But why all the books?

422
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:09,612
Because someone's got to be informed about the city.

423
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,102
Take care of my big Sis, okay?

424
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:16,586
I will, Ui.

425
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,416
Oh and about your big sister,

426
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,946
I get the distinct feeling that
she's hiding something from me.

427
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:26,900
Do you know what it is?

428
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:31,507
I honestly don't think Big Sis is
really capable of hiding anything.

429
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:33,825
You've got a point.

430
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,542
Welcome.

431
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:38,466
Are you here for a travel consultation?

432
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:39,570
Uh... yes.

433
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:42,511
We want to take a 5-day trip to London.

434
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,164
London 3 nights and 5 days?

435
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:47,850
3? Is she trying to gyp us?

436
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:50,043
No, we're going to need 2 travel days.

437
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:52,473
Ooh.  I knew that.  Yeah.

438
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:54,777
So you'll be wanting a London only tour?

439
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,969
London only?

440
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,074
I think so.

441
00:26:57,431 --> 00:27:00,346
It's fine. There's lots of things to see there.

442
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's ride that!

443
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,715
And then visit a tea shop.

444
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,758
Wow, that looks really delicious!

445
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,791
Yeah.  Hey look at that!

446
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,653
And I wanna see the homes of Jimmy
Page and Jimi Hendrix while we're there.

447
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,564
Great idea.

448
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,941
And David Bowie's, too!

449
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:15,449
Look, music stores!

450
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:16,284
Abbey Road!

451
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,154
Pardon?

452
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,340
Perhaps you'll want to choose a free
activity package to add to your trip.

453
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,215
No, I don't think we'll need that.

454
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,343
Oh Yes. Perfect! We'll take it!

455
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:43,678
Good morning!

456
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,118
Hmm? Miss Music Club.

457
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,689
Isn't it cold?

458
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:51,415
I gather that the Occult Club isn't on vacation yet?

459
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:56,891
Yes, we're heading up to the roof to see if
we can make contact with any extraterrestrials.

460
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,705
Oh really? The Light Music
Club is taking a trip to England.

461
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:01,883
Very nice!

462
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:05,900
Yeah, it's a graduation trip.
You want anything from there?

463
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,370
Yes, Nessie.

464
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:15,234
Nessie...

465
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:19,446
Take a photo of Nessie for us.

466
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:21,202
Right! You got it!

467
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,252
Leave it to me.

468
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,739
Miss Music Club?

469
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:31,800
So do you think that maybe we
can fit that into our schedule?

470
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,555
You mean Nessie?

471
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,137
Loch Ness is pretty far away.

472
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:41,675
And I hear Nessie is just a myth, it doesn't really exist.

473
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:44,122
So that was an Occult Club gag?

474
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,475
How're we supposed to get something like that?

475
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:49,861
Don't worry about it, Yui.

476
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:50,812
Okay!

477
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:53,428
Alright, any more requests for the trip?

478
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:54,729
Nope! That's it!

479
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:57,018
Good. Then I'm going to put together

480
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:00,212
a doable itinerary for us based on these notes I've taken.

481
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,518
You really don't mind doing that?

482
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:05,260
No. I kind of like this sort of thing.

483
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:06,332
Thank you.

484
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,611
Would you like some more tea, Azusa?

485
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:10,049
Oh no, thank you.

486
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,963
I'm feeling pretty full right now.

487
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:16,855
You know, whenever Azu-nyan makes
schedules, she always leaves out snack time.

488
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,616
I mean, what happened to the "free" in free activity?

489
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:22,381
Are you going home?

490
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,375
Yes, aren't any of you leaving?

491
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,686
Sure, I'll go home now!

492
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,479
Once we practice having Enlish style "Afternoon Tea".

493
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,758
I think...!

494
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:40,398
I think, I'll be having another cup of
tea, first. Here's a small gift for you.

495
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:42,632
Just a little something for the road.

496
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,990
We'll wash the cups, too.

497
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,987
Okay. Thanks a lot for the gift.

498
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:48,242
Take care, Azusa.

499
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:50,093
Include snack time, okay?

500
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:51,898
Sure. See you tomorrow.

501
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,421
Later Azusa!

502
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:55,702
Okay.

503
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:59,285
Alright, now we can get down to business.

504
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,517
What business?

505
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:02,257
She's still here?!

506
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,501
Hey! What gives?

507
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,503
You gotta go too, Sawa-chan.

508
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,024
Here's your parting gift.

509
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:10,465
Ohho that's right, you don't
you have a date tonight do you?

510
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:11,855
No! Not that I know of.

511
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:12,808
Go get one!

512
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:16,683
Okay!

513
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:20,346
We need to get a present for Azu-nyan.

514
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:22,854
So what do we get her?

515
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,422
We always rely on her for everything.

516
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,552
So we need to show her we're grateful,

517
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,292
and we need to do it in our own very special way.

518
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,214
Any ideas?  A play?

519
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,002
No! No more plays.

520
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:38,636
Ah! Azu-nyan left "Mud Stain" behind!

521
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,238
Oh no! Oh no!

522
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,725
That's "Mustang".

523
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,678
Yours is "Elizabass", right?

524
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:50,188
Why don't we just ask Mud Stain?

525
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,569
Mud Stain?

526
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,312
What would Azu-nyan like as a present?

527
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,359
I'm kidding!

528
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:08,475
Mud Stain!

529
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,935
Mud Stain said, "Song!"

530
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:13,210
Oh no! Did you hit your head?

531
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:14,981
It said "Zong"?

532
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,697
Not "zong", "song".

533
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,538
"Gong"?

534
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:19,820
No! "Song"!

535
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:20,450
"Tang"?

536
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:24,435
No, listen, I mean it actually said the word "song" to me!

537
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,475
Aw man! Why didn't I think of that before?

538
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,865
Are you saying that we should give Azusa a song?

539
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:40,126
Ui said, that Azu-nyan really loves the Light
Music Club and the band and all the music we play.

540
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,374
A brand new song for Azusa?

541
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,738
That's just perfect!

542
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:52,163
It is. A farewell song to Azu-nyan, it's gonna be so cool!

543
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,752
Yes, very cool.

544
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,945
Alright, so what kind of song?

545
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,680
Well, it has to sound real "senior-ly".

546
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:05,193
With zing, and a whole lot of bang, and boom!

547
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:06,010
You know?

548
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,536
What do you mean?

549
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:12,683
In short, it has to be bigger and more
powerful than anything we've ever done before.

550
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,515
For example what?

551
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,404
Boy, I neary forget Mustang.

552
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,461
Good morning everyone!

553
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:29,923
Just kidding.

554
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:33,422
Oh Azu-nyan! When did you...?

555
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:35,185
I just came back.

556
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,480
For how long?

557
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,488
Now.

558
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:46,230
Oh! Ooh, right! You came back here to get Mud Stain.

559
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:49,295
Don't be forgetting him.

560
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:50,884
Um, sorry.

561
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:53,496
Well, see ya.

562
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,482
Bye-bye!

563
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,174
You're safe and sound.

564
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:07,122
Azu-nyan?

565
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:11,419
Oh, no it's nothing. Nothing at all! Whatever am I doing?

566
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:13,147
Well see ya!

567
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:23,189
I don't remember ever seeing those four
looking as serious as they looked today.

568
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,902
Something's fishy.

569
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:39,657
It's Mugi.

570
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,373
At least she's having fun.

571
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,953
Boy, I'm nervous as all heck.

572
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:02,395
This could really turn out to be a global song.

573
00:34:08,354 --> 00:34:09,414
Big Sis, could you hold this for me?

574
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:11,008
Big Sis, could you hold this for me?

575
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:14,354
It's too full.

576
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:16,578
Why all the Japanese food?

577
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,778
I thought you'd probably miss it.

578
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:22,044
Why are you taking your school uniform?

579
00:34:22,116 --> 00:34:23,641
Everyone's bringing theirs.

580
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,834
Oh, okay.

581
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,696
Yui? You might need an English
phrase book to help you get around.

582
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:29,744
Thanks, mom.

583
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:32,065
And you're also going to need an outlet converter.

584
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:32,693
Thanks.

585
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,401
More things you gotta pack.

586
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,223
Alright girls, better hurry off to bed now.

587
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,143
Okay!

588
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,451
Tomorrow, I'm going to London.

589
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,381
I'm jealous.

590
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,146
I'd feel better if you were coming along.

591
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,754
But will you fit?

592
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,425
Just kidding.

593
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,155
Stop that, Big Sis!

594
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,957
See you 5 days!

595
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,936
Take care of youself, Big Sis!

596
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:04,037
I'm going to get something to drink.

597
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,142
Watch my stuff, okay?

598
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:06,960
Okay!

599
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:15,279
Rit-chan! Rit-chan! Good morning, Rit-chan!

600
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,595
Morning!

601
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:21,768
I thought it might look good in
all the photos we'll be taking.

602
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,454
Both you and Mio.

603
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:24,467
What?

604
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,542
Azusa, too?

605
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,191
Good morning you guys!

606
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,414
Good morning!

607
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,639
So you brought Mustang along, huh?

608
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:41,596
Sure did. I wasn't really sure, but I
figured Yui would bring hers along on the trip.

609
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,508
I was right.

610
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,560
Yui and Azusa brought them too.

611
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:52,690
I want any famous musicians that
we might meet there to sign my bass.

612
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,526
Gotcha. Okay, on to Mugi's station.

613
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,637
Did you bring your drums?

614
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,264
You haven't forgotten anything have you?

615
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:08,508
Oh! I forgot my passport!

616
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,043
Then I guess we're gonna have to leave you behind.

617
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:11,637
Hey!

618
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:13,109
It's hanging from your neck.

619
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,580
Sorry, I just couldn't resist.

620
00:36:32,383 --> 00:36:34,193
Good morning, Mugi-chan!

621
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:35,887
Good morning!

622
00:36:36,149 --> 00:36:40,113
Aw! No fair! I knew I should've brought my keyboard!

623
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,278
Wow!  It sure is big.

624
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:49,006
Let's go get some tea.

625
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:50,562
This is cool!

626
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:52,444
Let's check in our bags first.

627
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:53,936
Good idea.

628
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,004
I'm terribly sorry.

629
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,840
We have a very full plane and not much carry on space.

630
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:05,051
I'm afraid that we'll need you check
your instrument bags along with your luggage.

631
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,406
I'll see you in London, Geeta!

632
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:14,966
This is awesome! We could use one of these at school.

633
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,468
A people walker.

634
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:18,119
People mover.

635
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:19,822
I see your legs!

636
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:23,183
Are all the boyfriend rumors true?

637
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,891
Can you make it official?

638
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,369
Please, just a word, Ms. Kotobuki!

639
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:32,316
?Moonwalking? Moonwalking?

640
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:34,017
I'm so excited.

641
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:35,511
Look!

642
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,893
Wow.

643
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,021
Ritsu! Ritsu!

644
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:47,294
Shouldn't we get snacks?

645
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,411
They'll feed us soon after we take off.

646
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:52,049
You know all about this, Azusa.

647
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:53,684
That's 'cause I read up.

648
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,236
It's like a dream.

649
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:02,502
When this plane lands and we get
off, we'll be in London, England.

650
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,559
In a totally different country!

651
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:08,167
Wow! We're really traveling abroad together.

652
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:11,004
Yeah or maybe into the future or past!

653
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,299
It's a plane not a time machine.

654
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,360
But time will go backwards.

655
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:17,810
You scared me!

656
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:21,266
Here. Eye masks for you.

657
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,450
Thanks, Senpai.  Thanks, Mugi-chan.

658
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,770
Time will go backwards?

659
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:29,331
We're flying against the Earth's
rotation and across time zones.

660
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,277
Does that really make time go backwards?

661
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:33,230
Yes.

662
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,293
It's time to put on your seatbelt, Senpai.

663
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:45,966
If we didn't land and just kept going,
would we travel all the way into the past?

664
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:47,783
No not that far.

665
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,139
Well then how far would we go?

666
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,514
Look we're taking off.

667
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,628
Taking off already?!

668
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,081
Azu-nyan, we're moving!

669
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:09,135
Whoa! We're so high! Look at the pretty clouds! Woo-hoo!

670
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:19,154
Azu-nyan, from here on, no Japanese is allowed.

671
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:21,163
Okay?

672
00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:25,420
Okay, I understand.

673
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:27,193
Azu-meow.

674
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:28,321
Huh?

675
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,714
No Japanese.

676
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,826
Geeze.

677
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:36,240
Azu-meow? What's kinaishoku in English?

678
00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:37,481
In flight meal.

679
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:39,808
Beef or chicken?

680
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,814
We're practicing.

681
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:45,850
Give me, chicken.

682
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,699
Yes! Excellent!

683
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:50,495
And now me! Okay?

684
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:52,877
Cheers!  Chicken or beef?

685
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,419
The beef, please.

686
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,093
That's excellent.

687
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:57,835
Ma'am?  Yes?

688
00:39:57,906 --> 00:40:00,846
Now which would you like? Japanese or western?

689
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:29,495
Azu-nyan! Azu-nyan!

690
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:40,484
Hey! I should write lyrics for her song.

691
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,920
Upsy daisy.

692
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,583
What's this?

693
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:16,942
"Worldwide"?

694
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,142
Did you see anything?

695
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:26,005
Who, me? No.

696
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,918
Um were you trying to write something special?

697
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,978
I was just thinking about how I should live.

698
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:41,158
It turns out I've really got a lot to think about.

699
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:42,827
Oh.

700
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,433
What's going on?

701
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:07,467
is she really hoping to change the band's
direction and totally remake the sound?

702
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:12,830
Or is she actually flunking out of school and
worried about what's going to happen to her in the future?

703
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:17,078
Will she become... Big outlaw rocker Yui?!

704
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,066
Nah!

705
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:25,706
Azu-nyan, wake up!

706
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:27,890
We're arriving!

707
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:41,930
England? Is this really England?

708
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,437
Boy the trip here eemed so quick.

709
00:42:46,572 --> 00:42:50,075
We're jet-setters now! We flew
half way around the world in the air!

710
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,535
Take it easy, Yui.

711
00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:53,404
I can't believe we're really here.

712
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:54,922
We go through immigration next?

713
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:55,836
What do we do?

714
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:59,777
Let me see, usually you're asked
your purpose for coming to the country.

715
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,459
Oh! Our purpose?

716
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:05,420
Yes. Just say that you came
her on vacation to go sightseeing.

717
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:06,276
Okay.

718
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:08,056
Side business!

719
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:09,653
Side business?

720
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:10,588
Hello.

721
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:12,043
Y-Yes sir.

722
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:13,481
Uh... 4 days.

723
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,613
Yes, I am 17.

724
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:26,033
Oh I really missed you, my Geeta!

725
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:29,660
When you think about it, why'd we
bring all of our instruments anyway?

726
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:32,105
Mio, got your luggage yet?

727
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,241
No.

728
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:34,578
Really?

729
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:36,298
Don't worry, it'll come.

730
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,290
I guess, it didn't make it?

731
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,793
But why just my bag?

732
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:46,991
Do you think they might have lost it?

733
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:51,028
What'll you do without clean panties? As a lady?

734
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:53,397
But Mio doesn't wear them, does she?

735
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,066
Yes! She wears no panties!

736
00:43:56,152 --> 00:43:58,743
I said I don't wear socks, not panties!

737
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:00,443
Look! It's over there!

738
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,595
Hey, yeah.

739
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,757
Someone must have set it aside for her.

740
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,464
Right under her nose.

741
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,290
It's such a relief.

742
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,200
Brrrr!

743
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,319
London is really cold.

744
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:15,892
London sky!

745
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:18,117
London taxi!

746
00:44:19,274 --> 00:44:20,866
London English!

747
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:23,274
All of us in London!

748
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,149
Ahem.

749
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:27,764
Taxi, taxi!

750
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:28,575
Hello.

751
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,608
'ello.

752
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:34,629
In London, I'm pretty sure the custom is,
that you have to open the taxi doors yourself.

753
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:36,178
Wow.

754
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,014
But there's no handle.

755
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:40,301
I guess maybe the door is automatic.

756
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,572
Why don't we ask the driver?

757
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:47,033
The door opens the other way. I knew that.

758
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,598
Put your luggage up here in front.

759
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,439
Thank you.

760
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:51,822
Where to?

761
00:44:52,068 --> 00:44:55,516
Well um, to the hotel Ibis, please.

762
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:57,781
Yeah, the Ibis. Where abouts?

763
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,197
He's asking where the hotel is, I think.

764
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:03,700
Where? Well it's right here in London, of course! Right?

765
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,265
London humor?

766
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,807
London city?

767
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:07,767
Yes!

768
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,104
I'm facing backwards.

769
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,438
Feels weird.

770
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:15,721
Are you all right, Yui-senpai?

771
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:18,971
Sorry, Yui. I closed the door before you were ready.

772
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,750
Don't worry, I'm fine.

773
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,696
Mugi-chan's softness saved me from getting hurt.

774
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:24,837
I'm glad.

775
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,549
Wow, that was a real surprise.

776
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:30,067
I think it's the first of many.

777
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,522
Welcome to London.

778
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:58,789
Facing backwards was a bit uncomfortable for me.

779
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:00,696
Are you okay, Yui?

780
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,048
No sweat, I'll be fine.

781
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,352
Mind if I sit down a minute?

782
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,346
Sure you're okay?

783
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:10,648
What about dinner?

784
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,229
Dinner?

785
00:46:12,747 --> 00:46:16,607
I'd like roast beef and yorkshire pudding and ice cream.

786
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,007
Huh?! Oh no!

787
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:20,277
What's wrong?

788
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,527
They don't seem to have our reservation.

789
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,537
We can't stay here?

790
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,357
We have to sleep outside?

791
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:29,192
What do we do?

792
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,543
May I see that?

793
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:32,465
Y-Yes, ma'am!

794
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:39,766
You booking's actually over at the Ibis at Earl's Court.

795
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:41,626
Ibis Earl's Court?

796
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,926
Correct. This here is the Ibis London City.

797
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:47,682
We have a number of locations throughout the London area.

798
00:46:47,944 --> 00:46:49,578
I don't get her accent.

799
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,359
Me neither.

800
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,697
Well I do. They have other hotels in the city.

801
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,681
They do?

802
00:46:56,872 --> 00:47:01,379
Our reservation is for the Ibis hotel
that's located in a place called Earl's Court.

803
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:03,515
Boy that's a big relief.

804
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:05,835
Thank you very much.

805
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,386
You're welcome. You have yourselves a lovely day.

806
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,995
Let's see... Earl's Court.

807
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:13,829
Oh! There it is!

808
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,326
Yeah but, we're way over here.

809
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,940
Should we get another taxi? It's awfully far away.

810
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:22,268
What so Yui can bounce around again?

811
00:47:22,324 --> 00:47:24,382
Don't worry, I'll face backwards!

812
00:47:24,643 --> 00:47:27,344
I know! Why don't we all just take a bus?

813
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:28,750
Great idea!

814
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,184
You see one, Mio-senpai?

815
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,671
Nothing that goes directly there.

816
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,061
Too bad.

817
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:40,390
But it looks like we can get there by one subway.

818
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,228
What's wrong, Azu-nyan?

819
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:48,622
Um... I'm wearing new shoes and they're a little stiff.

820
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:50,790
Do your feet hurt?

821
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:51,671
A little.

822
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:52,990
Got a blister?

823
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:54,746
You mean all this time?

824
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:57,772
No. It just started a little while ago.

825
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,753
Then I think we should go buy you some new ones!

826
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:04,248
No, you've all got to be really tired!

827
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:06,049
And you're carrying luggage.

828
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:08,061
Hey, we should go here.

829
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,250
Where? Where?

830
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,077
Here, they sell rock 'n roll wear and accessories.

831
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,149
Lovely.

832
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:14,689
Okay, Azusa?

833
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,348
It's so cool!

834
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:43,510
I need to take a picture with with Geeta.

835
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:49,223
Yui, I'll hold your stuff for you.

836
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:52,262
So, how do they fit?

837
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:54,498
They look like they're pretty comfortable.

838
00:48:54,585 --> 00:48:56,643
They are. I'm okay now.

839
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:58,131
That's wonderful.

840
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,355
They look really good on you, Azu-nyan.

841
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,357
Look there! Suishi!

842
00:49:05,852 --> 00:49:07,235
It's kaiten sushi.

843
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:08,172
It spins?

844
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,045
Yes.

845
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:12,318
Mugi, you've never been to one before?

846
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:14,297
Then, we should go in.

847
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:15,663
But why in London?

848
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:17,976
Because it happens to be here in London.

849
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:21,158
Alright now, let's just see what you guys can do.

850
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,772
London!

851
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:30,528
Look at this place.

852
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,140
It's like really, really fancy.

853
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,973
The sushi's moving!

854
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,401
It's so strange.

855
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,165
I've a bad feeling.

856
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,215
What's wrong? Is the airport trauma's back?

857
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:45,337
It's a little different in here from what I expected.

858
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:49,111
I imagined ballerina-like
sushi spinning around and around.

859
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:51,009
Look they have a stage.

860
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:51,574
'ello.

861
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,745
You're the birds from Japan right-o?

862
00:49:56,397 --> 00:50:00,630
I understoof the word "from". And also "Japan".

863
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:02,699
Y-Yes!

864
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:05,271
I'm the govenor of this establishment.

865
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,671
You're the ones who'll be songbirding today, right-o?

866
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:13,122
Um... Uh... Yes!

867
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:14,077
Very tall!

868
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,893
Welcome to my sushi bar!

869
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:17,433
Yes.

870
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,250
Would you stop saying "yes" to everything?

871
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:23,126
I would but he seems happy to see us.

872
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,452
Shall we to work?

873
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:25,930
Y-Yes.

874
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,970
Wow, I guess in London, they wear
happi coats whenever they eat sushi.

875
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:38,084
Kind of like the aprons at a Korean barbecue.

876
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,200
Alright loves, time for you to get cracking.

877
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:48,253
Geeta!

878
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:50,127
W-What's happening?

879
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,709
Oh my gosh!

880
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:52,583
Mugi-chan?

881
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:53,234
Mugi!

882
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:58,279
Excuse me, please!

883
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:07,791
Oh good, Mugi-chan must be explaining to
them that we only came here to eat sushi.

884
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,801
Leave it to Mugi to take care of things like...

885
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:11,935
...wait a second!

886
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,744
What did you do, Mugi?

887
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,738
There wasn't a keyboard up there.

888
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:21,740
Okay let me handle this.

889
00:51:21,963 --> 00:51:22,908
Hey you!

890
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:24,816
I am bucho!

891
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:27,493
We are okyakusan.

892
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,892
Enso , not happening.

893
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,880
Rit-chan, you're speaking to him in mostly Japanese.

894
00:51:33,783 --> 00:51:35,715
Try again! You can do it.

895
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:42,356
I love sushi.

896
00:51:43,713 --> 00:51:45,448
London is intense.

897
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,806
Rit-chan, he's still looking at us.

898
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,394
You know, I don't think we're gonna get out of doing this.

899
00:51:53,228 --> 00:51:55,945
Well then, we're just gonna have to do it.

900
00:51:56,143 --> 00:52:00,712
Yeah, you're right. They may
not let us eat here otherwise.

901
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:03,887
This is an awful lot to go through just to get some sushi.

902
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:05,162
What'll we play?

903
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:06,860
Yui? What do you think?

904
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,467
Um I...

905
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,316
um...

906
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,193
"Curry, then Rice"?

907
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:20,606
At a sushi place?

908
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,338
Yeah, there's rice here.

909
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:27,503
And he looks like a nice person.

910
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:37,887
Let's go!

911
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,491
Who is that person?

912
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:41,391
Please don't leave us behind.

913
00:52:41,517 --> 00:52:45,417
Oh gosh, I'm do sorry. I guess
I just got a little pumped up.

914
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,676
I think we'd better hurry, though.

915
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:54,768
Oh no, Azu-nyan, you sound
like you're about a halftone off.

916
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:59,102
Wait I need time to tune up.
Never mind, I'll just tune it to you.

917
00:52:59,127 --> 00:52:59,978
Okay.

918
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:23,617
One, two, one two three four!

919
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,973
Hello. We're After-school Tea Time!

920
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:33,156
Hurray! Nice!

921
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,240
Thank you! Arigato gozaimashita!

922
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:37,407
That was brilliant!

923
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:38,948
Really blinding!

924
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:40,118
Right!

925
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:41,881
Thank you! Thank you all.

926
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:44,147
But uh what about the sushi?

927
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:47,053
Thank you! You're brilliant, Love Crisis!

928
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,522
That tall man...

929
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:51,659
what was it he called us again?

930
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,544
I think he said "Love Crisis".

931
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,477
I'm pretty sure I've heard that name before.

932
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:00,669
Ritsu isn't that your friend's band?

933
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:01,662
That's right.

934
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:07,449
I guess that makes them "Love Crisis
of Japan" since they're not here.

935
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:11,741
I knew it. Revolving things are always bad.

936
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,468
What's more...

937
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:16,385
I'm really hungry.

938
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,426
Be quiet.

939
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,103
It's too late for that.

940
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,785
I want sushi.

941
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:23,518
Please give us some.

942
00:55:23,804 --> 00:55:27,189
I-I don't have the guts to go back in there.

943
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:32,615
Does everyone have to perform before
they're allowed to eat in this country?

944
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,175
Well we may as well get moving and get to our hotel.

945
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:38,568
I agree.

946
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,943
What is with this stupid sushi place, anyway?

947
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:44,174
Ritsu? Mio?

948
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:45,442
Uh yes?

949
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:47,758
What a surprise! Are you on vacation?

950
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:50,380
Yes, we're all sightseeing.

951
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,570
You came together.

952
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,175
Yep, we did!

953
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:56,982
I think my English is really improving.

954
00:55:57,293 --> 00:55:59,174
But they're speaking Japanese.

955
00:56:00,842 --> 00:56:01,899
Maki?!

956
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,760
Love Crisis Japan!

957
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:08,025
What are you doing here in England!? I'm so confused!

958
00:56:08,183 --> 00:56:10,329
It's so good to see you!

959
00:56:10,354 --> 00:56:12,301
Hey, what's going on?

960
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:17,240
We just went in there to try out their sushi
but they told us that we had to perform first.

961
00:56:17,512 --> 00:56:21,274
So we went up there and played but
they didn't feed us. Maybe we stunk.

962
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:22,696
Really? You are kidding!

963
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,501
We're booked to perform here tonight
to celebrate their big grand opening.

964
00:56:27,557 --> 00:56:31,147
I get it now! They mistook us for Love Crisis!

965
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,156
Mugi-chan, nice deduction.

966
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:35,317
Remember Ms. Kawakami?

967
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:37,137
You mean from the music club?

968
00:56:37,232 --> 00:56:40,147
Yeah. She recommended us to these guys for this gig.

969
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:43,206
It turns out she's good friends with the manager here.

970
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,505
I know it's a small world but what are the odds?

971
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:49,657
Wow, it's kind of trippy.

972
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:53,643
Wait, we've got a problem, they
think you guys played the gig already.

973
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:56,246
Oh man, you're right. We'll go talk to them.

974
00:56:56,284 --> 00:56:57,664
Okay. See ya.

975
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,055
See ya. Bye.

976
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,977
They're so cool.

977
00:57:02,734 --> 00:57:03,765
They are.

978
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,235
Oh boy, we finally, got checked in.

979
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,724
At last, it's just the two of us, right Azu-nyan?

980
00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:17,530
Yeah, it's been a tiring day.

981
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:21,571
I'm really hungry and I want to take a nice hot bath.

982
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:22,906
Yes, I know. It was really cold.

983
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:24,575
Yes, I know. It was really cold.

984
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:29,485
What are we gonna do about dinner tonight?

985
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:33,712
This, huh?

986
00:57:35,422 --> 00:57:37,122
Thank you, Ui!

987
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:39,989
We'll need to bring her back a really nice present.

988
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,484
Aw look, we're gonna need a microwave for this one.

989
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,197
So what were you guys doing in here before we came over?

990
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:48,767
Taking photos, of course.

991
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,888
In school uniforms?

992
00:57:49,943 --> 00:57:52,445
Well that's why we brought them, silly.

993
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,918
Whatever makes you happy, Ritsu.

994
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:57,150
Yeah, well you changed quickly, too, Mio.

995
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,866
Ah, that felt great.

996
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,879
Oh wow, Ui is always so prepared.

997
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:04,863
That's my little sister.

998
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,207
What's wrong?

999
00:58:08,302 --> 00:58:10,496
It blew fire at me.

1000
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:13,490
Scary!  Yui, you need to use a power converter.

1001
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:16,549
No. I'm way too scared now.

1002
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:19,562
Let's just eat dinner.

1003
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:27,277
Azu-nyan, I flunked my senior year!

1004
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,006
Now you and I get to be classmates!

1005
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:31,114
Oh no!

1006
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:35,420
Wait a minute, does that mean
you're not my senpai anymore?

1007
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:38,231
No way. Consider us equals now!

1008
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:39,415
Really?

1009
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:40,391
Mhm.

1010
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:42,664
No formalities?

1011
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,432
Nope, we're both the same now!

1012
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:46,723
Stop that, Yui! Please!

1013
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:48,291
What? Just like that?

1014
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,206
It just all seems really strange.

1015
00:58:50,237 --> 00:58:53,861
It may seem pretty strange to you right
now, but you'd better get used to it.

1016
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:57,602
We're classmates now. We're classmates now.

1017
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:12,778
Huh?

1018
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,900
What's this?

1019
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,181
Yui's scaring me.

1020
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,497
Good night.

1021
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,714
What a relief.

1022
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:10,727
There's something that I really want
to see since we're here in England.

1023
01:01:11,665 --> 01:01:13,587
Ritsu used it in the school play.

1024
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,701
Oh, that grave, right?

1025
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:20,214
Wow! The Occult Club's replica was really accurate.

1026
01:01:20,365 --> 01:01:21,411
What passion.

1027
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,978
This is a replica, too.

1028
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:25,275
We've walked so much.

1029
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:26,608
Let's rest a bit.

1030
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:30,226
Well there should be a tearoom somewhere near by here.

1031
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:34,619
Afternoon tea! That's the heart
and soul of The Light Music Club!

1032
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,994
I can't believe you need a reservation.

1033
01:01:50,237 --> 01:01:52,381
It's so big!

1034
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,742
It's revolving.

1035
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:56,854
Revolving.

1036
01:01:57,116 --> 01:01:58,715
I think we should ride it!

1037
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:02,322
Come on, Mugi-chan! You too Mio-chan?

1038
01:02:02,703 --> 01:02:06,634
No, I think I'll just stay here
and keep and eye on everyone's stuff.

1039
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:09,614
You guys go ahead and have fun.

1040
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:11,594
Mio?

1041
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:12,495
Mio-chan.

1042
01:02:12,586 --> 01:02:14,159
Aw come on, chicken.

1043
01:02:14,254 --> 01:02:16,854
No! I don't want to go on anything that's revolving!

1044
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,134
It's okay. We'll all be with you.

1045
01:02:19,371 --> 01:02:20,818
Get a grip, Mio-chan.

1046
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:22,344
Nothing revolving!

1047
01:02:22,424 --> 01:02:23,622
Wow look at that!

1048
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,735
I can see all of London!

1049
01:02:26,506 --> 01:02:28,524
Mio-chan's sure enjoying herself.

1050
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:31,925
Yep, you really can't see something
revolve if you're riding on it.

1051
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:34,180
This is awesome!

1052
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,929
Where's my camera?

1053
01:02:36,932 --> 01:02:39,966
Hey, Mio, I'll hold your stuff for you!

1054
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:46,430
Hey Rit-chan, look over there!

1055
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:53,503
Mugi, would you mind holding this for me, for a minute?

1056
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:54,592
No problem.  Wow this is delicious.

1057
01:02:54,894 --> 01:02:56,211
It's so delicious.

1058
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,975
See ya later.

1059
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,243
G'night!

1060
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:01,577
I think I'll join them.

1061
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:03,220
But you're with me, Azu-nyan.

1062
01:03:05,903 --> 01:03:08,097
I'm home!

1063
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:18,315
I'm sorry! Are you all right, Yui?!

1064
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,432
But you see... I'm- I'm just not like that!

1065
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,035
Not like what?

1066
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:28,580
I was just going to hug and kiss my Geeta.

1067
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:29,652
What?

1068
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,952
Forgive me! I had the wrong idea! I'm so sorry!

1069
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:42,394
That's okay. I guess the self-defense
book Ui gave me a few weeks ago came in handy.

1070
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:45,039
Huh? Going to bed already?

1071
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,187
I guess you're really tired.

1072
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,720
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

1073
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:56,521
I'm so sorry.

1074
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,648
All right that's enough. We're not here
to sit around looking at photos all night.

1075
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:19,874
Well then, has anyone come up
with a concept for Azusa's song?

1076
01:04:20,382 --> 01:04:22,399
Not a thing yet.

1077
01:04:22,653 --> 01:04:26,069
I expected London to inspire a powerful song.

1078
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:28,491
At least an idea for one.

1079
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:34,078
Like ?Big Ben! The London Eye! The Thames River!?

1080
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:35,390
Like that.

1081
01:04:35,532 --> 01:04:39,258
Yui, you're just reciting the famous sites in a big voice.

1082
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,454
I know, but I just really want to
write the absolute best song ever.

1083
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:49,427
Something that will be remembered forever and will
energize people who hear it long after we're all gone.

1084
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:51,397
Yes, an eternal classic.

1085
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,295
Eternal, huh?

1086
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:58,731
What?

1087
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,323
I just realized I forgot my room key back in my room.

1088
01:05:06,578 --> 01:05:08,371
Can't you just enter from there?

1089
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:11,901
That's strange.

1090
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,948
A candy trail can be useful after all.

1091
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,759
Alright, goodnight everybody,
I'm going back to Azu-nyan now.

1092
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:31,827
You're dropping your candy, you know.

1093
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:35,062
That's alright, you can have it. Enjoy.

1094
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:36,254
Good night, Yui.

1095
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:37,233
Good night.

1096
01:05:37,405 --> 01:05:39,025
She's so scattered.

1097
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:42,960
Who could it be at this hour?

1098
01:05:44,885 --> 01:05:47,528
The peep hole's too high!

1099
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,424
Put everything away! It's Azusa!

1100
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:55,084
Coming! Welcome!

1101
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,131
Evening.

1102
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,186
Azusa?

1103
01:05:57,313 --> 01:05:58,463
What's up?

1104
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:10,028
Sorry to disturb you.

1105
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:22,701
We got big trouble!

1106
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:24,387
Big trouble! Big trouble!

1107
01:06:24,442 --> 01:06:25,474
Calm down, Yui.

1108
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:26,738
Azu-nyan's missing!

1109
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,088
She was just here.

1110
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:30,431
But she went back to your room.

1111
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,471
She what?

1112
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,663
Something is very wrong, Senpai!

1113
01:06:39,688 --> 01:06:40,680
She's awake.

1114
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:42,395
Yui-senpai is gone!

1115
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,712
Rit-chan, she's really missing!

1116
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,271
Big trouble, big trouble!

1117
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:51,774
Big trouble, Azu-nyan!

1118
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:53,738
Azu-nyan's gone missing!

1119
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,949
Wait, you're here.

1120
01:06:56,776 --> 01:07:00,024
Where'd you go? I was so worried about you!

1121
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:01,295
Um... well...

1122
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:04,371
It's the phone.

1123
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:05,316
Who is it?

1124
01:07:05,483 --> 01:07:06,989
Front desk maybe?

1125
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,324
At this hour?

1126
01:07:08,476 --> 01:07:10,202
Maybe the call's from Japan?

1127
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:12,608
But it's only 6 a.m. in Japan.

1128
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,406
Yui's really got the time difference down.

1129
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:19,268
Yes uh, hello?

1130
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:22,239
Yes? Oh yes I understand, of course.

1131
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:23,962
A killer what?!

1132
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:27,410
What do you know? They hung up before I could answer it.

1133
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:30,848
I wonder who it was?

1134
01:07:31,018 --> 01:07:34,132
I'm sure if it's really important,
they'll try calling us again.

1135
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:35,707
Yes, that's true.

1136
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,005
An eternal song.

1137
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:51,898
Wait a minute, does that mean
you're not my senpai anymore?

1138
01:07:52,023 --> 01:07:53,056
Azu-nyan?

1139
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,206
Must be dreaming.

1140
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:06,126
Senpai, you really should blink once in a while.

1141
01:08:06,569 --> 01:08:08,626
A song for Azu-nyan.

1142
01:08:09,522 --> 01:08:10,554
Hello.

1143
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,684
Would you stop staring at me?

1144
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,390
It's annoying.

1145
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:19,773
Oops, now she's mad.

1146
01:08:21,753 --> 01:08:25,187
I just can't think of anything good for a song.

1147
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,359
I really have to dump that phrase.

1148
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:40,599
That's lame.

1149
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,589
Yui-senpai!

1150
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:47,709
We're leaving in just a few minutes!

1151
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:49,109
Azu-nyan!

1152
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,536
Now this is London.

1153
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,222
Oh look, they've got Yui's guitar!

1154
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:02,145
Hey, yeah they do!

1155
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,772
A song for Azu-nyan. I need something really big.

1156
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:10,969
Big, ?big, very big.?

1157
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:12,500
That's so lame.

1158
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,243
A cool song for Azu-nyan.

1159
01:09:25,357 --> 01:09:28,833
A song as cool as London itself.

1160
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,813
It's Ms. Kawakami.

1161
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,653
How's it going? Doing good?

1162
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,815
Hey I'm next. Alright?

1163
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:47,639
Maki called me today and told me that
you guys are over there in London, too?

1164
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:48,481
That's right.

1165
01:09:48,846 --> 01:09:51,171
Good, then I have a favor to ask.

1166
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:56,559
There's going to be an event introducing
Japanese pop culture over there.

1167
01:09:56,927 --> 01:10:00,072
Love Crisis and Black Frill will be performing at it.

1168
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:02,798
Can I ask you guys to perform too?

1169
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:05,681
Wait pop corn?

1170
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:06,645
Perform.

1171
01:10:07,032 --> 01:10:07,897
It's tomorrow afternoon.

1172
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:09,145
Will you still be there?

1173
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:10,125
Ah, yeah.

1174
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:13,604
Excellent, I'll email you all the details later.

1175
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:21,508
She's introducing us as an
all-girls' high school music group.

1176
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:23,454
I'm curious.

1177
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:28,499
Does email from Japan have to be sent into the
past in order to get here when its suppose to?

1178
01:10:28,665 --> 01:10:35,093
But here in London it's today, and
back home in Japan, it's tomorrow already.

1179
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:36,158
Yeah, but...

1180
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,575
What are we going to do?

1181
01:10:38,678 --> 01:10:40,131
This is all so sudden.

1182
01:10:41,381 --> 01:10:45,201
That means the email we send from
here is being sent into the future!

1183
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:49,801
Yui-senpai, this is really getting
confusing. Could you please be quiet?

1184
01:10:49,896 --> 01:10:51,524
Should we refuse?

1185
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,971
But I really want to perform.

1186
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,433
Don't you?

1187
01:10:57,052 --> 01:11:00,486
I'm not sure but this seems like a stroke of luck.

1188
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:05,109
I mean it! It'll be okay! Not like
when we played at that sushi place.

1189
01:11:05,212 --> 01:11:07,874
But Yui-senpai that's not what we're worried about.

1190
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:09,930
I want to do it, too!

1191
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,001
Okay!

1192
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,021
Then let's tell Ms. Kawakami.

1193
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:25,508
Come on, hurry up, Azu-nyan!

1194
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,837
Okay!

1195
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:31,959
Press "Send"!

1196
01:11:33,313 --> 01:11:36,148
There goes our email into the future!

1197
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,037
We're suppose to go home tomorrow.

1198
01:11:41,307 --> 01:11:42,833
Oh, yeah that's right.

1199
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:45,192
Will we be able to make the flight?

1200
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:49,186
What time do we need to be there?

1201
01:11:49,211 --> 01:11:51,395
We need to be at the airport by 5 o'clock.

1202
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,043
According to this the show is at 4.

1203
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:55,569
Then we're okay!

1204
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,279
No problem.

1205
01:11:57,464 --> 01:11:59,048
Is that a peace sign?

1206
01:11:59,117 --> 01:12:01,392
Mhm. Peace. Peace.

1207
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,347
Yui-senpai's "no problem" sounds very dangerous to me.

1208
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,424
I translated a song into English for tomorrow.

1209
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:11,830
What?  We're singing in English?

1210
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:13,362
For an international audience.

1211
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:14,778
You sure about this?

1212
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:16,441
How did you translate it?

1213
01:12:17,757 --> 01:12:18,892
Check it out...

1214
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,279
"Gohan wa sugoi yo" is "Rice is super."

1215
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:25,258
Very direct translation.

1216
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,141
"Goes with anything" Huh?

1217
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:29,611
The word "Batchiri" just fit!

1218
01:12:29,866 --> 01:12:32,400
Yeah but "batchiri" is a Japanese word.

1219
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:34,759
"Mushiro rice is a nice side dish"

1220
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:38,254
"Mushiro" is "not so much A as B" ryme.

1221
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,496
I guess technically you're right.

1222
01:12:40,646 --> 01:12:43,238
Not so much A "Azu-nyan".

1223
01:12:44,546 --> 01:12:48,949
Wait a minute, rice is not so much
a main dish as it is a side dish.

1224
01:12:49,053 --> 01:12:52,201
But isn't rice suppose to be a main dish sometimes?

1225
01:12:52,376 --> 01:12:54,458
Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

1226
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:56,432
Whatever. Just move on.

1227
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:07,937
I just had a flash! About Azu-nyan's song. What was it?

1228
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:11,535
And it felt like a major discovery, too.

1229
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:17,426
You mean you're not my senpai anymore?

1230
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:28,339
Didn't sleep well, Azu-nyan?

1231
01:13:28,427 --> 01:13:31,874
No, I kept having really strange dreams about you all not.

1232
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:35,284
Really? Dreams about me?

1233
01:13:35,387 --> 01:13:38,447
Yeah, very, very strange dreams.

1234
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,496
I'm not telling, though.

1235
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:44,007
Wait just a second.

1236
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:46,699
What is it, Mugi-chan?

1237
01:13:48,368 --> 01:13:50,037
Mugi-chan!

1238
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:52,194
Wait a minute, is that your keyboard?

1239
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:55,155
You all brought your instruments so I just thought...

1240
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,902
I really envy the rich.

1241
01:13:57,053 --> 01:13:59,524
Now we're a complete band again!

1242
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:16,589
It still looks so huge.

1243
01:14:16,906 --> 01:14:18,742
And it's still revolving.

1244
01:14:19,315 --> 01:14:21,132
That must be the place.

1245
01:14:32,162 --> 01:14:33,314
Where do we go?

1246
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:35,849
Look, they have a yakisoba stand!

1247
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,884
How much you want to bet we won't be able to eat any.

1248
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:43,363
Hey, Maki!

1249
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,194
Yo, Ritsu!

1250
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,373
So what time are you guys going on?

1251
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,145
We're going up at 3:30

1252
01:14:52,296 --> 01:14:53,916
That's right before we go on.

1253
01:14:54,075 --> 01:14:55,917
When does Black Frill go on?

1254
01:14:57,427 --> 01:14:58,722
They go on at 4?

1255
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,560
But I thought we were suppose to go on at 4?

1256
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,037
Mhm that's right.

1257
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:05,294
Rit-chan, did we make a mistake?

1258
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:08,806
No mistake, that's when you're on.

1259
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:13,617
Our band and Black Frill are going to be
performing over there at the indoor stage.

1260
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,912
And you guys are gonna be
performing over on the outdoor stage.

1261
01:15:17,196 --> 01:15:18,236
Outdoor?

1262
01:15:18,855 --> 01:15:19,839
Not here.

1263
01:15:19,885 --> 01:15:21,158
But here?

1264
01:15:27,832 --> 01:15:29,611
What a great view.

1265
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:33,347
This is great! It'll be like a dream performing here.

1266
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:37,774
I thought we were getting the shaft being
sent outside, but I think this is a lot better.

1267
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,798
Hi. After School Tea Time?

1268
01:15:41,155 --> 01:15:41,981
Yes?

1269
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:44,762
Could you get your kits set up now, please?

1270
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:46,241
Say what?

1271
01:15:46,445 --> 01:15:48,644
He wants for us to set up out instruments.

1272
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,525
Are we sure I can plug this in?

1273
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,820
Will it spew flames at me?

1274
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:22,428
Well of course it won't, it's
perfectly safe to plug it in. Right Mio?

1275
01:16:22,915 --> 01:16:26,100
Oh man, I've got a bad feeling about this.

1276
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:28,108
You too, Senpai?

1277
01:16:29,858 --> 01:16:32,415
Do you think I can ask someone before I do it?

1278
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,403
Wait, you mean one of the visitors?

1279
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:37,892
Yui, you want me to call one of the show staff?

1280
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:41,919
Just plug the damn thing in!

1281
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,196
Geeta!

1282
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:46,609
Owie

1283
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:54,758
Think about it, that guitar
wasn't even made in Japan, was it?

1284
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,460
Are you a spirit?

1285
01:16:57,642 --> 01:16:58,747
Why're you here?

1286
01:16:58,985 --> 01:17:02,551
I'm not a ghost! What's the matter with you?

1287
01:17:02,877 --> 01:17:04,353
Why are you in London?

1288
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:05,404
Honeymoon?

1289
01:17:05,897 --> 01:17:08,065
I had some free miles to us.

1290
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:12,339
I have to use the miles I racked up
last year from using my credit card,

1291
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:14,771
before they expire and I lose them for good.

1292
01:17:15,095 --> 01:17:17,576
Plus, I am the Light Music Club adviser.

1293
01:17:17,743 --> 01:17:18,902
When'd you get here?

1294
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,341
Yesterday morning.

1295
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:21,206
And returning?

1296
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,176
Tonight.

1297
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:23,804
I really envy adults.

1298
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:25,862
You should've told us you were coming here.

1299
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:29,445
I called your hotel the other
night but you guys didn't answer.

1300
01:17:29,627 --> 01:17:31,756
Oh, that was you, Sawa-chan.

1301
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:35,384
Oh! And I brought some costumes for the show!

1302
01:17:35,506 --> 01:17:37,786
They're Japanese lady ninjas!

1303
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:38,986
"Kunoichi"?!

1304
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,418
Wow! Bravo! Bravo!

1305
01:17:41,484 --> 01:17:43,021
Please don't do that.

1306
01:17:43,046 --> 01:17:44,292
Look. Look!

1307
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,105
It's Nodoka!

1308
01:17:46,598 --> 01:17:47,796
Ui, too?

1309
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:49,154
And Jun!

1310
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,458
No, thanks.

1311
01:17:52,697 --> 01:17:55,163
Alright, we're on standby, girls.

1312
01:18:23,082 --> 01:18:26,259
Thanks everybody! We had a blast here in London!

1313
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,866
It really was the bees knees!

1314
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:31,311
Did I say that that right?

1315
01:18:31,755 --> 01:18:34,164
Yui, hurry up, we've got a plane to catch.

1316
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:34,949
Oh!

1317
01:18:41,727 --> 01:18:43,537
Now for our last song.

1318
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:46,080
"Rice is a Sidedish"!

1319
01:18:46,715 --> 01:18:48,153
One two three four!

1320
01:19:04,558 --> 01:19:07,764
After all that... She's singing in Japanese.

1321
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,623
She switched to English.

1322
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:31,664
Senpai.

1323
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,149
Sky high!

1324
01:21:17,168 --> 01:21:19,312
What was with that "sky high" bit all about?

1325
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:23,173
I just got really excited. And that baby was so cute.

1326
01:21:23,355 --> 01:21:25,650
I agree with Yui-senpai about the baby but...

1327
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:27,612
You mean the one sitting in front?

1328
01:21:27,637 --> 01:21:29,766
I knew we'd be rushing to the airport!

1329
01:21:29,971 --> 01:21:32,920
I wanted to end our concert in real style!

1330
01:21:32,992 --> 01:21:34,229
Hey taxi!

1331
01:21:42,993 --> 01:21:44,311
She's asleep.

1332
01:21:44,707 --> 01:21:50,142
She's earned it. She's worked really hard being
our information guide the whole time we've been here.

1333
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:53,719
She must be exhausted.

1334
01:22:11,255 --> 01:22:12,325
Is that snow?

1335
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,127
Oh wow it is!

1336
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:29,441
You know, I just realized something amazing.

1337
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:38,420
We can just write one of our usual songs for her.

1338
01:22:38,688 --> 01:22:40,802
Yeah well it took you long enough.

1339
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,718
That's what I've been thinking, too, Yui.

1340
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,292
You too, Mugi-chan?

1341
01:22:46,038 --> 01:22:47,849
I realized it ages ago.

1342
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:07,215
Nodoka-chan, go ahead and take whatever you like.

1343
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:09,746
There's like 10 years worth here.

1344
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,388
She never did get the chance
to have afternoon tea in London.

1345
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:14,956
Aw that's too bad.

1346
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:16,458
Yeah, I know.

1347
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:18,841
But you got to play your music, right?

1348
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:21,096
I wish I could've been there to see it.

1349
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,702
It was such a blast.

1350
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:25,737
Your whole class said they
wished they could've been there.

1351
01:23:26,188 --> 01:23:27,110
Really?

1352
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,739
Yui, I heard you rocked out in London.

1353
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:31,973
Yeah, how was it?

1354
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:33,254
What did you play?

1355
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:35,009
"Rice is a Sidedish"!

1356
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:35,995
"Say what?"

1357
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:38,171
That's right, Ichigo!

1358
01:23:38,528 --> 01:23:41,681
I'd really like to hear you guys play one more time.

1359
01:23:41,864 --> 01:23:43,342
Any chance that'll happen?

1360
01:23:43,635 --> 01:23:45,937
The Jazz Club's doing a graduation concert.

1361
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:47,516
Really?!

1362
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:49,082
Great idea!

1363
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,464
We didn't think of that?

1364
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:51,822
Come on let's do it.

1365
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:53,617
Alright! Where?

1366
01:23:54,069 --> 01:23:55,643
The club room?

1367
01:23:56,478 --> 01:23:57,543
This is great! Think we can make some requests?

1368
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,178
This is great! Think we can make some requests?

1369
01:24:01,382 --> 01:24:02,937
A concert in class?

1370
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,543
That's right on the last day of school.

1371
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:08,127
You know a final memory of high school.

1372
01:24:08,928 --> 01:24:11,702
I did something just like that when I was...

1373
01:24:12,306 --> 01:24:16,420
No way! You'll bother all the other
classes with the noise you'll make.

1374
01:24:16,729 --> 01:24:20,561
The choir and wind orchestra don't
even perform in their classroom, okay?

1375
01:24:20,648 --> 01:24:22,847
What the heck's gotten into you, Sawa-chan?

1376
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:26,550
You can't expect me to keep giving
you special treatment, understand?

1377
01:24:27,153 --> 01:24:28,051
It's final!

1378
01:24:28,422 --> 01:24:29,845
The answer is no!

1379
01:24:36,804 --> 01:24:38,460
We hear you, Sawa-chan.

1380
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,659
Good, I'm glad I made my point.

1381
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:42,001
See you tomorrow.

1382
01:24:45,425 --> 01:24:49,524
I remember we got in a lot of
trouble for playing in class.

1383
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:54,069
And we played really hard rock,
not like the music those girls play.

1384
01:24:54,382 --> 01:24:56,072
Their music is all fluff.

1385
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,026
I doubt they could handle the scolding we got.

1386
01:24:59,407 --> 01:25:00,702
They'd be crushed.

1387
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:02,495
I have to protect them!

1388
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:08,572
Make sure your corsages are finished by tomorrow.

1389
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:10,361
Okay.

1390
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,107
Azusa, lend me some scissors.

1391
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,347
Sure. Here you go.

1392
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:17,561
Thank you.

1393
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:20,953
Azusa?

1394
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:22,764
Hm? What?

1395
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,158
You do really funny things.

1396
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:28,389
Oh my gosh. No, I didn't do that!

1397
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,007
Ui, look what Azusa did!

1398
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:33,915
What did she do?

1399
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,780
Geeze, that wasn't me.

1400
01:25:39,235 --> 01:25:40,139
Hi!

1401
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,732
A live show in the classroom?

1402
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:46,157
Yeah. We'll be doing it in our own classroom so...

1403
01:25:46,324 --> 01:25:49,151
the four of us were thinking that it would just...

1404
01:25:49,402 --> 01:25:51,581
be the four of us performing.

1405
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:54,220
Absolutely not.

1406
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:56,254
Cause I want to perform too.

1407
01:25:56,388 --> 01:25:57,390
What you do?

1408
01:25:57,588 --> 01:25:58,207
Yes.

1409
01:25:59,065 --> 01:26:03,786
It'll be the last time that I'll be able to perform
with you guys in front of everyone that we know.

1410
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,463
Together here at school.

1411
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:07,338
I'm so glad.

1412
01:26:07,457 --> 01:26:09,197
Thank you, Azu-nyan!

1413
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:12,517
So when is this big live show going to happen?

1414
01:26:17,693 --> 01:26:19,997
It's here. The last day of school.

1415
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:23,466
And I am going to protect those girls!

1416
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,572
I think we'll need another row.

1417
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:30,123
On the desks?

1418
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:33,408
Yeah, we'll wipe them off later.

1419
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:01,561
Oh, these guys are cool!

1420
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,973
You're early today, Ms. Yamanaka.

1421
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:11,857
Well I- I have a lot to do before school's out.

1422
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:14,623
What's all the sound?

1423
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:17,658
That? Perhaps they're doing construction.

1424
01:27:17,754 --> 01:27:20,479
Well that's pretty lively construction if you ask me.

1425
01:27:22,519 --> 01:27:26,533
Like heck it is. I knew you had to be up to
something to be here this early in the day!

1426
01:27:26,558 --> 01:27:27,541
No, wait!

1427
01:27:28,087 --> 01:27:29,217
Live show?

1428
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,404
Oh cool! Let's go see!

1429
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:40,103
Okay, this next song will be our last one.

1430
01:27:52,697 --> 01:27:53,309
Mornig.

1431
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:55,439
I wish we could do this everyday!

1432
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:19,694
No, please! Wait!

1433
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:21,543
Out of the question.

1434
01:28:21,598 --> 01:28:24,801
They'll be done by the time homeroom starts. I promise!

1435
01:28:55,891 --> 01:28:57,493
Let go of me!

1436
01:28:58,646 --> 01:29:00,760
Could you take a picture and send it to me?

1437
01:29:00,824 --> 01:29:01,776
Okay.

1438
01:30:01,258 --> 01:30:05,295
Unlike you guys long ago, they're cute and they play well.

1439
01:31:12,938 --> 01:31:16,928
Well, all that's left to do is to finish Azu-nyan's song.

1440
01:31:17,047 --> 01:31:19,739
All that's left? That's the most important thing.

1441
01:31:20,112 --> 01:31:22,474
Oh yeah, I came up with a melody.

1442
01:31:22,555 --> 01:31:23,498
Let's hear it.

1443
01:31:51,783 --> 01:31:54,019
Mugi, this is amazing.

1444
01:31:55,768 --> 01:31:58,323
We just have to put some lyrics to it and it's done.

1445
01:31:58,537 --> 01:31:59,164
Yeah.

1446
01:32:00,716 --> 01:32:04,718
I can't believe how much time we've
spent with Azu-nyan these past two years.

1447
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:07,511
She's our biggest treasure.

1448
01:32:07,716 --> 01:32:09,315
Let's use that.

1449
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:13,914
See you tomorrow.

1450
01:32:14,009 --> 01:32:15,304
Bye!  Later.

1451
01:32:28,827 --> 01:32:30,060
Dinner's ready!

1452
01:32:33,968 --> 01:32:34,682
What?

1453
01:32:34,914 --> 01:32:36,140
You've really grown.

1454
01:32:36,228 --> 01:32:37,035
Really?

1455
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:56,333
Is it done?

1456
01:32:57,295 --> 01:32:58,263
It's all done.

1457
01:32:59,327 --> 01:33:01,543
That's great. Just in time.

1458
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:05,739
Yui, you kept this quiet right?
You haven't let on to Azusa?

1459
01:33:05,866 --> 01:33:08,576
I haven't said a word. I haven't even told Ui.

1460
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:11,000
You know what?

1461
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:13,042
No. What?

1462
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:15,449
The girls are acting strange.

1463
01:33:16,426 --> 01:33:17,856
Something's going on.

1464
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:20,169
Yeah well, they've always been strange.

1465
01:33:24,259 --> 01:33:25,961
That's not what I mean.

1466
01:33:26,723 --> 01:33:28,534
So  how're they strange?

1467
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:33,379
Whenever I walk in, they suddenly
stop everything they're doing.

1468
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,272
That is strange.

1469
01:33:36,357 --> 01:33:40,102
When I try to ask them about it,
they look away and change the subject.

1470
01:33:40,505 --> 01:33:43,559
They're probably communicating with aliens.

1471
01:33:44,067 --> 01:33:44,877
No way.

1472
01:33:45,091 --> 01:33:49,287
Or they're eating lots of candy behind
your back and they don't want you to know.

1473
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:50,755
I wouldn't put it past them.

1474
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:53,893
I wouldn't put it past them.

1475
01:33:55,204 --> 01:33:57,309
It's like they're hiding something.

1476
01:33:59,852 --> 01:34:02,984
Hey, Ui? You don't suppose...

1477
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:06,497
Yui's planning to stay back a year, do you?

1478
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:08,792
No of course not.

1479
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:09,912
Are you sure?

1480
01:34:10,101 --> 01:34:13,082
Yes, I'm positive. She's buying tights for graduation.

1481
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:14,741
I see.

1482
01:34:15,201 --> 01:34:18,486
I know, maybe she didn't get into a college.

1483
01:34:18,684 --> 01:34:20,698
Huh?!  No, she got in.

1484
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:23,433
Then what is it?

1485
01:34:29,922 --> 01:34:32,099
Don't worry about it, Azusa-chan.

1486
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:37,584
Even so... we all still met

1487
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:42,879
and you were so wonderful.

1488
01:34:47,485 --> 01:34:50,802
There's still something missing with these lyrics.

1489
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,572
Big Sis, can I come in?

1490
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,034
Yes.

1491
01:35:00,393 --> 01:35:01,210
Wait!

1492
01:35:01,935 --> 01:35:03,371
Hold on a sec!

1493
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:10,292
Okay, come in.

1494
01:35:16,004 --> 01:35:19,286
Big Sis, you'll get guitar lines on your face again.

1495
01:35:19,622 --> 01:35:21,001
Oh yeah, thanks.

1496
01:35:21,168 --> 01:35:23,171
I hate it when that happens.

1497
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:26,277
So are you ready for tomorrow? It's a big day.

1498
01:35:26,914 --> 01:35:27,363
Yup.

1499
01:35:29,002 --> 01:35:30,970
It's graduation at last.

1500
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:32,599
Better get to bed.

1501
01:35:32,798 --> 01:35:34,442
You, too, Ui.

1502
01:35:36,311 --> 01:35:36,964
Ui?

1503
01:35:37,249 --> 01:35:37,906
What?

1504
01:35:40,261 --> 01:35:41,100
Thank you.

1505
01:35:43,231 --> 01:35:46,479
Don't worry, I can graduate on my own.

1506
01:35:50,397 --> 01:35:51,191
Right!

1507
01:35:52,995 --> 01:35:54,164
Well, good night then.

1508
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:55,601
Good night, Sis.

1509
01:35:56,113 --> 01:35:57,690
Oh by the way, Ui?

1510
01:35:58,716 --> 01:35:59,628
What, Sis?

1511
01:35:59,884 --> 01:36:01,356
Once I'm in college,

1512
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,667
we can still get together for tea, right?

1513
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:08,314
Well yeah. Of course we can.

1514
01:36:08,536 --> 01:36:11,087
Really? I'm so glad.

1515
01:36:11,642 --> 01:36:13,723
Well, good night, Big Sis. Sleep tight.

1516
01:36:17,174 --> 01:36:18,180
Good night.

1517
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:36,052
Even so we all still met

1518
01:36:36,511 --> 01:36:41,132
a wonderful kitten girl.

1519
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:54,338
Come on! Come on!

1520
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:55,743
Wait up!

1521
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:56,998
Hurry up!

1522
01:37:20,512 --> 01:37:21,446
Yui!

1523
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,609
It was open!

1524
01:37:55,853 --> 01:37:57,066
Hey, Rit-chan?

1525
01:37:58,663 --> 01:38:00,513
You think we'll play this well?

1526
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:06,406
I don't think I've ever been this
nervous as I am right now in my life.

1527
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:10,418
Me, too.

1528
01:38:12,835 --> 01:38:14,813
My hands are so cold.

1529
01:38:16,536 --> 01:38:17,656
They are.

1530
01:38:19,794 --> 01:38:22,360
This is nerve-wracking.

1531
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,282
Oh no!

1532
01:38:26,259 --> 01:38:27,614
Should we call it off?

1533
01:38:27,698 --> 01:38:28,469
No way!

1534
01:38:29,257 --> 01:38:30,604
What will Azusa think?

1535
01:38:30,746 --> 01:38:32,665
She'll be thrilled, of course!

1536
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:39,333
I'm relieved that everyone's so nervous about this.

1537
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,627
Who wouldn't be?

1538
01:39:19,532 --> 01:39:24,549
"Give Me Wings" was the very first
song I ever heard you guys play.

1539
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:27,799
And that's how the Light Music Club got started.

1540
01:39:28,531 --> 01:39:30,511
And then Azusa joined us.

1541
01:39:30,566 --> 01:39:32,600
And provided a really big boost.

1542
01:39:33,124 --> 01:39:36,072
Azusa's "cutting" always keeps everything so sharp.

1543
01:39:36,128 --> 01:39:38,257
While Yui always goes for power.

1544
01:39:38,384 --> 01:39:39,592
Look who's talking.

1545
01:39:40,316 --> 01:39:41,482
You know what?

1546
01:39:42,222 --> 01:39:45,606
It was Azu-nyan who gave us our wings so we could fly.

1547
01:39:47,592 --> 01:39:53,544
She's a cute little angel who brought warmth, and
love and happiness to all of us for the past two years.

1548
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:54,955
An angel?

1549
01:39:55,145 --> 01:39:56,766
You know, you may be right.

1550
01:40:00,522 --> 01:40:01,257
What?

1551
01:40:14,027 --> 01:40:14,742
What do you think?

1552
01:40:14,892 --> 01:40:16,110
Perfect!

1553
01:40:16,249 --> 01:40:18,163
Don't you think it's a little corny?

1554
01:40:18,283 --> 01:40:20,142
No, I think it's just right!

1555
01:40:20,236 --> 01:40:22,866
Maybe this song will become Azu-nyan's wings.

1556
01:40:24,695 --> 01:40:25,854
It will!

1557
01:40:26,337 --> 01:40:27,601
At least, I hope.

1558
01:40:27,966 --> 01:40:30,670
It will! Because it's packed to the brim...

1559
01:40:30,952 --> 01:40:34,346
with all of our love for Azusa!

1560
01:40:36,357 --> 01:40:38,319
I just really hope she likes it.

1561
01:40:42,927 --> 01:40:44,338
Shall we have tea?

1562
01:40:44,552 --> 01:40:45,548
Sounds good.

1563
01:40:47,369 --> 01:40:48,290
Sure.

1564
01:40:49,985 --> 01:40:51,961
I'll take a sweet dumpling.

1565
01:40:52,175 --> 01:40:53,486
Those rock!

1566
01:40:54,566 --> 01:40:56,540
Oh! This one's for Azu-nyan.

1567
01:40:58,772 --> 01:41:00,978
So, how are we gonna do this?

1568
01:41:02,028 --> 01:41:07,174
As leader, I'll walk up and say,
"Azusa, there's a song I want you to hear."

1569
01:41:08,844 --> 01:41:10,030
Next comes Mugi.

1570
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,308
"We all worked together and wrote it for you."

1571
01:41:13,785 --> 01:41:15,239
I hope I don't flub it.

1572
01:41:15,342 --> 01:41:17,477
Well, you'd better not laugh, Mugi-chan.

1573
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:20,703
Wait a second.

1574
01:41:21,665 --> 01:41:24,146
Whenever we discuss this we always...

1575
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:27,235
Oh, Azusa.

1576
01:41:27,727 --> 01:41:28,967
Excuse me.

1577
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:33,448
I thought that maybe I'd make tea for you today.

1578
01:41:34,846 --> 01:41:36,188
Well, you can't.

1579
01:41:47,098 --> 01:41:49,322
Azu-nyan, can you come here?

1580
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:34,761
I see now.

1581
01:45:16,688 --> 01:45:19,212
I think Azu-nyan really liked her song.

1582
01:45:19,389 --> 01:45:20,262
Yeah!

1583
01:45:20,445 --> 01:45:23,411
Huh? Are those tears I see, Mio?

1584
01:45:23,459 --> 01:45:25,889
No, I just have a runny nose that's all.

1585
01:45:26,048 --> 01:45:28,407
After all, who's got time to cry, Mio?

1586
01:45:28,566 --> 01:45:31,481
That's right. We're all happy college students now.

1587
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,835
What optimists you guys are.

1588
01:45:33,921 --> 01:45:37,494
You know, we're going to have to start
eating more mature snacks with our tea.

1589
01:45:37,519 --> 01:45:38,298
Correct!

1590
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:39,543
Nothing changes.

1591
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,070
Ah, Mio's recovered.

1592
01:45:43,144 --> 01:45:47,649
Did you guys realize that the Death Devil
song we played, was also written as a farewell?

1593
01:45:47,799 --> 01:45:48,848
You're kidding!

1594
01:45:49,067 --> 01:45:51,488
Whoa, different tastes, I guess.

1595
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:55,549
I guess that means we just carried on an old tradition.

1596
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:57,651
By total coincidence.

1597
01:46:00,003 --> 01:46:02,450
So where do we go next year?

1598
01:46:02,475 --> 01:46:03,514
Next year?

1599
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:06,270
For Azu-nyan's graduation trip.

1600
01:46:06,295 --> 01:46:07,427
Are we going?

1601
01:46:08,169 --> 01:46:09,161
Why not?
