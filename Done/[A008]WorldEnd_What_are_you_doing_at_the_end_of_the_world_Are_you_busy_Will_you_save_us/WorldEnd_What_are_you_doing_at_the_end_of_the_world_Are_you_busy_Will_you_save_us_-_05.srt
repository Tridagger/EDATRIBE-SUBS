1
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:24,955
New count.

2
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:26,975
217!

3
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,768
Yeah, I think Chtholly's got this.

4
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,781
The rest of us can just go home.

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,357
The next one might sprout from inside.

6
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,334
Stay focused, Ithea.

7
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:43,750
What is that thing?!

8
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,532
I've never seen it before!

9
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:51,884
Do you see that?

10
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,283
It isn't a timere.

11
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:54,574
Maybe it's a new beast.

12
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:56,893
I've never seen anything like it before.

13
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:59,074
All hands, retreat.

14
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:02,324
We've detected the appearance of a new, unexpected beast.

15
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,191
As such, I'm declaring this operation a failure.

16
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,437
Island Fifteen is to be abandoned.

17
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:09,532
All hands, retreat.

18
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:10,696
We can't!

19
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,200
Oh no, you don't! Have you completely lost it?

20
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,941
I promised to stay alive.

21
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,693
I promised to make it home!

22
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:22,013
I was supposed to celebrate, too, and
eat all the butter cake I could handle.

23
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,907
How I can I do that if I let this world end!

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,031
Chtholly!

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,305
Trees vanishing in morning mist.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,824
Milk stains. Dazzling petals.

27
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:37,865
Air mass.

28
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:39,199
Herring on a wall.

29
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,157
Hedgehog standing on its head.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,459
Organ in a bag.

31
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:44,886
What is this?

32
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:16,587
What could we do?

33
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,119
Whatever that new enemy was, it
sent the whole battlefield into chaos.

34
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:24,049
It was ridiculously strong and we
had absolutely no idea how to fight it.

35
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:26,990
We had no choice, you know?
The island had to be abandoned.

36
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,407
That sounds awful.

37
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,574
It was awful!

38
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,945
Which is why we're all totally exhausted.

39
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,633
Well, I'm proud of you for hanging in there.

40
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,590
Success would have cost more
lives than the island was worth.

41
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:38,699
A strategic defeat.

42
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:39,814
Mm-hm!

43
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:45,074
But as for your work. The blades you forged shone
brilliantly, so you are due our praise and thanks.

44
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,907
Yep, that's right. This lizard is seriously dead on!

45
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,275
Oh, and I wish you could've been there to
see Chtholly fight, T.O... It was unbelievable.

46
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,139
The loss was all my fault, though.

47
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:56,911
I failed.

48
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,101
I should've just blown myself
up and neutralized the enemy.

49
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,636
But instead, I decided to be selfish.

50
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,157
You're wrong.

51
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:11,716
It wasn't you. The tactical projections
failed to account for the other beast.

52
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,264
If you'd self-destructed to take it out,

53
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,378
we would've been forced to try and
eliminate the new one without your help.

54
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:22,672
That would have yielded a far worse
outcome than a strategic failure.

55
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,115
Yep. I can't agree more.

56
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,462
It was no one's fault, we never
had a chance to defeat them.

57
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:31,472
So stop. You don't have to blame yourself.

58
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,192
Thank you, Ren.

59
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,037
By the way...

60
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,416
What are you two doing?

61
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:41,032
Willem will feel quite a bit better if we warm him up.

62
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,115
I'm actually pretty warm already.

63
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,365
Please get off me.

64
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,757
You're just saying that to be nice. Not yet.

65
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,391
Come on!

66
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,566
A little help over here would be appreciated, Chtholly.

67
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,074
I bet it would.

68
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,805
Uncle!

69
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,882
Uh, you're her uncle?

70
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:02,908
Uncle?

71
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:07,240
Of course not, she's the daughter
of an old friend of mine. Now then.

72
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,715
How many times have I told you not to come here, Phyra?

73
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,340
I am fully prepared to face the consequences, Uncle.

74
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:16,108
I sincerely apologize, but there
is no one for me to turn to but you.

75
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:20,913
Someone has threatened to kill Father if
we refuse to cancel next weekend's ceremony.

76
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,286
Really?

77
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,381
It's because of his policy as the mayor.

78
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,179
He's trying to ensure peaceful
racial coexistence within the city.

79
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:31,379
We're well aware that many do
not look favorably upon that,

80
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,046
but I'm appalled they would resort
to murder to impede his stance.

81
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:41,532
Listen. I won't be able to help you.

82
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:42,824
Forgive me, Phyra.

83
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,257
But why not?

84
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:46,447
I have a favor to ask you, Willem.

85
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:47,478
I won't.

86
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,866
I have yet to tell you what it is, though.

87
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,507
Yeah, I can guess what it is.

88
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:54,532
Let me apologize, now, because I'm not about to play hero.

89
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:55,782
Besides that,

90
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,574
I'm up to my neck in babysitting.

91
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,333
Huh?

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,793
Uncle, due to its sensitive nature, I
would prefer to keep this between us.

93
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,124
No need to worry.

94
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,937
Now, I can't vouch for his dependability
or trustworthiness, officially,

95
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,916
but he's earned the benefit of the doubt.

96
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,082
Right.

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,917
We gotta go. It's time to pick up Tiat.

98
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,662
Good luck, though. I hope you find someone to help.

99
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:17,732
Truly.

100
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,216
Will you at least listen?!

101
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,434
At next weekend's ceremony, my
father plans to unveil a new policy.

102
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,502
It should open the door for those of all races.

103
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:33,674
However, the Annihilation Knights oppose the idea
because they oppose tolerating anything disfeatured,

104
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
so they're plotting to assassinate him.

105
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,816
I have a feeling they're seriously
gonna regret that name in five years.

106
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:41,864
They destroy property,

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,975
kidnap children, and assault people.

108
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:49,364
Their intent is to rid the city of all disfeatured
races, and they'll seemingly stop at nothing to do so.

109
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,240
Uh...

110
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:52,954
That's why I felt I had to request assistance.

111
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,332
Still no.

112
00:06:54,732 --> 00:07:00,704
The Guardian Wings Military's singular role is to
defend Règles Aile from any and all external threats.

113
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:04,622
It is not allowed to interfere
in political affairs of cities.

114
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,990
Archipelago Military Charter, Chapter Four, Article Three.

115
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,212
This is cruel!

116
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,990
We're clearly in the right, how can you simply do nothing?

117
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,339
Being right doesn't make the use of force appropriate.

118
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:21,988
In fact, righteousness is merely a tool
used for legitimizing one's own violence.

119
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:23,907
Don't you understand,

120
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,929
the other side feels the same way.

121
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:29,293
They believe they're justified
just as much as you believe you are.

122
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,674
We can't all be right, can we?

123
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,287
That's how wars start.

124
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:34,447
But I--

125
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,574
Officer Limeskin turned you down because of this,

126
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,089
and it's why I won't help, either.

127
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:53,683
Nope! It wasn't even a little
scary, and it didn't hurt!

128
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:57,589
I laugh in the face of injections, ha, ha.

129
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:59,477
I'm so proud of you, Tiat.

130
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:00,402
We all are.

131
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,490
Thank you, Chtholly!

132
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,253
You're not a child, though?

133
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:05,657
No, I'm not a child!

134
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,757
Sure you're not.

135
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,240
Quick question, T.O.

136
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:11,482
Don't you think you were awfully cold to the lovely lady?

137
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,775
Let me guess, it's because of her age, isn't it?

138
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:18,720
Like maybe girls older than me
might as well not be girls, am I right?

139
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,699
No, it's not like that at all.

140
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,824
It doesn't matter whom I'm dealing with.

141
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:25,160
I just don't want to accept anything,

142
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,221
you know, if I can't accept it.

143
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:27,953
Huh?

144
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,979
Wanna try that again?

145
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,318
Sorry, it sounded better in my head.

146
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:37,672
And what's goin' on over here with
you smiling, what's that about, huh?

147
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,377
Oh, nothing.

148
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,340
I will never understand you two.

149
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:42,213
I swear!

150
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:43,019
Uh.

151
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,037
Something smells really good!

152
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,557
Look, they're wrapping meat in
leaves over there, and it looks yummy!

153
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,197
It's wrapped ram.

154
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,978
I am pretty hungry, now that I think about it.

155
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:03,088
We can grab lunch here, if everyone wants to.

156
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:04,686
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

157
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:09,074
They're obviously using far too much spice, and
they do not have their permit clearly on display,

158
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,699
as is the legal requirement.

159
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:13,407
I have little doubt they'll feed
you meat that is barely edible.

160
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,699
If you ask me, it's not worth the risk.

161
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,657
What's worse, their prices are higher than normal!

162
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,924
That's worse?

163
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,282
Come this way.

164
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:26,546
I'll show you genuine Corna di Luce
wrapped ram that won't make you ill.

165
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:30,525
That's weird. Did she morph into someone else?

166
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:31,903
Maybe.

167
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:37,365
So good!

168
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,424
I can't stop wolfing it down!

169
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:43,240
Let me see, if I had to guess, I'd say they
used less spice and incorporated some herbs

170
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:45,443
to give this wrap a little more balance.

171
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,907
Either way, the flavor makes it
easy to eat a whole bunch of it.

172
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:51,115
I know, it's so, good!

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,924
What's wrong?

174
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:57,673
You haven't taken a single bite.

175
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,190
Just thinking.

176
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,686
Well, don't force yourself.

177
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,437
I'm sure the girls will take any leftovers.

178
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,811
We sure will!

179
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,594
You may not know this, but
wrapped ram is a tradition here.

180
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,896
And this restaurant makes the
best wraps in the entire city!

181
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:14,490
Of course, all the locals know about this place.

182
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,718
Even a five-year-old would tell you that.

183
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,657
Wow, the local five-year-olds are intense.

184
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,699
To top it off, where we are is so legendary,
countless movies have been filmed right here!

185
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:28,882
Oh! Like the scene in <i>Clockwork Love and
Dreams,</i> where the golem accidentally gets drunk!

186
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:29,490
That's right!

187
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,632
You know, I think I've also
seen it before in <i>Let Me Trick You,</i>

188
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:35,408
and <i>The Return of Detective Curio</i> , and <i>Howl, Lazioni</i> !

189
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,907
My, how delightful. I am very impressed!

190
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,647
As for us, our ten-year-old's intense.

191
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:42,757
My beautiful Corna di Luce.

192
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,990
It's been the setting for many, many stories.

193
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,449
No surprise, though.

194
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:49,215
The rich cuisine, featuring classics like wrapped ram,

195
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,080
and the artistry, history and luminaries are
all well known to those across Règles Aile now.

196
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,574
I'm just so proud of it!

197
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:59,053
Wow, I can tell you really love this city,
like a whole lot, don't you?

198
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:02,471
Yes. Corna di Luce
is my home, after all.

199
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:04,782
I suppose it's my favorite city ever!

200
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,365
Ha, ha! I like that because I love it, too!

201
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,699
Favorite ever, huh.

202
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:13,458
I'm impressed you can say that with a straight face.

203
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,296
And what does that mean?

204
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,931
Nothing. I like your style, that's all.

205
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,782
I just wasn't sure we'd ever get you to lighten up.

206
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,090
Don't mock me.

207
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,090
I hate it when people always speak casually.

208
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,968
I gathered as much.

209
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:30,157
Whaddaya think. Somethin' weird in her past, right?

210
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,227
Maybe?

211
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,822
This is Perjurer's Grave.

212
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:42,066
A legendary con man from around
200 years ago rests in this location.

213
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,074
I've seen this in movies, too!

214
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,282
Of course you have.

215
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,962
The stone says, "Here lies an honest man."

216
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:52,472
I know this is gonna be a bit off topic,
but how did we end up on a sightseeing tour?

217
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,699
Is there a problem?

218
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:56,324
We have time until the airship's ready to take us home.

219
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,083
It's just kinda weird to take weapons sightseeing.

220
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,382
I mean, talk about special treatment!

221
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,755
If you ask me, we better thank the lizard and the lady.

222
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,468
Locked red grimoire.

223
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,449
Sweet cry of death.

224
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:24,811
Headless clown, wandering in twilight.

225
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:30,157
He laughs, laughs, laughs, laughs, laughs, laughs.

226
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,675
Chtholly?

227
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,405
Wh-What is it?

228
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,312
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

229
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:41,306
You've been so quiet today,
it's like having a statue among us.

230
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,970
As far as quiet goes, statues are the quietest.

231
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,615
If you're too tired, please tell me you're too tired.

232
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,655
I don't want to push you and make it worse.

233
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:49,722
Right.

234
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,703
It isn't like that, though.

235
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,174
Didn't mean to worry you.

236
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,256
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,717
If the venenum your body generated during
combat is still lingering somewhere inside you,

238
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,365
do want me to do the deal again?

239
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,459
No, thanks!

240
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:04,098
And will you please stop doing
that, you're freaking me out!

241
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,324
What's the deal?

242
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,232
None of your business, so back off!

243
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,990
Next up, we have the Lovers' Staircase.

244
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:14,490
This is where a legendary couple
whose love transcended social status met.

245
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,808
I've seen this in so many movies!

246
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,282
Yes, of course she has.

247
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,824
The two accidentally bumped into each other at the top.

248
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:25,032
They rolled down the stairs together,
marking the start of their romance, but now...

249
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,699
There's a "no rolling" rule?

250
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:30,929
You mean we can't roll down the stairs?!

251
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:35,861
Hey.

252
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,567
All right, it's time to set the bait.

253
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,926
Well, what do you think?

254
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,756
Do you like the city so far?

255
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,532
Yes, I'm enjoying my time here.

256
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:50,049
I already loved it, but now I like love, love, love it!

257
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,485
That's wonderful.

258
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,574
Hey, is there a fun spot we can head
to that's a bit more isolated than this?

259
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,282
I know just the place.

260
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,583
Welcome to the Well of Wishes.

261
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:03,574
Oh! I've never ever seen this before!

262
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:05,049
The Well of Wishes?

263
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,036
Hold on, is this one of those throw your coin
in, and get your wish granted kind of places?

264
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,090
That sounds like it came straight out of a fairy tale!

265
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,840
Forgive us for interrupting your fun,

266
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,380
but your tour has come to an end.

267
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,949
We're surrounded.

268
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,165
What are you doing? Who are you people?

269
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:31,824
Oh, come on, you can't tell me you don't
know the Annihilation Knights when they appear!

270
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,032
Annihilate! Destroy!

271
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:33,949
Annihilate! Destroy...

272
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:35,341
So it is you!

273
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:36,449
Really...?

274
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:37,658
Apparently.

275
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,449
We have come here for all that is right and for
the greater good, we must assassinate the mayor,

276
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:45,740
assassinate the mayor for all that
is right and for the greater good!

277
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:51,615
As an insurance policy, we will take you into
custody, take you into custody as an insurance policy!

278
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:52,963
He talks weird.

279
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,691
All that effort for such an awful show.

280
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,532
You disgust me, there are children present!

281
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,240
Ha, ha! Those filthy disfeatured
cannot understand our righteousness,

282
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,514
our righteousness. Those filthy
disfeatured cannot understand!

283
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,876
Now, hear me!

284
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,143
For the sake of all I know and believe right,

285
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,357
I shall not give in to the likes of you!

286
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,360
Take her.

287
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,482
Not yet.

288
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:18,427
Bang!

289
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:19,865
Ow!

290
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:22,749
Bang.

291
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,282
Bang.

292
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:25,918
Bang!

293
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:27,762
Bang.

294
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,122
What just happened here?!

295
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:38,100
First of all, I've known you've been following us.

296
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,490
So we kept to rather public places.

297
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:44,501
When we moved to a desolate one, you
saw your chance, but you never had one.

298
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:45,865
Please don't tell me.

299
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,740
Did you use me to lure them in?

300
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:50,270
Yes. You were what's called bait.

301
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:55,490
To be clear, I could not care less
about either your politics or justice.

302
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:58,312
I'm only taking your side for personal reasons.

303
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,324
You've been extremely kind to us,

304
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,782
and it helps that the little ones seem to love this city.

305
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:03,990
Uh! Whoa.

306
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:07,032
Who would've known our precious
T.O. could be one scary man.

307
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:07,990
A con man.

308
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,740
This is how he actually is.

309
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,550
Know your place, disfeatured,
disfeatured, know your place.

310
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:14,809
Bang!

311
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:20,407
Try to hide that bloodlust.

312
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,532
You're pros?

313
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:23,782
Damn! Move it, boys!

314
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,911
Boys, move it right now!

315
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,789
Cease and desist.

316
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,324
--Arrest. Arrest. --Cease and desist.

317
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,115
Arrest. Arrest...

318
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,282
Cease and desist.

319
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,257
Willem kind of seems like a bad guy.

320
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:50,519
Well, he does happen to be the sole
survivor of the terrifying emnetwiht race, so...

321
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:53,964
Con man.

322
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,217
I may be extremely grateful for your help,

323
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:05,490
but I, I simply cannot accept your methods!

324
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,490
All right. I figured as much, though.

325
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:12,824
Also, I've been trying not to bring this up again,
but upon our initial meeting, you touched my belly.

326
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:13,574
Huh...?

327
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,338
Don't play dumb with me!

328
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:21,178
To us lycanthropos, our bellies are sacred
places that we may only reveal to our spouses.

329
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,074
Ah, okay?

330
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,565
I hate you with every ounce of my being!

331
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,423
Thank you so much, girls.

332
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,883
I hope you come back to visit us again someday!

333
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,373
It is a beautiful city.

334
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:57,772
I can see why the lady wanted to
protect her home with such, uh... passion.

335
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,791
Yes.

336
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,372
But she hates me, and it seems she hates me a lot.

337
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,885
I imagine she'd probably rather
not ask me for any help again.

338
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,282
It's for the best, though.

339
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,403
She's genuine,

340
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,782
and people like that should be able to stay that way.

341
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,324
You're ridiculous.

342
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:18,541
Excuse me?

343
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,240
The finger guns were nothing more than camouflage.

344
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,074
Sure, you attacked them, but you did it by throwing coins.

345
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,196
Good eye, Chtholly.

346
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,797
It's not a good eye.

347
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:35,657
I just most likely know your fighting style and strength

348
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,693
better than anyone else in this world, or any other.

349
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:39,893
Did you forget?

350
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:45,184
I could see it because you taught me to
fight in the exact same way. I paid attention.

351
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,282
Yes, you certainly did.

352
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,990
I think you were such a good
student you may have made me forget.

353
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:51,199
Temporarily.

354
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,828
Tell me, you wanted a fight.

355
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:57,199
I don't know what you're trying to do,

356
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,549
but I wish you'd stop.

357
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,324
You don't have to fight anymore.

358
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,930
You're no longer alone.

359
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:06,865
We've taken on all of your battles, so you're free.

360
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,710
I'm extraordinarily grateful.

361
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:15,860
For years, I've waited for death to release me.

362
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,615
While I've waited, all I wanted was to go back home,

363
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,898
to go back to the people that waited for me.

364
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:25,223
But after meeting you all, it seems

365
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,885
well, I've changed a little.

366
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,568
I started to feel happy. I wanted a home again.

367
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,518
Meeting you has brought me a slice of salvation,

368
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:38,082
and when you returned alive, that brought me...

369
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:42,615
Well, it's like a joy I'd been missing.

370
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,205
Hang on, don't try to back away from me like that!

371
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:51,004
Come on, don't look at me as if I'm
embarrassing you! I'm tryin' to be nice here!

372
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,449
Okay, whatever.

373
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,072
I was surprised you noticed, and I'm done.

374
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,199
How could I not?

375
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,674
I'm in love with you.

376
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:20,371
Finally! We get to go home!

377
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,615
Aw, I wanted to check out a couple more places.

378
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,657
Remember, you're a fairy soldier now.

379
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,407
So, I'm positive you'll get the chance to come back.

380
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,110
True! You're so right!

381
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,636
You are Technical Officer Willem Kahmesh, is that correct?

382
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,865
Yes, and who might you be?

383
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,199
First-Grade Officer Burohnny Maxi.

384
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:40,870
I'm military police.

385
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,063
Interesting.

386
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:46,048
I see Officer Limeskin's report was quite accurate.

387
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:51,227
"A tall, black-haired disfeatured.
Likely has a thing for young girls."

388
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:55,654
Nah, if he actually did, someone I know
wouldn't always have such a tragic expression.

389
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,990
Am I right, Chtholly?

390
00:20:57,074 --> 00:21:00,115
There is an individual I'd very much like for you to meet.

391
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,293
Come with me.

392
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:04,585
No, thank you. I have plans already.

393
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,363
It's Souwong Kahndel.

394
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:13,624
Willem?

395
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,143
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,907
I can't walk away after hearing that name.

397
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,833
Burohnny, was it?

398
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,490
Yes.

399
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,532
I need to ask a favor, take care of these girls.

400
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,532
I can most definitely do that.

401
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,813
Wait a second! I won't let you stay here!

402
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,568
We make you happy.

403
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:33,924
Come back home!

404
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,792
I can't go, not just yet.

405
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,466
If you stay, I'll get really angry!

406
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,362
Chtholly...

407
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:42,236
I won't let you stay!

408
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:44,699
You jerk. You're a big jerk!

409
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,090
I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:53,976
Come back.

411
00:21:56,407 --> 00:22:00,804
I'll be waiting, so you'd better come home, okay?

412
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:08,150
Yeah. I will come home.

413
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,017
I swear that I will.

414
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:12,812
Good.

415
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:14,978
It's a promise.

416
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:26,367
I never welcomed them back from battle.

417
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,615
I probably shouldn't say this,

418
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,990
but you make the most peculiar
face when you cry, Officer Kmetsch.

419
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,933
Next Episode: no news was good news.
