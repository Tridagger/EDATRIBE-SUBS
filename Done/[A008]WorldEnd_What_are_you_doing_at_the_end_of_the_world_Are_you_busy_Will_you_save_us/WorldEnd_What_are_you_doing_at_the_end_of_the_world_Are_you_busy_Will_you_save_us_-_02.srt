1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,719
Just try not to over think it, okay?

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:10,761
The truth of the matter is, it's us. We're
the special weapons. You get to care for us.

3
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,794
So, what's after breakfast?

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,590
Play?

5
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:21,240
We're the special weapons.

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,015
--Stop it that's mine! --No, it's not it's mine!

7
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,234
Go find somewhere to sit so you can eat.

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,527
Hey! No running!

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,229
Good morning, ladies.

10
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,941
Your attention, please.

11
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,594
These girls, they're the special weapons.

12
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:40,610
Allow me to introduce you.

13
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:45,817
This gentleman is Second-Grade Technical Officer
Willem, and he will be living with us from now on.

14
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,354
I'm very pleased to meet you all.

15
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:57,027
Uh.

16
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,297
You three are awake early!

17
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,510
You up for a duel?

18
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:42,803
No, thanks.

19
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,236
Should be easier, now.

20
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,761
Lakhesh's gonna get eaten!

21
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,596
Or kidnapped for ransom!

22
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,689
I'm not gonna get kidnapped.

23
00:02:58,886 --> 00:02:59,939
I'm not, right?

24
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,497
Please put me down.

25
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,344
This way!

26
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,359
Hi.

27
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:11,931
Uh.

28
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:18,594
Don't take it personally.

29
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,028
The children here aren't used to having adult men around,

30
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:23,011
so they don't know how to interact with one.

31
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,469
Yes, I understand that.

32
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,053
I just wish I knew a way to keep from terrifying them.

33
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,511
Honestly, it's depressing.

34
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,236
Well, of course it would be!

35
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:33,625
So, Officer Willem, you like little girls, do ya?

36
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,028
I like kids, yes.

37
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,719
Wow. Then, you admit it.

38
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,986
Now, I'm dying to know which one is your type!

39
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,553
There's me, the lovably boisterous Ithea.

40
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,633
Capricious lil' Nephren here.

41
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,319
Although, if I were to make a recommendation,

42
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,669
I'd say go with fresh-faced and moody.

43
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,560
Chtholly. We've met.

44
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,678
Hold on, when did that happen?

45
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,886
Moving a bit fast, aren't ya?
You gotta tell me everything!

46
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,387
Cut it out, Ithea!

47
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,033
Okay, it's been cut.

48
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,917
I find you three and all the little ones very cute.

49
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,094
What? You're lumping me in with children?

50
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:09,736
You're not much older than them.

51
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,798
That's not true! I'll have
you know I'm 15 years old!

52
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,511
And now I wanna know if that
falls within the officer's range.

53
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,199
Ithea, shut up!

54
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:24,325
Back to the point, I wish I could think of a
good way to get the little ones to open up to me.

55
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,719
Even when you're agonizing like that,

56
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,553
you... look... delicious.

57
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:35,375
Nygglatho! What's that?
You're supposed to be the adult.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,736
You can't just go around licking people!

59
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:40,069
Great plan! I bet something
tasty will win 'em over real fast!

60
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,013
Is that what she meant?!

61
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:44,321
Of course!

62
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:45,488
Uh?

63
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,886
That's perfect!

64
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:47,825
Uh?

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,404
So you can cook, huh?

66
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:54,080
I guess just a bit.

67
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:57,249
A man who can help around the
house is definitely a keeper!

68
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,153
Valid.

69
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:00,902
Where'd you pick up that so-called wisdom?

70
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,211
Looks good.

71
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,751
Here, tell me what you think.

72
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:08,886
I'll pass, thanks, though.

73
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:09,579
Really?

74
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:10,691
All right.

75
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,929
It's yummy.

76
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,319
What do you think? Ready to dig in, girls?

77
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,153
Yeah!

78
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,219
This is the bestest, ever!

79
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,798
You've certainly changed, haven't you?

80
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:53,530
Not that I didn't love it, but before, you were always
what I considered one of those "aloof degenerate" types.

81
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:58,969
--Is something wrong? --Yeah.

82
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,383
I forgot who I was for just a moment there.

83
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:02,886
Won't happen again.

84
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,342
It won't?

85
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,849
Oh my.

86
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,386
Seconds, please!

87
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,816
Whoa!

88
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:18,396
What was that about forgetting who you were?

89
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:24,061
I think it's safe to say you
got them to open up to you.

90
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,879
I did. Kids are funny. They're just great.

91
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,344
Hearts on their sleeves.

92
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,817
Very true.

93
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:32,550
Oh, by the way.

94
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,220
You didn't have to help me clean up, but thank you.

95
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,516
You're welcome.

96
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,326
It's a good distraction.

97
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,430
Uh. What do you mean? Do you need a distraction?

98
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,094
No, not really.

99
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,589
I think we're finally done!

100
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,336
Yay! Cleanup complete!

101
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,533
Goodnight, then.

102
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,094
I'll see you tomorrow.

103
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,725
Okay. Goodnight.

104
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,408
Here we go!

105
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,511
All right, it's my turn, now!

106
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,261
No, I'm throwing it!

107
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,623
Girls, that's enough, stop fighting.

108
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:12,219
Calm down. Don't be weird.

109
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,909
Can't stop thinking about him?

110
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,694
Wow, interesting reaction.

111
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,469
Why are you acting like that?!

112
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,353
Acting like what?

113
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:23,903
I just think it's funny how
everyone's taken to Willem so fast.

114
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:27,280
I mean, it's practically like he's
already been here for years, ya know?

115
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,087
Yes, I do.

116
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,014
I like your new hat.

117
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:37,335
It must mean a lot considering you
keep it safely hidden in your closet.

118
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:40,303
Oh. Yeah, she's
obsessed with it.

119
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,528
Uh! No, it doesn't mean anything to me.

120
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,028
I just prefer to keep it out of the way

121
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,511
because you don't need a hat like that very often.

122
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:47,814
Yeah, right.

123
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,509
What do you mean by that?

124
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,884
What do you mean what do I mean?

125
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,136
Hey, Ren, you interested in him, too?

126
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,192
Not really.

127
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:57,882
Though I do find him... curious, I suppose.

128
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,162
Meaning, you're interested in him.

129
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,203
Chtholly.

130
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,316
How many days are left as of now?

131
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,300
Around ten.

132
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,020
I don't know if that's enough time for a romance, but,

133
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,986
you might as well give it a shot, you know?

134
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:17,569
Will you please leave it alone?

135
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:18,803
Don't be so timid.

136
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:21,950
In this day and age, lots of
fairies never even hit adolescence.

137
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:25,344
You did that and fell in love,
which basically means you won life.

138
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:26,871
It isn't like that.

139
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:31,763
I see. I'll search the study for any
books that might help in this endeavor.

140
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,869
Oh, not you, too.

141
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,769
Ugh! Don't bother!

142
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:41,519
Can we focus and get dressed already?

143
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,903
Is that not what we're doing?

144
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:47,003
Never saw it comin'. Hi-yah!

145
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,111
Collon, what are you thinking?

146
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,055
Tiat's on your team!

147
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,468
Whatever works.

148
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,045
I got it!

149
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,965
Stop rolling, ball!

150
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:05,964
Almita!

151
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:08,543
Hey!

152
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,440
Almita! Are you all right?

153
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,761
Yeah. I think so.

154
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:16,678
Ouchie.

155
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:19,859
I fell down hard!

156
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,972
Stay still. You're bleeding.

157
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,885
I'm fine, don't worry.

158
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,650
Almita! Get the dumb ball!

159
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,070
It's right over there!

160
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,029
Hurry up!

161
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,055
You girls are...

162
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,780
You appear to have something you'd like to share with me.

163
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,687
I didn't realize it until earlier today.

164
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,613
These children.

165
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,264
They're not at all concerned about their lives.

166
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,596
They're not.

167
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,484
I know it can be unnerving how indifferent they are.

168
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,201
It's not normal.

169
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,501
Who and what are these girls?

170
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,226
I get why you ask, but, to be
honest, I'd rather not answer.

171
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,855
Are you sure you wanna know the truth?

172
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:19,622
Once you know, your attitude towards them will
change, and you won't be able to help yourself.

173
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:21,574
I just...

174
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:24,480
I don't want that change in you to hurt their feelings.

175
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:28,584
The past few days, you've
acted like a very nice young man.

176
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,428
While, at first, I found that side of you a little creepy,

177
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:34,631
now, I'm thankful for how kind and generous you've been.

178
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:38,879
If it's at all possible, I'd like
things to stay this way for a while longer.

179
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:50,011
I want to know.

180
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,736
I assume you're already aware of the 17 beasts?

181
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:07,069
Yes, they were created 500 years ago by foolish humans.

182
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,486
I mean, emnetwihts.

183
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:10,959
Awfully self-deprecating, aren't we?

184
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:17,141
Of course, not long after their creation, the beasts wiped
out all life on the surface, including the emnetwihts.

185
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,298
That wasn't enough for the beasts, though.

186
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:22,582
Our skies are in constant jeopardy of their next attack.

187
00:11:27,044 --> 00:11:28,377
Which begs the question,

188
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,595
how do we defend ourselves against them?

189
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,042
The answer lies beyond this door.

190
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,194
Are those... carillons?

191
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,385
We call them "dug weapons" now.

192
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:51,565
These instruments are our only
means of fighting the 17 beasts.

193
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,635
Insania.

194
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:57,058
Ignareo.

195
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,589
Percival.

196
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,052
As I recall,

197
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:04,178
Carillons were special.

198
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:08,297
So special, in fact, that only chosen
emnetwiht braves could wield them.

199
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,377
Correct.

200
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,761
So, with the emnetwihts gone now,

201
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,369
how are they still working?

202
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,022
Who's using them to fight?

203
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,201
Well, surely, you already know.

204
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,366
But how...?

205
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,654
The girls are leprechauns.

206
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:29,302
Fairies who have imitated emnetwihts since ancient times.

207
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:32,357
That means they have the ability to use emnetwiht weapons.

208
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:33,938
The difference?

209
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,867
Their bodies were created to be expended in battle.

210
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:41,270
ecause of that, they have no fear of death.

211
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,784
You wanted to know what they were.

212
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,217
You have your answer.

213
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,532
I hope you can handle it.

214
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,616
I'll be fine.

215
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,354
So those girls are your partners, now?

216
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,697
Huh.

217
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,469
Pannibal, you're going too fast!

218
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,261
Wait!

219
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,968
Hello, Nephren. All alone?

220
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,469
Where are Chtholly and Ithea?

221
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,756
They both went out.

222
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,681
They both went out,

223
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,793
and did not return until several days later.

224
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:39,590
Venenum output is inversely proportional
to a spell caster's life force.

225
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:42,831
The more they want to live, the lower the output.

226
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:47,638
For those who care nothing about their
lives, the output rises drastically.

227
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:54,432
Such power cannot be contained and quickly
grows out of control causing a massive explosion.

228
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,713
Both spell caster and enemy will be obliterated,

229
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,922
leaving the dug weapon as the lone survivor of the blast.

230
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:04,425
Yes.

231
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,244
I'm sure those girls make excellent weapons.

232
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,043
If it isn't Officer Willem. Long time no see!

233
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,469
Hey, are you two all right?

234
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,542
What?! Yeah, sure, I'm fine!

235
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:29,664
And she's...

236
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:31,792
Well, she's napping 'cause she's worn out.

237
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:34,885
That's a relief.

238
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,462
Fancy running into you here, though.

239
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:38,588
Out on a walk?

240
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,594
Nygglatho told me you were
back, so I'm here to pick you up.

241
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,757
Wait, does that
mean that you, um...

242
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,943
Knew that you were away fighting?

243
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,653
Seventeen beasts and all that.

244
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,262
I can't believe it!

245
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,315
Talk about embarrassing.

246
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,418
You must be who I'm looking for.

247
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,148
Technical Officer Willem, that correct?

248
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,092
Yes.

249
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,023
And who exactly are you?

250
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:12,209
I'm here to give you their weapons.

251
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,484
Return them to the vault immediately.

252
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,587
These are Seniorious and Valgulious, right?

253
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,021
Wow! You're good at knowing stuff.

254
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:32,736
Seniorious is the one Chtholly's compatible with.

255
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,502
And I've got Valgulious.

256
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:38,403
Seriously, you're extremely well informed.

257
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:41,507
I bet you checked our equipment
list or something like that.

258
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,513
Actually, no.

259
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:46,033
They just happen to be swords
I'm familiar with, that's all.

260
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,667
That's all, huh? Very interesting.

261
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,537
Fess up. How much do you really know?

262
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:53,737
Not much.

263
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,370
I know that you're fairies.

264
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:58,293
And you fight with dug weapons to protect the world.

265
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,486
I suppose that's about it.

266
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,157
Did the idea of weapons that
look like us bother you at all?

267
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:11,032
I mean, we're basically disposable lives.

268
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:15,668
Not to mention, we use relics of those awful emnetwihts.

269
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:17,794
What's up?

270
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,095
A long time ago,

271
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,304
I knew someone in a similar situation.

272
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:26,411
And I owe that someone a great deal for many things.

273
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,217
So after hearing your story,

274
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,435
I couldn't just walk away.

275
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,178
Now, you know.

276
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:35,594
Oh, boy!

277
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,464
A sudden mention of your past!

278
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,928
Two people having a heart-to-heart all alone!

279
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:42,693
Wait, are you hitting on and or flirting with me?

280
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,159
All alone?

281
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:45,886
Are you forgetting about the girl on my back?

282
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:50,469
Course not! Because this is the start of a love
triangle filled with passion, hate, and jealousy.

283
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,844
Keep it down. You're gonna wake her up.

284
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,561
Wow, what a tease.

285
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,219
Willem!

286
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:14,063
What do you think you're doing in here?

287
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,886
I think I'm taking care of a patient.

288
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,547
Well, who's your patient?

289
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,511
Try not to push yourself.

290
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,155
You do still have a fever.

291
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,167
I'm your caretaker, remember.

292
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,511
So, let me take care.

293
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,386
I don't need you, a caretaker or not.

294
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:32,170
Besides, what you do for me doesn't really matter anyway.

295
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,033
I appreciate it, but I don't have much time left.

296
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,261
"Time left"?

297
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:38,741
What does that mean?

298
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:45,348
Hey...

299
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,781
What is it?

300
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:50,009
Just um, let's say...

301
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,070
...if I were gonna die in five days, like hypothetically,

302
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,776
do you think you'd be a little nicer to me?

303
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,426
What are you talking about?

304
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:04,542
In five days, Island Fifteen
will come under a powerful timere attack.

305
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,757
One of the 17 beasts?

306
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,834
None of the beasts can fly.

307
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:13,300
But a timere can release
parts of its body into the air,

308
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:16,665
allowing those parts to travel
all the way up to the sky islands.

309
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,344
How do you know for sure it will be five days?

310
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,335
We can predict their attacks, now.

311
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,523
We've fought for centuries. I guess we're bound to evolve.

312
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,867
But it certainly took us long enough!

313
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:33,407
Apparently, the incoming timere can't
be fought using usual military methods.

314
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,844
However, a fairy wielding a dug weapon...

315
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:39,928
...can take it out single-handedly.

316
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:42,156
The only cost would be your life.

317
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,803
That's pretty much it.

318
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:46,832
If I use my power and Seniorious to blow myself up,

319
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,774
I'll just barely be able to destroy the thing.

320
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,920
How lucky is that, right?

321
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,092
Nobody else will have to die.

322
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,636
Okay, so it's not hypothetical.

323
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:01,690
Does that maybe make you feel
like granting me a final wish?

324
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,594
Depends on what it is.

325
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,178
Well, I uh...

326
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,366
Um.

327
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,637
Like for example.

328
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,327
What if I...

329
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:14,908
A kiss?

330
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:17,148
What if I asked to kiss you?

331
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,487
Just once.

332
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:32,069
After all that talk about only having five days left,

333
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:33,994
that's the kind of crap you ask me for?

334
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,692
So what!

335
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,680
Ah!

336
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,125
Ow.

337
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,536
You're a kid. Why are you
trying to be something you're not?

338
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:42,969
Excuse me?!

339
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:45,928
What's wrong with wanting to
have sweet memories before I go?

340
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,761
I'm about to die here!

341
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:51,797
But first, I wanna matter! I wanna
be kept alive in someone else's heart!

342
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,319
Just to be connected.

343
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,329
Tell me! What's wrong with that?

344
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,462
Am I not allowed anything?

345
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,386
I don't want you to sell yourself short, that's all.

346
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,469
You don't have to settle for
who's standing in front of you.

347
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,694
You should buy me while I'm selling myself short.

348
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,372
Seriously, it's a basic rule for shopping smart.

349
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,136
Just go!

350
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:18,145
If you won't kiss me, don't
try to help! I'm not even crying!

351
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,803
Well, you sound like you're crying.

352
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,120
You're crying!

353
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:25,553
Good grief. Look, I want you
to turn on your belly for a sec.

354
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:26,803
I can't hear you.

355
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,511
Will you please stop being difficult?

356
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,266
I said I can't hear you!

357
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,079
Oh, come on.

358
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,980
Could you be any more stubborn?

359
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,093
What... What was that?

360
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:54,014
Um, I didn't um...

361
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,605
I really didn't feel that one.

362
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,960
I knew it.

363
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,126
You're showing typical symptoms of venenum poisoning.

364
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:12,964
You generated too much which then gave
you a real nasty case of muscular fever.

365
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:16,553
This isn't pleasant, but it helps.

366
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:19,319
Ow! By not pleasant, you mean it feels like fire?!

367
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,928
It'll be better in a little bit.

368
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,019
A little bit?

369
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,075
I'm gonna feel like this forever, aren't I?

370
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,665
Not to worry. You just let me take care of this.

371
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:13,794
The mightiest brave is here with the mightiest sword.

372
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,854
There's nothing else for you to do.

373
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,085
No.

374
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,412
I can't just walk away.

375
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,580
Next Episode: starry road to tomorrow.
